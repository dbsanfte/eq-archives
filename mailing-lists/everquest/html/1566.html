&gt; to share :)Nymue   To: the citizens of Norrath, primarly those of<br/>
&gt; Kelethin<br/>
&gt; Fr: Guard Fireblight, stationed at the PoD lift<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dear Citizens,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am writing this letter in behalf of my fellow guards here in<br/>
&gt; Kelethin. We&#39;ve refrained from voicing our concerns and opinions long<br/>
&gt; enough. Here are a list of demands that must be met, or else we whom<br/>
&gt; are affiliated under the Emerald Warriors will refuse to save your<br/>
&gt; retarded young ones from yard trash trains and your [censored]<br/>
&gt; children from falling off of the lifts of Kelethin.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - If you are young enough to be a casualty of war between the elves<br/>
&gt; and the Kelethin yard trash, DO NOT attack the bat that&#39;s surrounded<br/>
&gt; by its sisters, brothers, uncles, aunts, mother and father, and expect<br/>
&gt; me to take action. Kelethin is better off without you, and your lack<br/>
&gt; of contribution to the Fier`Dal bloodline will only strengthen us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - What the hell do you think I&#39;m going to do with your fishing grubs<br/>
&gt; and cloth loot? The bloody merchant is up the lift. Hell, give it to<br/>
&gt; the Priest of Discord. We sure as hell don&#39;t have need of any of your<br/>
&gt; junk.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - This one irks us the most. When you train the entire orc encampment<br/>
&gt; to the &quot;orc lift,&quot; and die because the guard stationed there did not<br/>
&gt; kill off the twelve orcs quickly enough, DO NOT yell trash about the<br/>
&gt; guards being &quot;broken&quot; or &quot;stupid.&quot; Between you and me (yes, you right<br/>
&gt; there, the newbie to the left), the one who trained the orcs to the<br/>
&gt; guards wasn&#39;t me. I&#39;d seriously reconsider calling someone else<br/>
&gt; &quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;broken.&quot; There is only two of us, and as &quot;uber&quot; and<br/>
&gt; &quot;leet&quot; we might be in comparison to you, sixteen orcs take at least<br/>
&gt; five seconds to fend off, even with my &quot;leet&quot; skills. Unfortunately<br/>
&gt; for your pathetic rear, you don&#39;t have five seconds worth of hit<br/>
&gt; points to make it to the end.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - As much as watching you newbies cry like babies as you crawl towards<br/>
&gt; me may be entertaining (in a slightly sadistic way, I&#39;ll admit), don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; wail about how the &quot;worthless&quot; guard didn&#39;t save you because you<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t make it to me in time. You were the one who wanted to take on<br/>
&gt; big mama bee and her three children alone, not me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Now, I shall answer a question that has astounded the masses since<br/>
&gt; the beginning of time. Why don&#39;t the guards save you when you fight<br/>
&gt; pixies or faeries? I&#39;ll tell you why. The sight of a young warrior<br/>
&gt; getting his ass handed to him by a blue pixie with cute little wings<br/>
&gt; (who&#39;s less than 1/4 his size, mind you) is one we guards derive<br/>
&gt; massive amounts of entertainment from. Even funnier is the picturesque<br/>
&gt; image of the hapless elf&#39;s curled up body lying on the ground with a<br/>
&gt; pint-sized pixie hovering over his corpse, gloating in victory. Don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; look at me so surprised when you&#39;re dying to a faerie next to me and<br/>
&gt; give me the sad puppy dog face, wondering why I&#39;m not helping you. It<br/>
&gt; gives me something to talk about with my comrades after the day is<br/>
&gt; over.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Let me tell you this before I get another crazy moron who tries to<br/>
&gt; piss off the Priest of Discord right in front of me. I own the PoD.<br/>
&gt; Sure, it&#39;s fun to kick that fugly hummie&#39;s ass from time to time, but<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t come back and yell and carp that the &quot;****ing useless&quot; guard<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t help you. I may own the PoD, but the PoD sure as hell owns you.<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s just the natural order of things. It&#39;s him, me, and you lying<br/>
&gt; beside us in that cute fetal position. Provoke the damn PoD at your<br/>
&gt; own @#%$ risk.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - You older and more experienced ones out there, listen to this one.<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t remain in a stationary position in the middle of a collection of<br/>
&gt; newbies at Kelethin then gripe about them inspecting you. They&#39;re like<br/>
&gt; flies, and your &quot;uber&quot; equipment is like honey. Come back to the city,<br/>
&gt; do the banking and restocking you need to do, and get out. Go back to<br/>
&gt; Velious or wherever it is you live now. Make yourselves useful and<br/>
&gt; stop provoking the damn newbies. Find another way to satisfy your damn<br/>
&gt; egos.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - On the flip side, you greedy newbies need to stop harrassing the<br/>
&gt; residents of higher level whenever they pop up naked beside you,<br/>
&gt; begging for &quot;ph@t l3wts&quot; and the like. It bothers me when I see a<br/>
&gt; seasoned warrior run like a pansy because some newbie is chasing him<br/>
&gt; for a donation. If you really, really want a donation, target the high<br/>
&gt; level comrade, and type &quot;/d&quot; for donation. I&#39;m sure he/she will give<br/>
&gt; you one, and the silence that will result afterwards will be music to<br/>
&gt; my ears.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - All you newbies that really think your idle rants shouted throughout<br/>
&gt; the faydark really go appreciated, come see me. Target me and press<br/>
&gt; &quot;A.&quot; I&#39;ll show you just how much the citizens of the faydark<br/>
&gt; appreciate you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The guards of Kelethin are sick and tired of this garbage. Get your<br/>
&gt; acts together, or your newbies die. Then again, that might actually be<br/>
&gt; an interesting prospect...<br/>
