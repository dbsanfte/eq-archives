<div id="ygrps-yiv-196755643">Yeah. I&#39;m paying for 56k but can&#39;t get it bc of my phonelines. Rather than<br/>
giving me a full phone line like everyone else in town has, they spliced<br/>
mine with all of the other lines in the area. Basically they just cut the<br/>
line and split it into little parts. The less bandwidth you have, the less<br/>
phones you can use. So if I pick up one phone while another is off the hook,<br/>
one of them won&#39;t work. and I am supposed to be able to have up to 4 phones<br/>
on the same line.<br/>
Drives me nuts!<br/>
luv,<br/>

That is terrible, I can&#39;t get DSL or Cable, but I am fortunate enough to<br/>
have 56k. I used to have 26k too when the game first came out and it seemed<br/>
to work ok.<br/>

  Oops. Typo. It&#39;s 1Gb of RAM. Sorry. I should proofread my own messages.<br/>
  I need the RAM to compensate for a 26k dial-up connection. Can&#39;t even get<br/>
  28k! I&#39;ve ranted about this before. Still can&#39;t find my consumer rights<br/>
  regarding my phone service so they are royally screwing me.<br/>
  luv,<br/>

<br/>
  2GB of ram?!?! Isn&#39;t that a little excessive? Do you know if the 1.5 Ghz<br/>
  Duron has been released yet? I always double everything when it is<br/>
  availiable. I have a 750 Duron now and 512MB of ram. I guess I need to get<br/>
a<br/>
  1.5Ghz Duron, 1GB or ram and what ever video card is relatively cheap<br/>
right<br/>
  now, guess ill have to do some research on that. Maybe a 19&quot; monitor too.<br/>

    I have the same video card and it runs great on mine. But it is a 64mb<br/>
  one..<br/>
    and I have an AMD 1.4Ghz processor and 2Gb of RAM..<br/>
    luv,<br/>

    What video card do you have? I have a Geforce 2 MX. When I first started<br/>
    playing with the Luclin expansion, it ran like crap until I turned down<br/>
  the<br/>
    clip plane and then it ran great and all was well.<br/>
