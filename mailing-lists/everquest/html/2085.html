<div id="ygrps-yiv-25086606"><p>Thanks for sharing Su!&nbsp; I can tell you this, though.&nbsp; It is admirable that your mother plays the game.&nbsp; Most parents wont play the game and consider it evil.&nbsp; I am one of the few lucky parents that like to play the game with my family.&nbsp; LOL in fact we have a family friday night.&nbsp; My family is big enough that we can have two groups.&nbsp; Yet we enjoy it!
<p>So, basically what I am saying is Kudos to your mom for playing and like you said at least trying.&nbsp; But I dont think fat ass was necessary LOL.&nbsp; Yet it did provide a funny mental picture.

If you notice a bad<br>pattern-- like the main puller pulling nonstop and not giving you time to<br>med, make sure you tell them to stop pulling.

I<br>was the main healer. When I came back my mother was sitting in my chair<br>shrieking about how she couldn&#39;t heal people. She blocked my keyboard with<br>her hands and I couldnt&#39; see the screen. Turned out I was still sitting. I<br>managed to reach over and stand up but she swatted my hands away and started<br>casting heal-- on the mobs. Wasted most of my mana.

I should have gated but I didn&#39;t want to ditch the<br>others. I didn&#39;t realize they said it was ok to zone. Big mistake. I ended<br>up dead. Fortunately they found a high lvl cleric to rez me and I got back<br>more xp than I&#39;d remembered having.<br>Don&#39;t mind me. Just felt like sharing.

If your corpse had nothing on it, it may have<br>&nbsp; disappeared, but your own anwswer is most likely. You misplaced your<br>&nbsp; corpse. Dying at levels below five is set to be low-penalty (you lose<br>&nbsp; very little and get food and water when you come back) to make the<br>&nbsp; early learning a bit easier.<br><br>&nbsp; There are tools to find corpses, sold by merchants. However, it is<br>&nbsp; best to learn to die with finding your corpse in mind. Try to look<br>&nbsp; around at landmarks when death is clearly coming. Try to be near some<br>&nbsp; object you can find easily when you come back. And unless you don&#39;t<br>&nbsp; mind having to do this often, learn to fight in such a way as to<br>&nbsp; seldom die. Some gamers like to take the risks leading to frequent<br>&nbsp; deaths, but I prefer to hunt with care and die seldom. Seems more in<br>&nbsp; the spirit of the game to me.<br><br>&nbsp; Good hunting to you.<br><br>&nbsp; Barto Proudfoot<br><br>&nbsp; If --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Minigamer&quot; &lt;rlebeau65@y...&gt; wrote:<br>&nbsp; &gt; Hi all,<br>&nbsp; &gt;<br>&nbsp; &gt; Forgive my ignorance but I am a newbie had a 4th level Druid in the<br>&nbsp; city of Elves and while out at the Orc Camp, with others, I got<br>&nbsp; killed by an Orc Centurian and when I returned to get my corpse,<br>&nbsp; nothing was there.&nbsp; It was not more than 4 minutes when I returned.<br>&nbsp; &gt;<br>&nbsp; &gt; Question: Is it possible for someone to Steal or Loot my corpse?<br>&nbsp; The book says no but I beg to differ.<br>&nbsp; &gt; Is it possible that I had two corpses out there?
