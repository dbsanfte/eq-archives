<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605020417"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">Well for me, some benefits have been...
<br>
<br>I always have questions, my main is now a 28 enchanter. &nbsp;I have some 
<br>wonderful high level enchanters in my guild to give me advice and answer my 
<br>neverending questions. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>I have guildmates who are willing to help anyone who needs it. &nbsp;If I can&#39;t 
<br>find something I need, perhaps they have it and I can either buy it at cost 
<br>or they will just give it. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>People share their skills at cost to guildmates in my guild.
<br>
<br>Great raids. &nbsp;We can set up raids and get good loot and experience. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Then of course is the social aspect. &nbsp;There&#39;s always someone you can joke 
<br>around with or complain to if you&#39;re a chatty sort. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Off the top of my head, there&#39;s just a few. &nbsp;

<br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote TYPE="CITE" style="BORDER-LEFT:#0000ff 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;">I have seen a lot of people with guild names on my server and I was really 
<br>wondering what the benefit of being in a guild would be to going it without 
<br>one???
<br>
<br>I mean I can always find someone to group with... or solo it on the blue&#39;s 
<br>and blacks....
<br>
<br>Other then maybe another aspect added to the role playing game what benefit 
<br>do you recieve from a Guild.
<br>
<br>ok got to run just wondering</blockquote></span></blockquote></font><font COLOR="#000000" SIZE="3" FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial">
