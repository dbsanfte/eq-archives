 </span></blockquote>They are similar to Diablo but the slots on the items are not visible. and<br/>
certain types of stones can only be put in certain slots and certain items<br/>
only have certain types of slots. It will just have in item description that<br/>
it has one slot, type 4, and whether or not it&#39;s empty. Plus you have to<br/>
combine them. I guess sort of like combining things in the cube in diablo.<br/>
Even if you don&#39;t have the dye you can preview the way you will look with<br/>
the dye. It doesn&#39;t dye the actual armor piece, it dyes that slot on your<br/>
body. So if you change armor, your new armor will be the same color. You can<br/>
toy with the Red Green Blue value and pick color combos you like in various<br/>
places. I&#39;ve seen trolls wearing hot pink. It&#39;s pretty cool.<br/>
Cool! Heh. I think the little froggie guards like me. Unless they are<br/>
undead, most frogloks like me. My undead faction in lower guk is bottomed<br/>
out though. No pun intended.<br/>
