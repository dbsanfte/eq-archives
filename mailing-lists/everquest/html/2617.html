<b>Subject:</b> Building a wish list <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193951589">Since I have yet to subscribe at Allahkazam, I have used an <br/>
alternative research technique to work up my wish list. I am still in <br/>
the middle of that research.<br/>
<br/>
I go to the caster&#39;s site and use the druid equipment list. I grab <br/>
any info on items which look good to me. Mostly stuff with wisdom and <br/>
ac, and the more positive buffs the better. Once I have collected all <br/>
of the items for a particular slot into one file, I use Allakhazam to <br/>
fill in details. This goes farely quickly if I use two windows and <br/>
move back and forth. Once all of the data is collected I organize the <br/>
info in the file by level to attain. Tailored and quest items are at <br/>
the top of the list, drop items following.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of work, but I have been doing a little every day. I have <br/>
learned a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Allakhazam has a new wish list system for subscribers. If you want <br/>
tailored info but don&#39;t want to do the work listed above (or any <br/>
other method with similar results), the subscription is a good value.<br/>
