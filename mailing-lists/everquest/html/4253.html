<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979469437">I reinstalled the set once after a major malfunction. Lots of <br/>
download time in that, and there were problems getting all of the <br/>
files. If you do it, load one part at a time, and get all the <br/>
downloads before going on the the next cd. Otherwise the load will be <br/>
too large.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know of another solution. Might try getting in touch with the <br/>
techs at EverQuest.com. Takes a while, but I did get help from them <br/>
on the few occasions I have had a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
