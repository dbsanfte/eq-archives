think I would be wise to have some back-up at lvl 34.<br/>

there,<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the island of the elementals, I was wondering if it would be <br/>
nuts<br/>
&gt; &gt; to try to solo there at lvl 33? Nice drops from those elementals, <br/>
but<br/>
&gt; &gt; I may try to get a group up if the solo thing is not workable.<br/>

&gt; I could solo on the elemental island with a 33rd mage, pulling <br/>
towards the<br/>
&gt; castle. Was a bit slow for me, but steady. Note that the castle <br/>
guards<br/>
&gt; will ignore elementals, and even the undead chasing you about. </span></blockquote></div>
