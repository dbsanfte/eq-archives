<div id="ygrps-yiv-1807661074">Your email addy may be verified but it might not be selected as your default<br/>
email choice for this group. You will need to go and select your email<br/>
address instead of your yahoo as the default one for this group.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Was wondering, when I try to email from my personal email-the email<br/>
&gt; never shows up. My email address is verified etc, I can come on here<br/>
&gt; and post and it shows up instantly, I can also post from my yahoo<br/>
&gt; email and it shows up within few seconds. My wife posts from hers-<br/>
&gt; which her email is through same place mine is and she can post from<br/>
&gt; the email with no problems.<br/>
&gt; Why can I not post via email? Anyone able to help me?<br/>
