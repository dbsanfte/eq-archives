<div id="ygrps-yiv-925099419">I have a 55 sk and the focus effects I think you might want are mana <br/>
preservation, burning affliction, and extended enhancement items. <br/>
Everyone who can cast a spell wants mana preservation, and extended <br/>
enhancement will make what few self buffs sk&#39;s have last a little <br/>
longer, burning affliction will make those damage over time spells do a <br/>
little more damage, and since we all know sk damage over time spells <br/>
are just lower level necro spells you&#39;ll need all the help with them <br/>
you can get, and some of them do actually help hold aggro too.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion for a low level sk weapon is Mace of the Shadowed Soul, <br/>
which you can usually find in bazaar at some really low price since <br/>
they are a common drop and only sk&#39;s can use. Base damage on that is 19 <br/>
and gives you +10 int. I&#39;m sure there are plenty of weapons you can <br/>
find in bazaar when you have more plat to spend, but I suggest that <br/>
mace because it&#39;s rather cheap and sometimes people even give them away <br/>
because as I said they are common and only sk&#39;s can use.</div>
