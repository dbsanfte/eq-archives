<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I concur.&nbsp; I decided just to see what they 
were like to get one of the guides marked &quot;Make Plat the Quick and Easy Way&quot; or 
something like that.&nbsp; It turned out it was nothing more than a recipe book 
for batwing crunchies, fish cakes, and fish rolls.&nbsp; It gave specific 
detailed instructions on where to buy the ingredients, how to combine them, and 
so on.&nbsp; The idea was to get your baking skill up to about 135 so you could 
make most anything and then sell it back to vendors or to other players to make 
the plat.&nbsp; However, I found&nbsp; if you sell it back to vendors you don&#39;t 
get near as much money for the product as you paid for all the ingredients, 
especially with what you lost on failed attempts so it didn&#39;t turn out to be 
profitable in the end.&nbsp; However, I found this could be remeied by charisma 
enhancing items or buffs.&nbsp; A pair of Opal Encrusted Steins which have +25 
charisma each can sometimes get you a plat or two more.&nbsp; Otherwise, you can 
sell tacks of what you make in the bazaar and reap some reward for them.&nbsp;

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">At any rate, my baking skill is now up to 
100.&nbsp; So I guess it was somewhat worth it.&nbsp; </font></div>

    <p>With all due respect, what is so fun about going around&nbsp;for a 
    week&nbsp;building up money for armor that you desperately want when you 
    could do it in a way that isn&#39;t as deadly, would only take you 3-4 days, and 
    would give you more exp in the long run of things, and then the better armor 
    would be something to brag about to other ppl ,and you&#39;d probably get more 
    invites. </p></blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
