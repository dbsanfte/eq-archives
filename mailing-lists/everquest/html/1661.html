<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776709009">It is just a mater of time before a problem will arise. I guarantee one,<br/>
you&#39;ll be in one of these pick up groups and a good item will drop and an<br/>
argument will start. The only way around this is to only group with friends<br/>
whom you trust or join a good guild. Everybody does not think the same way<br/>
you or I might think. You might think need before greed. But sure enough, a<br/>
caster item will drop and the Monk, Rogue or what ever will insist on full<br/>
random. It happens all the time.<br/>
<br/>
If you think you can just solo and never need a group, that is fine also.<br/>
But you will never see some of the great zones and dungeons in the game<br/>
without a guild or a group. Going to the Planes or Armor quest dungeons, you<br/>
want to be in a good, well organized guild. I am not saying by any means<br/>
you&#39;ll never get some great items by soloing or in pickup groups, you can<br/>
get you fair share of loot, but it&#39;ll be at the cost of many headaches if<br/>
you don&#39;t find some regular friends or a guild to stick with.<br/>
<br/>
Guilds have many advantages. In my guild, we hand down items once we get<br/>
better items or sell them to a guild mate for like half the cost of the<br/>
current market. My warrior has Thurg armor and I handed down all my stuff,<br/>
Cobalt gloves, Hammerhead Helm, Kylong legs & 2 cheep bracers. We keep it<br/>
all in our family. My guild mate gave me 5k for the gloves, 5k for the legs<br/>
and 6k for the HHH. When I got my quest armor, not only did that make me a<br/>
stronger warrior, but it also made some of my guild members stronger, and<br/>
thus my guild is stronger. <br/>
<br/>
Another guild advantage is the guild chat handle. If you have every tried to<br/>
raid Kael with your guild of 2 - 3 groups and there is already another raid<br/>
going on in Kael. While the other raids are using the /shout & /ooc chat<br/>
handles, you and your guild can use the guild handle. Believe me, Kael can<br/>
be as bad as GFay if they are 3-4 groups there and all you see is the<br/>
following:<br/>
/shout Incoming giant xxxxx<br/>
/ooc giant xxxxx is tash&#39;d<br/>
/shout giant xxxxx is snared<br/>
/shout Incoming giant yyyyy<br/>
/ooc giant zzzzz is malo&#39;d<br/>
/ooc giant yyyyy is malo&#39;d<br/>
/ooc giant xxxxx is slowed<br/>
/shout giant yyyyy is snared<br/>
/shout Silk arms, all casters give me a tell now if you want to roll<br/>
/ooc giant zzzzz is slowed<br/>
<br/>
Believe me, it is great to go there and only have to look at my guild chat<br/>
to see what is incoming, slowed or what just dropped. Maybe it is just me,<br/>
but there is A LOT of advantages to belonging to a guild.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for all the rambling!<br/>

<br/>
	I have seen a lot of people with guild names on my server and I was<br/>
really <br/>
	wondering what the benefit of being in a guild would be to going it<br/>
without <br/>
	one???<br/>
<br/>
	I mean I can always find someone to group with... or solo it on the<br/>
blue&#39;s <br/>
	and blacks....<br/>
<br/>
	Other then maybe another aspect added to the role playing game what<br/>
benefit <br/>
	do you recieve from a Guild.<br/>
<br/>
	ok got to run just wondering<br/>
<br/>
