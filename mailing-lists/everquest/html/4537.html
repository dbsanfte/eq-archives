<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Think about it this way.&nbsp; A video card has 
memory for a purpose.&nbsp; The video card&#39;s job is to draw, redraw, and crunch 
the numbers that adds texture to graphics.&nbsp; EQ being a constantly changing 
3D environment needs a card with the ability to render the graphics.&nbsp; In 
layman&#39;s terms, the better the video card, the better graphics performance 
you&#39;ll get.&nbsp; So why memory on a video card?&nbsp; Well the memory is a 
localized storage for functions and information that the graphics processor on 
the card will perform before sending the information to the CPU via the graphics 
bus.&nbsp; The more memory your video card has, the more information it can 
store and retrieve to complete its tasks before it gets sent to the 
processor.&nbsp; The less distance it has to travel, the faster it will 
be.&nbsp; Therefore, having memory on a video card makes sense.&nbsp; It doesn&#39;t 
have to travel far.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">If you don&#39;t have enough memory on a video card to 
perform all the functions the game requires of it, then these functions have to 
be performed SOMEWHERE.&nbsp; Where then does this happen?&nbsp; You guessed 
it!&nbsp; Virtual Memory.&nbsp; Where is virtual memory stored?&nbsp; You 
guessed it.&nbsp; On the hard drive.&nbsp; The hard drive is miles away from the 
video card.&nbsp; Think about what the video card has to do to&nbsp;process that 
information.&nbsp; First, it has to send that information via the graphics bus 
to the processor saying it needs to assign this information to virtual memory, 
then the processor says, &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll get to it as soon as I can finish these 
other functions.&quot;&nbsp; Then the processor looks up in its memory mapping to see 
where information from the video card can be stored and then sends the 
information to the IDE BUS and says &quot;Put these here&quot;.&nbsp; So then the IDE bus 
kicks in and sends the information to the appropriate spots.&nbsp; So the hard 
drive kicks in and says &quot;Wait! I need to locate those spots.&quot;&nbsp;So the hard 
drive spins and spins and spins until it&#39;s managed to store all that information 
that could be handled elsewhere.&nbsp;Once all this is done, the information is 
stored and everyone is happy, until the video card says &quot;I need this 
information.&quot;&nbsp; Then the hard drive gets upset and says &quot;Can&#39;t you see I&#39;m 
busy here???&nbsp; CPU can&#39;t you do anything about this?&quot;&nbsp; And the CPU 
grumbles and says &quot;Don&#39;t look at me man, it&#39;s the video card&#39;s problem; I just 
do what everyone else tells me to.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the hard drive gets 
aggitated and says &quot;Well if the video card would upgrade its stupid memory, it 
wouldn&#39;t have to utilize my resources to do its work.&nbsp; I got my own 
problems!&quot;</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Then the video card said &quot;God, I wish my user would 
upgrade my memory cause it&#39;s such a pain in the ass having to deal with all 
these unnecessary steps!&quot;</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The repetitive act of accessing the hard drive 
unnecessarily for virtual memory is called Disk Thrashing, and over a period of 
time can cause undue wear and tear that could have otherwise been 
prevented.&nbsp; Upgrade your video card.&nbsp; Let it do the tasks so the hard 
drive doesn&#39;t have to.&nbsp; Your hard drive won&#39;t be accessed as often thus 
giving it another few good years of life, and you&#39;ll get better graphics 
performance in the game.</font></div>

  <div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font><font face="Arial"
 size="2"></font><br></div><tt>Thanks again for all of the suggestions! Really 
  appreciate it.<br><br>I already have the VM set to max - no problem with all 
  of the <br>available disk space.<br><br>It seems most of you are pointing to 
  the Video controller as the <br>likely solution. Could well be - the existing 
  one is only 16MB. But <br>why would a slow video cause such a hit on the hard 
  disk, which seems <br>to be viusally where the bottleneck is - i.e. on zoning, 
  the hard <br>disk is very active until it zones are goes back to the server 
  <br>screen. The hard disk is performing extremely well and is very fast, 
  <br>so that is not the problemin itself - could the slwo graphics card 
  <br>cause EQ to go to the hard disk more to compensate?<br><br>I am not sure I 
  could go to a 128MB graphics card - would 64Mb do?<br><br>Thanks once 
  again.<br><br>Regards.<br><br><br><br></tt></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
