<div id="ygrps-yiv-1288903500">Being a Viet Nam era vet (never in country) I just want to thank you<br/>
for what you are doing. So many of my brother vets served in country<br/>
and saw so little appreciation. Thanks for serving in difficult times,<br/>
whatever your contribution.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry you can&#39;t get the bandwidth to play while away. Hope you can get<br/>
what you need via the books and sites like this. Thanks again for your<br/>
service.<br/>

&gt; Hello everyone I&#39;m new to this club and my name is Ron and I&#39;m a EQ<br/>
addict<br/>
&gt; lol.  I just thought I&#39;d introduce myself to everyone and give a little<br/>
&gt; background info about myself.  Well I&#39;ve been playing EQ for about 2<br/>
years<br/>
&gt; now and I love it.  I play on Ayonae Ro and my main is a 29 troll<br/>
warrior<br/>
&gt; and I also have a 25 iksar necro, 12 human monk, and the rest of my<br/>
&gt; characters are just throw away ones, I wanted to experiment to see<br/>
how the<br/>
&gt; different classes play like.  Well I&#39;m also in the navy out here in<br/>
the gulf<br/>
&gt; and I&#39;m stationed in Everett, WA.  I haven&#39;t played EQ since March<br/>
2nd (we<br/>
&gt; left for westpac March 3rd) and I won&#39;t be able to play until we get<br/>
back<br/>
&gt; sometime in middle November.  I have with me here on the ship just about<br/>
&gt; every EQ book/guide that came out lol from Kunark to Luclin to the<br/>
EQ Atlas<br/>
&gt; and the EQ spellbook..I read them whenever I have EQ withdrawls<br/>
(which is<br/>
&gt; everyday).  So yeah I just can&#39;t wait to come back to the states and<br/>
play<br/>
&gt; again.  Well I guess I&#39;d better get going for now, take care<br/>
everyone and<br/>
&gt; happy hunting!<br/>
