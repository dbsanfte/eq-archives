<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-706849823">I personally started a ranger before the &quot;Trueshot Chainmail&quot; quests <br/>
came out, but I started getting that armor around 8th level and now <br/>
have a COMPLETE set.  It took a while and some work to get all the <br/>
armor, but it was well worth it.  At 15th now and have over 100 str , <br/>
100 sta, and 100wis without having had to dumped all the training <br/>
points into any of them..I increased cha, dex, and int and <br/>
wis..because after 9th, a ranger is also a druid and need wis for <br/>
mana.<br/>
<br/>
Put a few into each, but remember that the Trueshot Chainmail <br/>
increases STR and STA for EVERY piece.  I have included the stats <br/>
below.   Take it from someone who had the ringmail that was weighting <br/>
him down and now has the relatively feather light trueshot chainmail <br/>
and loving it.<br/>
<br/>
Almost every piece increases the STR enough to cover the items weight <br/>
and in some cases more.<br/>
<br/>
And if you do these quests at the appropriate time, everything should <br/>
provide you with experience.  Crushbone will be your chosen hunting <br/>
ground because 80% of the stuff you need drops there.<br/>
<br/>
If you are or soon plan to be, a big orange hostess treat, then <br/>
ignore my comments, because NOOB armor is beneath most twinkies even <br/>
at low levels.  ;)<br/>
