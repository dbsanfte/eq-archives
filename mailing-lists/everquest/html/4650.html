<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375777637">The thing that has changed about languages is that you no longer have <br/>
to zone to see a skill up in that language. As you are spamming your <br/>
student they will see the skill ups immediately.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   I don&#39;t know that languages and the teaching of them has changed, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>but I can state for sure that it WAS so that you could teach <br/>
languages in a group and every person in the group would get better <br/>
at it.  All you needed to do was to constantly spam the group with <br/>
text in the language you wanted to teach, assuming of course, you <br/>
knew the language.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt;   It&#39;s not uncommon for a guide or gm to make claims about the game <br/>
 </span></blockquote>as it is or was and for those claims to be totally baseless, I <br/>
suspect that they lie as often as not.  Keep in mind that the <br/>
development team recently suggested that people could interupt a <br/>
spell being cast on horseback by making a hotkey that consisted of <br/>
two lines, /dismount and /duck<br/>

&gt;     I was curious what has changed about the languages.  I used to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>be able to teach a language to my group and get better at it.  This <br/>
is no longer so, and I talked to a GM who told me this was never so.  <br/>
I was also told that something changed in respect to languages and <br/>
zoning or something.  I am quite curious about this, as I am trying <br/>
to learn every language I can.  I was also curious if you could teach <br/>
over your own knowledge in the language.  Thank you in advance for <br/>
your replies. <br/>
