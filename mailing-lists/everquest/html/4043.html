<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Hi...I am looking for a EQ entusiast (addict) for a TV Interview <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388671993">I come out of lurking to say this:<br/>
TechTV is a really great network that I watch constantly. I am sure <br/>
that whatever package they are producing will be fair and informative <br/>
to both players and non-players of Everquest. Call for help is, as you <br/>
might guess from the title, is a call-in show where the host help <br/>
people out with their computer questions. I hardly think they will be <br/>
grilling interview-ees about EQ suicides or any other hot button <br/>
issues. They may mention the addictive nature of EQ, but I doubt it <br/>
will turn into any sort of an inquisition. TechTv has always been cool <br/>
about covering computer games and the culture of computer gamers. Heck, <br/>
they are sponsoring their own LAN party of Unreal Tournament 2003.<br/>
