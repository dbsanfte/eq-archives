of the lag comes from their code, and<br>not just our systems. Everquest is an 
old game, using<br>older code, and some of that code has been modified to<br>try 
and make the game graphics look like some of the<br>newer games.<br><br>I&#39;m not 
blaming them, they&#39;re just trying to keep up<br>with what the players want 
(better looking graphics).<br>It&#39;s just that the original graphic engine is too 
old.<br>:)<br><br>3 gigs of RAM and a 3 gig processor... wow, I&#39;d love<br>to 
have that, hehe.<br></strong></font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I agree.&nbsp; I think at some point there will be 
a massive overhaul of the graphics in these zones that lag and change the code 
so it&#39;s more up to date.&nbsp; Moving to the XML GUI I think helped a lot, 
except now there is more of the screen to refresh.So when they can fix that, the 
Bazaar will be so much more bearable.</font></div>
