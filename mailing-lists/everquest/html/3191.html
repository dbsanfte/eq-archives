  <div><br></div><tt>Hail all and well met.&nbsp; I have been playing EQ 
  since<br>about Nov of last year and have become adicted to it<br>just like 
  everyone else.&nbsp; I have also been a member of<br>this group for awhile but 
  never posted.&nbsp; Have enjoyed<br>alot of the info that has been put out 
  there.&nbsp; So I<br>figured it was time for me to come out of the 
  shadows<br>and let my voice be heard.&nbsp; I been play on Brell,<br>haven&#39;t 
  tried any other servers as of yet.&nbsp; Have alot<br>of friend on Brell in RL 
  so tis why I stayed on there<br>for this long.&nbsp; However I do have alittle 
  bit of a<br>question that I want to put out there.&nbsp; I play a 
  36<br>Drunken Chanter of Greenhall, am alittle tired of the<br>Kunark area and 
  looking for some new places to hunt. <br>EIther in groups or solo makes me no 
  matter.&nbsp; But I<br>would like to find a place that i can do both.&nbsp; 
  And<br>yes this chanter still solos alot.&nbsp; Although my guild<br>leader 
  doesn&#39;t like it, and she has even taken away my<br>staff so that I couldn&#39;t be 
  a chanter tank anymore. <br>hehe&nbsp; What she doesn&#39;t know won&#39;t hurt 
  me.&nbsp; hehe <br>Anyway, did alot of time in LOIO and FM and 
  OT<br>already.&nbsp; To break it up I even went to SK and soloed<br>the gnolls 
  at the spires.&nbsp; But now that I am 36 SK<br>just won&#39;t do it much for 
  now.&nbsp; I do have a score to<br>settle with some giants in the Karanas 
  though.&nbsp; SO I<br>will be back.&nbsp; But if anyone could shed alittle 
  light<br>on some good places to group or solo til into the 40s,<br>with good 
  xp.&nbsp; Not saying I want to lvl every night in<br>one setting, those places 
  would tend to be full of<br>death also.&nbsp; Just looking for some nice and 
  calm pace,<br>but have alittle on the edge feel to it.&nbsp; I get 
  enough<br>of that on raids.&nbsp; And yes I do go on bigger guild<br>raids 
  then my lvl should let me, but then again I have<br>the safety of my guild and 
  some of our allies there. <br>So if anyone is on Brell and wants to give me a 
  shout<br>out feel free.<br><br><br>Zindi<br>36 Drunken Chanter<br>Elder board
