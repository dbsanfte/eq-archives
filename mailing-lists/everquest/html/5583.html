<div id="ygrps-yiv-33263095">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I just bought a new DELL computer for gaming.  When I played EQ the <br/>
other day, I went to the OVERTHERE.  Instead of seeing the usual <br/>
creatures (succulents, rhinos, Sarnaks and tigers), I see only <br/>
various sizes of human men.  Now this computer is supposed to have a <br/>
top line graphic card, so I&#39;m not sure how to adjust my settings to <br/>
see the normal bestiary for this area.  Does anyone know what I <br/>
should adjust to get things back to normal?   <br/>
<br/>
Thanks....</div>
