<br/>
because of the druids transportation spells ... but with luclin<br/>
it already got much better.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO druids/shammies work better with monks, because monks don&#39;t<br/>
need the extreme heals like warriors. a warrior/cleric combo is<br/>
pretty &quot;brutal&quot;, but the cleric has no SoW-like spells and not<br/>
everyone has jboots ... well, you could still buy SoW potions.<br/>
<br/>
another interesting combo is mage/cleric (which i currently use).<br/>
but i know it only works very good at 39+ for the cleric and 51+<br/>
for the mage.<br/>
<br/>
i also played a chantress/wizzy combo for some time ... it makes<br/>
both parts very happy ... and very effective ... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
i wanted to try a bard/ranger combo one day, but i think this has<br/>
to be done by two persons, because both classes are very active<br/>
ones.<br/>
