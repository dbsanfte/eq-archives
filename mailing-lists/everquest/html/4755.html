<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077042490">All I can say is I agree with you all with the<br/>
exception of the person who started the thread.  My<br/>
adivice to that person is, dont get so wrapped up in<br/>
the GAME, yes it is a game ya know, that you can&#39;t<br/>
enjoy it , if you don&#39;t have UBA gear, the best weaps<br/>
your PP can buy, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Any caster in the game needs to learn skills like Mana<br/>
effectiveness just like a warrior needs to learn how<br/>
to pull and when not to pull so casters can med up.<br/>
<br/>
It is a synergy that makes a good group.  Granted we<br/>
all make mistakes and most people are forgiving but<br/>
because they took away KEI under 45 and made a few<br/>
zones harder.  I don&#39;t find that as any substantiated<br/>
means to quit the game.  Yeah the level 30 druid NOW<br/>
has to actually do something to gain some levels as<br/>
opposed to rooting, dot&#39;ng and getting mana back<br/>
within a minute or so.<br/>
<br/>
Like, SU, I remember the times where you only had that<br/>
short time to get your corpse.  This game is not as<br/>
challenging as it could be.  And with additions like<br/>
the bazaar, come on, let&#39;s be real. There are more<br/>
people whose main title should be CAPTAIN TWINKIE more<br/>
now than ever.  I picked up a shield for my cleric the<br/>
other night for 700pp and 5 other people were selling<br/>
the same shield for 1600-2000pp.  <br/>
<br/>
My advice to you would be, try getting into a GOOD<br/>
guild, where you meet good people and can enjoy<br/>
grouping with them as opposed to the Give me give me<br/>
give me syndrome that far too many people seem to<br/>
have.<br/>
<br/>
Sony is making this game more group oriented and I<br/>
really can see reasons why they should.  Nothing use<br/>
to upset me more than some mid level twink going to<br/>
High Keep and just fighting mobs , KS&#39;ng from groups<br/>
that were camped there.   Because so many people would<br/>
solo, there were more camp fights than I dared to<br/>
dream about.<br/>
<br/>
Things seem a lot calmer now since there are benefits<br/>
to grouping and not soling. Especially a char like the<br/>
halfling druid who now gets more exp in a group at 30<br/>
than soloing , since he/she can manage their mana<br/>
better in the group. Yes Soloing still gives more exp,<br/>
but the time to med makes grouping a better choice.<br/>
<br/>
I would really love to know what zones are that much<br/>
harder, cause I can&#39;t find any that are rediculously<br/>
difficult.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you give it another thought and look deeper<br/>
into the game for enjoyment.  Heck, I have as much fun<br/>
taking an under 10 char to places and getting the snot<br/>
beat out of me and I know some people who just love<br/>
getting the newbie armor quests, which are a great<br/>
accomplishment with the # of rare drops.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And as far as writing the letter, I think you can see<br/>
that the majority of the population are happy with the<br/>
games progress and maybe rethinking your letter would<br/>
save you time and heartache.<br/>
<br/>
Have a nice day and Smile, it takes less effort they<br/>
say.<br/>

&gt;  I think that quitting EverQuest over a few<br/>
&gt; &gt; changes is a bit <br/>
&gt; &gt; extreme. But I guess what it comes down to is your<br/>
&gt; &gt; enjoyment of the <br/>
&gt; &gt; game. If you no longer enjoy it, then you do not<br/>
&gt; &gt; have to play.<br/>
&gt; &gt; luv,<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; My thoughts exactly. Very good response.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hehe, we sound like old timers.... &quot;Back in my day,<br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt; only had breeze and we were THANKFUL for it!&quot; :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I, for one, am happy with just about all the<br/>
&gt; changes.<br/>
