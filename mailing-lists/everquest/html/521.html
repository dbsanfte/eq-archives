<div id="ygrps-yiv-1812086171">I have to comment that I decline to respond to the questionnaire because I<br/>
don&#39;t like the choices - it is too black and white...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t kill-steal - and I don&#39;t think it is in the spirit of role-play.<br/>
And I also don&#39;t think it &quot;ruins&quot; the game.  I think that simply there are<br/>
&quot;problems&quot; with the code as it is designed to determine who gets credit for<br/>
the kill.  I think that minor not drastic changes are in order.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless - you are a bit out of date in that Verant has acknowledged the<br/>
problem and will be addressing it.  They stated (and I&#39;m paraphrasing) that<br/>
the current system is such that it rewards solo over groups and they want to<br/>
change it to tilt towards group - since their philosophy of the game is to<br/>
promote grouping.<br/>
<br/>
The way I see it - the main problem is that it only looks at damage against<br/>
the mob and doesn&#39;t incorporate the damage that the players receive...<br/>
