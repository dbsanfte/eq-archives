  tailor/smithy.</div>
  <div><br></div><tt>I had just returned from looting Permafrost to my home of 
  Rivervale. <br>I sold my loot, visited the bank, and ran into a high level 
  wood elf <br>druid. He was seeking a tailor to make the new 100% weight 
  reduction <br>bags.<br><br>I told him I was a level 80 tailor, and level 70 
  smith. After not <br>finding anyone better, he and I went to the Vale Forge to 
  try to make <br>the Vale Sewing Kit I would need. As getting parts for this 
  kit <br>happens to be my present goal, I was delighted.<br><br>He had parts 
  for five tries. In five tries I failed five times, but <br>gained three 
  levels. Not bad for me, but unfortunate for my new <br>friend.<br><br>I gained 
  also in learning how to get my hq metal bits. I have been <br>seeking the ore, 
  but he suggested reverse-engineering fine steel <br>weapons. He said a fs 
  weapon, flask of water, and chisel can break <br>down the fs weapon to the 
  component parts. <br><br>He suggested Hill Giants in Raith Mountains as a good 
  source of fs <br>weapons to work with. I am nearly leveled enough for that 
  adventure, <br>and so I may direct my efforts to leveling a bit so I may 
  follow this <br>advice.<br><br>Anyone know of other good hunting which nets 
  fine steel drops? I <br>expect that my quest to make my Vale Sewing Kit will 
  raise my <br>experience and my smithing levels quite nicely.<br><br>And about 
  reverse engineering. Anyone know much about this? For <br>example, I looted a 
  chainmail tunic in Permafrost, but it was too <br>large for my alts to use. 
  However, if I could break it down into <br>parts and remake it with the 
  correct pattern for a small character, I <br>could come out ahead. Any idea if 
  this works?<br><br>Barto Proudfoot<br><br></tt><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest
