<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146793191">Hi everyone whatz up?? I am really looking for some friends on <br/>
everquest so i can meet people outside of my own hometown. When i <br/>
play the game it seems like everyone is busy and really doesnt want <br/>
to talk so i decided to come to a group where i could meet some <br/>
people and talk and become friends in the game! So if anyone is <br/>
interseted in becoming friends please reply or maybe chat with me <br/>
while on everquest if ya see me!! My Name on Everquest is Curapachi <br/>
and i am a level 10 bard/wood elf. I hope i meet ya there and we can <br/>
