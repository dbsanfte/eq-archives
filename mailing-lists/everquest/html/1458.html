Everquest resembles real life in many ways. Just like the previous poster<br/>
said, pretend this low level character has a rich uncle. Usually when you<br/>
see a low level character in level 50 gear, they have already played this<br/>
game to level 50+ when one of their other characters and then outfit their<br/>
new character with equipment they received with their main character. <br/>
<br/>
If you go around inspecting lower level players, you are going to find A LOT<br/>
of people with great gear better than yours. I guess you&#39;re in for a sad EQ<br/>
life, or atleast until you understand this and get over your sadness or you<br/>
obtain some great gear for yourself. <br/>
<br/>
Buy low, sell high and go buy your own uber gear.    <br/>

	I&#39;m not a core roleplayer.  And it&#39;s still sad to me to see a lower<br/>
level <br/>
	with better stuff than me.  I&#39;ll get it one day so I&#39;m not envious.<br/>
I just <br/>
	hate to see it.<br/>

	&lt;&lt; It isnt sad, its real life. These things happen every day, both<br/>
in-game and<br/>
	 outside. If you are a core roleplayer just think of it as he had a<br/>
rich<br/>
	 uncle. If not well, you would do it yourself if you had a chance.<br/>
Simply<br/>
	 nothing to moan about.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 Envy wont help you one bit. Most likely hes gone through the &quot;i<br/>
killed 2000<br/>
	 rats and then 2000 orc pawns&quot; with another character and its not<br/>
appealing<br/>
	 to do it again.<br/>
