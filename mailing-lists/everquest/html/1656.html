<br>get his brother into the game but that didn&#39;t work. &nbsp;But we have RL friends

<br> 
<br>I also play with family members.... &nbsp;
<br> 
<br>My son and his wife both play EQ... &nbsp;&nbsp;My hubby plays too, but not with 
<br>me... &nbsp;LOL It&#39;s better that way... he has his friends and I have mine... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>We like it that way... &nbsp;We are together, but not together... &nbsp;&nbsp;We share the 
<br>maps and EQ info... &nbsp;&nbsp;:)
<br> 
<br> 
<br>I imagine there are many, many family members playing EQ &nbsp;.... &nbsp;&nbsp;
<br> 
<br>Cercie &nbsp;Kindheart &nbsp;&nbsp;~~~ &nbsp;Cleric of Povar
