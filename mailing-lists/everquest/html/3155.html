<b>Subject:</b> New to EQ and can&#39;t get it started!!! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-710040366">Hello.  I bought eq today along with a game card.  I installed it, <br/>
went to new account, and when I click it it bounces me to the <br/>
desktop.  i dried disabling my firewall, soundcard, starting with <br/>
all unnecessary processes disabled.  uninstalled/installed many <br/>
times.  checked for irq and I found that the cable modem network <br/>
cark was sharing 12 with the onboard sound, tried moving the network <br/>
card and ended up having to reactivate xp!  As it stands, I&#39;ve yet <br/>
to set foot in Norrath.<br/>
I registered at the Station, and tried to use the tech bulliten <br/>
board, but it won&#39;t let me post, says that I need to me a regisered <br/>
user-- I thought I was!!<br/>
anyways, that&#39;s why I&#39;m here.  PLEASE HELP!!  I can&#39;t wait to play <br/>
my new game!!!<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Dan</div>
