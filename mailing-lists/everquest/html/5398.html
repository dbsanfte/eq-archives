<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-380132669">Thanks!<br/>
I&#39;m level 56 now but I started the shawl quest two years ago. I believe I<br/>
worked on the 5th shawl for over a year. Well, not the shawl itself, but<br/>
getting my skill up. I think I started at level 48 or 49. Possibly 50. I<br/>
remained level 52 for almost a year. I haven&#39;t leveled in several months.<br/>
I&#39;m almost 57 now. I have about 5 LDoN adventures under my belt.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if you can get all of the no drop items at your level. You need<br/>
75 no drop threads from crystalline spiders in velks for the 5th shawl, no<br/>
drop sirens hair from either Sirens Grotto or Cobalt Scar (as long as you<br/>
keep the sirens chain stunned you can kill them quickly), no drop swordfish<br/>
tooth from Sirens Grotto.. And I believe you need to have good enough<br/>
faction with the Coldain to start the quest to begin with. So you need to<br/>
have killed a few drakkel wolves and frost giants in GD or EW.<br/>

&gt; Might I ask what level you are? I&#39;m trying to start the shawl quest<br/>
&gt; with my 40 Barbarian Shaman cause he could really use the Flowing<br/>
&gt; Thought at the end, but didn&#39;t know if I was still to low to work on<br/>
&gt; the firsth shawl<br/>
