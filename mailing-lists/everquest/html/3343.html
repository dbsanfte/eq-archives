<div id="ygrps-yiv-838388477"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; It sounds like you have a Velium weapon.  Those are pretty common<br/>
&gt; anymore.  They come in almost all weapon types and are easy to find.<br/>
&gt; They usually go for around 10 plat.  Most people use them because<br/>
&gt; they are magic and they can hunt magic only mobs.  Their ratios are<br/>
&gt; good until about 20, then you should be able to get better.<br/>

recovered from fighting a mob and in return gave me a velium shortsword<br/>
which had like dmg 10 delay 25 and procced the velium shards. Procs like 3<br/>
times in a battle. Very helpful. :-)<br/>
