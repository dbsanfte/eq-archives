<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141127260">You have to go to Kelethin. People in Kelethin are friendlier. Heh. looking<br/>
like PP is funny. :-)<br/>
That reminds me, isn&#39;t the game supposed to ask you if you want to drop your<br/>
money when you are clicking it over something? Bc I tried to trade money<br/>
with someone once and it didn&#39;t trade but the money was gone. The person<br/>
informed me that I had dropped it on the ground. I had not meant to drop it<br/>
and it didn&#39;t ask me if I wanted to.. Was that a glitch?<br/>
