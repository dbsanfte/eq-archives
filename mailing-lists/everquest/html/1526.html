<div id="ygrps-yiv-1108988679"><html><div>I recently hit 49th with my druid.&nbsp; A lot of the friends I made at lower levels (I am a grouping druid, didn&#39;t solo until level 35) have quit EQ and moved on, and my guild is made up of lower levels who aren&#39;t anywhere near able to group with me.&nbsp; Where do you all suggest I go for exp and loot?&nbsp; I&#39;m not much of an explorer and so won&#39;t go to a zone I don&#39;t have a map of and preferably an escort (hehe).&nbsp; I&#39;ve tried Karnor&#39;s, but it&#39;s sooo hard to get a group there, and I got my face shoved through my head when I tried to kite in Burning Woods.&nbsp; Any suggestions would be appreciated :)</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>Thanks,</div> <div>Nymue<br><br></div></html></div>
