<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058256408"><html><div>Honestly, Su, I would *never* have stayed in that group.&nbsp; If you&#39;re there for exp, how good is the exp if you keep dying because the main healer won&#39;t heal you (I know you didn&#39;t die but you very easily could have)?&nbsp; I would never stay if I wasn&#39;t absolutely sure the healer wouldn&#39;t do everything in his power to keep me alive, tank or not.&nbsp; I&#39;m sure there were other open spots at camps nearby you could have gone to.&nbsp; That guy sounds like a 5-yr-old brat, and I&#39;d put him on ignore -- someday he&#39;ll need something from you!&nbsp; :)</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>Nymue<br></div> <div><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> </span></blockquote></div> <blockquote style="BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;"> <div style="FONT:10pt Arial;">----- Original Message -----</div> <div style="BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt Arial;"><b>From:</b>&nbsp;Su</div> <div style="FONT:10pt Arial;"><b>Sent:</b>&nbsp;Wednesday, May 23, 2001 8:31 PM</div> <div style="FONT:10pt Arial;"><b>To:</b>&nbsp;EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</div> <div style="FONT:10pt Arial;"><b>Subject:</b>&nbsp;Re: [EverQuest] money problem</div> <div><br></div><br>This reminds me.. Recently I was in a group and they refused to do alpha<br>loot. But I needed the xp and faction so I stayed. I was getting to loot a<br>little bit but then one of the members looked at my gear and suddenly<br>decided that I didn&#39;t &quot;need&quot; money or items bc I already had &quot;good stuff&quot;.<br>Nevermind that I had to work my ass off to get the money to buy the stuff<br>and had no money left to buy spells or better items. I don&#39;t know where he<br>got off. I mean, I wasn&#39;t even getting xp from most of the stuff while he<br>was and he would&#39;ve been dead 10 times over if I hadn&#39;t saved him by using<br>DDs to kill stuff before it could kill him. So he expected me to gain<br>nothing but faction? Such a jerk. And the worst part was, he was main healer<br>yet he refused to heal me when I had 1 bub of life left. He had 3 bubs of<br>life yet and started healing HIMSELF while I was near death. He wasn&#39;t even<br>getting aggrod on at the time. I was only injured so much bc I pulled some<br>orcs off of him so they wouldn&#39;t kill him. When I asked him nicely for a<br>heal he said &quot;I heal the tanks first-- and I&#39;m the only one injured&quot;. I<br>responded with &quot;I think I did a pretty good job of tanking&quot;. I didn&#39;t get<br>healed til another person who wasn&#39;t in a group ran by and stopped to heal<br>me.<br>Luckily a guildmate of mine showed up and invited me to join his group. The<br>jerk was left on his own and he stupidly tried to attack the entire large<br>orc camp (in EC) on his own. I watched him die (nothing I could do about it<br>really).<br>Oh well.. don&#39;t mind me. just rambling.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br></blockquote></html>
