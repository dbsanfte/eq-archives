<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477067708">Verant seems to do that alot. They always seem to assume that the players<br/>
are guilty of some wrongdoing.<br/>
They are so concerned about making things &quot;fair&quot; that they make it unfair<br/>
for the players. They ban players for taking advantage of bugs or any<br/>
advantage they have over mobs yet mobs can still hit players through walls<br/>
and solid objects, can walk thru objects (like trees, walls, stones), and<br/>
can hit from 5 feet away when the players can&#39;t hit. They can manage to be<br/>
invisible and unhittable to the player yet that is considered &quot;fair&quot;.<br/>
Also, when a player dies, his/her pet disappears. but when a mob dies, it&#39;s<br/>
pet stays and can kill the players. I think that&#39;s wrong. Verant needs to<br/>
work on making the game a little more fair for the players again.<br/>
I know people who refuse to get EQ until they fix the mobs walking thru<br/>
trees and walls bit. oh, and mobs can run straight up vertical surfaces with<br/>
no problem while players can&#39;t. that&#39;s another problem that needs to be<br/>
worked out.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;  Prior to banning any accounts reported as compromised, we will<br/>
&gt; &gt; conduct a thorough review of the accounts in question and determine<br/>
&gt; &gt; the appropriate course of action on those accounts. Accounts will only<br/>
&gt; &gt; be banned based on information gathered through our investigation and<br/>
&gt; &gt; not merely as a result of external allegations.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;From my understanding, this bit was added to avoid cases like that<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; out by Mu, when someone may have a personal vendetta against you and may<br/>
&gt; somehow find out your account username then call up Verant and claim that<br/>
&gt; you stole their account just to have your account banned.  A rudimentary<br/>
&gt; investigation would probably turn up who the original account owner was.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However, I don&#39;t think this type of investigation would protect against a<br/>
&gt; real &quot;hack&quot; of Verants systems.  If a completely unrelated third party<br/>
&gt; were to obtain username and passwords to accounts on Verants systems, I<br/>
&gt; would think it to be difficult for the owner of a compromised account to<br/>
&gt; prove that they didn&#39;t give out any account information.  It seems to have<br/>
&gt; been turned into a case of guilty until proven innocent.  Although this in<br/>
&gt; no way benefits the victim (owner of compromised account), Verant is a<br/>
&gt; business and businesses are in it to make money.  This probably seemed<br/>
&gt; like the most economical solution for them with little work on their end<br/>
&gt; and  &quot;should&quot; not have negative effects on the largest portion of the user<br/>
&gt; base.<br/>
