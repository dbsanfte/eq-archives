<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689765423">I wish you well in your battle with leukemia, and am delighted that <br/>
you can play this wonderful game during your difficult time. I was <br/>
diagnosed with acute pancreatitis last year, which put me in contact <br/>
with many persons with the chronic form of that disease. <br/>
Unfortunately, most of them contend with too much pain to be able to <br/>
play EQ comfortably. I am most fortunate, as my treatment was <br/>
successful, and I have had no recurrence thus far.<br/>
<br/>
Stay strong, play long.<br/>
