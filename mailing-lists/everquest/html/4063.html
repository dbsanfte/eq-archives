<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141270127">well not only do people reading have to find out all the facts, but I <br/>
believe that person postsing up the message should word it in a way <br/>
that shows what he really means and explain since not everyone has <br/>
that show. I&#39;m not trying to diss techtv, I never even heard of it, <br/>
and when I first read the &quot;call for help&quot; and EQ enthusiest (addict) <br/>
it struck me as a sort of blow to the gut. Yes there are people who <br/>
do play EQ a lot for many different reasons, one in my case  is that <br/>
I live in a really borring town and shops close at like 8pm on <br/>
weekdays... even the mall... so other than EQ I&#39;d just be sitting <br/>
down watching TV... *sighs* I need to move to pheonix or back to <br/>
hawaii... anyways just saying that I didn&#39;t know about techtv and I <br/>
apologize if I said anything harsh, I didn&#39;t know what the show was <br/>
about or the segment &quot;call for help&quot;. but also saying that people <br/>
reading should not only know the facts, but also need to be told the <br/>
facts for not everyone around the world understands things, like me <br/>
being from Hawaii I&#39;m sure most people don&#39;t know how to say or what <br/>
words mean like &quot;Ikaika&quot; or how to say kalanianiole... but yeah <br/>
that&#39;s what I think is that facts need to be known that is true, but <br/>
also need to be told to those who don&#39;t know for ignorance is not <br/>
always bliss...<br/>
<br/>
Btw for those on the Rathe. a few guilds are having a Kith raid this <br/>
wed, not sure what time atm, but I will find out today and post it up <br/>
tomarrow. so all you rogues out there who need the kith raid come <br/>
