Subject: [EverQuest] Looking for a weblink<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I feel kinda stupid asking this.<br/>
<br/>
One day while sitting in class ignoring my professor&#39;s lecture, I was<br/>
browsing the web and came across a weblink.  It was a series of comic strips<br/>
based on EverQuest that I thought was really well done.  I had intended on<br/>
posting the link to this list, but never did.  Now I&#39;m trying to find the<br/>
link again but I cant remember how or where I found it.  So I was hoping<br/>
that maybe someone here might know what I&#39;m talking about.  Essentially the<br/>
comic strip starts out with a female wood elf turning in her quest paper to<br/>
become a druid, but some things happen and she ends up being taken under the<br/>
wing (?) of an Iksar who was a friend of her father.  The Iksar character is<br/>
named after the person&#39;s character who draws the strip.  Hopefully this is<br/>
enough information that someone might recognize it and post the link.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>
