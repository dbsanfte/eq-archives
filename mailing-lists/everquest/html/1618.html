<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-826523006">I&#39;ve found that I get better CS from Beseen.com --- and they are a FREE<br/>
service. Holden, one of their managers, personally corresponds with me on a<br/>
regular basis.<br/>
I think Verant could learn something from them.<br/>
One of the things that bugs me is how the GMs at the chats will sit and joke<br/>
with other people (which is ok sometimes) while ignoring people who are<br/>
asking for help.<br/>

&gt; does, would you keep doing business there? VI has the CRAPPIEST cs I have<br/>
&gt; EVER seen in a businness, at least one that is still in operation. They<br/>

&gt; can sure as heck afford to instigate some decent cs.<br/>
