&gt; <br/>
&gt; So is anyone besides me going to get this? I&#39;m really excited about <br/>
&gt; it and look forward to it coming out. I was just wondering if anyone <br/>
&gt; else on this list was going to get it. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>EQOA is going to be fun.  I got into the betas.  Beta2 is going to start <br/>
soon.  Some people may call it &#39;EQ-lite&#39; but it&#39;s not really like that.<br/>
It&#39;s just as fun as EQ.<br/>
Anybody planning to buy it, buy the network adapter as soon as you see <br/>
it.  They are sometimes hard to find.  Also, buy a USB keyboard or a <br/>
regular keyboard with a USB adapter, keyboards make it much easier to <br/>
communicate.<br/>
Can&#39;t really tell any details of the game because of the EULA they make <br/>
us agree to.<br/>
Somebody who was in the Disney beta said that was actually much better <br/>
than you&#39;d think a &#39;kid-themed MMOG&#39; would be.  Don&#39;t think I&#39;d buy it <br/>
tho.  Don&#39;t see it making it very long.  May do well at first, but after <br/>
a while the kids will lose interest or grow out of it.<br/>
