<div id="ygrps-yiv-2069957379">I read Computer Gaming World. They list their &quot;Killer Rigs,&quot; which <br/>
you could build or have built. Alternately, the Alien line advertised <br/>
in that same magazine seems to be a superior game platform. If you <br/>
have several grand to spend, they have some fine machines.<br/>
