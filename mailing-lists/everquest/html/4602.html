<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280528977">WEll one thing I did with my mage was to camp the LR<br/>
or look out room in high hold heep.  You will need a<br/>
healer.<br/>
<br/>
Or you can hunt gnolls at the spires in SK. THis was<br/>
good exp for me around that level.  <br/>
<br/>
You can also get into groups in the keep which is nice<br/>
since people always need binds which you can do and<br/>
you can bank there.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>

&gt; how hard i try, I cant seem to get past this lvl.  I<br/>
&gt; have been in full groups killing reds in FV for<br/>
&gt; hours and still only gotten like half a bub of xp,<br/>
&gt; and all the others in my group were around teh same<br/>
&gt; lvl.  I have tried soloing and still nothing.  I am<br/>
&gt; curious waht I should do, because I lvled really<br/>
&gt; quick until 24 and it took me about teh same amount<br/>
&gt; of time to get to 24 as it did to get from 24 to 26.<br/>
&gt;  I am about done with it because I cant seem to go<br/>
&gt; anywhere with her.  I started a druid on another<br/>
&gt; server and have been playing that, but if i CAN find<br/>
&gt; a way to lvl up my mage, Id liek to.  Thanks in<br/>
&gt; advance for all your help.<br/>
