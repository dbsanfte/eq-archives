As a friend of mine tells me in the SCA over and over as long as you are<br/>
having fun and no one is hurt by it then by all means keep having fun.  But<br/>
the day it stops being fun is time to take a break for awhile and get back<br/>
to it when you are ready to have more fun.<br/>

&gt; Heh. Since both of you said it, I&#39;m more likely to remember it when I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; helping my mom do her shammy&#39;s epic.<br/>
&gt; Right now I need to start on my own epic. People would love me if I had a<br/>
&gt; click stick. And it would save so much mana. I swear I would rez anyone<br/>
who<br/>
&gt; helped me for free forever. Oh wait, I rez most people for free anyways. I<br/>
&gt; never ask for donations for it. I just occassionaly accept donations. If<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; person is a friend I refuse donation. And if it was a really easy rez or I<br/>
&gt; found the body or just offered to go do the rez without being asked I<br/>
refuse<br/>
&gt; donation. Which would explain why I have no money. lol. I know, I&#39;m not<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; most aggressive or best player, but I enjoy the way I play.<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>
