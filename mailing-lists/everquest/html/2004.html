Subject: [EverQuest] GAHHH!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I was playing EQ in Lower Guk and was just about to leave to camp when the<br/>
&gt; enchanter in the group went for a pull. He did not tell us to run, nor did<br/>
&gt; he warn us that he was pulling almost half the zone. I was the main<br/>
healer.<br/>
&gt; I saw him injured. So I healed him. Next thing I know, everything is on<br/>
me.<br/>
&gt; I asked the backup healer to help me. Backuphealer did nothing. I died. I<br/>
&gt; was the only one who died though bc after healing and effectively taunting<br/>
&gt; mobs off the enc, he was able to mez. Right after I repopped after dying a<br/>
&gt; system message said half an hour til downtime to patch. So, I memmed<br/>
spells<br/>
&gt; and was heading back for my corpse. 5 minutes later another system message<br/>
&gt; said &quot;Servers coming down, log out now&quot; I know this bc I did a /ti to<br/>
&gt; compare the times. So what does my group do? Rather than help me, they<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; camped and left me there. So now I probably lost all of my stuff. I wish<br/>
&gt; they wouldn&#39;t lie about how long til patch time.<br/>
&gt; Sorry, just very frustrated.<br/>
