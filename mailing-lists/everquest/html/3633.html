<div id="ygrps-yiv-415408992">From what I understand the  ports to luclin  became available on the live<br/>
servers  just recently like within the last week.<br/>
<br/>
as for Twilight Sea I&#39;ve no idea you could always bind your self near the<br/>
portal spot or zoneline and explore and see what happens<br/>

<br/>
&gt; So, how long have we druids had the ports to Luclin? I just heard<br/>
&gt; about it, learned that the spells were in my home of Rivervale, and<br/>
&gt; bought all I could use. Just wondered if this was very new, or if I<br/>
&gt; simply have had my head up my backside. Hadn&#39;t seen the vendor<br/>
&gt; before. In the back of the druid&#39;s guild in Rivervale.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone familiar with the Twilight Sea? Since I can port right there,<br/>
&gt; to the island of the elementals, I was wondering if it would be nuts<br/>
&gt; to try to solo there at lvl 33? Nice drops from those elementals, but<br/>
&gt; I may try to get a group up if the solo thing is not workable.<br/>
