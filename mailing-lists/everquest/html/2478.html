<div id="ygrps-yiv-657863252"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; getting much game time...Is really hard for this<br/>
&gt; newbie who is itching to play, play, play...Here is<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Spent the last 2+1/2 weeks on the other side of the<br/>
continent from my puter, so I can totally relate.<br/>
Neeeeeeeed mah fix... :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;but am wanting to add a couple characters to play<br/>
&gt;with when he is over at Fennin...While I am too<br/>
 </span></blockquote>afraid &gt;to play her now, I have thoughts of an<br/>
Enchanter but &gt;am also thinking of a Druid<br/>
character...I have a name <br/>
I&#39;d personally recommend the Druid for now, Enchanters<br/>
are *VERY* group dependant, whereas Druids are the<br/>
exact opposite. You&#39;re never at a loss for things to<br/>
do with a Druid, plus the ability to travel is a<br/>
luxury that&#39;s difficult to give up. (always having<br/>
SoW, porting whenever you feel like it, being able to<br/>
solo yellow and in some cases low red conning MOBs,<br/>
etc.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;for my Enchanter but am at a loss for something<br/>
 </span></blockquote>really &gt;creative for my Druid...Any suggestions on<br/>
websites &gt;for research for a name?<br/>
<br/>
By far the hardest part of the game. ;) I&#39;ve still<br/>
gotta pick last names for my Druid and Rogue...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Guess I could go to Google but I thought I<br/>
&gt;would check with you guys first.  Also, any<br/>
&gt;suggestions for a really easy quest for my Cleric? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, depends on your level range, but once you hit<br/>
the late teens, you should attempt the Testament of<br/>
Vanear quest. It&#39;s a relatively simple quest for a 10<br/>
WIS 10 mana secondary weapon slot book.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; One I might be able to do fairly easily on my own? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The only combat portion of the Testament quest is<br/>
killing Dyllan Starshine in Highpass. He&#39;s a long<br/>
camp, seven hour respawn time, but a fairly easy kill<br/>
in the high teens to low 20&#39;s. Aside from that, it&#39;s<br/>
just a quick trip to Qeynos to meet with an NPC<br/>
outside of Crow&#39;s Tavern. (the erudite in the purple<br/>
robe, forget his name) Check allakhazam.com for the<br/>
complete rundown of the quest.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have got to start learning this game on my own<br/>
&gt;instead of just doing what HE tells me to do...you<br/>
&gt;know, AUTO FOLLOW, ASSIST, Here take<br/>
&gt;this..LOL...LOL...I keep running around Freeport<br/>
&gt;afraid to go out cause I don&#39;t know if I could find<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my &gt;way back...I sound pathetic don&#39;t I?? :-)<br/>
<br/>
The quick fix for that is Bind Affinity and Gate, with<br/>
those no matter what you can always gate back to your<br/>
bind spot. Part of why I recommended the druid is that<br/>
once you get your first round of teleports, your<br/>
freedom to travel greatly increases, you can always<br/>
just port back to a druid circle you know. (if you&#39;re<br/>
parked in Freeport you&#39;ve probably seen the circle in<br/>
West Commonlands)<br/>
