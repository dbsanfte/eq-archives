I doubt there&#39;s anything a GM can do now.  Since<br/>
you&#39;ve probably looted your corpse completely, they<br/>
can&#39;t rez you for experience.  That really sucks that<br/>
they didn&#39;t get back with you, though.  How long were<br/>
you online between talking to the GM and logging out? <br/>
Because your petition gets removed from the queue when<br/>
you log off your character ... if she was still<br/>
looking into it, and you logged, there wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
been anything left for her to do because you weren&#39;t<br/>
online.<br/>
