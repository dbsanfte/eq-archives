<div id="ygrps-yiv-836415022">[Steven R. Hulse] AMEN Brother! I would have to agree, I think it would<br/>
be so cool to play EQ on Linux. Hell maybe it wouldn&#39;t hang at times!<br/>
(Due to Windows freakyness). I currently play off Win2k and it seems to<br/>
run a heck of a lot better than in 98. <br/>
And while Verant is at it, how about making a Penguin character<br/>
class!!!!<br/>
<br/>
TUX, the almighty necromancer!!!!</div>
