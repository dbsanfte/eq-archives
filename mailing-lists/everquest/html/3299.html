<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322460079">Our whole operation us run by a bunch of people who thinks its worth<br/>
shelling out some extra for the organization. We registered our own domain,<br/>
asked members who cared for a contribution and it wasnt a problem. We<br/>
developed a raid system, its fairly nice now, its like an automated workflow<br/>
system. You log in , go to the raid attendance page, sign for the<br/>
appropriate raid, mark which mobs you killed, and how many hours you played.<br/>
The system then automatically updates your raidpoints online and deducts<br/>
points if you gained loot. A message is sent to raidleader with a raid<br/>
attendance summary and here changes can be made, points added or deducted if<br/>
there are errors or inconsistensies. 5 days after finished raid the raid is<br/>
closed and archived. Old raids , mobs are searchable and loot history is<br/>
sortable on who got what and when. Its...nice. You see your % raid<br/>
attendance / month and class to see whos slacking and what classes you need<br/>
more of to keep raiding smooth. You see the total amounts of raids you could<br/>
have attended since you joined raid and how many you actually were there<br/>
for. Guild average level is calculated, aswell as there are flags on the<br/>
accounts for special things like who is officer, what keys you hold, if you<br/>
are afk, if account should be hidden when rendering member table cause of<br/>
low attendance, links to magelo profiles, mail address, contact info.<br/>
<br/>
Simply, a lot of work put into a solid system for an online community. These<br/>
kind of things I would imagine the legends service would offer (without<br/>
checking). This is something VI should offer to all, it makes larger guilds<br/>
a lot easier to manage and give you time to do what you want, play the game.<br/>

oooooo A very good point.  This sounds like a good<br/>
idea but you are actually saying another real account<br/>
for just baking?  Who shells out the REAL dollars for<br/>
that account?<br/>
<br/>
But the topic of having a friend log in with your<br/>
account for this does make sense, regardless of who<br/>
pays for it.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine being on line when some guildee says&quot;<br/>
/Guild, &quot;I need to donate 200PP to the banker, please<br/>
let me know where we can meet?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
LOL<br/>
<br/>
Banker replies, /Guild &quot;Ok, I will stop huting with<br/>
the group, Be right there.&quot;.......NOT<br/>
<br/>
Great Point Alex.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Its around the account is personal and cant be<br/>
&gt; exchanged with outhers bla<br/>
&gt; bla. I do agree very much that you shall keep your<br/>
&gt; account safe and all<br/>
&gt; this, but in a large scale operations guild its<br/>
&gt; IMPOSSIBLE to not share your<br/>
&gt; account with a few people that you trust. This is<br/>
&gt; essential to day to day<br/>
&gt; operations. You choose a couple of people who you<br/>
&gt; trust and hand them your<br/>
&gt; info.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1 example. Guild property and funding. A single<br/>
&gt; person cannot manage the<br/>
&gt; trades/funds/hand out of items for the guild. This<br/>
&gt; would be a full time job<br/>
&gt; for 1 person in my guild. Our solution is a separate<br/>
&gt; account shared among<br/>
&gt; the officers with mules for cash / gems / spells /<br/>
&gt; items. On our<br/>
&gt; messageboard transactions take place and a member<br/>
&gt; can ask any officer to<br/>
&gt; complete a transaction once its validated on board.<br/>
&gt; This is clearly against<br/>
&gt; the EULA but since there are no support for these<br/>
&gt; types of operations with a<br/>
&gt; central store for a guild we have not found a better<br/>
&gt; way to handle work like<br/>
&gt; this. How do others solve these types of problems?<br/>

&gt; Well, any exchange of accounts is forbidden by the<br/>
&gt; terms of service. Part of<br/>
&gt; the reason for this is that the person buying the<br/>
&gt; account may get swindled.<br/>
&gt; They may pay for the account only to find that the<br/>
&gt; character is deleted or<br/>
&gt; the person changes passwords on them and so forth.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve heard of this<br/>
&gt; happening. Or they may get an account that has many<br/>
&gt; soulmarks for bad<br/>
&gt; behavior. Also, people who work for Verant and EQ<br/>
&gt; have been invited to this<br/>
&gt; list. If they see the people advertising they are<br/>
&gt; selling their accounts<br/>
&gt; here, they may bust the person who is trying to sell<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>
&gt; -Su<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Since he is selling his account for Platnum (15k,<br/>
&gt; which I don&#39;t have) is<br/>
&gt; that against the rules? I thought it was just if it<br/>
&gt; was for $$$?<br/>
