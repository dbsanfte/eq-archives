<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851206163">You have to manually kick.  From the windowed view click on the combat<br/>
button.  Then click on one of the empty slots.  This should bring up a list<br/>
of available commands (kick and taunt) click on kick to select it.  Now add<br/>
the new &quot;kick&quot; button as one of your hot keys and when in combat click it<br/>
whenever it is enabled to kick...  I can&#39;t guarantee this is 100% correct as<br/>
I am at work and haven&#39;t had to do this recently but you should be able to<br/>
figure it out ;)<br/>

<br/>
I have a question regarding the Kick skill.  My ranger (10th) has supposedly<br/>
had the<br/>
kick ability since level 5.  I spend a couple of &#39;seed-points&#39; in the skill<br/>
at that<br/>
time and was hoping that it would increase like all combat skills.  It has<br/>
not.  As<br/>
an experiment, I dropped another 15 points into it, so that it is now like<br/>
17-18.  I<br/>
have NEVER successfully kicked anything.<br/>
<br/>
I recently acquired the dodge skill, spent a couple of seed points and it<br/>
has<br/>
increased to 45 with use.<br/>
<br/>
What am I doing wrong?<br/>
