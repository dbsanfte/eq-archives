<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220351800">I&#39;m not a guild leader but I have some tips.<br/>
Establish what lvl range you want your guild to be. How often you want raids<br/>
and such. Do you allow powerleving? Are any races/classes excluded?<br/>
Then play the game. If you spot someone who is guildless who you really<br/>
enjoy playing with and you think would fit well in your guild (and if they<br/>
are in the right level range) keep an eye on them. If you find that all or<br/>
most of your encounters with the person are enjoyable you might want them to<br/>
join. Some guilds have a trial or probation period in which they watch that<br/>
person and the person must be on best behavior. After the probation is up<br/>
and the person has proved to be good in the guild, their alts are allowed.<br/>
I&#39;d say a big rule of thumb is to be available in case members need to speak<br/>
to you. Especially in disciplinary matters. If someone in your guild does<br/>
something that makes your guild look bad, investigate. Find out if they are<br/>
just being jerks, or if someone is lying. There&#39;s alot of responsibility<br/>
with it. You also get to assign officers and such. And maybe plan raids.<br/>
Ok, I&#39;m babbling now so I&#39;ll shut up.<br/>
luv,<br/>
