<div id="ygrps-yiv-761545410">Hi Jennifer & Melanie!<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the world of Evercrack! er...Everquest! (If you don&#39;t know <br/>
the joke, you soon will!) Anyway, As mentioned before, definitely go <br/>
through the tutorial. You will get a nice little charm that has some <br/>
decent stats for new toons. Also depending on your class you can get a <br/>
spell. I know that Rangers get Salve (which as far as I know is the ONLY <br/>
place to get it.) Since you are new and Mel you&#39;ve came back and are <br/>
fairly new, I would avoid messing with LDoN, LoK, & OOW for right now. <br/>
As also mentioned those are for higher levels plus they have new <br/>
features and advancements that only higher levels can use. Don&#39;t worry, <br/>
you will have PLENTY of time to learn all about that stuff! They did add <br/>
some cool stuff however such as armor and weapons that you can get <br/>
through places like the Bazaar and really nice people giving you things! <br/>
If you missed the Halloween fun I&#39;m sorry, it was kind of fun. They had <br/>
a skeletal army appear after dark. They dropped some decent stuff, <br/>
(great newbie twink gear!), and the opportunity to lvl up some of your <br/>
toons was good too.<br/>
<br/>
Being former D&D players then you will have a decent understanding of <br/>
how the stats work. They are pretty similar from what I can tell. <br/>
Research your class and race preferably before you create your toon. <br/>
Placing your bonus points correctly will really help. If you already <br/>
created a toon, don&#39;t worry, you can always make up for it with gear. I <br/>
had to do that with my first. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Finally just keep in mind that there is so much to do and learn in this <br/>
game that you will be kept busy for a very long time! Ignore the rude <br/>
jerks and just have fun! I play on Solusek Ro server so if you happen to <br/>
be on there look up either Durgaa, Pistashio, Boarr, or Shizney. That&#39;s <br/>
me and I would be glad to help you guys out in any way!<br/>
<br/>
Later!</div>
