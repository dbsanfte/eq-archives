<div id="ygrps-yiv-445468958">Yeah... I&#39;d say you&#39;d get slaughtered~~~  heh.  they con blue or <br/>
yellow at 34+ plus I don&#39;t think they give that much money anyway.  <br/>
And you need good magic resist cuz they can fear you.  As for you <br/>
clerics, you just need a good group to kill these things.  I don&#39;t <br/>
know many clerics who solo anyway if that&#39;s waht you were thinking <br/>
(those that are clerics anyway).  I&#39;m sure you can do it at 35+ <br/>
though if you got a good group.<br/>
