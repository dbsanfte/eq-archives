<div id="ygrps-yiv-1627635578">From day one the chat server has always been a problem.� It was never<br/>
designed to handle more then 500 people at a time.�� Which is fine, however<br/>
the problem arises when a server ( or multiple servers ) go down.� The<br/>
Everquest client tries to immediately relog the person back into the chat<br/>
server�when the user is disconnected.��This reloggin�process jams the chat<br/>
server, while those users that have been disconnected wait restlessly for<br/>
the Server Up message.�� Meanwhile when you try to login ( or pass between<br/>
zones ) the chat server cannot validate you as a user and ceremoniously<br/>
kicks you.��We don&#39;t have to have more than one chat server, its just that<br/>
...� the chat server is an intricate part of the entire system, and its<br/>
current concept and design is limited to one�server.���<br/>
�<br/>
PS..� This is the reason I love it when they shutdown all the servers for<br/>
maintenance, instead of 3 at a time.�� They are all down then all up without<br/>
frustrating users who are simply trying hopelessly to long in.��It would be<br/>
great for�people to, when the server goes down,�simply�close out�EQ and sit<br/>
back and watch EverMon for when the server comes back�up..�=)�� ok there&#39;s<br/>
my half a cent...���<br/>

Verant should have seperate login/chat servers, or get a second login<br/>
server...<br/>
