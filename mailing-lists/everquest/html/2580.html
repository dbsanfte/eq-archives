<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Level to attain <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-611336275">It all depends on the class. For instance, my cleric has to be much higher<br/>
than the level to attain generally. Unless he is in a group with higher<br/>
levels and then he can do it below or at the level. Clerics are not good at<br/>
soloing-- at least mine isn&#39;t. But my brother&#39;s paladin could probably do<br/>
things while below the level to attain. So I think it&#39;s averaged. I sort of<br/>
think they have the level set at the level of whatever mob is involved.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; For those who use Alahkhazam, what is your take on the &quot;Level to<br/>
&gt; attain&quot; recommendation? Is it a recommendation for a group quest, or<br/>
&gt; solo? If it is a group recommendation, how much do you think it<br/>
&gt; should be bumped up for a solo quest?<br/>
