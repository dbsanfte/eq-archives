  <div><span class="ygrps-yiv-452056613008240712-01092003">Hello everyone I&#39;ve got a 
  few&nbsp;questions that I hope some of you can help me out with.&nbsp; 
  Ok&nbsp;I haven&#39;t really played LoY yet (being that I am in the navy and we 
  went to sea a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;days after it came out and I kept getting 
  booted from the game) and I had a chance to go online and check out the latest 
  EQ stuff and I saw these monster looking things that you can ride like a 
  horse.&nbsp; I was wondering what are these things and are they better than 
  having a horse?&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing I was wondering is it ture the 
  fastest horse in the game is Pegasus?&nbsp; One last thing I was wondering 
  about is that if you go to the horse stalls at the bazaar there is this 
  merchant selling various items and a couple of them caught my eye, a large bag 
  of plat and a small bag of plat both of them costing an insane amount of plat 
  with the small bag costing way more than the large... so my question is does 
  anyone know what these bags of plat are for and what they do?&nbsp; If anyone 
  can help me out in answering these questions I&#39;d appericate it.&nbsp; Happy 
  hunting!</span></div>
