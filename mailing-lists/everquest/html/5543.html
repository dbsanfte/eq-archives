        am back in school and working full time so I don&#39;t have time for all 
        my<br>hobbies.&nbsp; I was thinking of canceling my EQ account for the 
        semester and<br>picking it back up later.&nbsp; I am only 2 semester 
        from graduation (then I will<br>have a degree showing I can do what I 
        have been doing for the past 8 years).<br>How long after you cancel your 
        account will your stuff get erased?&nbsp; I would<br>hate to start back 
        up later and find all my loot was gone.&nbsp; While paying for<br>the 
        account would not break me I just hate the feeling that I am 
        wasting<br>money that could be better spent on my RC racing hobby.&nbsp; 
        Sorry, won&#39;t give<br>up RC for EQ.&nbsp; It gets me out of the house and 
        with real people, and sadly<br>is the second most physical activity I 
        engage in.<br><br>I did have another idea.&nbsp; Let a friend use the 
        account and just tell him to<br>stay off Tunare where my guys are.&nbsp; 
        While not any cheaper it would help me<br>with the &quot;waste&quot; aspect.&nbsp; 
        What happens if he is in the game and I try and<br>log in for a quick 
        game?&nbsp; Will it give me an error, kick him out, suspend<br>the 
        account, alert the Sony SWAT team?<br><br>Thanks!&nbsp; Thanks for help 
        with this in advance and for all the help I have<br>gotten 
        previously.<br><br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at
