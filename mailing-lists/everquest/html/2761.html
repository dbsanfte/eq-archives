<div id="ygrps-yiv-1897384521">Over eight pp per tusk for my druid halfling selling at home in <br/>
Rivervale. Pretty profitable and exp as well. Glad I moved to <br/>
Everfrost.<br/>
<br/>
Did snoop into Permafrost. A bit tricky to solo. Would be better with <br/>
someone to watch my back. The goblins are refreshingly stout. <br/>
Actually got chased out of the zone by a pair of hard blues. I plan <br/>
to go in after a few specific items, but it is hard to stop hunting <br/>
those mammoths. <br/>
