<div id="ygrps-yiv-454871727">Lvl 12? Man, I was lvl 40 and getting killed by those frickin&#39; little<br/>
brownies. One day I will have my revenge. You also have Equestrielle the<br/>
Corrupt (a high lvl necromancer unicorn). Biyatch harmtouched me for like<br/>
500dmg. Then there&#39;s the inky camp. I think there&#39;s a brownie camp. A faerie<br/>
camp. Orc camps.. shadow men camp.. Nybright sister&#39;s bandit camp...<br/>

&gt; Fey with my lvl12 WE Ranger, Well needless to say it was a little more<br/>
&gt; than what I was expecting! I figured by at least 12, I can very well<br/>
&gt; hold my own over there! NOT!<br/>
