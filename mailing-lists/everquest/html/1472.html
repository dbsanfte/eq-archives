<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1102130735">This reminds me.. Recently I was in a group and they refused to do alpha<br/>
loot. But I needed the xp and faction so I stayed. I was getting to loot a<br/>
little bit but then one of the members looked at my gear and suddenly<br/>
decided that I didn&#39;t &quot;need&quot; money or items bc I already had &quot;good stuff&quot;.<br/>
Nevermind that I had to work my ass off to get the money to buy the stuff<br/>
and had no money left to buy spells or better items. I don&#39;t know where he<br/>
got off. I mean, I wasn&#39;t even getting xp from most of the stuff while he<br/>
was and he would&#39;ve been dead 10 times over if I hadn&#39;t saved him by using<br/>
DDs to kill stuff before it could kill him. So he expected me to gain<br/>
nothing but faction? Such a jerk. And the worst part was, he was main healer<br/>
yet he refused to heal me when I had 1 bub of life left. He had 3 bubs of<br/>
life yet and started healing HIMSELF while I was near death. He wasn&#39;t even<br/>
getting aggrod on at the time. I was only injured so much bc I pulled some<br/>
orcs off of him so they wouldn&#39;t kill him. When I asked him nicely for a<br/>
heal he said &quot;I heal the tanks first-- and I&#39;m the only one injured&quot;. I<br/>
responded with &quot;I think I did a pretty good job of tanking&quot;. I didn&#39;t get<br/>
healed til another person who wasn&#39;t in a group ran by and stopped to heal<br/>
me.<br/>
Luckily a guildmate of mine showed up and invited me to join his group. The<br/>
jerk was left on his own and he stupidly tried to attack the entire large<br/>
orc camp (in EC) on his own. I watched him die (nothing I could do about it<br/>
really).<br/>
Oh well.. don&#39;t mind me. just rambling.<br/>
luv,<br/>

&gt; Everquest resembles real life in many ways. Just like the previous poster<br/>
&gt; said, pretend this low level character has a rich uncle. Usually when you<br/>
&gt; see a low level character in level 50 gear, they have already played this<br/>
&gt; game to level 50+ when one of their other characters and then outfit their<br/>
&gt; new character with equipment they received with their main character.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m not a core roleplayer.  And it&#39;s still sad to me to see a lower<br/>
&gt; level<br/>
&gt; with better stuff than me.  I&#39;ll get it one day so I&#39;m not envious.<br/>
&gt; I just<br/>
&gt; hate to see it.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; It isnt sad, its real life. These things happen every day, both<br/>
&gt; in-game and<br/>
&gt; outside. If you are a core roleplayer just think of it as he had a<br/>
&gt; rich<br/>
&gt; uncle. If not well, you would do it yourself if you had a chance.<br/>
&gt; Simply<br/>
&gt; nothing to moan about.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Envy wont help you one bit. Most likely hes gone through the &quot;i<br/>
&gt; killed 2000<br/>
&gt; rats and then 2000 orc pawns&quot; with another character and its not<br/>
&gt; appealing<br/>
&gt; to do it again.<br/>
