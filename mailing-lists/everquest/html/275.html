<div id="ygrps-yiv-171130623">Has anyone had any luck with teaching them to another player? I went ahead<br/>
and trained in several, and now I have 11 different languages, this includes<br/>
Common and Elf. Do you need to put more than one point in it to learn it<br/>
from someone else? Or to teach it to someone else? I grouped with someone<br/>
that wanted to work on it, so we gave it a try. Made a key that said several<br/>
lines to the group and spammed each other. I saw the blue message that your<br/>
language skills have improved several times but did not seem to see any<br/>
change in the language on the skill list. Also, when I right click to change<br/>
what language that I am talking in and click the choice to scroll threw<br/>
them, Dark Elf shows up on the list of choices, but when I look at my skill<br/>
list it is not there. Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
