<div id="ygrps-yiv-881074875">I haven&#39;t the faintest idea what modem I have lol, but until this <br/>
experience, I hadn&#39;t had one bit of trouble, even though I only have an AMD <br/>
500mhz processor, 184 mg ram, Trident Blade video card and ESS sound card. <br/>
The problem is, I used to have dsl, but we moved to take care of my dad and <br/>
his crappy little trailer is 30 years old, original wiring, including phone <br/>
wires. Oh, and Qwest, our phone company, says, that if we have a dial tone, <br/>
they won&#39;t do anything. They say they aren&#39;t required to keep the lines so <br/>
that the internet runs right, only voice is what they are required to make <br/>
run well. Bunch of Bull &%*(, I know.<br/>
<br/>
I just got off the phone with an eq tech, and he said to try downloading the <br/>
files (and I didn&#39;t mention that some files keep re-downloading) and email <br/>
him the names of them and he&#39;d email the files to me.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t get what verants prob is....DAoC works GREAT, no probs downloading, <br/>
surfing the net is a bit slow, but managable, even downloading music isn&#39;t <br/>
this big production that I need a damn tech support guy to help me do what <br/>
should be a simple task. He said DX8.1 is also required to even download <br/>
some of the files SHEESH<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and for all of you having SoL probs....he informed me that the are <br/>
&#39;working on it&#39;, that they can&#39;t do things all speedy like, cause then if <br/>
they screw up, they can&#39;t go back and fix it (say what???since when can&#39;t <br/>
you go back and fix something?) /sigh<br/>

&gt;I forgot something..<br/>
&gt;Check your cables/phone lines for kinks or damage. a simple kink or crushed<br/>
&gt;point can ruin your connection. Also clean your phone jacks but do not use<br/>
&gt;water. :-)<br/>
&gt;Sometimes just pulling out the phone line and plugging it back in to the<br/>
&gt;jack can help improve the connection.<br/>
&gt;I personally went to the trouble of getting special phone cords just for<br/>
&gt;modems. They were about $12 for 15 feet of cable. They really helped my<br/>
&gt;connection. They are much thicker than normal phone cords. There are also<br/>
&gt;some cords that have special coating to sheild them from electrical<br/>
&gt;discharge. Oh, magnets can screw up connections too. Anything with<br/>
&gt;electrical or magnetic (or both) fields can disrupt internet connections.<br/>
&gt;Radios, speakers, and fans are common culprits. Even phones have magnetism.<br/>
&gt;That is why you should never ever ever set your phone down on a floppy disk<br/>
&gt;unless you want the disk erased.<br/>
&gt;Ok, I&#39;ll shut up for real now.<br/>
&gt;luv,<br/>
