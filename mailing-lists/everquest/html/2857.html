 </span></blockquote>On my server there aren&#39;t many GM events.  Word spreads pretty fast <br/>
when there is one.  I was in Qeynos Hill during two of the undead <br/>
Invasions there and had a good time.  I have also been through <br/>
several Halloween events, though I always seem to arrive late!  <br/>
<br/>
And you are right about Guides.  I saw 4 of them and a GM just prior <br/>
to the trial in Qeynos.  Yeah, missed that one too! :(<br/>
