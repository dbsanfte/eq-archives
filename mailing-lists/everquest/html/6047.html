<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035586863"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have tried to travel, but seems my character is loved by low level<br/>
&gt; npc&#39;s and hated by the high npc&#39;s everywhere with no middle ground. I<br/>
&gt; can count on being killed 1 in 3x&#39;s I visit Qeynos--where I have high<br/>
&gt; faction with gaurds and merchants. I am only marginally liked in<br/>
&gt; Surefall Glade--my spawn point. I get killed everywhere I go--even by<br/>
&gt; single dark blue monsters. How do I correct this? Or is this normal?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well in most zones are always those monsters ready to do you in no matter <br/>
what you try to do to please them, as for cities like Qeynos and such, there <br/>
are so many factions in there its hard to make sure you have all of them <br/>
happy enough to leave you alone.  I did a lot of faction work to get the <br/>
good guards to like me and also did the Badge of Qeynos quests but forgot to <br/>
watch my standing with the corrupted guards till it was too late.  By the <br/>
time I did realize they hated me I didn&#39;t really care....they were green <br/>
cons and wisely ignored me.  But then I learned there was one who would not <br/>
ignore me, when i got Harmtouched for over 700.  Mind you that wasnt that <br/>
big a chunk of my life but being ambushed he got a full 50% of my life <br/>
before I could react.  I still think there are claw marks on the streets <br/>
heading out the gates to the PoK book.  For all you can do there will be <br/>
lots of places that hate you and lots that like you and plenty that are a <br/>
mixed crowd.  All you can really do is pay attention to all mobs in a city <br/>
you find.  If you need help working on some faction just ask and someone <br/>
here should know the best way to go about raising it, just remember when you <br/>
raise one often you lower another, make sure the one lowered you don&#39;t care <br/>
for anyway.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I leveled twice yesterday! Back to lvl 19. I love playing this guy,<br/>
&gt; but I want to be able to roam a little. I think I will build another<br/>
&gt; character using the knowledge I have aquired over the last couple of<br/>
&gt; weeks. I have been reading and asking a lot of questions. Any advice<br/>
&gt; you guys have on a new hef rgr for me will be greatly appreciated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am also thinking of building a gnome...well maybe later.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Gnomes are fun I hear, as for leveling they created &quot;hot zones&quot; where xp is <br/>
boosted.  To find out where I&#39;d say write down the zones when they change as <br/>
for the currrent hot zones check out www.everquest.com and look at the <br/>
&quot;recent updates&quot; area and select the December 15th patch mesage.  Thats the <br/>
latest list of hot zones.  Oh and about a gnome....they are the shortest <br/>
race in the game so expect to be watching things from between peoples legs. <br/>
Playing my dwarf pally recently its hard to manuver between 2 barbarian guys <br/>
to reach the mob, I tend to get pushed back when the mob gets pushed away <br/>
and they close the gap by bunching up (dang oversized slabs of meat.) <br/>
