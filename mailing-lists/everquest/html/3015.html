	<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://matt.waggoner.com/orbofmastery.html">http://matt.waggoner.com/orbofmastery.html</a><br/>
for some stats about the pet and the orb (and the walkthrough)<br/>
<br/>
to quote this site (close to &quot;- QUEST RUNDOWN -&quot;):<br/>
According to Chris Babb, the epic pet always hits for max 67, is always <br/>
level 49, has a DD attack for 160 damage and a 6 second stun, has 2500hp <br/>
and a 50 point damage shield. If anyone else can confirm these numbers, <br/>
that would be great.<br/>
<br/>
besides, for the epic walthrough i prefer<br/>

one hint for young mages, if you really want to go for the epic: start<br/>
as soon as possible to gather the information needed. some parts can<br/>
be obtained very early (like 25 to 30 for the focus items) and it is<br/>
quite a waste of time, to go to those places 20 levels later to camp<br/>
green stuff. but to actually do this quest, most will be over 55 until<br/>
they finished it ... if they finish it at all.<br/>
<br/>
for me it is five items to go:<br/>
  - Torch of Elements, Neh&#39;Ashirr, City of Mist<br/>
  - Blazing Wand, Undertow, Kedge Keep<br/>
  - Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth, Magi P&#39;tasa, Hate<br/>
  - Staff of Elemental Mastery: Water, Phinigel Autropos, Kedge Keep<br/>
  - Crown of Elemental Mastery, ?random drop?, Air<br/>
<br/>
with the &quot;crown&quot; the only dropable item, but i can&#39;t afford 30k to 60k<br/>
to buy one. CoM and Kedge sound possible with a small group, but what<br/>
i read about the drop rate makes me sick. hate ... well, it is hate.<br/>
<br/>
i have been on air up to spiroc isle. it will be very interesting if i<br/>
ever get to the 8th (or 7th, depends on how you count) isle. but there<br/>
are other things to do first.<br/>
