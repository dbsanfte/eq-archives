<div id="ygrps-yiv-1474852771">Change is always great unless you are the one who is<br/>
on the losing end of the curve. I know it is easy to<br/>
think that &#39;they don&#39;t need to change&#39; and they will<br/>
do just fine. Sadly ... that is not how any succeful<br/>
compapy grows. Its frustration thinking &#39;I bought this<br/>
game and now I cannot even use it anymore.&#39; I did<br/>
upgrade over the required limits ... and I know other<br/>
people cannot and Im sorry that happens. Honest ...<br/>
 BUT .. technology changes and companies have to grow<br/>
with it. Last time I looked the 8 track player is no<br/>
longer supported nor reel to reel tape. Am radio still<br/>
exist but is not a serious market. Beta lost out to<br/>
VCR&#39;s and DVD not laser disk is the current standard.<br/>
Each had a loyal customer base and many resented and<br/>
hated the change over. Anyone know of any successful<br/>
companies that said .... NO ,, sorry .. we are not<br/>
changing nor upgrading to the new standards? I know a<br/>
few that got washed out of the market trying to do<br/>
that but none that succeded. <br/>
 So I guess the question is are we debating whats best<br/>
for the individual ... non upgradable ... customers or<br/>
for the EQ base now and in the near future. I hate the<br/>
lose of one player and fellow adventurer because of<br/>
changing standards. I would hate MORE for EQ to fall<br/>
behind industry standards and ALL of use lose this<br/>
game we love so much. Yes you can add more zones and<br/>
change things around but if the technology gets too<br/>
behind the curve we all lose out. Its one of the<br/>
hateful things about computers .. they change and grow<br/>
very quickly. Technology seldom lasts 3 years before<br/>
being outmoded to almost a non suppost level. It sucks<br/>
.. yea ... but it IS THAT WAY. I upgraded my computer<br/>
to give the old RAM &lt;256&gt; and VID CARD to my EQ<br/>
partner in crime. I am seeing friends and guild<br/>
members not getting on cause of the chages .. and some<br/>
<br/>
of the changes I do not like myself. However, I know<br/>
that growth is good and not everything will be as a<br/>
few people want it. So we grow with it ... or accept<br/>
the change and move on to other things. Yes ... I to<br/>
would complain if I got left behind. I would hope the<br/>
game would go on rather than die out in a backwater<br/>
attempt to hold back the changes they can be leading.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Re: [EverQuest] I hate Shadows of Luclin<br/>
&gt; and I don&#39;t even own it<br/>
&gt; yet...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not saying they shouldn&#39;t change at all, but I<br/>
&gt; think they should try to<br/>
&gt; consider their current customer base and what<br/>
&gt; systems they have before<br/>
&gt; making drastic changes. Look at Sims. They make<br/>
&gt; expansion packs but they<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t require you to change your system everytime a<br/>
&gt; new expansion comes out.<br/>
&gt; Considering how addictive EQ is, even without the<br/>
&gt; new graphics engines<br/>
&gt; people would still be playing. They could still add<br/>
&gt; to the game by making<br/>
&gt; new zones and such without requiring a change in<br/>
&gt; directx programs. They<br/>
&gt; could find other ways to make the game better<br/>
&gt; without changing the system<br/>
&gt; requirements so drastically. What if they expanded<br/>
&gt; the game one day and<br/>
&gt; changed the system requirements to the point that<br/>
&gt; you could not afford to<br/>
&gt; upgrade? What then? Would you be a happy camper?<br/>
&gt; While verant may be getting<br/>
&gt; a few more customers who can handle the higher end<br/>
&gt; requirements, they are<br/>
&gt; alienating older customers with lower end systems.<br/>
&gt; In the long run, that<br/>
&gt; kind of attitude toward customers is bad for<br/>
&gt; business. If Verant doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; give a fuck about their current customers then they<br/>
&gt; will start to lose<br/>
&gt; business. If I were the VP I would find some way so<br/>
&gt; that there would be some<br/>
&gt; servers set aside so that the lower end systems<br/>
&gt; could still play on them--<br/>
&gt; which is what the GMs have been suggesting. And I<br/>
&gt; certainly wouldn&#39;t release<br/>
&gt; a game full of bugs before it had been fully tested.<br/>
&gt; I would also have<br/>
&gt; research done and surveys to find out just how many<br/>
&gt; people would no longer<br/>
&gt; be able to play with their current systems and<br/>
&gt; factor that into my decision<br/>
&gt; on what types of changes could be made without<br/>
&gt; alienating a large customer<br/>
&gt; base. Change is important in some regard, but so is<br/>
&gt; reliability and<br/>
&gt; integrity. So far, Verant seems to be lacking the<br/>
&gt; latter two. -Su<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; As a paying customer, I do not want EQ to just<br/>
&gt; survive. I want EQ to<br/>
&gt; strive<br/>
&gt; &gt; to be the best game available. No one wants to<br/>
&gt; play a so-so game. I <br/>
&gt; &gt; can guarantee you, EQ would not be afloat if they<br/>
&gt; had not made any or <br/>
&gt; &gt; even a<br/>
&gt; few<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the upgrades / expansions they have done. I<br/>
&gt; would hate to think of <br/>
&gt; &gt; 3 years of EQ with no upgrades or expansions. Do<br/>
&gt; you honestly think EQ <br/>
&gt; &gt; would still be played to today if it were still<br/>
&gt; the original EQ of 3 <br/>
&gt; &gt; years ago? NOWAY ! EQ would be around right now.<br/>
&gt; But since Verant <br/>
&gt; &gt; choose to continue<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; grow, they still have a strong player base. Sure,<br/>
&gt; some might quit due <br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; new requirements, but it is better than being out<br/>
&gt; of business if <br/>
&gt; &gt; they&#39;d<br/>
&gt; sat<br/>
&gt; &gt; on their ass and count the money for the first 1<br/>
&gt; year.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thank God Su was not a VP at Verant at the time of<br/>
&gt; EverQuest release <br/>
&gt; &gt; or<br/>
&gt; we&#39;d<br/>
&gt; &gt; be lining up to kill Vox and Naggy for the<br/>
&gt; 1,000,000th time.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t really want Verant to waste my $9.95 a<br/>
&gt; month trying to figure <br/>
&gt; &gt; out<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; way for DirectX8 to work on your 8 MB video card<br/>
&gt; or your neighbors <br/>
&gt; &gt; WIN95 system. I hope they spend my monthly service<br/>
&gt; fee making the game <br/>
&gt; &gt; better. I hope they keep upgrading the EQ world.<br/>
&gt; You notice, this is <br/>
&gt; &gt; the exact opposite things you want. Change is good<br/>
&gt; when it comes in <br/>
&gt; &gt; the form of an upgrade :-) I think that for every<br/>
&gt; person that quits EQ <br/>
&gt; &gt; because of the new requirements, they keep 2<br/>
&gt; people playing for months <br/>
&gt; &gt; longer by making the more enjoyable. People will<br/>
&gt; and do quit after <br/>
&gt; &gt; doing everything there is to do in EQ.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It is crazy for people to think that a company<br/>
&gt; should hold back and <br/>
&gt; &gt; try<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; to be the best game out on the market. As time<br/>
&gt; goes on the bar that <br/>
&gt; &gt; games get measured on will continue to grow. As it<br/>
&gt; grows, new <br/>
&gt; &gt; requirements are<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; an option, but a necessity, a must. Once Verant<br/>
&gt; knew the release of<br/>
&gt; DirectX<br/>
&gt; &gt; 8, they knew that they MUST use DirectX8 if they<br/>
&gt; wanted to continue to<br/>
&gt; move<br/>
&gt; &gt; forward and strive to be the best game out on the<br/>
&gt; market. As a paying <br/>
&gt; &gt; customer, (some paying more than others) you would<br/>
&gt; have to be crazy <br/>
&gt; &gt; not to want the same thing. I love the new<br/>
&gt; graphics and sure, I had to <br/>
&gt; &gt; do some upgrading, but damn, look at the zones<br/>
&gt; today compared to 3 <br/>
&gt; &gt; years ago, what<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; change.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I guess you really don&#39;t understand Su, these<br/>
&gt; changes are really not <br/>
&gt; &gt; for<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; fun of it or for show. They are a must. The vast<br/>
&gt; majority of Verant&#39;s <br/>
&gt; &gt; customer base demands that Verant provides the<br/>
&gt; best game possible. The<br/>
&gt; best<br/>
&gt; &gt; graphics, the best detail, the best way to<br/>
&gt; interact with the fellow<br/>
&gt; players,<br/>
&gt; &gt; the best dynamic role playing world and the best<br/>
&gt; customer service. Do <br/>
&gt; &gt; I think Verant is the best at all these? No, but<br/>
&gt; atleast I know they <br/>
&gt; &gt; are striving to be the best. Verant knew that<br/>
&gt; without DirectX8, they <br/>
&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; the best for long. As time goes on, all the best<br/>
&gt; games will be running <br/>
&gt; &gt; the current DirectX.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; SoL left 2 out 3 of my household computers<br/>
&gt; unplayable. My son, who <br/>
&gt; &gt; also plays EQ, doesn&#39;t have a playable computer<br/>
&gt; now. Even though <br/>
&gt; &gt; Verant might have released SoL a little early and<br/>
&gt; untested, I am happy <br/>
&gt; &gt; they released<br/>
&gt; when<br/>
&gt; &gt; they did, just before Christmas. Perfect timing<br/>
&gt; for the many people <br/>
&gt; &gt; that will ask their parents, spouses,<br/>
&gt; grandparents, aunts and uncles ( <br/>
&gt; &gt; Mu,<br/>
&gt; Chase<br/>
&gt; &gt; needs another stick of RAM for Christmas ) for<br/>
&gt; their upgrades. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Computers<br/>
&gt; get<br/>
&gt; &gt; outdated just like games do and if expect to play<br/>
&gt; the most popular <br/>
&gt; &gt; games, you&#39;ll have to keep your machine updated.<br/>
&gt; Just be thankful <br/>
