<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877185325">I didn&#39;t see what could be upsetting about the posts<br/>
in that thread, but I work as a consultant... as bad<br/>
as working in a jail in some ways.<br/>
<br/>
I think for the most part folks should take a chill<br/>
pill and learn to appreciate differences of opinion<br/>
(diversity).  If one can&#39;t handle that, then leaving<br/>
the forum is an OK option too.<br/>

&gt; As it is, I find this group generally quite fine.<br/>
&gt; Then again, I have <br/>
&gt; worked in a jail for the past thirteen years. My<br/>
&gt; skin is a bit thick<br/>
&gt; As is my head, obviously, if I haven&#39;t found a<br/>
&gt; better way to earn a <br/>
&gt; living than working in a jail.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Days off are good, though. Lots of gaming time.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I am posting to tell Su that this is AGAIN my<br/>
&gt; last post. I left <br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; group once before because of idiotic members who<br/>
&gt; insisted on <br/>
&gt; forcing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; their opinions apon others, and I will not put<br/>
&gt; up with it. I have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; better things to do with my time then spend it<br/>
&gt; with opinionated <br/>
&gt; low<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lifes. Su, I&#39;m sorry for everything, none of<br/>
&gt; this goes to you, I <br/>
&gt; know<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you tired, but there are just too many morons to<br/>
&gt; filter out of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; group. To the rest of you, you will never get<br/>
&gt; anywhere in life <br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the attitudes you have. Only in a fantasy game<br/>
&gt; like EverQuest will<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you ever be something. But at some point you<br/>
&gt; need to grow up and <br/>
&gt; face<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; reality, and it&#39;s not going to be fun or easy<br/>
&gt; when you do. Do not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bother replying to this post. Leave your fights<br/>
&gt; and comments out <br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Su&#39;s group and for once in your life respect her<br/>
&gt; wishes and be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; CONSIDERATE. If you forgot what that word means,<br/>
&gt; get a <br/>
&gt; dictionary. If<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you MUST comment, e-mail me personally, but I<br/>
&gt; most likely will <br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; delete the message. Like I said, I have better<br/>
&gt; things to do. Good<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; day.  <br/>
