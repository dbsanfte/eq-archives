<div id="ygrps-yiv-974280611">heres a short description.<br/>
<br/>
if you use any of the filtering options like others damage off, npc spells<br/>
off, my misses or whatever you should use /serverfilter on to prevent the<br/>
server from sending this data to your client. else this info gets propagated<br/>
over your (possibly very thin) wire and flood your pc with things that the<br/>
client itself discards as you choose to filter that info out. This helps ...<br/>
a lot in raid situations with 30+ people and low bandwidth users.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if youre on dsl or any other (relatively) highspeed<br/>
connection the file datarate.txt in your eq directory is set wrong. Its<br/>
tuned by verant for a modem user. What this file does is preventing the<br/>
server from overloading your client with too much data causing linkdeaths<br/>
when you can no longer recieve enough info, this tends to happen when zoning<br/>
or when someone uses a lag intensive spell (sentinel, ae rains and so on).<br/>
The Verant setting is 5.0 in the file. If youre on dsl turn this up to 9.0<br/>
(max)<br/>
<br/>
This will reduce the lag you get by letting your client recieve more updates<br/>
since you have more bandwidth. this will make you much more responsive and<br/>
not having a nasty 30 secs msglag when someone is asking for a heal or a<br/>
buff or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
More is in the manual or on the everquest messageboards at everquest.com.<br/>
Read the technical information.<br/>

you need to fiddle around with the user interface some to understand how it<br/>
works. Most things are reachable through /commands in the chat bar. try<br/>
/help and read some.<br/>
<br/>
You also have a hot key bank, you need to assign skills to buttons and<br/>
probably you will want put the button in your hot-key bank. try to structure<br/>
it early into types of banks. Combat, traveling and so on. find a system<br/>
that suits you. <br/>
<br/>
If you want to delve into the more advanced commands then maybe perhaps<br/>
affix sense heading to your slam button or something like that. This will<br/>
max out Sense heading very fast. Or filter out your hits out of the chatbox,<br/>
this gets annoying fast when you got double attack and dual wield. hard to<br/>
read things then.<br/>
<br/>
There are many many things that makes the ui better, there is no set way of<br/>
whats good and bad just preference. IT also varies as yo pass through<br/>
levels. <br/>
<br/>
If you like to raid a lot and are playing in large groups, remember<br/>
serverfilter is your friend and DONT forget to set your datarate.txt to<br/>
appropriate value. Your friends will love it even more than you not having<br/>
to wait for ld people all the time. <br/>
<br/>
But I think you have some learning to do before this, keep it up.<br/>
Experiment, learn. dont just take it from everyone else.<br/>
