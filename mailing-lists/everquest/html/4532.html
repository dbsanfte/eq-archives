<div><font face="Arial" size="2">You can try all of that stuff, but I would think 
it&#39;s your CPU and video card that&#39;s hampering you more than anything.&nbsp; I 
ran EQ on a PII 333mhz with an 8MB video card and 8MB accelerator while I was in 
Japan.&nbsp; It was slow as molasses.&nbsp; No matter how many options I turned 
off.&nbsp; I noticed moderately better performance once I upgraded the video 
card.&nbsp; Even on my PIII 800 with 640MB of RAM itwould run everything but 
Luclin.&nbsp; Then I upgraded the video card to 128MB and it ran 
fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you really want to improve performance, upgrade your video 
card if at all possible.&nbsp; It can sometimes compensate for a slower 
processor.</font></div>

  zoning</div>
  <div><br></div><tt>Thank you very much indeed to everyone who has responded so 
  far. I <br>have tweaked the datarate to 7.0 and switched on the caching to see 
  <br>if that makes much difference.<br><br>We have the basic New Dawn with the 
  Planes of Power expansion. The <br>Options screen however states &quot;Luclin 
  Options&quot; - I don&#39;t know why.<br><br>As for the PC - maximum RAM capacity is 
  384MB and that is what is <br>installed.&nbsp; There is 50Gb free on the hard 
  disk. I have noticed that <br>while loading and zoning however, the hard disk 
  light is always on <br>meaning it is doing alot of work. I suppose this would 
  be the case as <br>it is loading alot from the hard disk.<br><br>Performance 
  within a zone seems fine on the whole,it is just initial <br>loading and in 
  particular the zoning times. Very often, after waiting <br>5 minutes, it 
  simply gives up and goes back to the server screen - <br>very 
  frustrating!<br><br>The only other components that could be awapped are the 
  hard disk <br>controller - but I really don&#39;t see that making much difference 
  since <br>it is working fine, and the video controller - which is a nVidia 
  Riva <br>TNT with just 16Mb RAM. We are running DirectX 9.<br><br>Thanks very 
  much again for all of your suggestions, and I would be <br>grateful for 
  anytthing else you can suggest.<br><br>Best regards.<br><br><br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit
