<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-958206580">I have the latest drivers. I upgrade regularly. I discovered that alot of the problems I was experiencing were bugs on the serverside. Alot of people were having the same problems. I think some of the patches cleared up some of the problems. I also have the problem that while I have alot of RAM, I have a modem that requires specific software to be run on my computer plus my computer is the server for the network. So I have to run my ISPs software, plus the network, plus the browsers I keep open to look up info while I&#39;m playing EQ. I can actually run 2 EQ Windows on my computer. It&#39;s a tad slower than one window and I get a message that I&#39;m out of virtual memory, but it still works.<br/>
When I upgrade my modem to the new direcway model that runs the software itself and doesn&#39;t need the comp to connect I will probably have more RAM.<br/>
I got the directx 9 upgrade when my sister installed Star Wars Galaxies on my computer. That game sucks.<br/>
Thanks for the suggestion! And sorry I took so long to reply. Been playing EQ alot more.<br/>
Got my cleric to lvl 62! :-)<br/>

Before buying a new video card as someone else suggested, I would <br/>
try installing the new 56.64 drivers from NVIDIA first. Your card is <br/>
not that old. It&#39;s part of the GeForce4 series which is one series <br/>
before GeForce FX (in case anyone didn&#39;t know). The 56.64 drivers <br/>
support your card. Also, to reduce headaches, set a restore point <br/>
before upgrading the video drivers. I prefer to uninstall and re-<br/>
install drivers in Safe Mode. In this way, you&#39;re sure the system <br/>
isn&#39;t using any of the driver files.<br/>
<br/>
If you look at SOE&#39;s required specs (forget recommended specs), I <br/>
believe that your system meets or exceeds their requirements.<br/>

And, this is SOE&#39;s guide to the DirectX 9.0b upgrade: <br/>
