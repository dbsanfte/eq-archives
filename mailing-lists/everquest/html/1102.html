<div id="ygrps-yiv-603451097">I&#39;m running a Celeron 533, 185 Meg, with Win ME and a cable modem.  I&#39;ve<br/>
set that Everquest datarate to 9.0, but it still seems to take just as long<br/>
to zone as it did before my cable modem, when I was still using dial up.<br/>
<br/>
Is it my computer?  It helps when you zone from a PKer, and not have them<br/>
standing there waiting for you on the other side. LOL</div>
