<b>Subject:</b> SK Gnolls <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-957896481">I was hunting the gnolls at the Spires in SK when I learned something <br/>
about them which others may find useful.<br/>
<br/>
My current technique for gnolling is to find one by himself, and hit <br/>
him with Creeping Crud. That dot gets his attention, and begins doing <br/>
damage. I then begin running away from the Spires, to get some <br/>
distance from any possible gnoll back-up. Once I have the distance I <br/>
want, I root him and hit him with another dot, Incinerate in this <br/>
case. I then rest to regain mana. I will run, root, and dot him until <br/>
dead. With luck I have enough mana left to rest only a short time <br/>
before I go get another.<br/>
<br/>
I was talking with my son-in-law while taking one gnoll, and rooted <br/>
the thing at the spire rather than pulling him away. I guess I was <br/>
distracted. A second gnoll came along and agroed on me, driving me <br/>
away. I knew I did not have the mana to manage both, so ran south for <br/>
Lake Raithtear. I reached the zone well ahead of them. I rested to <br/>
full capacity, with no gnolls in sight. Didn&#39;t even zone.<br/>
<br/>
I went back to get some more gnolls, but found someone camping the <br/>
spire I had been working. I started to leave, honoring his claim to <br/>
an abandoned camp, when a gnoll hit me from behind. I lead him on a <br/>
fatal chase. The camper sent a tell regarding a perceived violation <br/>
of camp courtesy, for which I appologized.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that the gnolls will abandon a chase after some time and <br/>
distance, but remember you well. The second gnoll I had been involved <br/>
with agroed on me from a considerable distance from the Spires. <br/>
<br/>
So, gnoll hunters, keep in mind that an injured gnoll has a long <br/>
memory, and even longer agro range.<br/>
