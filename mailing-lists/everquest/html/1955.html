<div id="ygrps-yiv-493769471">Might be because they havent fixed all the graphic problems yet.  I have an<br/>
1.8Mhz system and most of the game runs slick.  Some zones like the Oasis is<br/>
really laggy at times.. (like trying to run through some thick soup) They<br/>
mention today that there was a bug that caused lag when you had your<br/>
particle effects off, of all things.  Not sure what the problem is but give<br/>
them a few days to figure it out.. They are still iorning out some of the<br/>
visible lag related issues.<br/>
<br/>
If ya can.. Post more of the equipment you have.. More information to work<br/>
with.<br/>
