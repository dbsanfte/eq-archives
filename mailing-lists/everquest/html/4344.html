expansion? I don&#39;t have that yet, so maybe that has something to do <br/>
with it...<br/>

I was half remembering a discussion about a question that someone <br/>
had asked The Screen Savers on cable. The original Gold Box version <br/>
of Everquest was said to have differences from the newer Everquest <br/>
Classic. I think that the first version was said to have been <br/>
developed for use directly between two computers in a network or <br/>
over a phone instead of through a paid game server.<br/>
<br/>
I have Everquest Trilogy installed plus the Shadows of Luclin <br/>
expansion pack. I just got into all of this last week. I bought the <br/>
expansion pack first because I liked the kitties. Then I bought the <br/>
Everquest Trilogy so that I could use the expansion pack. G. I have <br/>
no regrets. My only complaint is that I can&#39;t stop playing once I <br/>
start. I love this game.<br/>
