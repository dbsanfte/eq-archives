<div id="ygrps-yiv-1084908837">When the weather is better and I have a stable &#39;net connection I&#39;ll try<br/>
another dungeon crawl. As it is I have failed 4 or 5 times because of<br/>
running out of time.<br/>
The first dungeon crawl I did we made over 100pp each. Second one I got a<br/>
wisdom augmentation stone. Even though we didn&#39;t succeed we still had fun.<br/>
I hope that I can get grouped with some guildies sometime though.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I have been in a couple of guild adventures.  It&#39;s not too hard to<br/>
&gt; get 6 guildies together, but not all the time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And the main idea of all these adventures is to get to the named mob,<br/>
&gt; because that is where the big drop is.  Rangers and Druids have<br/>
&gt; track, so once again we have a use.  And that snare helps too when<br/>
&gt; they go for friends!<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;m a level 41 Half Elf Druid.  Like you, I have soloed most of my<br/>
&gt; life.  What I have found about LDoN is, true you have to group.  But<br/>
&gt; the organization is there, so that the groups constantly change.<br/>
&gt; Most often I am asked to join by putting my LFG flag up.  The<br/>
&gt; adventures are short, 2 hrs and have a specific goal to obtain.  The<br/>
&gt; exp is great, typically half a level per adventure.  We druids are<br/>
&gt; popular for our regen buff and healing, and have counteract poison up<br/>
&gt; if someone&#39;s gonna play with the crates.  You can save yourself in<br/>
&gt; time if your fast.  Then, after 2 hrs, you split the loot, typically<br/>
&gt; 50 - 80 plat your share, and go back to soloing.  I thought it was<br/>
&gt; more for guilds as well, but have yet to see a group of all one<br/>
&gt; guild.  I am typically quiet (I type slow, hehe) but so much goes on<br/>
&gt; so fast, that nobody seems to mind.<br/>

&gt; &gt;   I am a lvl 41 Halfling Druid. Haven&#39;t purchased LDoN yet, as I<br/>
&gt; most<br/>
&gt; &gt;   often play solo and don&#39;t know that I would use it. Have<br/>
&gt; everything up<br/>
&gt; &gt;   to this expansion, but am not convinced that it is worthwhile.<br/>
&gt; Sounds<br/>
&gt; &gt;   very nice, but I have had two guilds I have been a part of fade<br/>
&gt; away,<br/>
&gt; &gt;   and this sounds like something best suited to guilds.<br/>
