<div id="ygrps-yiv-1912627086"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; I agree with you there. I can see losing the exp, but I hate trying<br/>
&gt; &gt; to find my corpse and get all my gear back. I got slapped last night<br/>
&gt; &gt; by Choon (which conned white to me) so I thought I could kill him.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Died about a minute later and paid heck trying to find my corpse.<br/>
&gt; Yes, it would make me VERY happy if they would get rid of that part... the<br/>
&gt; searching for the corpse.<br/>
&gt; Side note though... has anyone noticed that the higher level you are,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>there<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is a difference in what cons you can kill? For example, when you start off<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it&#39;s<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; usually not to hard to kill things that con white but as you get up in lvl<br/>
&gt; sometimes even things that con blue can be hard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. The higher up you go sometimes even greens can kill you if you happen<br/>
to get unlucky. My main can&#39;t even solo a light blue if he can&#39;t get spells<br/>
off. Hell, at lvl 52 he got owned by Kizdean Gix in West Commons (well,<br/>
almost owned, had to run tot he zone) bc the little fucker resisted all of<br/>
my stuns and nukes, broke free of root less than a second after it was cast,<br/>
and interrupted all my spells even when he missed me. The higher level you<br/>
get the more you run into mobs that have more HP/AC and abilities than a<br/>
player of the same level. Like lvl 40 enchanter mobs with 3k hp.<br/>
