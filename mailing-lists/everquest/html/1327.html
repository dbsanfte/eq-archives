<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714300755">Heh...that would be one guy I&#39;d never group with again.<br/>
<br/>
and I don&#39;t understand the term &quot;ffa&quot;<br/>
<br/>
alpha looting is okay in my opinion...<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;d like to have happen is that one person with a lot of bags loot<br/>
everything and then at the end of the battle he /split p g s c for the rest<br/>
of the group<br/>
but then that would include a bunch of trust...<br/>
<br/>
and then he calls off everything he&#39;d looted while we were grouped...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
then again...you really have to trust someone a bunch....<br/>

&gt; Subject:	[EverQuest] About loot order<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Recently in some of the groups I&#39;ve been in, we&#39;ve had a few problems with<br/>
&gt; loot order. Often, the tanks will insist on FFA. But since I play the main<br/>
&gt; healer and am expected to sit and med (only getting up to heal) I get<br/>
&gt; totally screwed. I never get loot. But then when we try to establish alpha<br/>
&gt; loot some people complain. They don&#39;t care about the casters. All they<br/>
&gt; care<br/>
&gt; about is getting loot for themselves. These people partake in<br/>
&gt; &quot;ninja-looting&quot;. They loot everything really fast so nobody else gets a<br/>
&gt; chance. And even when we establish a regular loot order some people will<br/>
&gt; still loot out of turn.<br/>
&gt; And then we have times when people say we roll for certain types of loot.<br/>
&gt; When I first joined a group, this one guy told me it was ffa (and he was a<br/>
&gt; ninja-looter) but that &quot;bronze&quot; and ore were rolled for. I saw that he<br/>
&gt; picked up an FS morning star and wanted to roll for it (bc it&#39;s an<br/>
&gt; expensive<br/>
&gt; item). He said no, it was only for bronze, not FS. So later he picked up a<br/>
&gt; bronze weapon. I said, &quot;ok, let&#39;s roll for it&quot;. He said, &quot;no, that&#39;s only<br/>
&gt; for bronze armor&quot;...<br/>
&gt; Has anyone else had this problem?<br/>
&gt; What do you think is the best and fairest loot order?<br/>
&gt; Just wondering.<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>
&gt; -Su<br/>
&gt; ps. alpha loot with 3 loots per turn (per person) works pretty well when<br/>
&gt; people cooperate.<br/>
