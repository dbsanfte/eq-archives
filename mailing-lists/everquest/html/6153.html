<div id="ygrps-yiv-17924541">Well, it hadn&#39;t even been a month... So I shouldn&#39;t have to worry about that. I guess I can&#39;t blame Sony too much. It&#39;s my Discover card being retarded again.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Well, I had to resubscribe at a higher price to get<br/>
&gt;&gt; my account back but I got it back. I haven&#39;t logged<br/>
&gt;&gt; in to see my characters yet though. I was still a<br/>
&gt;&gt; bit irritated when I finally got it fixed.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Sony&#39;s customer service is really lacking these<br/>
&gt;&gt; days. I mean, it wasn&#39;t always the best but it has<br/>
&gt;&gt; really deteriorated.<br/>
