&gt; a) Why?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Blatent flaming.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sure, *you* are flaming, but the original poster flamed no-one... just<br/>
made a simple request to interview an EQ player for a TV program... How<br/>
is that either Flaming or Trolling?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; b) Try to avoid top posting... makes it harder to follow threads<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s what I ususally do, if I&#39;m replying like I am now I reply like I<br/>
&gt; am right now though.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmm, seems you haven&#39;t got your mail reader set up to indicate quoted<br/>
material in a plai-text email... perhaps you could set it up so that you<br/>
conform to the established standard of indenting quoted text with a &gt;<br/>
... makes it easiet to follow who said what.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; c) More likely he will be unable to get an EQ &#39;addict&#39; to drag<br/>
&gt; themselves away from the computer long enough to be interviewed...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yeah.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And like Vash says, why do they only attack everquest, because it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; the most popular.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Where did he attack EQ? You are *assuming* that the TV program will<br/>
focus on the recent news stories regarding EQ, but you, as yet, have<br/>
nothing to base that claim on.<br/>
