<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815750003">Hello all, im glad to see that theres a group for those of us that <br/>
play EQ.  Just thought id tell you all a little about myself,  Im 42 <br/>
yr old male, Ive been playing sense 1999,  I started on the TT server <br/>
but now is the prexus sense tt and prexus merged. I have a son and a <br/>
daughter , my son is 18  and my daughter just turned 21.  I am <br/>
currently in my 2nd semester back in college as my children have <br/>
grown.  Now a little about my eq , i have 3 accts  only because each <br/>
of my children played (we play alot as a family), currently im only <br/>
playing the one but i do 2 box at times when im in need of a healer or <br/>
slower.  my favorate character is my 70 mage,  we are currently <br/>
exploring and doing aa exp  in the new expansion zones. Well i hope i <br/>
havent bored you all,  it will be great sharing my eq exp with you <br/>
all, and asking for help also at times when im in need.  God speed to <br/>
all of you in your journeys.<br/>
<br/>
PEACE</div>
