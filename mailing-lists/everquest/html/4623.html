<div id="ygrps-yiv-1896002798">Personally I would head over to North RO if you are<br/>
around level 10.  There are two good Derv camps there<br/>
which give good exp.  You can then head to Oasis 12+<br/>
but some roaming mobs are a bit nasty, like IceBone or<br/>
Drybone Skelies, for got the exact name now, and not<br/>
to mention the Sand GIant here or there but the Orc<br/>
Highway is a great place to learn how to group<br/>
effectively.<br/>
<br/>
I would not recommend Paludal Caverns before 16.  Most<br/>
won&#39;t want you and soloing will be rough.  However, at<br/>
16, this is the best place by far for exp up until 25.<br/>
<br/>
After 25 you could get a partner or small group and do<br/>
Unrest or Aviaks in South Karana.  From 25-35 the High<br/>
Keep is a good place but gets rather full fast. <br/>
Around 33+ you can go to the Overthere and get into a<br/>
group at either the Sky zone or the Ledge which is at<br/>
the FM zone.  (Please see Eqatlas.com for<br/>
abbreviations)<br/>
<br/>
You can fight in the Overthere till 38-40 and after<br/>
that you can go to Dreadlands.<br/>
<br/>
good luck<br/>
<br/>
