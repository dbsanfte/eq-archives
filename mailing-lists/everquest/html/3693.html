&gt;      I need help from any of you High End gamers.  My guild is <br/>
quickly growing,  and starting to do Higher level raids.  Many of our <br/>
members have not had much experience raiding, so we have been <br/>
doing &quot;training&quot; raids.  We are still having people not listening, <br/>
and ending up causing TPW&#39;s.  If any of you have any Guids to <br/>
raiding,  and/or rules that your guild has,  please send them to me <br/>
so I can design something tailored to my guild.<br/>
&gt; Any personal advice is welcomed also.<br/>
&gt;     OH,  Barto,  you should try Iceclad Ocean on Velious, and fight <br/>
the cougars.  Kat went from 32-37 there fighting the cougars,  with <br/>
an added bonus that a cougar claw earring may drop form a few of them <br/>
