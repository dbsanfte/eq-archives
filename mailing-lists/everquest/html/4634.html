<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710970235">Oh my, 5-6 nukes?  I forget what level you are but 5-6<br/>
nukes will most definitely kill mana as well as draw<br/>
aggro where then you won&#39;t be able to get the mob off<br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
I have a mage and a druid and after months of not<br/>
playing my mage, I started him up again only to die<br/>
several times.  I was getting to caught up in the a<br/>
similar pattern where I was nuking too much and once<br/>
you get a mob that hits for 75 per shot on ya, we<br/>
don&#39;t last tooo long.<br/>
<br/>
We have the second best pets in the game and should<br/>
let the pets do most of the work.  I remember being<br/>
under 25 and being able to handle mostly yellow mobs<br/>
and I am not a twinked char.  Once you get Renew<br/>
summoning , learn to use it wisely.  YOu can heal your<br/>
pet for 200 hp and sit while watching its health.<br/>
<br/>
I strongly suggest if you are having trouble to get a<br/>
partner or group for a while.  A druid or cleric is a<br/>
great team where you can both buff your pet and they<br/>
can heal it as well as you.  Both with Kei would be<br/>
dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let us know if you need more , dont&#39; be afraid to try<br/>
strategies, find one that fits your playing style.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to email me off list and I will be more than<br/>
happy to help you.<br/>

&gt; my mage evne with kei will run out of mana with<br/>
&gt; about 5-6 nukes and DS&#39;s.  I must say, for my druid<br/>
&gt; being on kei since the beginning of her creation,<br/>
&gt; her med is still almost maxed, and her combat skills<br/>
&gt; are still good.  amazing waht you can do after you<br/>
&gt; learn the game a bit better.<br/>
