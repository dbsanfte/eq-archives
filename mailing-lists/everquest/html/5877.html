<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020958697">Well, now (unless you choose not to) you start your<br/>
character in a tutorial. And I advice you to do the<br/>
tutorial. You&#39;ll get a nice little charm just for<br/>
talking to all the folks there. And you can get to lvl<br/>
5 fairly easy with not as much fear of being killed.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll probably be ok with just what comes with<br/>
Evolutions for a while. LDoN, GoD and OoW are all for<br/>
higher levels. (Well, you can technically start using<br/>
LDoN at lvl 15, but you can&#39;t go on an adventure until<br/>
you&#39;re 20)<br/>

Welcome back to Norrath!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a sorta newby question.  Last spring I bought<br/>
&gt; Evolution thinking I would<br/>
&gt; re-join Norrath.  Well, apparently not!  My system<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t handle the change<br/>
&gt; on the first of April (no matter what I tried, my<br/>
&gt; sad, tired machine couldn&#39;t deal<br/>
&gt; with the changes).  So, now I have a new machine<br/>
&gt; that will work with the game<br/>
&gt; and will be getting dsl shortly.   I will be using<br/>
&gt; the game I bought (Evolution) and<br/>
&gt; would like to know if any of the expansions beyond<br/>
&gt; LoY offer anything for the<br/>
&gt; &#39;new&#39;, young player or if they are mostly for above<br/>
&gt; levels 20, 30, 40, 50 or more?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I first played (on a borrowed account to see if<br/>
&gt; I would like it) I couldn&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; out of the room/building where I was created!!!  It<br/>
&gt; was hysterical!  My Mentor had<br/>
&gt; to come get me!  and he was kos in Felwithe!  I<br/>
&gt; definately won&#39;t be repeating <br/>
&gt; that scenario......LOL<br/>
