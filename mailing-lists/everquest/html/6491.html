<div id="ygrps-yiv-939389697">Mine has been at 15 too since the expansion came out but I have <br/>
never killed anyone in my home town or any allies with some of my <br/>
characters they are at 15 too. I was wondering the same thing as the <br/>
original question to (how to lower it). I have killed some of my own <br/>
with some of my characters though and the number didn&#39;t rise on them <br/>
either though.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve yet to figure out or find out how Im supposed to destruct my <br/>
terrain though either like it says youre supposed to be able to with <br/>
prophecy of ro expansion? Do you guys know how or where for me to <br/>
find out?<br/>

&gt; That&#39;s a stat that started with the new expansion. I&#39;ve yet to see <br/>
a way to <br/>
&gt; bring this number up or down. Mine has been at 15 ever since the <br/>
expansion <br/>
&gt; came out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is a stat at the bottom of my player stat window that says<br/>
&gt; Corruption.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I assume that is updated when a character commits an offense <br/>
against<br/>
&gt; his home town like attacking a member of one of their allies or, <br/>
worse<br/>
&gt; still, attacking someone in his own city. Please correct me if I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; wrong about that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My corruption stat is 15. Is there a way to remove corruption?<br/>
