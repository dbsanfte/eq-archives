&gt; shadeweavers and the 2 at the end of hollowshade, you will then be given<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; anvil and told to make shadow disks.  To make the disks you combine 1<br/>
&gt; swirling shadow with 1 metal bit in a forge with the hammer and anvil.<br/>
&gt; Barkem will hand you a box to put 10 in.  After that, you move on to the<br/>
&gt; humming orbs.  Handing Barkem 3 orbs plus your hammer gets you the hammer<br/>
&gt; used to make shadowscream armor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for the substances, that requires running the war of hollowshade.  the<br/>
&gt; basics of the war is this.......<br/>

&gt; named in back of the caves (was never good at remembering the bear<br/>
&gt; names....so oddballed.)  Killing this trigger usually sets off the enemy<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; cave always attacks the south camp, south camp always attacks the east<br/>
 </span></blockquote>cave,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and east cave always attacks the north cave.  So to get a mob you want in<br/>
&gt; control of one area, you need to get them to the attacking camp, then<br/>
&gt; trigger them to attack the one you want them at.  Once a mob controls 2<br/>
&gt; camps however, if they are attacked they do not spawn defenders in the<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; wolves once they take the south camp area, rarely they drop off the others<br/>
&gt; but its a once in a 100 kills.  South camp kills are one almost every<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; kill.  The wolves drop Shrieking substances, looks like a blueish green<br/>
&gt; rock, and the owlbears drop wailing substances, looks like an orange orb.<br/>
&gt; Combine 1 each of the substances with the hammer, anvil, one metal ring,<br/>
