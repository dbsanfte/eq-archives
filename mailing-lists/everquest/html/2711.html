<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621553954"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I just hit level 30 last night, and being the Druid<br/>
&gt; that I am, I had a couple of questions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;First, I&#39;ve been hunting in South Karana since level<br/>
&gt;25, hunting the Tesch Mas Gnolls around Paw, and <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately the days of hunting yellows and low reds<br/>
solo are coming to an end, by 40 you won&#39;t be able to<br/>
do it anymore. (just too many HP) What I did at 30 was<br/>
I caught a boat to Velious and bound myself at the<br/>
igloos so I could root and rot Cougars til 34. Once<br/>
you hit 34, you can quad kite Cougars til 38 I believe<br/>
it was, and Ulthorks for several levels after that.<br/>
Also if you want to get started on one of the factions<br/>
in Velious, you could head over to The Great Divide<br/>
and hunt either Drakkel Wolves or Coldain Wolves. (I<br/>
took the easy way out and went Dwarf/Dragon faction<br/>
and hunted Drakkel, but you can go either way) The<br/>
loot is pretty bad on Cougars and even worse on<br/>
Wolves, but the XP is good and it&#39;s relatively safe.<br/>
Plus, at least for me, travelling to Velious for the<br/>
first time was really cool. :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Second, Could someone suggest an item for my arm,<br/>
&gt;back, of legs that gives a decent (around +3) Wisdom<br/>
&gt;modifer that I could try to track down for myself<br/>
&gt;either through a quest or through hunting loot?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Inexpensive items for each slot:<br/>
<br/>
Ulthork Hide Arms - ac8 3wis neg3dex (worth about 75pp<br/>
if that, most people just sell them to merchants once<br/>
you get to velious)<br/>
<br/>
Gatorscale Leggings - 4wis, I forget the rest of the<br/>
mods (400pp in EC tunnel, finding a pair is fairly<br/>
simple)<br/>
<br/>
Kunzar Cloak - some AC, 10 sv vs fire, 2wis (75pp and<br/>
dropping, not great, but the next upgrade is throwing<br/>
down 3k for a 10wis tailored cloak :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re a little short on money after hunting KFC<br/>
for a while, the best loot you&#39;ll find in your level<br/>
range is hunting mammoths in Everfrost. They should be<br/>
dark blue to you for a couple more levels, and drop<br/>
tusks worth 8pp each. (7pp to a merchant in Halas<br/>
unless you have good faction) I only recommend that to<br/>
druids though, as it takes two people to kill the<br/>
Mammoths as fast as they spawn, three and the zone is<br/>
overcamped. A druid can both track and leave when the<br/>
zone gets crowded, nobody else can do that. (well,<br/>
trackers can leave but not to anywhere interesting,<br/>
running thru Blackburrow and spending all night to get<br/>
somewhere interesting is a pretty bad idea :)<br/>
