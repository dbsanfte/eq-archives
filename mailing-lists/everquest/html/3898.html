<div><font face="Arial" size="2">This is vaguely reminiscent of the issue that Judas 
Priest and Ozzy Osbourne had with parents claiming their kids committed suicide 
because of what the lyrics say in the songs.&nbsp; Both were taken to court, 
neither were ever proven.&nbsp; Basically because the children who committed 
suicide were known to have f*cked up family lives and mental problems to begin 
with.&nbsp; The music was no more to blame than the musicians.&nbsp; The parents 
were just looking for a scapegoat.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Now as I see it, Sony does put a label on the game 
saying that it does contain graphically violent content and some mature 
situations.&nbsp; Sony cannot be held liable for anything that happens.&nbsp; 
I&#39;ve just recently noticed they also started labelling it that it may cause 
epileptic seizures.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Now I have been playing Everquest for over a 
year.&nbsp; And consequently enough, it&#39;s helped me more than hindered me.&nbsp; 
I started playing at a down point in my life when I didn&#39;t have a social life, 
when I never left my apartment, and I really had nothing to do except sit and 
watch TV all day.&nbsp; I craved social interaction, and for a guy that lived 
way out in the boonies with no transportation, Everquest was a god-send.&nbsp; 
the people at work turned me on to it strictly for those reasons.&nbsp; It 
became my social life when I needed one.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Now things are different.&nbsp; I get out more, I 
have a social life, and I&#39;ve turned a few other people on to the game.&nbsp; I 
don&#39;t play nearly as much as I used to, but I still enjoy the game for its 
interaction - it&#39;s still &quot;new&quot; to me.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">So if anyone commits suicide, it has nothing to do 
with the game, it&#39;s cause they already had some mental problems and inside 
turmoil that they were harboring even before EverQuest came along.&nbsp; That&#39;s 
what I believe.&nbsp; And again, I think it&#39;s just the parents looking for a 
scapegoat.&nbsp; My parents know I play EverQuest.&nbsp; Albeit, they think I 
play it too much, but because I am the one paying for it, they don&#39;t try to stop 
me. </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">and that&#39;s that.</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>BAH! tell your parents to shut up, 48 hours just played on 
  the bad <br>news about the game, if that were true then they would also play 
  on <br>Ultima Online and Ashron&#39;s call 1 and 2 and also Dark Age of Camelot. 
  <br>They just played on that story because more people that I know play 
  <br>Everquest than any other online game, people who have quit EQ has <br>come 
  back because it is by far that I heard of the superior of the <br>breed of 
  online games. BAH!!! Listen to the REAL news like CNN and <br>stuff, don&#39;t 
  listen to 48 hours or talk shows, they only want <br>ratings, tell your 
  Parents that if they got a problem with EQ talk to <br>me I&#39;ll knock some 
  sense into them! I&#39;ve been playing for 2 years, my <br>cousin&#39;s been playing 
  since it game out along with his friends and <br>they&#39;re fine. yeah There are 
  obsessed people out there but that&#39;s for <br>all the games not just EQ. I mean 
  there are stalkers out there also. <br>jeezuz, and if they talk to me about 
  the game tell them to email me <br>or shut up about giveing you crap about EQ. 
  Same goes for anyone else <br>who has this problem, tell your parents to get 
  over it, if they KNOW <br>you and they should, then there is no problems 
  unless you&#39;ve done <br>that kind of stupid stuff before (suicide), I mean as 
  you all <br>probally heard about EQ that guy who commited suicide had a mentel 
  <br>condition, hopefully none of you have that problem, and if you do, 
  <br>just be safe ^_^. <br><br>--- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Thunder Cat&quot;

  also said people become obsessed and make the game their <br>&gt; life...they 
  don&#39;t get jobs or do anything else, just play all the <br>time. My <br>&gt; 
  parents are now concerned and told me as soon as they see any signs <br>that I 
  <br>&gt; am going to kill myself, they are taking the game away. I can&#39;t 
  <br>believe <br>&gt; that...the game is fun, yeah, but to end your life over 
  it? Come on.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;
