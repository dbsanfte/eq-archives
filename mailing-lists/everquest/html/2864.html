 </span></blockquote>I found starting out with a meele was easier.  Casters can be <br/>
difficult until you get the hang of things.  Warriors, Rangers and <br/>
Paladins are good for a beginning.  SK&#39;s take some experience.<br/>
<br/>
The PvP and roleplaying servers are also for more experienced <br/>
players, but you can dive in if you want.  The game will be a little <br/>
harder to learn, but who knows?  You may find a mentor!<br/>
<br/>
And do try out several characters.  And check out the EQ sites for <br/>
creations guides, unless you just want to go for it!<br/>
<br/>
And most of all, have fun!<br/>
