<div id="ygrps-yiv-1444666504">Well, when I first talked to the EQ people about having different eye<br/>
colors, hair styles, and hair colors they told me that they would never be<br/>
able to do it bc it was too complex. Now they do have it. It just depends on<br/>
the programming advances they make.<br/>

Unfortunately, going by what they&#39;ve said in the past, never gonna happen.<br/>
If adding ONE model (Iksar skellie pets for Iksar necros and SKs) sucks up<br/>
too much resources and would require too much  recoding to be feasible, then<br/>
adding seperate, interchangable parts like taller collars or optional horns<br/>
for helms would likely fall under the same limitations.<br/>

  Another thing I&#39;d think would be cool is a feature that relates to the<br/>
armor dyes..molding, and tailoring any piece of gear you own to your own<br/>
liking.   Like say if you were a ogre warrior and you didn&#39;t like the way<br/>
your helmet looked like, well you could go down to a forge or blacksmith and<br/>
pay a certain amount to have them mold the helmet anyway you would<br/>
like..maybe you would like horns on the helmet or a certain design ecthed on<br/>
it..and for casters you could go to a tailor somewhere and have them design<br/>
your robe a certain way..maybe you would like longer sleeves or a slit in<br/>
your robe or a fancy collar. </span></blockquote></div>
