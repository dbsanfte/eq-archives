&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am fairly new to EQ and have been trying various class-race <br/>
&gt; combos to see what I like.  I now have three character <br/>
&gt; between level 10 and 15.  I have been going to Crushbone alot <br/>
&gt; to hunt, and the tower in the field of bone is cool but I am <br/>
&gt; getting tired of the same old stuff.  Where else can a <br/>
&gt; character in the 10-20 range go to hunt where he can find a <br/>
&gt; group easily?  I have looked over the EQ Atlas and see a lot <br/>
&gt; of stuff for 1-10 and 30+. Since I may try some more <br/>
&gt; class-race combos before I try and take anybody over 20 I <br/>
&gt; could use some more places to fill the gap between newbie and <br/>
&gt; experienced.  I am not interested in power-leveling.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have EQ Evolution, so every expansion but LDON.  I play on <br/>
&gt; the Tunare<br/>
&gt; (sp?) server.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks! </span></blockquote></div>
