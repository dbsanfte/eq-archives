Subject: [EverQuest] Platinum<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hello All.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was wondering if anyone knew where to get lots of platinum. I am a<br/>
&gt; lvl 20 (almost 21) Mage and am in need of cash. (Those spells are<br/>
&gt; real expensive!).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If anyone knows where to get good loot please let me know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!!<br/>

Well, if they aren&#39;t camped there are the aquagoblin camps in butcherblock<br/>
mountains. They drop a few items that sell for a few plat each. If you hunt<br/>
rats in freeport they drop plague rat tails that sell for just over 1 plat.<br/>
You can also take up a tradeskill like brewery and make money selling heady<br/>
kiolas (trivial at 46). You can probably solo the bandits in highpass (right<br/>
near highkeep). They drop bronze weapons and gems that sell for a few plat.<br/>
I think Netherbian Lair is also good for loot but I&#39;m not sure on the levels<br/>
there.<br/>
luv,<br/>
