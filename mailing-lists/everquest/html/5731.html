<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053913139">No, that wouldn&#39;t be the case. My highest is a lvl 55<br/>
and the lowest is 13. I think I just didn&#39;t reactivate<br/>
my account in time. Oh well. Maybe as the release date<br/>
for EQ2 gets closer, they might do this again.<br/>

&gt; Just a note, all keys not used go bad July 2, so if<br/>
&gt; you have one you might<br/>
&gt; want to use it or let us know about it pretty soon. <br/>
&gt; Would hate to see all<br/>
&gt; those keys go bad.<br/>
