<div id="ygrps-yiv-476478281">I have one male character. I don&#39;t know many rl girls who play males.<br/>
Although I find that while people tend to give more stuff to females, people<br/>
listen better to males. ie. as group leader with my female alt I set loot<br/>
order and organize strategy. People tend not to obey loot order nor to they<br/>
listen to strategy. But even when not as group leader playing a male, people<br/>
will listen to my suggestion of loot order as well as strategy. Odd isn&#39;t<br/>
it?<br/>
