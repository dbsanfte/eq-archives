<div id="ygrps-yiv-68025681">Earlier someone wrote that there was a way to switch back from red to <br/>
green...i had heard rumors about some sort of Order Quest, the reverse of the <br/>
Discord quest (which is just giving the Priest of Discord the book), but i <br/>
didnt think that they had implemented it yet. Anyone know if its true or is <br/>
it still a rumor?</div>
