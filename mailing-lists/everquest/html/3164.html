<div id="ygrps-yiv-976241922">ahhhhh tooo funny I use the &quot;Q&quot; as well.<br/>
<br/>
as far as the person with the playing problems.  Here<br/>
is what I would try:<br/>
<br/>
1. uninstall everything associated with the game<br/>
including Direct X., REBOOT,<br/>
2.  Then download Direct x 8.1 from Microsoft.com.<br/>
3. install Direct x, REBOOT<br/>
4. Install EQ BUT BUT BUT, when you install it this<br/>
time, change the directory to something like c:&#92;EQ and<br/>
not the default.<br/>
5. after installing eq reboot and try again ti run<br/>
<br/>
NOTES: if it still does not work, make sure your<br/>
software firewall is not running, make sure you are<br/>
not running TOO high of a resolution for your monitor.<br/>
Most important, try shutting down any application<br/>
running in the background you do not need, even<br/>
disable antivirus software just as a test. I did not<br/>
say remove the anti-virus but disable it.<br/>
<br/>
Let us know if any of this helps<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt; By the way I did defrag(and needed it) but to no<br/>
&gt; avail.<br/>
&gt; &gt; My big question is why can&#39;t I post at the<br/>
&gt; station? I have cookies <br/>
&gt; &gt; enabled, I&#39;m signed in and it says &quot;hi muddywag&quot;<br/>
&gt; at the top, but it <br/>
&gt; &gt; keeps telling me that I need to be registered. <br/>
&gt; AHHH! IWANNA KILL A <br/>
&gt; &gt; BAT!!  By the way I CAN play the tutorial.  Which<br/>
&gt; only served to let <br/>
&gt; &gt; me know that I&#39;ll REALLY like this game- someday!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You can&#39;t post to the tech boards because you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have an EQ account <br/>
&gt; yet.  Until you finish the registration screens in<br/>
&gt; the game your station <br/>
&gt; name and password isn&#39;t associated with an EQ<br/>
&gt; account.<br/>
&gt; Do yourself a favor and delete that tutorial.  If<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s the one you <br/>
&gt; download off the station&#39;s website, it&#39;s very old. <br/>
&gt; It does give an idea <br/>
&gt; of gameplay but you&#39;ll still be very lost when you<br/>
&gt; play for the first <br/>
&gt; time.<br/>
&gt; First thing you do when you do get a character<br/>
&gt; started is change where <br/>
&gt; the autoattack key is.  Every newbie gets killed<br/>
&gt; trying to talk to thier <br/>
&gt; trainer because they don&#39;t hit enter before they<br/>
&gt; start to type<br/>
&gt; You click Options then Keyboard then click the field<br/>
&gt; below Autoattack <br/>
&gt; then hit a key on the keyboard you don&#39;t think<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ll use often.  Mine <br/>
&gt; is set to Q, some people use the Insert key.  Dont<br/>
&gt; use the numbers, <br/>
&gt; anything on the number pad, Pgup, Pgdown, or any of<br/>
&gt; the Fkeys or arrow <br/>
&gt; key; all those have a use already in the game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good luck<br/>
