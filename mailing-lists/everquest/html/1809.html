<div><font size="2">Druids are the BEST PLers. At about 10-18 best places to PL 
are EK and LOIO towards the higher end of it. I got a ranger PLed from 8 to 14 
with druid DS, wolf form, SLN and a few other goodies, easily, on gorge hounds 
and crag spiders. There&#39;s a big hill a little to the right and into the zone, 
which is where the spiders spawn. Chasm crawlers (they&#39;d be exp too) are PH&#39;s 
for the spiders, so with druid help you guys should clean up.</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>Well, I don&#39;t know much about melee myself either but I can 
  say that <br>you can DS (Damage Shield) your hubby to power level him as well 
  as <br>give him Skin Like Rock.&nbsp; Also, buff him up with strength so he 
  can <br>deal more damage.&nbsp; I&#39;m really not sure if fearing is very 
  effective <br>to PL because when I tried doing that, they didn&#39;t seem to get 
  much <br>xp out of it.&nbsp; Well, I can definitely help your hubby get to 
  your <br>level if you&#39;re on Vazaelle.&nbsp; I doubt it though.&nbsp; Not many 
  poeple <br>I&#39;ve seen online post that they&#39;re on vazaelle.&nbsp; Cuz I can 
  definitely <br>help him level.&nbsp; I&#39;m a level 51 druid and I can use my 49 
  DS and <br>he&#39;ll kill mobs like they were nothing.&nbsp; It deals 24 points of 
  damage <br>each time the mob hits the person with the DS.<br><br>--- In

  all,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I was wondering if some of you could help me.&nbsp; I 
  got my hubby <br>involved in EQ<br>&gt; so he&#39;d stop bugging me to get off the 
  computer.&nbsp; He&#39;s got a 10th <br>lvl<br>&gt; halfling fighter, and I know 
  next to nothing about the melee <br>classes.<br>&gt; Assuming he&#39;s got about 
  1000pp to spend, what are his best choices <br>for armor<br>&gt; and a decent 
  weapon.&nbsp; He&#39;s got a fine steel longsword right now, <br>which 
  seems<br>&gt; to suck, and leather armor.&nbsp; Should he go to bronze or fine 
  steel <br>armor?<br>&gt; What does a full suit of either of these cost?&nbsp; 
  And what&#39;s the best <br>weapon<br>&gt; for him at this point?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 
  Also, I&#39;m trying to powerlevel him just a little so we can go 
  <br>adventuring<br>&gt; together, though I&#39;m not generally a fan of leveling 
  people that <br>don&#39;t know<br>&gt; what they&#39;re doing.&nbsp; They should die 
  plenty and learn like the rest <br>of us<br>&gt; did :P&nbsp; I have a 16 
  druid and he just needs a couple of levels so <br>we can<br>&gt; hang 
  out.&nbsp; Is there a good place to do this quickly?&nbsp; All I can <br>think 
  of at<br>&gt; the moment is to fear kite lions and bears, oh my, and let him 
  hack <br>them up.<br>&gt; There&#39;s so darn many people in EC these days, 
  though.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thanks for any help!!<br>&gt; <br>&gt;
