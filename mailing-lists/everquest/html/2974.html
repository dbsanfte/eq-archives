<div id="ygrps-yiv-708478368">ok i finally got in EverQuest and walked around.  Found a black wolf <br/>
after about 10 minutes, it had the name of &quot;black wolf&quot; I attacked it <br/>
and the human players nearby attacked me to near death,  i evaded <br/>
them and wondered what just happened. do you just stand around (it <br/>
appeared as if everyone else was) till an enemy comes strolling by.  <br/>
How do you know whats what is this game?</div>
