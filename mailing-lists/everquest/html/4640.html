<div><font size="2">I have both....the ME one doesn&#39;t have&nbsp;any real 
problems.&nbsp;The XP one for some reason is running&nbsp; much laggier lately. 
ME is a bit less ugly, IMO, and has somewhat more&nbsp;modest system 
requirements.&nbsp; ME&nbsp;also works with a&nbsp;lot more older&nbsp; 
stuff.&nbsp; I&#39;ve had 1 windows game and 1 DOS game&nbsp; not work right in it, 
but&nbsp; many newer&nbsp; ones like&nbsp;UT&nbsp;and Worms: Armageddon won&#39;t 
work right&nbsp; under XP.&nbsp; Your call but if&nbsp; you have a working, 
stable ME box and&nbsp; you&#39;re happy with it, don&#39;t switch. Oh&nbsp; yeah, did I 
mention 10 day + uptimes, not counting when the power goes out&nbsp; or I unplug 
as a precaution against lightning strikes during storms? No serious lag problems 
either. This is a 450mhz K6-3 with 448 megs ram. ME has an undeservedly bad 
reputation. </font></div>

  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">I think, in my opinion, you probably won&#39;t see a 
  lot of difference between how EQ runs in ME or XP.&nbsp; The operating system 
  itself doesn&#39;t really effect gameplay.&nbsp; EverQuest is more based on the 
  quality of your hardware; graphics, CPU, memory, etc.&nbsp; Where the OS does 
  come into play is memory management.&nbsp; XP is moderately better at handling 
  memory resources than XP is.&nbsp; In ME over a period of time, without the 
  system being restarted, game play tends to get sluggish and lag a lot.&nbsp; 
  You might not go linkdead, but it&#39;s very hard to play until you restart yoru 
  computer and the memory resources are fresh.&nbsp; Now this can also happen 
  with XP, but it takes considerably longer to get to that point.&nbsp; If 
  you&#39;re happy with ME and the game runs fine, don&#39;t bother with XP.&nbsp;

  PM<br>Subject: [EverQuest] unusual question<br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
  have an unusual quest for you al.&nbsp; I am thinking of switching my OS back 
  to windows XP. I currently have win ME on my system.&nbsp; The question is 
  will Win XP make Everquest run better?&nbsp; I had XP on my system but I have 
  done some upgrading since then and my system crashed twice when I was using XP 
  and it crashed in a bad way I could start windows at one point.&nbsp; Well let 
  me know any recommendations please.&nbsp; Thank you for your help and 
  time.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
