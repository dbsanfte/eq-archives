<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517061733">I don&#39;t think anyone has said this was Verant&#39;s fault. I think we all<br/>
realize that anytime you have a large number of people someplace it is going<br/>
to zone. It is kindof amazing to realize that there are 200+ people in one<br/>
zone though. I don&#39;t think people expected to see that many in one zone.<br/>
Hopefully the lag will die down some as the novelty of the new features<br/>
start to fade. Who knows though, maybe they might have to make a bazaar2.<br/>
Until then, some of us with really pathetic &#39;net connections will have to<br/>
wait until the fervor dies down.<br/>
And nah. You&#39;re not going to get flamed. You&#39;re just stating the facts. :-)<br/>

&gt; Well I&#39;m probably going to get flamed for this but you all do<br/>
&gt; realize that the bazaar is a new feature and it&#39;s going to get hammered<br/>
&gt; by practically all the players in the first couple of weeks? If any<br/>
&gt; Verant admins monitor this list maybe they could post the stats on how<br/>
&gt; many hits the servers for the bazaar are getting and their processing<br/>
&gt; percentage plus the net traffic stats. I bet that they will all<br/>
&gt; practically be maxed out. Basically what I&#39;m saying is, yes the lag is<br/>
&gt; annoying but be patient and give it time and it will quickly even itself<br/>
&gt; out. The problem is not your computer, it&#39;s a combination of your<br/>
&gt; connection to the net and how many are also on at your local hub at the<br/>
&gt; same time you are, (if you have a broadband connection), and that the<br/>
&gt; servers are taking a hellacious beating right now. The bank in Kelethin<br/>
&gt; is this way, it lags when everyone is meeting there but when everyone is<br/>
&gt; out hackin and slashin it&#39;s really smooth.<br/>
