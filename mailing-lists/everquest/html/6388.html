Welcome--If you ever decide to come to Maelin Starpyre look me and will <br/>
be glad to help you out and show you the way thru the game :)  <br/>
My ingame name is Tartracheon.  <br/>
I DEFINITELY agree on purchasing EQ Platinum--you will later on want to <br/>
buy the Dragons of Norrath or download online because when you die in<br/>
Everquest you have to go back and loot your corpse or do it the <br/>
easy way and go to guild lobby and have it summoned to your <br/>
feet...lolol <br/>
(there is a fee involved for getting a summons in guild lobby but not <br/>
that much for low level players.) (in game money--not money from you) <br/>
If you need to purchase armour there are now alot of new armour quests <br/>
for new players or you can pop into the Bazaar in Plane of Knowledge <br/>
and buy something there.  <br/>
Hope to see on Maelin :)  <br/>
<br/>
Tartracheon <br/>
Wraiths of Discord <br/>
Maelin Starpyre Rules...lolol <br/>

&gt; Lots of products to choose from.  What products does a newb that has <br/>
&gt; never played Everquest before purchase?  i.e.  How do I get online <br/>
&gt; with this game and do I want it or the newest EV II.  (Bored with UO <br/>
&gt; for sure.)<br/>
&gt; Thx in advance.  Linda M<br/>
