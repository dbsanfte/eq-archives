<div id="ygrps-yiv-221084880">I generally solo my druid. Just reached lvl 30 last night. I like <br/>
open spaces, and for quite some time favored snare/nuke kiting with <br/>
using some weapons work at the end. In SK, however, as I began to <br/>
solo wandering Aviaks I altered my style to do root/dot/dot with a <br/>
nuke at the end. If I kited too widely I tended to bump into a <br/>
helpful Aviak wanderer, too often big enough to rob me of the kill <br/>
because it forced me to gate.<br/>
<br/>
Since I am a halfling I have made it my goal to master the skills to <br/>
make the imbued leather armor. The Vale leather skills are a <br/>
challenge and building toward that has been a goal just as much as <br/>
leveling. With soloing and foraging in the Karanas for ages I have <br/>
gotten quite a few plains pebbles for this future use.<br/>
<br/>
The gods of the game are wise. I cannot complete the leather work <br/>
without the special Vale sewing kit. To make the kit I need an ore <br/>
dropped, I have learned, only from the goblin janitor in Runnyeye. A <br/>
dungeon. I will have to find a group to help with that one, if I <br/>
cannot find anyone selling the stuff. Dungeons just don&#39;t work well <br/>
for solo druids, in my opinion.<br/>

p.s. Regarding best solo, my druid is my primary and highest alt. I <br/>
love soloing this one so much I rarely play my others. I like the <br/>
independence of the druid, sowing and binding as needed. The down <br/>
time to med is a pain, but I try to take it in a roll-playing spirit. <br/>
As to whether or not this is best, I know it is for me right now. <br/>
Later on I may find I have changed over time, and another class and <br/>
race will seem better. For now, however, my halfling druid is just <br/>
fine.</div>
