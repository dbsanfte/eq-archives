<div id="ygrps-yiv-1341260370">I use the root and nuke strategy.<br/>
Another fun thing to do for faction or items.<br/>
With my cleric I run around hittng polar bear cubs once and get a whole<br/>
train of them on me (when I am much higher lvl than them). Once I have about<br/>
5 or more I wait til they are all close to me and cast Word of Pain. Then<br/>
They all die instantly. So then I gather up their pelts. some of which can<br/>
be turned in for quests.<br/>
I do something similar with my wizard and orc pawns in Freeport. I use a low<br/>
lvl dd spell to lure pawns to me and get a whole bunch around me. This is<br/>
good when I am encumbered and cannot chase after them. Once I get them<br/>
gathered around I use an AE spell. if they don&#39;t all die, I stand in place<br/>
and attack the ones that are close to me. If they run I turn to another one<br/>
and fight it. Eventulaly they all come back to me. I keep fighting til they<br/>
are all laying dead around me. then I loot their corpses and gate back to<br/>
Hallard&#39;s to deliver pawn picks.<br/>
Got my faction up to apprehensive so far.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Like me...my current fav character is Sarakan...a level 12 druid<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; and my best strategy is to fear kite young kodiaks in the commons<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; and at later levels, I&#39;ll be grouping with a rogue so that he can back<br/>
