<div id="ygrps-yiv-1643095947">I have only been playing EQ for a few weeks and <br/>
have found a /command that is not in the <br/>
text files that come with the game.<br/>
<br/>
/corpse: <br/>
summons your corpse from a few yards away.<br/>
This is useful if your corpse is underneath the<br/>
NPC/creature that killed you, or if you want to <br/>
loot yourself in a less high traffic area.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone out there that can tell me more <br/>
commands that are not in the list?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
