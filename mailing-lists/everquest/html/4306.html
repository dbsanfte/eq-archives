<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032269404">The 6-month time period is a myth. Your characters and their info are <br/>
kept indefinitely in their servers unless they go cleaning it out for <br/>
space which I highly doubt since your files are miniscule in size. <br/>
I&#39;ve had a number of friend who have left for over a year (one for 3) <br/>
and have returned with everything intact. The only catch is it make <br/>
take some time to re-activate your account after extremely prolonged <br/>
inactivity. :) So there is no way you can leave for a year, then come <br/>
back and not get your account back. Of course if you were banned or <br/>
suspended, then that is another issue, or your credit card is maxed <br/>
heh. :)<br/>
