<div id="ygrps-yiv-908593616">Legend is $40 a month.  ALL new content in Everquest will go into Legend first, and normal servers will suffer because of it, only getting new updates as they filter out from Legend.  The new content and improvements will obviously come through to regular servers slower than in the past, in order for Verant to justify the high subscription to Legend and keep those few elite and rich players interested.<br/>
<br/>
You might gather I dont subscribe to the Legend server :)<br/>

Anyone doing the new Legends thing? Looks cool, but the existing game <br/>
is still enough for me. How much more are they asking for Legends <br/>
access? I never saw a price.<br/>
