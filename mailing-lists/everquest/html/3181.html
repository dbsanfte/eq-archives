<div id="ygrps-yiv-298484384">I have been alternating with my young warrior. Same level as yours. I <br/>
had a gnoll hide whip I used for some 1hs, and I have a velium <br/>
morning star for 1hb. My plan is to use both for a while when I get <br/>
dual wield. Use the whip primary for fast lashing and possible stun, <br/>
and the star in the off-hand for dealing bigger damage.<br/>

&gt; Ok, I have a level 11 warrior and would like your<br/>
&gt; opinion on the following:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I started wondering why I was not hitting that much<br/>
&gt; with him even though he has a good weapon. After some<br/>
&gt; research, I found that the reason I am not hitting as<br/>
&gt; much as others is because I have been switching<br/>
&gt; between 2HS and 1HS weapons to increase the skills of<br/>
&gt; each attribute.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Example: My skill in both is 25, let&#39;s say and my<br/>
&gt; attack is at like 152.  If I were to just use 1HS<br/>
&gt; let&#39;s say, my ATK rating would be like close to 300.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have proved this because now that I am using the 1HS<br/>
&gt; more, the skill is close to 30 and my ATK rating is<br/>
&gt; close to 200 where with a 2HS weapon, it is still at<br/>
&gt; 152.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Would you continue to alternate both weapon types or<br/>
&gt; would you just pick one and go with it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
