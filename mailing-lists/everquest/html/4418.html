<div id="ygrps-yiv-973540697"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; As a lvl 60 druid with a horse I&#39;ve got to say I never knew how much I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>needed my horse until I had him. For the aggro management alone it&#39;s worth<br/>
the 8k.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I notice the difference drastically when I&quot;m grouped in outdoor zones<br/>
 </span></blockquote>opposed to inside zones. For example, had a group in Plane of Storms<br/>
(outside zone) stayed on my horse and never got aggro once. Next night was<br/>
in North Temple of Veeshan, tried to sit between fights and picked up aggro<br/>
everytime something popped. From a casters point of view and the damage the<br/>
mobs do with one hit at higher levels. One hit can sometimes be deadly.<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t use the horse for solo&#39;ing because of the slow start stop time, but<br/>
in groups it&#39;s the greatest.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm.. slow start stop time? Is there a delay from when you tell it to stop<br/>
and such?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I love my horse, the only thing that I hate is the visual of the horses<br/>
 </span></blockquote>head and ears that get in the way of your targeting. The new LoY lizards<br/>
supposedly do not have that problem so even if it&#39;s a 1.5k plat hit for a<br/>
trade in. I might make the change. Although it will all depend on if I can<br/>
find a lizard to match my new dyed blue outfit :-)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Where are lizards sold? and are there quests to get them?<br/>
luv,<br/>
