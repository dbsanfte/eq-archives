&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is a stat at the bottom of my player stat window that says<br/>
&gt; Corruption.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I assume that is updated when a character commits an offense against<br/>
&gt; his home town like attacking a member of one of their allies or, worse<br/>
&gt; still, attacking someone in his own city. Please correct me if I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; wrong about that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My corruption stat is 15. Is there a way to remove corruption?<br/>

Dumb question number 2 :)<br/>
I&#39;ve been looking for a Twisted Ajrah Treant in East Karana for a<br/>
month and I&#39;ve never see it. I need the special item that only that<br/>
critter carries to complete a quest. Does it appear at a certain time<br/>
of day on a certain day of the week realtime or something?</div>
