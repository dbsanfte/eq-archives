I am in need of help.&nbsp; I used to play everquest all the time using a <br>
friends username and password until he changed his password and never <br>
told me what the new one was.&nbsp; I know i am about to ask a stupid <br>
question but is there any way that anyone would let me use their <br>
username and password.&nbsp; I would be very greatful and i would stay off <br>
of the severs you use, and i would help you anyway that i could.&nbsp; I <br>
would get a username and password if i could but i dont have a credit <br>
card.&nbsp; I&#39;m sorry if i have bothered any of you fine gamers but i just <br>
had to ask.&nbsp; and if you will let me use your username and password <br>
email me.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for taking the time to read this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
