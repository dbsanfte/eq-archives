<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528685064">I agree. Definately get the Platinum pack first. it&#39;s actually cheaper
to get that than if you went and purchased all the expansions
seperately. You will get the following...EQ, Ruins of Kunark, Scars of
Velous, Planes of Power, Legacy of Yekesha, Lower Dungeons of Norrath,
and Gates of Discord. I keep thinking there was another in there but
can&#39;t remember. The three expansions past that are Omens of War,
Dragons of Norrath (Really nice if you get into a guild that uses it to
manage inventory) and the most recent Depths of Darkhollow.<br>
<br>
A quick note, this is a &quot;Live&quot; game and there can be some very rude
people but please don&#39;t let them discourage you from playing. For every
jerk there are at least 3 really cool people. If you can, find yourself
a good guild, one that will help and mentor you. My guild, Mystic
Crusaders, is on the Bristlebane server. If you decide on that server
to play on then look me up!<br>
<br>
Oh, yea servers, there are several servers for you to play on. There
are a couple of &quot;special&quot; servers that only do role playing or player
vs. player but I can&#39;t remember which ones those are. I think the
Firona Vie server is the RP one.<br>
<br>
Internet - it really helps if you have a cable or DSL connection but
you can still play on a dial up. (pref 56k) Dial up just takes a little
longer to do a few things like zone from one area to the other, when
you die it will take a few minutes to come back. (due to the data
transfer) <br>
<br>
Computer - What kind of PC you got? yes I will say that if you had one
of the uber Alienware or custome build hot rods then you are set but
you should be fine with the &quot;off the shelf&quot; unit at Wal*Mart. As long
as you have at least a Pentium III 800Mhz and 256MB Ram you should do
pretty well. Anything lower than that and you might run into a few
performance issues. A good graphics card really helps! <br>
<br>
Payment - As already mentioned, you can pay either by credit card or by
Game Card. I have done both but now only so credit card. I have only
one card and thats all I use it for. Pay for EQ and then pay off the
card. Helps build good &quot;faction&quot; with the credit gods. ;-) <br>
<br>
Characters - there are so many to choose from, Elves, Humans, Gnomes,
Trolls and more. You can be a Ranger, (My personal fav) Warrior,
Cleric, Druid, Beast Lord, Necromancer, Rogue, Berzerker and I&#39;m sure
I&#39;m forgetting a couple. You have 8 slots which allows you to create 8
different characters so this allows you to try a few different classes
and races. Before creating a character, research them out. Ask here
about them, read Sony&#39;s site <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.everquest.com">http://www.everquest.com</a> on characters,
and check out websites like <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/</a> and
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eqatlas.com/">http://www.eqatlas.com/</a> for maps. Doing a little research before hand
will help make your experience much better. Oh and a few other bits of
advice, You don&#39;t loose anything under level 10 when you die, after
that corpse runs suck, SoW is awsome, TEMP rules (until you can get V),
tradeskills are boring at times but cool when you learn a new skill,
Ambasador Dvinn is an ass along with Equestrielle and tracking rocks!<br>
<br>
The game is really fun and it is what you make it. Granted it can be
very frustrating at times but thats just when you take a break and then
come back.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Hope to see you in the game and posting lots of questions here soon!<br>
<br>
C-ya!<br>

would suggest starting with with EQ platinum set and when you get into
game more then get the additional downloads. Be sure to get your game
cards or do your subscription via credit card. I do both. LOL.<br><br>As far as EQ II, I have seen alot of players come back to EQ from EQ II. They state that the game is too limiting.<br><br>Hope this helps. 52th level BST Notanicekitty (Quellious)
