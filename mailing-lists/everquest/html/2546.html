<div id="ygrps-yiv-488331629">Thanks!<br/>
I&#39;ve been lucky in that the few groups that I do moderate I haven&#39;t had to<br/>
do anything more than occassionally post a calender reminder of someone&#39;s<br/>
birthday except for one case where I had someone unreasonable who had a<br/>
problem with the word &quot;fruck&quot; and left the list bc they felt I should ban<br/>
the use of the made up word. I want the list to be friendly and fun.<br/>
I won&#39;t make any new rules or anything unless things go sour and I have to.<br/>
Hopefully things will stay as they are.<br/>
luv,<br/>

Rock on SU........ Nice job.<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure how the board has always been but I personally think it should<br/>
be moderated too.  Just to keep spammers, Off-topic, and unnecessary<br/>
vulagarities off this list.  I have not seen this group abused like others I<br/>
am on, WOW, but I think moderation keeps people longer.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents.<br/>

  Hi!<br/>
<br/>
  As a result of me quitting EQ I have handed over the ownership of this<br/>
  mailing list to Su, she seems like a reasonable person to carry on, even<br/>
  tho there isn&#39;t really much this list has required in the ways of<br/>
  maintenance.. I have barely done jack here since I started it back<br/>
  during beta.. :p However i did restrict access to the calendar now and<br/>
  removed that annoying spam event thing hehe...<br/>
<br/>
  Good luck everyone!<br/>
