<div id="ygrps-yiv-836020082">Velks is good. I don&#39;t like going up high there. I made it to 51 and 52 in<br/>
Velks. But lately it&#39;s been too crowded and I haven&#39;t been able to find a<br/>
group.<br/>
Im not familiar with the tent. I do the floor where you come in either in<br/>
one of the side rooms or on the middle room in the back. I&#39;ve sometimes gone<br/>
up to SH. I really hate going up those narrow passageways though. especially<br/>
with the slippery ice.<br/>

&gt;   Ok now that my cleric is lvl 52, I&#39;m trying to find a good place to hunt<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt;   get xp. Also, are there any parts of my epic that I can do out of order.<br/>
&gt;   Like can I kill some mob in nagafen&#39;s lair or such without doing the<br/>

 </span></blockquote>there..<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;   does it have to be triggered by the quest to spawn? I&#39;m worried that I<br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt;   hit one of those zones where if you are over 52 you will be banished to<br/>
&gt; zone<br/>
&gt;   beginning so I want to do what I can while lower lvl and then do the<br/>
&gt; higher<br/>
&gt;   lvl stuff once I&#39;ve gone up more.<br/>
&gt;   Any suggestions?<br/>
&gt;   luv,<br/>
