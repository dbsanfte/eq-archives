<div id="ygrps-yiv-1465348563">Ok, considering that I avent played EQ in ages, as I&#39;m sure you all <br/>
know by now..lol..I have an odd question. Odd only because I am <br/>
thinking about it and not being able to play...well...<br/>
<br/>
I was going through the &quot;EQ Journal&quot; of mine and came across the <br/>
inventory list. It wasnt complete, but fairly accurate and almost <br/>
done for all 16 of my toons. Now, I am the kind of user that gets <br/>
each toon their own armor, weapons, etc...so at one time or another <br/>
I had 8 or 9 centi short swords, etc. Occasionally...if a weapon was <br/>
too good and not no-drop and I couldnt get another one, I&#39;d switch <br/>
them between toons that could use it ( thank the gods for the shared <br/>
bank..lol)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was thinking about weapons and their usage in particular. <br/>
Mainly, the correct way of giving waepons to a Dual-Wielder( which <br/>
weapon goes in primary/secondary....faster weapon or the more <br/>
damaging weapon.  Also, when learning a new skill (i.e piercing) <br/>
when your level 40..lol...does it matter which hand you have the <br/>
dagger in?<br/>
<br/>
I have heard many answers and many conflicted with each other..and <br/>
it was never something I was clear on..considering my two &quot;mains&quot; <br/>
are a caster and druid...lol...<br/>
<br/>
As always..longwinded..and Greg</div>
