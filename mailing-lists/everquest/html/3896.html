They also said people become obsessed and make the game their <br>life...they don&#39;t get jobs or do anything else, just play all the time. My <br>parents are now concerned and told me as soon as they see any signs that I <br>am going to kill myself, they are taking the game away. I can&#39;t believe <br>that...the game is fun, yeah, but to end your life over it?
