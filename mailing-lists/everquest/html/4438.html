<div id="ygrps-yiv-1223923739"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; I suck at selling and can&#39;t go into the bazaar anymore. Sharing a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>network<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; with 4 computers with only a 19.2kbps connection really really blows. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; can&#39;t even play EQ if one person has a text based rpg going on online<br/>
 </span></blockquote>now.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; i saw some of your postings about not being able to enter bazaar.<br/>
&gt; i think it is either your connection or the gfx card is &quot;too small&quot;.<br/>
&gt; have a look further down, i wrote some more things down there...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s my internet connection. I have a GeForce 4 Ti 4600 128mb vid card. My<br/>
system is good. but my phone lines are horrible.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Wow. WW is what now? warsilk woods? What lvl are they?<br/>
&gt; sorry... forgot about that zone... i was referring to Western Wastes.<br/>
&gt; and the right name of the wolves is &quot;Velium Hounds&quot;. the wolves<br/>
&gt; are 49 to 51 i think and i can only solo them pet-chaining. one wolf<br/>
&gt; needs up to four, sometimes five (air) pets.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ahh. No good for me cuz I can&#39;t have pets and can&#39;t solo. lol.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; getting there can be sort of an adventure for non-porters:<br/>
&gt;     Cobalt Scar -&gt; Siren&#39;s Grotto -&gt; Western Wastes<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ahh.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; it is really nice to have a wizzy and druid alt... especially<br/>
&gt; if they are on another account and you have more than one<br/>
&gt; system to play... :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can barely stay connected with one account... I only get about 9k<br/>
bandwidth if one other person uses the &#39;net on my network.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; and having a cleric on a third account with even one more<br/>
&gt; system availible to play, makes me feel much better hunting<br/>
&gt; there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh, I wouldn&#39;t be able to even open the patch checker with that many<br/>
accounts.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; huh... did i mention i am maxxed ally on CoV faction (those<br/>
&gt; drakes in Skyshrine)... also most of my alts have good CoV<br/>
&gt; faction... it makes it much easier to stay alive in WW.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m dubious or indifferent. :-)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; actually there aren&#39;t many critters i could hunt in WW without<br/>
&gt; hurting my CoV faction. well, and if there is one of those wurms,<br/>
&gt; i just run... or gate...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh. :-)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; here is the link to the mobs:<br/>
&gt;     <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=108">http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=108</a><br/>
&gt; think of this zone like the sandy area of South Ro:<br/>
&gt;  - replace the sand with ice... looks almost like eastern wastes<br/>
&gt;  - replace all the undead with wyverns (CoV faction)<br/>
&gt;  - replace all the spiders with (named) drakes (CoV faction)<br/>
&gt;  - add some Brontos<br/>
&gt;  - add many Ice Burrower (really big wurms)<br/>
&gt;  - add _some_ Velium Hounds<br/>
&gt;  - add some more things that want to kill you...<br/>
&gt;  - and of course some NPCs<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>oh I hate icy snowy stuff. Whenever it snows I get disconnected. and I tend<br/>
to go LD while running over snow/ice graphics for some odd reason.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yeah, but by the time I can actually hit a key I&#39;m kicked. :-( It takes<br/>
 </span></blockquote>me<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; 10 minutes to zone in and then boom. disconnected.<br/>
&gt; argl... this is pretty ugly... :-(((<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; maybe switch to top-down-view before entering the zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can&#39;t, see, I always zonecrash if I zone in from shadowhaven or bazaar. And<br/>
then I have to restart EQ and try to enter. Every other time I manage to get<br/>
in but immediately go LD. Hence why I had to have a GM move me.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; my smallest system (p2/300, 512mb, tnt2) has some problems with<br/>
&gt; the game (old zones are the fastest), but still works pretty good.<br/>
&gt; actually i use that system for my trader and bazaar is no problem at<br/>
&gt; all. about zoning: it is faster than all my other systems...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Cool.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; the bigger systems are a notebook and a desktop, each with a<br/>
&gt; P3 (notebook 1.12GHz, desktop 933MHz) and nVidia chips<br/>
&gt; (notebook geforce 2 go, desktop geforce 3 ti550). all systems<br/>
&gt; have a fixed swap file with 4095MB (limitation is because of<br/>
&gt; windows 2k, i think XP can use bigger ones). most EQ options<br/>
&gt; are turned off, no music, &quot;not much&quot; sound.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a great sound card on mine. :-) And a good processor, good RAM, good<br/>
modem, great vid card... But my phone company is retarded and gave me<br/>
spliced lines so it&#39;s impossible for me to connect at more than 20kbps.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; the notebook gets slower in bazaar at a resolution of 1024x768.<br/>
&gt; the desktop hasn&#39;t too many problems even at 1600x1200. other<br/>
&gt; zones, like wakening lands (eg with many trees, and other stuff)<br/>
&gt; or some of the new LoY zones give those boxes very much<br/>
&gt; trouble.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I use the lowest resolution possible bc the next lowest makes the text too<br/>
small for me to read easily.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; all my systems are connected to the internet using a PPC/G4<br/>
&gt; based linux system connected to DSL (actually the german<br/>
&gt; &quot;T-DSL&quot; variant). the major problems i have is the connection<br/>
&gt; to the states... on the other hand, sometimes it is hard to believe<br/>
&gt; that the servers (eg Tarew Marr) is located overseas.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My computer is the server. DSL and cable internet are not available to me. I<br/>
support a network of 4 other computers. my brother is almost ALWAYS on and<br/>
when he sends an IM or loads a webpage, if I&#39;m in EQ I get kicked out. :-(<br/>
luv,<br/>
