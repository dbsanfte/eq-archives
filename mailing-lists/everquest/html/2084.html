Thanks, Solid advice to me.<br/>
So, it sounds like when I die, I would lose mets say a shield and sword<br/>
then?<br/>
If so, then I get it now.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

  &gt;Hi all,<br/>
  &gt;Forgive my ignorance but I am a newbie had a 4th level Druid in the city<br/>
of<br/>
  Elves and while out at the Orc &gt;Camp, with others, I got killed by an Orc<br/>
  Centurian and when I returned to get my corpse, nothing was &gt;there.  It<br/>
was<br/>
  not more than 4 minutes when I returned.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  No problem. All of us were newbies once.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Question: Is it possible for someone to Steal or Loot my corpse? The book<br/>
  says no but I beg to differ.<br/>
  &gt;Is it possible that I had two corpses out there? Meaning, When I went<br/>
back<br/>
  with a dead body I died again?  &gt;Which meant I found the wrong corpse?<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  You must have found the second corpse. It can be tough sometimes getting<br/>
the<br/>
  right corpse if you die more than once. And sometimes if you don&#39;t have<br/>
any<br/>
  items other than foraged food, you lose the foraged stuff anyways and just<br/>
  get back the food you started with. Up to level 5 I think you get your<br/>
  food/drink and tome of discord back. I think your starting weapon too.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;And to add one last question, &quot;what do I do now? seeing as I have no<br/>
food,<br/>
  no money, no nothing?&quot;  Do I &gt;beg or do I start another char?<br/>
  &gt;This game is totally fun but with the fact of trying to learn which way<br/>
to<br/>
  go all the time and dying, it is starting &gt;to get to me,<br/>
  &gt;I don&#39;t want to give up just yet and I turned to this board since the<br/>
Chat<br/>
  from the game options was &gt;USELESS.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  Well, if it bugs you that much, you can start over again. But even if you<br/>
  lose everything, at that low level you can just keep the character and<br/>
just<br/>
  build your items and such back up again. I recommend that you not carry<br/>
  anything you really don&#39;t want to lose until you get level 6. Keep<br/>
  everything else in the bank. Especially your money. Oh, and practice<br/>
  foraging alot. It will help you later on in the game. Trust me. Begging is<br/>
  not a good idea. Begging tend to piss people off. And you might want to<br/>
  avoid orc camps at that level. at least stay close to the lift with a good<br/>
  group and have someone to pull wandering orc cents. I think even some orc<br/>
  pawns might give you xp at that level.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Please help and Thanks in advance<br/>
  &gt;Rob<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  You&#39;re welcome.<br/>
  luv,<br/>
