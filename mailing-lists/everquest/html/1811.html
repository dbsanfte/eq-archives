<div><font size="2">Yep, that&#39;s very true..but at mid levels that&#39;s easier to do. 
the island in Dagnor&#39;s is a great place to PL tanks from about 13 up, and the DS 
method works well there. You can hit enough to raise skills and get the exp, but 
the DS does enough damage to help you along. </font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt><br>I am not too crazy about using damage shields on very 
  low level players to<br>help them power-level, because the newbie mobs often 
  kill themselves on the<br>damage shields before you can even get in one damage 
  point. When soloing,<br>you have to inflict at least one damage on a mob to 
  get exp. for killing it.<br><br>I know I always hated it when a well-meaning 
  druid would cast Shield of<br>Spikes or whatever on my newbie characters. Gray 
  wolf, orc pawn, fire<br>beetle, bat, goblin whelp etc. -- attack, bingo dead 
  time after time without<br>me getting exp for it.<br><br>Skin and regen is 
  much more helpful, as well as standing by and healing at<br>need.<br><br>My 
  opinion only =)<br><br>----- Original Message -----<br>From: &quot;Richard Ong&quot;

  weapons at low level<br><br><br>&gt; Well, I don&#39;t know much about melee 
  myself either but I can say that<br>&gt; you can DS (Damage Shield) your hubby 
  to power level him as well as<br>&gt; give him Skin Like Rock.&nbsp; Also, 
  buff him up with strength so he can<br>&gt; deal more damage.&nbsp; I&#39;m really 
  not sure if fearing is very effective<br>&gt; to PL because when I tried doing 
  that, they didn&#39;t seem to get much<br>&gt; xp out of it.&nbsp; Well, I can 
  definitely help your hubby get to your<br>&gt; level if you&#39;re on 
  Vazaelle.&nbsp; I doubt it though.&nbsp; Not many poeple<br>&gt; I&#39;ve seen 
  online post that they&#39;re on vazaelle.&nbsp; Cuz I can definitely<br>&gt; help 
  him level.&nbsp; I&#39;m a level 51 druid and I can use my 49 DS and<br>&gt; he&#39;ll 
  kill mobs like they were nothing.&nbsp; It deals 24 points of damage<br>&gt; 
  each time the mob hits the person with the DS.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; --- In

  all,<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; I was wondering if some of you could help 
  me.&nbsp; I got my hubby<br>&gt; involved in EQ<br>&gt; &gt; so he&#39;d stop 
  bugging me to get off the computer.&nbsp; He&#39;s got a 10th<br>&gt; lvl<br>&gt; 
  &gt; halfling fighter, and I know next to nothing about the melee<br>&gt; 
  classes.<br>&gt; &gt; Assuming he&#39;s got about 1000pp to spend, what are his 
  best choices<br>&gt; for armor<br>&gt; &gt; and a decent weapon.&nbsp; He&#39;s 
  got a fine steel longsword right now,<br>&gt; which seems<br>&gt; &gt; to 
  suck, and leather armor.&nbsp; Should he go to bronze or fine steel<br>&gt; 
  armor?<br>&gt; &gt; What does a full suit of either of these cost?&nbsp; And 
  what&#39;s the best<br>&gt; weapon<br>&gt; &gt; for him at this point?<br>&gt; 
  &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Also, I&#39;m trying to powerlevel him just a little so we can 
  go<br>&gt; adventuring<br>&gt; &gt; together, though I&#39;m not generally a fan 
  of leveling people that<br>&gt; don&#39;t know<br>&gt; &gt; what they&#39;re 
  doing.&nbsp; They should die plenty and learn like the rest<br>&gt; of 
  us<br>&gt; &gt; did :P&nbsp; I have a 16 druid and he just needs a couple of 
  levels so<br>&gt; we can<br>&gt; &gt; hang out.&nbsp; Is there a good place to 
  do this quickly?&nbsp; All I can<br>&gt; think of at<br>&gt; &gt; the moment 
  is to fear kite lions and bears, oh my, and let him hack<br>&gt; them 
  up.<br>&gt; &gt; There&#39;s so darn many people in EC these days, though.<br>&gt; 
  &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Thanks for any help!!<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;
