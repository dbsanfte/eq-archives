  <div><br></div><tt>A better an more interesting question, more &quot;correct&quot; 
  answers too, is what 2<br>classes make the best DUO team.&nbsp; I wont say 
  what is best because I guess it<br>might boil down to two players that play 
  well together and not depend on<br>their class too much (par from two straight 
  melee).&nbsp; <br><br>My favorite?&nbsp; Ranger + Enchanter.&nbsp; Outdoor 
  zones fights go something like<br>this enchanter tashs with beserker up or 
  whatever dmg absorb spell they have<br>for that lvl.&nbsp; As enchanter is 
  casting tash he runs at the mob while the<br>ranger starts to cast snare 
  enchanter will get hit and his pet will start to<br>attack.&nbsp; By this time 
  the ranger should have hit the mob and taken agro from<br>the pet (The pet 
  agro patch actually helped enchanter pets a ton.&nbsp; They<br>taunted like 
  nobody&#39;s business and died fairly quick).&nbsp; Enchanter fears and<br>uses 
  his mana wisely nuking when it wont hurt down time more than help by&nbsp; 
  a<br>faster kill.&nbsp; Ranger shouldnt cast any spells but snare and save the 
  rest of<br>his mana for heals depending on what you are fighting a few seconds 
  of non<br>feared mob might take a bub or two.&nbsp; <br><br>Using this tactic 
  an Enchanter Ranger combo can make a great team for<br>outdoor mobs.&nbsp; 
  Yes, you can substitue the ranger class for any class that<br>can snare but 
  there are a few reasons, in my opinion, why rangers make the<br>best 
  choice.<br><br>Necro, he doesnt need an enchanter, he will get faster exp 
  solo, and the<br>only thing the enchanter will bring to the group is haste 
  (necro has this<br>for thier pet, enchanters haste is better at some lvl&#39;s but 
  really not a<br>good enough reason to group with you).&nbsp; Clarity?&nbsp; 
  Necro lich type spells are<br>better at every lvl.<br><br>Shadow Knight, his 
  darkness spell doesnt seem to last very long and unless<br>he has some really 
  good weapons isnt going to do as much dmg as a ranger.<br><br>Druid, too mana 
  dependant over a period of time the ranger will be able to<br>do better for 
  you as the druid will start to go oom with constant fighting.<br><br>Bard, 
  maybe a nice second choice never duo&#39;d with one much.&nbsp; Maybe 
  first,<br>never tried it.<br><br>I have also done this with a warrior that has 
  a snare whip but can make for<br>a nasty fight while waiting on whip to 
  proc.<br><br>Just me rambling at work.&nbsp; <br><br>Mu<br>&nbsp;

  EverQuest@yahoogroups.com<br>Subject: [EverQuest] Subject: Best soloing 
  class<br><br><br>&gt; I am just wondering your thoughts on which class<br>&gt; 
  makes for the best soloing.. all the way from 1-60..<br>&gt; 
  -emily<br><br>This question comes up way way too often, i&#39;ve seen it<br>argued 
  about 20 seperate times on message boards,<br>here&#39;s how it usually plays out. 
  The Necros and Druids<br>immediately leap up and shout &quot;We&#39;re best!&quot; 
  and<br>frankly, they are. Necros and Druids solo better than<br>any other 
  class in EQ. Which is better? It&#39;s largely a<br>matter of personal preferance 
  and where you&#39;re<br>soloing. Then everyone else crowds in on the 
  thread<br>arguing the merits of their pet class. (as in<br>&quot;favorite class&quot;, 
  not Mages ;) Technically really any<br>class can solo, it just involves 
  unmanagable amounts<br>of downtime, picking less than profitable mobs, 
  and<br>unacceptable amounts of risk... unless you&#39;re a Druid<br>or Necro. 
  :)<br><br>Just an afterthought, had to reply to the post<br>questioning Mage&#39;s 
  dominance as &quot;the pet class&quot;, take<br>a look at the message boards on 
  eqvault.ign.com<br>there&#39;s a large thread comparing the Mage Epic pet 
  to<br>the highest level Beastlord 
  pet.<br><br><br>______________________________________________________________________
