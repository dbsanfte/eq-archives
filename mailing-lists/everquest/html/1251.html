<div id="ygrps-yiv-751586209">I, too, play a main healer (cleric), and have encountered this many <br/>
times.  I either decide that the experience is worth it and miss out <br/>
on looting, or I quit the group and look for another.  The tanks <br/>
won&#39;t appreciate what you bring to the group until you are gone.  <br/>
Also, while there are more of the type looter you describe in the <br/>
game, there are many who strive to be fair and succeed.  Perhaps you <br/>
should choose your friends more wisely...  <br/>

Just my 2 cp worth...<br/>

&gt; Recently in some of the groups I&#39;ve been in, we&#39;ve had a few <br/>
problems with<br/>
&gt; loot order. Often, the tanks will insist on FFA. But since I play <br/>
the main<br/>
&gt; healer and am expected to sit and med (only getting up to heal) I <br/>
get<br/>
&gt; totally screwed. I never get loot. But then when we try to <br/>
establish alpha<br/>
&gt; loot some people complain. They don&#39;t care about the casters. All <br/>
they care<br/>
&gt; about is getting loot for themselves. These people partake in<br/>
&gt; &quot;ninja-looting&quot;. They loot everything really fast so nobody else <br/>
gets a<br/>
&gt; chance. And even when we establish a regular loot order some people <br/>
will<br/>
&gt; still loot out of turn.<br/>
&gt; And then we have times when people say we roll for certain types of <br/>
loot.<br/>
&gt; When I first joined a group, this one guy told me it was ffa (and <br/>
he was a<br/>
&gt; ninja-looter) but that &quot;bronze&quot; and ore were rolled for. I saw that <br/>
he<br/>
&gt; picked up an FS morning star and wanted to roll for it (bc it&#39;s an <br/>
expensive<br/>
&gt; item). He said no, it was only for bronze, not FS. So later he <br/>
picked up a<br/>
&gt; bronze weapon. I said, &quot;ok, let&#39;s roll for it&quot;. He said, &quot;no, <br/>
that&#39;s only<br/>
&gt; for bronze armor&quot;...<br/>
&gt; Has anyone else had this problem?<br/>
&gt; What do you think is the best and fairest loot order?<br/>
&gt; Just wondering.<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>
&gt; -Su<br/>
&gt; ps. alpha loot with 3 loots per turn (per person) works pretty well <br/>
when<br/>
&gt; people cooperate. </span></blockquote></div>
