<div>It&#39;s nothing that you need to lower, as a matter of fact it needs to be 
increased.&nbsp; Corruption is a new effect that came out with the TSS 
expansion.&nbsp; On your inventory it is listed as one of your resists and like 
your other resists has to be raised to become more effective.&nbsp; In the older 
zones it likely will not matter but in the new zones the higher your corruption 
resist the more likely you will be to resist the effect when you do encounter 
it.&nbsp; No fear however, if you do become corrupted several classes have also 
been given new spells with the TSS expansion&nbsp;that cure corruption such as 
the druids, shamans &amp; clerics.&nbsp; </div>
