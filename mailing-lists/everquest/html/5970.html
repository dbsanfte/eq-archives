<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Just goes to show, you can&#39;t please all the people 
even some of the time.&nbsp; If you&#39;re so hell bent against the game, then why 
are you even on this list???</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I don&#39;t believe your argument that EQ2 was rushed 
either.&nbsp; Considering there was word of EQ2 in development long before there 
was ever a release date set, considering the game was in closed beta for months 
before we ever got a peek at it, considering it was in open beta for several 
months BEFORE it went live, AND considering the release date was even pushed 
back so tha tit came out later than it was supposed to, I seriously have a hard 
time believing it ws a rush job.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">And apparently you don&#39;t know anything about 
business.&nbsp; It would seem to me that to be competitive in the market place 
you have to take into account things like the release of other games and 
holidays and so on.&nbsp; Let&#39;s face it, Sony Online Entertainment is a 
profiteering company.&nbsp; they want to make money just like the rest of 
us.&nbsp; If they have to cut a few edges to get the product out in manner to be 
more competitive with other companies, then that&#39;s what they have to do.&nbsp; 
Since the game is an ongoing development, they can always add the stuff after 
the fact.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">As far as I&#39;m concerned they did a damn good job 
with EQ2 and I think they will continue to do a damn good job with it.&nbsp; EQ2 
had far more content to it than Lineage II did when L2 was released.&nbsp; 
</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Besides, SOE is only adding the stuff that people 
are asking for anyway, so if we don&#39;t like it, we can&#39;t complain cause we&#39;re the 
ones who asked for it.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">If you really don&#39;t enjoy the game, then why are 
you here?&nbsp; This list is supposed to be for people that like EverQuest and 
want to see it grow, not for people who are going to argue every single little 
nitpicky thing wrong with the game or SOE.&nbsp; </font></div>

  <br>&gt; No, it actually makes it tougher. There&#39;s no more<br>&gt; single 
  pulling, or FD splitting. If you get a mob<br>&gt; linked with 3 other mobs, 
  they&#39;re all coming, and<br>&gt; you&#39;d better be ready for them.<br><br>It&#39;s 
  not tougher.&nbsp; You know exactly how many are coming and you can plan 
  <br>for it.&nbsp; EQ had &quot;linked&quot; mobs too, but you didn&#39;t know how many were 
  <br>coming.&nbsp; WoW has linked mobs, but you really can&#39;t tell which ones 
  are <br>coming.<br><br>EQ2 was a rushed product that probably needs about 6 
  more months of <br>development time.&nbsp; They rushed it out because of WoW 
  and Christmas.&nbsp; Not <br>much of a surprise since SoE drove EQ into the 
  ground as well.<br><br></tt><br><br></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
