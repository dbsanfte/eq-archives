<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1491399351">Fellow adventurers,<br/>
<br/>
I come to you to seek knowledge from you on two questions.<br/>
<br/>
1) Where can I find more information on lore items such as &quot;Tergon&#39;s<br/>
Spellbook,&quot; &quot;Staff Segment,&quot; &quot;Mace Handle,&quot; and such.  I have acquired<br/>
these lore items in my adventures, but have no idea what to do with<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
2) I have read the tips provided thus far on gaining/improving<br/>
languages, but how do you improve one like combine language, elder tier<br/>
dal, old erudian, froglok, fraerie, gnoll, orc, or gaint without<br/>
spending a large amount of training points to improve.  I have learned<br/>
many of the common languages by traveling with speakers of those<br/>
languages and exchanging training of one language for another.<br/>
<br/>
Your assistance in these matters will be appreicated.<br/>
