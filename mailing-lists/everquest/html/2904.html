<div id="ygrps-yiv-306163151">Hi Everyone,<br/>
I have been on this board and playing since January. <br/>
So YES I am a newbie.<br/>
I have three chars between 10 and 20 in level.  My<br/>
question is this.<br/>
<br/>
�Are the trade skills really good and do they play a<br/>
part of succeeding at higher levels?�<br/>
Here is why I ask.  My friend is a level 17 druid and<br/>
a tailor.  He can�t make armor that my level 13 Ranger<br/>
can use that is worthwhile to me.  I bought some mail<br/>
boots and chest armor, which are far better than what<br/>
he can make.<br/>
<br/>
I am also doing pottery with my Druid and I can�t see<br/>
any value to this trade.  If I make 30 muffin tins, is<br/>
some baker really going to buy the lot off me?<br/>
<br/>
I feel that as I get up in level, I will be able to<br/>
get better Drop items than I can make.<br/>
However, I do know that trades take part in some<br/>
quests and this is the only purpose I can see for<br/>
them.  I think<br/>
<br/>
Am I missing something here?<br/>
<br/>
Trade confused!<br/>
<br/>
