<div id="ygrps-yiv-907971374">This thread is cracking me up.  Anyways, I know that one of the <br/>
largest guilds out there, Sisterhood of the Rose??, is all female <br/>
toons, and like 300+ members.  I don&#39;t know how many are actual <br/>
female gamers.  I can tell you that three of the best gamers I play <br/>
with are women.  They are guildmates, and I know they&#39;re female <br/>
because their significant others are also in the guild.  They have <br/>
all been playing a LONG time and know the game well.<br/>
<br/>
Good to know threads don&#39;t always have to be about critical gaming <br/>
strategies. :)<br/>
