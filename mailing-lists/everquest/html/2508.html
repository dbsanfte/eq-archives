<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838236300">Thanks for this info Rob.  Actually i set them up on<br/>
Fennin even though I had to pick some different names<br/>
and change the spelling of my dear Barbarian Naara. <br/>
On Fennin she is Naera...then I have my Druid, Amaiya<br/>
and my Cleric is Diahni(pronounced Dieawnee)...I even<br/>
have my own account now WOOOOWHOOOOO....I have also<br/>
kept my characters on Ayonae and will play them on<br/>
occasion I am sure since they are very special to<br/>
me...Thanks for the website into..Have been to<br/>
Alakazam but not Everlore...will check that one out at<br/>
lunch  :-) Wish I had read this post before I set up<br/>
the new characters so I could have gone to Druzzil...I<br/>
still have some &quot;characters&quot; left...I could make one<br/>
for Druzzil yes?  Ok, back to work with me...<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; You can go to sites like Alakazam and Everlore.com<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; find Great info without someone leading you by the<br/>
&gt; hand.  It gives pointers and ideas which should help<br/>
&gt; you build a character.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Be careful in Kelethin since it is a hard area to<br/>
&gt; learn.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, you need to hunt.  The only way you will level.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good luck and if you choose Druzzil , let me know<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good Luck<br/>

&gt; &gt; Ok..i have decided my new character will probably<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; Wood Elf Druid, i think i have her name picked out<br/>
&gt; &gt; (even a last name should i EVER get that far..lol)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Not<br/>
&gt; &gt; sure what server i will play on yet but....my<br/>
&gt; &gt; question<br/>
&gt; &gt; is, is there anywhere i can read about what i<br/>
&gt; should<br/>
&gt; &gt; do first as a new character and yadda, yadda,<br/>
&gt; &gt; yadda....See the problem with my boyfriend being<br/>
&gt; &gt; experienced in the game is that he did it ALL for<br/>
&gt; &gt; me,<br/>
&gt; &gt; or led me around by the collar doing it all for me<br/>
&gt; &gt; :-P...i want to do this on my own and have no idea<br/>
&gt; &gt; where to start...Do i just jump out there and<br/>
&gt; start<br/>
&gt; &gt; killing critters or run around and hope i can find<br/>
&gt; &gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt; way back from wherever i leave??  i know i sound<br/>
&gt; &gt; foolish but it is really important to do this on<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt; own..how else can one really learn??  Help is<br/>
&gt; great<br/>
&gt; &gt; and i really do appreciate it but i also want to<br/>
&gt; &gt; feel<br/>
&gt; &gt; like i have accomplished something<br/>
&gt; personally...Does<br/>
&gt; &gt; that make sense...<br/>
