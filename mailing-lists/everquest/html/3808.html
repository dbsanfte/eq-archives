<p class="ygrps-yiv-1028559112MsoNormal" style="MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="FONT-SIZE:14pt;FONT-FAMILY:Perpetua;"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size="2"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#6000bf">&nbsp; </font></span><font color="#6000bf">Our story starts out when Kat&#39;s husband, Rakshaka, was asked by a ranger friend, if he would like to go on an adventure&nbsp;to kill the evil Lord Nagafen, who had recently been terrorizing the area of Lavastorm. (Our ranger friend had been tracking the evil Lord for many weeks trying to discover any of his whereabouts).&nbsp; Rak needs&nbsp;a red dragon scale for his Bard epic, so he figured it would be fun to go along on this little adventure.&nbsp; Now,&nbsp;as Rak&#39;s wife,&nbsp;Kat felt it was her duty to go along and make sure that Rak had a better chance of living through the ordeal, and slaying Lord Nagafen, by using her ability to draw upon the powers of the spirits of her ancestors to enhance the abilities of others.<br><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Rak and his pretty little wife Kat neared the corner of the world where it was believed Lord Nagafen was hiding out, Kat began to get a little nervous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had only seen one other dragon in her days of walking Norath, and that dragon (Lady Vox), and her Ice Giants, wiped out her whole adventuring party in a matter of seconds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The recovery of those lost was a long, time consuming process, so you can understand Kat�s reluctance to go, but as Rak�s wife, she felt that it was her duty to protect him at all costs.<br><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There were many evil creatures, including fire giants, which had to be killed in order to get to Lord Nagafen�s lair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The party successfully cleared out the&nbsp;Fire Giants&nbsp;quickly, and with a minimum of casualties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They then had Lord Nagafen trapped in his lair, and decided before they continued any further, they would stop for the evening and rest up, so they would be fresh for the big battle with the evil dragon. The next morning they awoke refreshed, and ready for battle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Kat called upon her Shamanistic powers to enhance the party�s strength, and fortitude, so they would have a better chance of slaying Lord Nagafen.<br><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The time for battle� Lord Nagafen was fully prepared for this group of adventurers, and within a matter of minutes had killed the whole party. We had a few very kind, brave people who were able to collect our bodies and bring them back to our camp spot from the night before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the help of several clerics, we were able to return back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><br><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now, this was no ordinary band of adventurers, there was no way they were going to give up so easily, so they got rested up and decided to go for it again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lord Nagafen underestimated this party, believing this was the last he would see of them, and feeling safe, he let his guard down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The band of adventurers rushed in and caught the dragon by surprise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They managed to do some serious damage to him this time, before they started dying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once again, the party was slain. The brave rescuers managed to get everybody back, and the wonderful clerics were once again able to resurrect the adventurers.<br><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Being the hardy group that they were, they decided to recruit some friends, and have a go at Lord Nagafen one more time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They rested up a while, and went right back in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, Lord Nagafen was wizened to this party, and was better prepared for them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were slain very quickly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a rather long and difficult rescue, and once all the resurrections were done, the party decided to go back to their homes and try another day when they were better prepared, and had a bigger force.</font></font></font></span></p> 
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE:14pt;FONT-FAMILY:Perpetua;"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size="2"><font color="#6000bf">Wonderful people, our story does not end here� no it does not.</font></font></font></span></p> 
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE:14pt;FONT-FAMILY:Perpetua;"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size="2"><font color="#6000bf"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now, our main character Katashaka bound herself close to the lair, so that if she died, she would be close at hand to help after the spirits restored her soul to Norrath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she returned home, she was so exhausted that she went strait to bed, and forgot to bind herself close to home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><br><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Katashaka went to the aid of a friend in another part of the world, and when that was complete, decided to gate back to her home, completely forgetting that she was not bound at home, but very close to the lair of the evil dragon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she arrived at the spot, she was surprised to find another party of adventurers trying to do what her party failed to do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She felt very lucky, as Lord Nagafen has many minions, and it is very possible that he could have summoned more of them to his lair for reinforcements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While Kat was making arrangements with a wizard to help the party out, for payment to get sent back to her home, one of Lord Nagafen�s fire Giants arrived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This party was ill prepared for this unexpected arrival, thus all were slain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Unfortunately, our dear Kat was slain twice)<br><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With the help of a friend, Katashaka was able to get out of one of the most horrid things that could ever happen to someone, with a minimum of death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, for those of you who don�t know it, there is a horrid thing called a bind death loop, this is where a person is bound near a creature that does not like them, and every time the spirits of the realm restore this person to Norrath, they are killed almost immediately upon re-entry to the world. <br><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fortunately our girl Kat was able to get a high level resurrection, and was also able to return to her home, where she immediately bound herself next to her bed, so this would never happen again.</font></font></font></span></p> 
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE:14pt;FONT-FAMILY:Perpetua;"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size="2"><font color="#6000bf">My friends, there is a moral to this story. If you are going to bind yourself close to an enemy, remember that when you are done, you need to be sure to bind closer to home.</font></font></font></span></p>
