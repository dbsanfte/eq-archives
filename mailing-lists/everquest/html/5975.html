<div id="ygrps-yiv-614014700">Someone had their Hatorade today huh?  Dude, it&#39;s just a game, and a <br/>
damned good one at that.  Just because YOU think it sucks, doesn&#39;t <br/>
make it so.  Besides, if you don&#39;t like it, you know where the camp <br/>
button is.  AND Wulf, I don&#39;t think he feeds trolls, I think he puts <br/>
itching powder in their drawers.  That&#39;s why they&#39;re always <br/>
scratching their bums!</div>
