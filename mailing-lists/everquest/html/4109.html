<div id="ygrps-yiv-1625941213">Well, lol, there are several zones, which are areas that you enter, <br/>
takes a loading time, and have different creatures. some cities have <br/>
seperate zones. eq is meant to play in rp, or just regularly in your <br/>
own style. you can meet friends, make money in game and buy items, <br/>
become very strong and help out friends if you wish. the enemies only <br/>
attack if they hate you, except for some that attack anything. you <br/>
can duel other players if you wish, making them enemies or you can <br/>
just turn in the book of discord. when being a rogue, dont pickpocket <br/>
the guards, they will kill you. you can stop attacking a monster and <br/>
pickpocket and attack again as a strategy. joining a guild isnt <br/>
really something you would like to do at low levels. you can join <br/>
one, and if lucky one that is really helpful. they can help, or you <br/>
can help them, say epic weapons? those take long most of the time and <br/>
you usually have to kill a hard monster. sometimes guild members <br/>
pitch in for a tradeskill you are currently doing.<br/>
There are city peoples, such as merchants, guards, and quest npc&#39;s. <br/>
you can pickpocket them, but you might die. you can run to zone and <br/>
off their hate list, but that might not happen. so dont try to steal <br/>
from good npc&#39;s, just monsters.</div>
