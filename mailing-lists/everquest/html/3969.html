  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">No, it definitely does not cost.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; 
  It is my home, and I can&#39;t imagine playing anywhere else! But know that it is 
  &quot;roleplaying preferred&quot;... it is as rich an experience as you choose to bring 
  to it -- no more, no less. Play it as you would have it played, and those 
  like-minded souls around you will respond in kind.&nbsp;&nbsp; :-)&nbsp;
