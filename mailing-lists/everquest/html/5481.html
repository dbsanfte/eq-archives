<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880006917">Since we are in a story telling mood, and to get some things jump <br/>
started, I though I&#39;d ask this.  Do you remember your first GM <br/>
event?  Or even the most memorable.  <br/>
<br/>
Now I know some of you are asking what are those!  Back in the olden <br/>
days of Everquest, before the new planes were revealed, before the <br/>
Nexus opened and the moon Luclin moved closer to us, before the great <br/>
ice sheet that is Velious was found there were mythical beings that <br/>
walked the land called GM&#39;s.  On certain occasions they would come <br/>
down to the lands of Norrath and alter them.  Sometimes they played <br/>
tricks, or reset a zone to their own liking.  Some of you may have <br/>
experienced this over Christmas, or during Halloween.<br/>
<br/>
When Tuldayen was a young and very inexperienced Ranger roaming the <br/>
hills around Qeynos he was involved in such an event.  He awoke one <br/>
morning to find himself in the quiet of Surefall Glade.  He took up <br/>
his trusty Hickory Bow and sheathed his now only tarnished long sword <br/>
and ventured out into the still unfamiliar hills.  But when he <br/>
entered the tunnel he was met by several of the evil undead.  He was <br/>
lucky enough to jump back into the protection of the glade and <br/>
avoided death.  He thought to himself &quot;where are those guards&quot; and <br/>
ventured out again.<br/>
<br/>
He was amazed by what he found.  The sky was a deep red, blood red.  <br/>
The entire land was filled with all manner of Skeletons.  Many were <br/>
familiar to him, but many more were not and some were 30 feet tall!  <br/>
It was as if the ancient battlefields of Norrath had spilled their <br/>
dead on the land.  Then he heard the wails of Varsoon the undying and <br/>
saw great magicks near the ruins.  He ran for his life toward the <br/>
City of Qeynos.  When he looked back there were a dozen of the evil <br/>
creatures behind him.  He made it to the city and found many like <br/>
him.  Parties were formed and we headed back to the hills to destroy <br/>
what evil we could.  Oh, many of us fell that day.  We had the good <br/>
fortune to have obtained a bind in the city.  Experience was gained <br/>
and lost, many of us found better weapons amongst the shattered bones <br/>
and plenty of gold was found.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually the hills filled with powerful adventurers and the Guilds <br/>
called upon their members to gather for the war.  The Undead War <br/>
raged for days in the hills around Qeynos until at last enough blood <br/>
had been spilled to satisify any God.  Or GM! ;)<br/>
<br/>
This was a 1-35 event that went for 8 actual hours.  Tell us your <br/>
story, and I&#39;ll tell you about day werewolves ravaged the West <br/>
Commonlands!</div>
