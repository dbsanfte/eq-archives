<div id="ygrps-yiv-1666163991">See that&#39;s cool, I can see where he would be some fun. I was thinking<br/>
originally that there was some function like a pet. I&#39;ve seen some of<br/>
the familiars that wiz&#39;s have and they are really cool. By &quot;Flappy&quot; I&#39;m<br/>
guessing that you have one of those little winged demon looking things?<br/>
Those are just so cool! <br/>
<br/>
Hey if your ever online look me up and maybe we can group. Granted I<br/>
don&#39;t have the highest level of characters but they do ok. ;-)<br/>

LOL I call mine Flappy too and feed him treats, emote him purring,<br/>
biting ppl who are snotty to me, etc. It&#39;s at least a cool idea...and<br/>
really, a actual pet of any sort would make a wiz overpowered if you<br/>
think about it. I&#39;m content with my lil guy, even if he is just a<br/>
visible buff.</div>
