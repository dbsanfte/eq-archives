<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782246110">Oh yea! I just went out and looked again and your right. Ok! :) Another<br/>
thing I would like to see SOE or Verant do is make a book with all the<br/>
quests/skills in them including pics and stuff of the items and people<br/>
involved. This would be so much nicer than trying to have to remember<br/>
what items you need because as forgetful as I am I write them down and<br/>
then I misplace the paper! lol<br/>

We know this because you can see previews of the maps<br/>
on EQ main site. I agree - Verant would be better<br/>
served to support Muse and EQAtlas.</div>
