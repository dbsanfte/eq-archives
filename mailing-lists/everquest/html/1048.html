<div id="ygrps-yiv-752334443"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">After onelist it became egroups and now it&#39;s yahoogroups. &nbsp;Go to 
<br>www.yahoogroups.com and if you don&#39;t have a yahoo email address, then you 
<br>have to sign up for one before it will let you do anything. &nbsp;This totally 
<br>urked me and I wrote a letter to yahoo complaining about having to get a 
<br>stupid yahoo email address when I didn&#39;t want one and would never use it. &nbsp;
<br>Anyway after you do that you can go to the everquest list and do whatever 
<br>needs done.
