<br/>
If from all of this you refer to people being able to<br/>
use the trade to make a profit from other PCs, then I<br/>
agree wholeheartedly.  It&#39;d be nice if all the trades<br/>
were PC desirable as far as produced product is<br/>
concerned.<br/>
<br/>
If, however, you refer to people being able to profit<br/>
from the NPCs, I must resoundingly disagree. <br/>
Everquest is different from UO in that macros and such<br/>
aren&#39;t usable in EQ; but the potential for abuse still<br/>
exists.  To be able to take an evening (3-6 hours) to<br/>
crank out ten or twenty plat an hour of profit off the<br/>
NPCs has far too much potential for abuse.<br/>
<br/>
Prices in the game, both vendor and player, are<br/>
generally set to encourage certain &#39;level ranges&#39; of<br/>
buyers; a first level character shouldn&#39;t be able to<br/>
afford to buy a Polished Granite Tomahawk, or a pair<br/>
of Dusty Bloodstained Gloves.<br/>
<br/>
NPC profit is abuseable because you can, literally,<br/>
stand there and crank out a vast quantity of product<br/>
to sell to the poor vendor; in real life the guy would<br/>
eventually tell you he really did have all the pie<br/>
tins (or whatever) that he needed for now (and the<br/>
next three years).  NPCs in a computer game will keep<br/>
taking.  If they implemented a &#39;volume based reaction&#39;<br/>
to the vendor prices, people would scream bloody<br/>
murder.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If that were the case, you&#39;d have only a small<br/>
&gt; amount of people really taking advantage of it,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, reference the insanse amount of screaming done<br/>
over the recent Verant fix to Brewing (removing the<br/>
twinkable profit level from it).  Small, no.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My argument is really about making money.<br/>
&gt; Adventuring is what this game is all about, but<br/>
&gt; killing things shouldn&#39;t be the only way. It&#39;d be<br/>
&gt; great for my situation, because of the limited hours<br/>
&gt; I can play it&#39;s hard to form a group and go<br/>
&gt; adventuring, so I have to solo a lot. But right now<br/>
&gt; I have 4 characters at 5th level, and it&#39;s hard<br/>
&gt; getting to the next step without a group. If I could<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You will typically solo until you hit double digits<br/>
(10+), and even after that will still only group some<br/>
of the time.  Most people hanging out in the &#39;outdoor<br/>
areas&#39; (Commonlands, GFaydark, Butcherblock, Ro<br/>
Desert) won&#39;t group up (for whatever reason).  When<br/>
you get to the midteens and start visiting dungeons<br/>
(Befallen, Runnyeye, etc...), you&#39;ll be able to group<br/>
consistently and constantly.  DO NOT judge the game,<br/>
the economy, or the grouping situation; do not judge<br/>
*anything* about Everquest based on what you see at<br/>
any level below at least 15, and probably 20.  The<br/>
game is different for newbies and youngsters than it<br/>
is after you put some levels on your character.<br/>
<br/>
Including the money.  At 15th, visiting dungeons, I<br/>
began to make *good* money with my character; it all<br/>
changes at that point.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; spend a few days making some money to better equip<br/>
&gt; myself, it would be a lot easier.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is the abuseable part I describe above.  5th<br/>
level characters shouldn&#39;t be able to afford to outfit<br/>
themselves with full banded or a combine weapon or whatever.<br/>
