<div id="ygrps-yiv-379951784">I was wondering if anyone out there has tried pottery yet?  I&#39;m a<br/>
level 11 cleric with 50 trains saved up and had heard that eventually<br/>
with pottery you can make armor molds.  This would be really nice<br/>
because our guild smith wouldn&#39;t have to buy molds.  So if you have<br/>
any info on pottery please share or if you&#39;ve seen any guides on a web<br/>
page that would be nice too since I haven&#39;t found any on EQvault and<br/>
Stratics.<br/>
