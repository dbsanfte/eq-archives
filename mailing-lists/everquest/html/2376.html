<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759174473">I am really new at the game (have been playing only about a <br/>
month)...i am on the Ayonae Ro server with a couple of characters <br/>
(lvl 9 Barb Warrior and lvl 5 Cleric...told you I was new...LOL) Was <br/>
just curious if anyone else in on that server...usually am hunting <br/>
with the love of my life who is teaching me the game but would be fun <br/>
to pass a friendly &quot;Hail&quot; to those here on the list should our paths <br/>
cross...would that be proper and acceptable EQ etiquette??  Just <br/>
curious  :-)<br/>
