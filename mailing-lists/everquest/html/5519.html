<div id="ygrps-yiv-923665641">Hello, yes as mentioned a few times begging is useless.  You have pretty<br/>
much wasted that time working on your begging skill.  Why do you have<br/>
direction sense?  Norrath is a huge world..you will soon answer your own<br/>
question on that.  And safe fall, just keep doing what you are doing to<br/>
build it up, practice Mend with Safe Fall whenever you take too much damage.<br/>
Remember you can only use Mend every 6 minutes.  I suggest working on that<br/>
skill the most..if your skill in Mend is 5 then it will only work 5% of the<br/>
time.  Plus a couple things to remember as a monk do not carry more than<br/>
14lbs..do it and your AC will suffer.  Balence your weapon skills meaning<br/>
use a 1hb in one hand and a hand to hand weapon in the other hand or<br/>
whatever.  Once you get Feign Death practice that skill as much as you can,<br/>
it will save your life many times.  And also not all the characters are<br/>
white, Eurdites are of course black and the dark elves, trolls, vah shir,<br/>
and froglocks are their own colors/races.  Well that is it Happy Hunting.<br/>

<br/>
Ok, I&#39;m new to this group and to playing EQ.  <br/>
<br/>
My questions may be redundant to those asked by others here or even <br/>
off the wall but her goes.<br/>
<br/>
Does any one use begging?<br/>
<br/>
I have built mine to 23 (not real hi I know but the character is only <br/>
9th level) so far all it has done is get me 2 copper and attacked <br/>
twice.  Not good odds (one attack per copper).<br/>
<br/>
Why do I have direction sense?  And why would you buy a compass?<br/>
<br/>
I have a compass on my screen.  I already know what direction I am <br/>
facing.  My direction sense is at 200 and it still only works about <br/>
60% of the time.<br/>
<br/>
As a monk, how do I improve my safe fall skill without spending all <br/>
my points on it?<br/>
<br/>
I keep jumping off tall things and taking damage but no improvement.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why are all the characters white?  What if I want to play a black <br/>
person?<br/>
<br/>
Well that&#39;s about it for now.  I look foreword (because my eyes are <br/>
in the front of my head :P ) to your answers.<br/>
