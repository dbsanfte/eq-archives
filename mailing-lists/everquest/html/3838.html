<div id="ygrps-yiv-249549853">I have not been playing EQ for years but I have played<br/>
for about 10 months and I feel I need to shed some<br/>
food for thought on this topic.......<br/>
<br/>
I can see why people suggest Stamina but I think it<br/>
depends on a few factors first.  If you are totally<br/>
new and don&#39;t know much about EQ NOR have a high level<br/>
alt, I would Really have to say to put the extra in<br/>
Str.  The reason is because Chainmail is still heavy<br/>
and when have a full suit of Mail you will have about<br/>
10-20 pts of weight to allow for loot.  This is not<br/>
much at all.<br/>
<br/>
NOW, if you have an alt and are twinked, we all know<br/>
what this means, then I can see why to put in Stamina.<br/>
 Since most will have a full suit of Ivory etched<br/>
armow which does not weight all that much as compared<br/>
to Chain.  Plus twinks will tend to CHAIN pull, like<br/>
the example we saw in the keep.  Meaning, pulling so<br/>
much or the ranger being the main tank that you need<br/>
to worry about Stamina.  If you have one or two<br/>
warriors, a ranger should not worry about STA since<br/>
his/her role is to assist and draw aggro if tank gets<br/>
hurt to bad.  Also, Druids are so numerous that at<br/>
after level 25 they can cast Endure Fatigue which<br/>
boosts your STA to full status.  So, if you are<br/>
careful in picking your groups, you should be ok with<br/>
STA.  The other thing that drains sta is a BIG TWINK<br/>
weapon that is Heavy..  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Summary:  For a totally new player I still suggest STR<br/>
and rely on others to assist in your flaws, like the<br/>
druid partner.  If you have alts and good weaps, then<br/>
yes maybe STA is the way to go.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, make two rangers and play them til about<br/>
level 20, which is not that hard once you get to know<br/>
the zones, then decide for yourself which char is<br/>
better based upon your playing style...<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps but this is obviously open for debate,<br/>
it really is a personal choice.<br/>
