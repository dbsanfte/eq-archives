<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I realize I am new to the group and all, but I feel 
I have to respond to this.&nbsp; While it is true that Rangers don&#39;t have the 
hitpoints of Paladins, Shadowknights, and Warriors (even with the same gear and 
stats).&nbsp; You have to keep in mind, that Rangers are not tanks (well, at 
least not post 25ish), but are more in the line of&nbsp;a light offensive class, 
with excellent agro control.&nbsp; It is true that they do not have as high of 
an AC as a pure tank,&nbsp;Pally, or SK, due to the fact that there is very 
little in the way of plate armor that&nbsp;they can wear.&nbsp; As far as 
soloability, they are the most efficient melee based class for soloing, even 
prior to getting panic animal at 22.&nbsp; I know this&nbsp;is true, as other 
than from 12 to 15, and 21 to 25, I have just about exclusively soloed mine (and 
very little of it has been on animals).&nbsp; I&#39;ve even grouped with a higher 
level Ogre warrior (i was&nbsp;40, he was 45), and peeled the&nbsp;mob off of 
him for a time, due to the healer being lom, and held it til the ogre&nbsp;got 
healed.&nbsp; If The Ranger in your group is dying a lot, then one (or more) of 
several things is true:&nbsp; either the MT is not doing his job with damage and 
taunt, the ranger is not doing efficient agro&nbsp;control, the healer is not 
keeping up with the damage done, or&nbsp;the ranger has not focused as much on 
AC as he/she should have.</font></div>

  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">Yeah they seem like they would be really good in 
  the high end game. I think they are kind of hard to play in groups though as 
  they don&#39;t have many hit points and die a lot. </font></div>

    A ranger is a tough class to play. I played one to 40, I don&#39;t 
    recommend<br>it,<br>&gt; I think they stink, but they are good for fooling 
    around with.<br><br>Rangers aren&#39;t tough to play at all.&nbsp; While htey 
    are group dependant until<br>they get Panic Animal at 22, they are excellent 
    characters in teh high end<br>game.&nbsp; There aren&#39;t too many classes that 
    can do the damage they can AND<br>still be able to control aggro as well 
    they do.&nbsp; And they are the masters of<br>outdoor pulling.<br><br>&gt; 
    There are characters that you use for the high end game, and 
    characters<br>used<br>&gt; just for fooling around and making money, and 
    characters used for their<br>sheer power.<br><br>And well, any class can 
    fill any of these roles.<br><br></tt><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at
