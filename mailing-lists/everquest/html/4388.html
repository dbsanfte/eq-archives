<div id="ygrps-yiv-335513264"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;but wait ... where is Clurg now? the trolls had to leave their home<br/>
&gt; tome and have to stay in neriak now ... %-&<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you mean that Clurg&#39;s goon has left Ogguk and I might be able to <br/>
&gt; give him the Stein components? I a bit lost - as usual LOL<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>stupid me... sorry, i mixed up some things: Clurg is an Ogre not a Troll.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;there are three classes who you should be looking for:<br/>
&gt; - rogues: if you know the location where you died, but other classes <br/>
&gt; have problems to get there and back again, get an rogue. the <br/>
&gt; sneak&hide makes them invisible to most of the critters throughout <br/>
&gt; the world.<br/>
&gt; - necros & SKs: they can summon a corpse ... it isn&#39;t cheap,<br/>
&gt; but before you will loose some &quot;special&quot; items, they can help.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does these classes RES you? And could I make myself a Rogue, SK or <br/>
&gt; Necro and RES my Enchantress corpse?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>only clerics, pallies and necros can res. i know clerics can do this<br/>
very early, but i am not so sure about pallies. necros have to be<br/>
50+ to res... not sure about the level.<br/>
<br/>
necros (and SKs, not sure about level) can summon the corpse<br/>
to you. the spell needs a component which costs some PP.<br/>
<br/>
besides, a corpse will only remain in game for a certain time. after<br/>
that time it goes away, with all the things on it.<br/>
<br/>
i don&#39;t think the game allows to RES yourself, but you can consent<br/>
one of your alts to pull your corpse.<br/>
