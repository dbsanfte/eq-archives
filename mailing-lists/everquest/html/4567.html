Stay away from the Elf towns and you&#39;ll be ok.  EQOA has no plans to include PVP as far as I know. There are lots of places Dark Elves are welcome, have you been to Freeport yet?  That town is an evil town, still seems strange to see Trolls walking around Freeport.  Have fun.<br/>

You didn&#39;t get waxed by another player then.  If there is no PVP on the PS2 version then you got waxed by an NPC.  And assuming the PS2 version remains true to the computer game, Freeport initself is not an inherently evil town.  Freeport is just having internal problems.  <br/>
<br/>
--------------------<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s more than that in EQOA.  Trolls and Dark Elves can walk freely all over the town without doing any faction work.  They made the alignment evil so that the evil characters can use that coachman to get around.  There were complaints that evils didn&#39;t have enough coaches and Freeport is one of the coaches you need to link up some of the other coaches so they really needed to be welcome in Freeport.  I still don&#39;t have to like it tho, hehe<br/>
<br/>
I was in all 3 betas and I&#39;ve had a current account since launch day even though I can&#39;t play as much as I want to anymore.</div>
