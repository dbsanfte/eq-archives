<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007620342">I&#39;ve always wondered how EQ played on the ps2.  I came really close to<br/>
buying a ps2 just so I could try it once *chuckle*  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well scott, its just like you would on the pc, i would assume. You<br/>
make you characters, and you build them just like you would on pc.<br/>
Like for example, You have 8 toons a server u can make. I only play on<br/>
one, but i have all my spots taken up. Partly because i get bored<br/>
playin one toon and partly because I like to have a variety. My first,<br/>
fav and my main would be my 60 dwarf burgular (Rogue). Then i also<br/>
have a 60 Erudite Pyromancer/Aeromancer (Mage), 60 Elf<br/>
metabolist(Alchemist), 60 Stack faithful (Cleric), 42 Elf Wizard, 33<br/>
Barbarian Warrior, 32 Human monk, and last but not least 32 Dark Elf<br/>
enchanter. I also have a sha on my boyfriends account. But as you see<br/>
its quiet the same, We xp, we raid, we do pretty much the same thing.<br/>
I would assume the jist is the same but computer might seem a lil more<br/>
complicated. You really should buy the ps2 version and try it out.<br/>
This is my first game like this and i love it. I hope that answers<br/>
your question a lil bit....Talk to you laters</div>
