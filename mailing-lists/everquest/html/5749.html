Find someone who knows the game, get taught everything<br/>
you can learn about the game and then run with your<br/>
knowledge and become knowledgable in the game itself.<br/>
<br/>
Gotta love those 50+ clerics who don&#39;t know what<br/>
Unrest or Befallen is.<br/>
<br/>
There is so much to the game. I have played for 2+<br/>
years and still develop my play style today.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>

&gt; Using Kazaa Lite (not plain Kazaa, it will jack up<br/>
&gt; your PC) I found a ton of<br/>
&gt; EQ cheat, hack plat-making, etc guides.  I<br/>
&gt; downloaded some and if they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; involve anything illegal I would be willing to post<br/>
&gt; them to the files<br/>
&gt; section of the group for those that don&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt; mess with file-sharing<br/>
&gt; programs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For $5 less then the guide you can buy 10,000 plat<br/>
&gt; if that is what you want.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Be careful with power-leveling.  It is a great way<br/>
&gt; to make a high-leveled<br/>
&gt; character that is pretty useless.  In some games it<br/>
&gt; works great since the<br/>
&gt; only way to increase skills is to gain a level. <br/>
&gt; When people come to EQ they<br/>
&gt; do it and end with with a level 30 char with no<br/>
&gt; skills.  You get 5 points<br/>
&gt; for leveling, I normally get 100 - 150 skill points<br/>
&gt; while gaining my level.<br/>
&gt; How are you going to make up for all those lost<br/>
&gt; points?  You do boring stuff<br/>
&gt; over and over and over, that&#39;s how.  When I get to<br/>
&gt; level 30 I won&#39;t need to<br/>
&gt; spend hours working my safe fall, bind wounds, or<br/>
&gt; dodge, I use them all the<br/>
&gt; time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am also concerned about the PDFs.  How often are<br/>
&gt; they updated?  I have<br/>
&gt; several of the published EQ guides I have gotten<br/>
&gt; from book store discount<br/>
&gt; racks and much of the stuff in them is flat out<br/>
&gt; wrong.  The game is always<br/>
&gt; changing and the websites change with it, my books<br/>
&gt; do not.  Do these guides<br/>
&gt; get updated with every patch?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
