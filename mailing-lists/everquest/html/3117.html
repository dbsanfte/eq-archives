<b>Subject:</b> Adventures of a tailor/smithy. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1099822096">I had just returned from looting Permafrost to my home of Rivervale. <br/>
I sold my loot, visited the bank, and ran into a high level wood elf <br/>
druid. He was seeking a tailor to make the new 100% weight reduction <br/>
bags.<br/>
<br/>
I told him I was a level 80 tailor, and level 70 smith. After not <br/>
finding anyone better, he and I went to the Vale Forge to try to make <br/>
the Vale Sewing Kit I would need. As getting parts for this kit <br/>
happens to be my present goal, I was delighted.<br/>
<br/>
He had parts for five tries. In five tries I failed five times, but <br/>
gained three levels. Not bad for me, but unfortunate for my new <br/>
friend.<br/>
<br/>
I gained also in learning how to get my hq metal bits. I have been <br/>
seeking the ore, but he suggested reverse-engineering fine steel <br/>
weapons. He said a fs weapon, flask of water, and chisel can break <br/>
down the fs weapon to the component parts. <br/>
<br/>
He suggested Hill Giants in Raith Mountains as a good source of fs <br/>
weapons to work with. I am nearly leveled enough for that adventure, <br/>
and so I may direct my efforts to leveling a bit so I may follow this <br/>
advice.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know of other good hunting which nets fine steel drops? I <br/>
expect that my quest to make my Vale Sewing Kit will raise my <br/>
experience and my smithing levels quite nicely.<br/>
<br/>
And about reverse engineering. Anyone know much about this? For <br/>
example, I looted a chainmail tunic in Permafrost, but it was too <br/>
large for my alts to use. However, if I could break it down into <br/>
parts and remake it with the correct pattern for a small character, I <br/>
could come out ahead. Any idea if this works?<br/>
