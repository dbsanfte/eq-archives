<div id="ygrps-yiv-902686650"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I guess I should go to Alakhazam and even pay the subscription fee to find<br/>
 </span></blockquote>out some good stuff to &gt;camp/quests to do, etc.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, there are some features there that are still free. And there are<br/>
guides for specific classes on other sights I think.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;I guess you decide upon a target and then spend a ridiculous amount of time<br/>
 </span></blockquote>waiting for it to show up.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Like a classic target is Grenix Mucktail, who drops the Polished Granite<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Tomahawk. I suppose in order to &gt;camp the PGT you just keep killing all the<br/>
gnolls in the area that Grenix spawns until he does and then you kill &gt;him<br/>
and get the Tomahawk. I don&#39;t think that is very productive for a level 30<br/>
ranger to do, but it would be &gt;good practice. I suppose you would make some<br/>
money from the items the gnolls dropped as well. Maybe I &gt;will camp the orcs<br/>
on the other side to see if that guy who drops the weight reduction bag<br/>
shows up.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The PGT isn&#39;t that hard to get. I got it and the cracked darkwood shield a<br/>
few times. It&#39;s more fun if you are in a gnoll killing group for xp or<br/>
faction.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;It seems like an enchanter is a better character for getting into groups<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and being invited on epic encounters, but &gt;a ranger is better for doing<br/>
quests and camping items.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since my mains are a cleric and a wizard, I wouldn&#39;t know.<br/>
