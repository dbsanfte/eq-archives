<div id="ygrps-yiv-1414447873">Some more questions for you.<br/>
<br/>
1. Is this card new and did this start happening once<br/>
he card was installed?<br/>
<br/>
2. Did you install the software from the CD that came<br/>
with it, or have you downloaded the LATEST driver for<br/>
the card?<br/>
<br/>
3. Not so much a question but I searched my machine<br/>
for that file and it is in Windows&#92;System which means<br/>
it is an Operating System file.<br/>
<br/>
Search the web for this file and see what you get. I<br/>
will myself and get back to you.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>
<br/>
