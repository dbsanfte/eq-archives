<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366674730">Pretty much...there ARE a few ppl who defy the standard class roles and have<br/>
fun with it. I&#39;ve done the druid as ghetto wizard thing (fun!) and a battle<br/>
shaman who has mastered both spear and warhammer to the point of being as<br/>
deadly in melee as with spells, and has ac better than a goodly number of<br/>
rangers and monks her level...she can and does tank occasionally. Yes, I<br/>
KNOW that&#39;s &quot;not how you play a shaman&quot;. I do it anyway...and it works.<br/>
Hubby also plays a battle cleric....usually too  drunk to cast,  but being<br/>
as the char I partner with the drunken dwarf  is a gnome Shadow Knight, it<br/>
doens&#39;t  matter...two anklebiters swinging at a feared  mob and lifetap for<br/>
what hits  I do take. And  you KNOW the goggles just strike terror into<br/>
whatever I face!<br/>

&gt; Yeah, you&#39;ll like WC hunting at your level.  You can<br/>
&gt; solo or do a derv or orc group.  Befallen is cool when<br/>
&gt; you get a little more exp under your belt.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As far as being a newb goes, no worries.  Have fun,<br/>
&gt; its a game, and you are paying for it.  If others<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t like your style of play for whatever reason, who<br/>
&gt; cares?  There&#39;s several hundred thousand accounts<br/>
&gt; active out there.  Find someone else to play with :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi<br/>
&gt; &gt; As a newb, its hard not to feel a little intimidated<br/>
&gt; &gt; by the<br/>
&gt; &gt; discussions here. I am in AWE of you people even<br/>
&gt; &gt; though I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; understand half of what you say. I long for the day<br/>
&gt; &gt; when I can talk<br/>
&gt; &gt; about the finer ponts of EQ like you guys.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; For the moment I have a love/hate relationship with<br/>
&gt; &gt; EQ after playing<br/>
&gt; &gt; for about two months or so. Its a type of game I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have never<br/>
&gt; &gt; experienced before - I am totally fascinated and<br/>
&gt; &gt; mildly (well, at the<br/>
&gt; &gt; moment!) addicted. The game boths thrills and scares<br/>
&gt; &gt; me. I find<br/>
&gt; &gt; myself nervously approaching the PC every night<br/>
&gt; &gt; mentally preparing<br/>
&gt; &gt; myself for the dangers ahead. Once I&#39;m in, I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; immersed. GET THAT<br/>
&gt; &gt; LEVEL UP is my only goal.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; When I levelled 10 I knew that I was going to have<br/>
&gt; &gt; to deal with REAL<br/>
&gt; &gt; dying and corpse retrieval. Boy, that was - and<br/>
&gt; &gt; still is  - a<br/>
&gt; &gt; learning experience. The first few times I got so<br/>
&gt; &gt; depressed that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; vowed to give up and cancel my subscription. But I<br/>
&gt; &gt; crawled to lvl 11<br/>
&gt; &gt; and am much more careful about conning.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; By nature I am not a team player so grouping is<br/>
&gt; &gt; still a bit alien to<br/>
&gt; &gt; me although I realise its the only fast way to get<br/>
&gt; &gt; xp. But too often<br/>
&gt; &gt; I find myself in groups that just gung ho for<br/>
&gt; &gt; everything in sight<br/>
&gt; &gt; hitting anything that moves (= Excelsis having to<br/>
&gt; &gt; retrive his corpse<br/>
&gt; &gt; ONCE more in some weird, out of the way loc).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Can I ask you guys some questions? I reckon a 1/5<br/>
&gt; &gt; bub a night is<br/>
&gt; &gt; pretty average to aim for. That would lvl me up once<br/>
&gt; &gt; a week. Is that<br/>
&gt; &gt; the norm? How long did it take you in the beginning?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have tried to solo in Black Burrow but that is<br/>
&gt; &gt; well nigh impossible<br/>
&gt; &gt; on your own. Grouping is the only way but I HATE<br/>
&gt; &gt; that place so much<br/>
&gt; &gt; it makes me so nervous to go there. I am soloing in<br/>
&gt; &gt; West Kerana but<br/>
&gt; &gt; grizzly and giant spider spawns are pretty rare so I<br/>
&gt; &gt; spend a lot of<br/>
&gt; &gt; time hanging around and trying to avoid the bandits<br/>
&gt; &gt; (by the way, they<br/>
&gt; &gt; seem to be walking all over WK recently,  not just<br/>
&gt; &gt; around their huts.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Is this new?)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Any advice and encouragement you can give me is<br/>
&gt; &gt; greatly appreciated.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I know I&#39;m not alone, but sometimes it feels as<br/>
&gt; &gt; though I am! I use<br/>
&gt; &gt; the English server Venril Sathir (I live in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Amsterdam) and sometimes<br/>
&gt; &gt; the zones are completely deserted. Is it like that<br/>
&gt; &gt; on the US servers<br/>
&gt; &gt; as well?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hope to hear from some of you anyway, especially<br/>
&gt; &gt; your experiences and<br/>
&gt; &gt; feelings about EQ when you first started. I&#39;m off<br/>
&gt; &gt; again now to that<br/>
&gt; &gt; HUGE VAST world that we all know and love (and<br/>
&gt; &gt; sometimes hate...)<br/>
