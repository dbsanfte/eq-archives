<b>Subject:</b> Hi...I am looking for a EQ entusiast (addict) for a TV Interview <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-697640572">I am a booker at TechTV and I am looking for an EQ enthusiast <br/>
(addict) for a live in-studio interview on the show &#39;Call for Help&#39;. <br/>
We are interested in talking about what exactly EQ is, how people get <br/>
started, what the allure is and maybe just talk about the phenomenon <br/>
a little bit. This will be a live interview in our Sna Francisco <br/>
studio so I&#39;m hoping to find someone who lives in the Bay Area and <br/>
would be willing to come on TV. Thank you very much for any help you <br/>
can render. PLease respond to my email account.<br/>
<br/>
