Forget the AC as mage, it wont do you any good. Get more +int and +mana<br/>
on<br/>
your items, it will help you way more in the long run. And get your<br/>
focus<br/>
items.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[Steven R. Hulse] I guess AC was a bad term to use, Mostly I was wanting<br/>
to know about clothing other than the cheap crap, cloth stuff. I was<br/>
wondering mostly about leather goods. For example, I found soft wicker<br/>
legging in Ak&#39;anon but I&#39;m afraid to buy them because I&#39;ll just waste<br/>
money I can use on other things like spells. I was just hoping for a<br/>
little better protection other than cloth. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks though! ;-)<br/>

There a lot of newbie armor quests out there now.  I heard the <br/>
Gnomes armor were going to be in the next patch.  You might check the <br/>
Arcane Order Armor quests in Qeynos, or the similar ones in <br/>
Freeport.  These all have minor stats on them, but they&#39;re better <br/>
than cloth and sometimes even raw silk.  You are well above the level <br/>
range for them so they should be easy to get.<br/>

Hopefully so! I don&#39;t care if my Mage can go to full armor, just<br/>
something to offer a little more protection than cloth. I found the Orcs<br/>
love to pick on the little guys! Yesterday I was playing my new warrior<br/>
Gnome and went to Orc hill and man I was even there yet and already had<br/>
3 of them on my butt! I got creamed but it was fun though!<br/>

/help pet will bring up all the pet commands.  I would suggest you <br/>
hotkey several of them, at least /pet attack and /pet back off.  It <br/>
helps not having to type all that stuff out.<br/>
<br/>
[Steven R. Hulse] <br/>
Cool thanks, I did get some in the other night. I couldn&#39;t figure out<br/>
how to get my pet to guard and attack other than be attacked myself.</div>
