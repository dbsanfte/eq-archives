<div id="ygrps-yiv-1663018775">Sadly the only way to check your faction is to con a mob, but you risk<br/>
getting spotted a lot of times.  As for the faction levels...basically they<br/>
are, from lowest to highest.... Scowls ready to attack, threatening,<br/>
dubious, apprehensive (i may have those two backwards,) indifferently,<br/>
amiably, warmly, ally....so you have 2 more levels with the swiftails.  As<br/>
for the factions of major city guards, there are usually some common mob<br/>
around there that gives you faction with them.  There are sites that list<br/>
what faction the guards are on and how to get good faction with them.  Be<br/>
warned however, some guards may be on totally different factions, one<br/>
example is Qeynos where corrupt and good guards wander the same areas (my<br/>
beast is KOS to the corrupt and ally to the good.  Same with Cabalis,<br/>
amiably to the warriors, scowls to the crusaders.)<br/>
<br/>
Playing a totally evil race you have your work cut out for you if you want<br/>
to enter most cities.  So far as i know the only cities that allow any race<br/>
to enter without faction adjustments are cities on Luclin and the city in<br/>
PoK.  (BTW, to all you druids out there....NEVER head up to Shar Vahl in<br/>
wolf form...cats and dogs DON&#39;T mix.)<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck getting good faction with the towns you want to enter, if you<br/>
need any info just ask here or check major EQ sites...they usually have<br/>
great information for that.<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] Faction<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Is there some way to see my faction scores?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How can I tell what faction somebody is?  I see a guard and he does<br/>
&gt; not like me, how do I know what faction I need to raise to impress<br/>
&gt; him?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am an Iksar Swiftail Monk (yeah, question 2 comes up a lot) and I<br/>
&gt; just completed a quest.  It told me my faction with the Swiftails<br/>
&gt; increased.  Is that any good for anything?  They already think of me<br/>
&gt; amiably, can it get any better?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Are there ever faction changes you are not told about?  When I kill<br/>
&gt; some creatures there is no message about a faction change, is it<br/>
&gt; possible one happened anyway?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
