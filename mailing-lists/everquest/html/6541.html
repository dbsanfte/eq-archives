Best place to download it is from www.everquest.com. As far as being an elf, now you have to decide what kind of elf. Half-elf, Wood-Elf, High-Elf, etc. My main character is a lvl 75 Half-Elf Paladin. I play on the Drinal server. And I play Everquest, not Everquest II.<br><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote><hr>To: EverQuest@yahoogroups.com<br>From: ramona2u2@...<br>Date: Sun, 2 Sep 2007 18:54:42 +0000<br>Subject: [EverQuest] I need help pleaseeeeee.....<br><br>

            Some co-workers were talking about Everquest and it sounded like a <br>
great game. They said there was a free or trial download so I could <br>
give it a try this weekend. I thought what a perfect opportunity to <br>
try it while I have a couple of days off.<br>
<br>
Well, my problem is that I don&#39;t know what site to download the game <br>
from or what version. I mean there is a Everquest 2 and there are 7 <br>
day trials and a 30 day one but only if you are on a certain server <br>
etc. I&#39;m so confused and I haven&#39;t even started the game...lol. <br>
<br>
So, if anyone knows of the best site to download from I&#39;d really <br>
appreciate it. I can&#39;t call my co-workers since I dont know their <br>
phone numbers off hand. I guess I&#39;d like to be able to have the <br>
download from a place that has several servers so I can find my co-<br>
workers on there when I see them next. <br>
<br>
Oh by the way I&#39;m not sure if this makes a difference when <br>
downloading etc. but after talking with my co-workers about <br>
characters/classes etc. I decided I would like to be an Elf :)<br>
<br>
Thanks a bunch in advance for all of your help and hope to see you <br>
playing Everquest soon!<br>
<br>
thx,<br>
