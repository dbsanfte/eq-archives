  Has this ever happened to you?? and what can you do when it 
  does<br><br></font></div><tt>&gt; I have been playing EQ for about 2 years and 
  enjoying every min. of<br>&gt; it. I play for only about 1 to 2 hours a day 
  (maybe) so I really get<br>&gt; in to my time in the game. This sunday 
  something new happened to me.<br>&gt; I have a 24th level Bar. shaman and have 
  been grouping in Pav.<br>&gt; Caverns to work up in levels. I logged on and 
  ooc&#39;ed asking to group.<br>&gt; I got not responce. I went to camp 1 aqnd 
  found a good mixed group<br>&gt; working it very well (8 people mixed classes 
  teaming very nicely) so<br>&gt; I went to camp 2, There were 5 people 3 
  casters (2 mages and a necro)<br>&gt; a ranger and a fighter) all around 19 to 
  20., all at 100% health. I<br>&gt; asked if they wanted a healer/buffer and 
  got &quot;Shouted down&quot; &quot;This<br>&gt; Camp is TAKEN GO AWAY&quot;!!!....ok so I truned 
  and started back. I got<br>&gt; jumped by 3 of the bandits. I Camp was not 
  doing anything so I pulled<br>&gt; the mobs back in to the camp and ooced here 
  is your mobs take them I<br>&gt; don&#39;t want to steal your kills(all the time I 
  am getting pounded) ..<br>&gt; no one said anything so I ran .. about 1/2 way 
  back I get ooc&#39;ed &quot;WTF<br>&gt; Frezz wait...&quot; as I as all ready near the cave 
  to SH and the zone I<br>&gt; just left... the &quot;group&quot; because of 5 mobs brok 
  camp and ran (as they<br>&gt; ran they pulled 2 more) and &quot;telled&quot; me to death 
  about how they were<br>&gt; going to cause me problems every time they see me 
  and ect...<br>&gt; A. did I do wrong by trying to &quot;not steal&quot; the camp&#39;s 
  mobs<br>&gt; b. what do I do about the &quot;problems&quot; I might have later by 
  thes<br>&gt; people?<br>&gt;&nbsp; I like doing the right thing and playing 
  with people not causeing<br>&gt; problems for others...<br>&gt; 
  Frezslice<br>&gt; 24 circle Shaman of the North<br>&gt;<br>Some people just 
  aren&#39;t friendly. Considering they yelled at you to get out<br>of &quot;their&quot; camp 
  when you were LFG then they sound like the uptight type<br>anyways. They&#39;ll 
  probably just not invite you to group and such. Since you<br>were trying to 
  bring them mobs so as not to steal you meant well,<br>unfortunately they 
  probably thought you were training them on purpose to get<br>them killed or 
  something bc they told you to go away. The official rule is<br>that if 
  something attacks you, you have the kill because it aggrod you<br>first. If 
  you couldn&#39;t kill them by yourself best thing to do is to pull<br>them away 
  from other players and zone, but shout a train warning. If they<br>complain 
  that you are &quot;stealing&quot; their mobs, just tell them you got aggro<br>and needed 
  to defend yourself. Or you could ask them to take a mob or two<br>off of you 
  bc you got aggro and don&#39;t want to steal, but not pull into their<br>camp. 
  It&#39;s a tough call. The people might call you names and junk but from<br>my 
  experience, unless you did something really nasty to them or did<br>something 
  mean repeatedly they are likely to forget about it.<br>I had people cussing at 
  me one day when I was calling trains that I saw<br>going by (bc the people 
  pulling them weren&#39;t calling them). Someone started<br>calling me names and 
  telling me to stop pulling trains and I had to explain<br>that I was not 
  pulling the trains, I was just warning people when I saw<br>them. And I had 
  someone accuse me of pulling trains when I was running from<br>something that 
  had been trained onto me. If the people are nice enough to<br>listen when you 
  explain then that&#39;s cool. If they won&#39;t listen and just get<br>nasty then you 
  don&#39;t want to be grouping with them anyways.<br>It&#39;s just a game and people 
  get too uptight about it sometimes.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit
