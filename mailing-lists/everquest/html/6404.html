<div id="ygrps-yiv-197510061">I too started just after Kunark.  I remember the run across Antonica to <br/>
get from Qeynos to Freeport, out running Giants, that group in the <br/>
mountains, Griffs, Gnolls, Orcs!  That was always fun.  And boat rides!<br/>
<br/>
I used to hate being in EC on Sunday.  Every channel was jammed with <br/>
auctions, shouts and tells!  There were so many people there it was <br/>
slow and glitchy.  And then there was the search to try and find the <br/>
sellr.  But the deals!  And I used to make a ton of plat making arrows. <br/>
<br/>
As a Ranger that would mean back to the days of the SSoM, Ivy Etched <br/>
armor and Evileye bags.  How quaint!<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I&#39;d do it.<br/>
