<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368373551">So many questions, so little time....am really bummed<br/>
because with it being tax season and all I am not<br/>
getting much game time...Is really hard for this<br/>
newbie who is itching to play, play, play...Here is my<br/>
question though...I already have two characters that I<br/>
play with my boyfriend but am wanting to add a couple<br/>
characters to play with when he is over at<br/>
Fennin...While I am too afraid to play her now, I have<br/>
thoughts of an Enchanter but am also thinking of a<br/>
Druid character...I have a name for my Enchanter but<br/>
am at a loss for something really creative for my<br/>
Druid...Any suggestions on websites for research for a<br/>
name?  Guess I could go to Google but I thought I<br/>
would check with you guys first.  Also, any<br/>
suggestions for a really easy quest for my Cleric? <br/>
One I might be able to do fairly easily on my own?  I<br/>
have got to start learning this game on my own instead<br/>
of just doing what HE tells me to do...you know, AUTO<br/>
FOLLOW, ASSIST, Here take this..LOL...LOL...I keep<br/>
running around Freeport afraid to go out cause I don&#39;t<br/>
know if I could find my way back...I sound pathetic<br/>
don&#39;t I?? :-)<br/>
