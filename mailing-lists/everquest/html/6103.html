<div id="ygrps-yiv-773922134">Lol! I would have a hard time remember too if mine wasn&#39;t at the top of the list.  I used to be on dialup but my phonelines kept deteriorating. When the bandwidth dropped under 10k we had to get satellite. Once when it was raining and lost satellite I dialed up but was only at 6.2k. On a later attempt the bandwidth was too low to even dialup at all. The phone company denies there is anything wrong with the lines so we can&#39;t get them to do anythign about it. So we are completely on satellite now. It&#39;s supposed to be about 800k dl speed and 50k upload. However, they tend to cap usage if you load more than a certain amount. Because of the delay with the satellite signal I get over 800ms ping. I pretty much average around 3kms. It makes things tough in WoW, but it&#39;s still doable. Death in WoW is easier to deal with than death in EQ. I kinda wish EQ would change it so you no longer lost xp on death, but I doubt they will. I would be willing to sacrifice some cash for armor repair or such <br/>

&gt;    On EQ2 I am on Crushbone server.  On EQ I am on Cazic Thule server so I went with whatever &quot;C&quot; named server EQ2 had.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    As far as lag, are you on dialup?  I had a lot of lag on EQ2 when I first started it, but I built a new system and now it runs fine.  Definitely need a nice system to run it.<br/>
