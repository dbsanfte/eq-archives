<div id="ygrps-yiv-1579759714">Not that I&#39;m on your server Tammy but wouldn&#39;t it be important that <br/>
you two know each other&#39;s character&#39;s names before you two go on to <br/>
look for each other?  It would be cool if there was somoene that goes <br/>
on my server though that is on this Yahoo Groups.  Just curious but <br/>
where do you all play at?  I only have 1 character on the server I <br/>
play.  I probably will switch to another server when I do make <br/>
another character, though.<br/>
