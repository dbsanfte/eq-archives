<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298995922">They said it was ok for you to loot though, right?<br/>
Just bc someone appears to be twinked doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t need money. I<br/>
had someone who wouldn&#39;t let me loot in group bc he claimed I was twinked. I<br/>
was around lvl 25 and wearing a Green Silk Drape and poking away with a<br/>
drachnid leg tip that I bought off a merchant in Neriak. I had no money bc<br/>
I&#39;d spent it all on spells and the equipment that I had.<br/>
Sorry, pet peeve. The attitude that someone with good gear doesn&#39;t have<br/>
money can get you into trouble.<br/>

I made about 300pp in the Highpass Basement just looting everything because<br/>
everyone else was so twinked they don&#39;t need money.<br/>

  Don&#39;t forget buffing for donations. At lvl 30 Rangers get sow. So you can<br/>
  sow for donations if no druids, beastlords, or shamans are around.<br/>

  I guess the obvious ways I can think of are to kill lots of green mobs.<br/>
Camp<br/>
  items in dungeons. Practice trade skills. I have spent a great deal of<br/>
time<br/>
  in the Highpass Basement and when I am in a group where everyone is<br/>
twinked,<br/>
  they often let me get all the loot.<br/>
