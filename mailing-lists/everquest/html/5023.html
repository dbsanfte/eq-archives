  <div><span class="ygrps-yiv-254186434008240712-01092003">Hello everyone I&#39;ve got a 
  few&nbsp;questions that I hope some of you can help me out with.&nbsp; 
  Ok&nbsp;I haven&#39;t really played LoY yet (being that I am in the navy and we 
  went to sea a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;days after it came out and I kept getting 
  booted from the game) and I had a chance to go online and check out the latest 
  EQ stuff and I saw these monster looking things that you can ride like a 
  horse.&nbsp; I was wondering what are these things and are they better than 
  having a horse?&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing I was wondering is it ture the 
  fastest horse in the game is Pegasus?&nbsp; One last thing I was wondering 
  about is that if you go to the horse stalls at the bazaar there is this 
  merchant selling various items and a couple of them caught my eye, a large bag 
  of plat and a small bag of plat both of them costing an insane amount of plat 
  with the small bag costing way more than the large... so my question is does 
  anyone know what these bags of plat are for and what they do?&nbsp; If anyone 
  can help me out in answering these questions I&#39;d appericate it.&nbsp; Happy 
  hunting!</span></div>

  <div>To answer your questions......</div>
  <div>The lizard you see people riding are called Drogmars....they are the 
  mounts sold in the new LoY zone, similar to horses they do not have the horses 
  head in front of the caster so often they are more sought after.</div>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <div>The bag of platinum you see the merchants having is what players are 
  handed when they trade in their old horses.&nbsp; The bridles are no-drop so 
  they cannot be sold the normal way.&nbsp; There is a stable hand there that 
  you hand a bridle to and he gives you a bag of plat that can be sold.&nbsp; 
  The big bag might have been a bigger horse but the small bag may have been 
  from a more expensive horse.&nbsp; They are used to try to get back part of 
  the expense of the horses.</div>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <div>As for Pegasus, not sure since i had never heard of that, but the general 
  rule is the more expensive the horse, the faster it runs and the stronger it 
  is.<br></div></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
