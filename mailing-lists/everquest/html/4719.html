<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738479763">That&#39;s a great idea. I&#39;m getting really tired of using<br/>
my training points on Elder Erudite, Gnoll and other<br/>
languages I doubt I&#39;ll ever use, hehe.<br/>

&gt; is that you end up with a lot of  excess training<br/>
&gt; points you can&#39;t use.  You get 5 training points<br/>
&gt; each level you go up.  However, you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; necessarily get 5 new skills each level so if you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; like me, you put one point into the new skill to get<br/>
&gt; it started then let the course of the game and use<br/>
&gt; of that skill cause it to go up.  Of course after a<br/>
&gt; certain point you get charged plat for training, not<br/>
&gt; to mention the training point.  Well I don&#39;t need<br/>
&gt; the training points but I can&#39;t spend them on<br/>
&gt; anything else.  So I find it&#39;s a waste of plat to<br/>
&gt; have to pay for training.   But what can ya do? <br/>
&gt; They should have some kind of reward process<br/>
&gt; implemented where you can convert your non-used<br/>
&gt; training points into AA points or back into plat.<br/>

&gt;      OK, You can train your trade skills ( baking,<br/>
&gt; Tailoring, ect) To <br/>
&gt; 21 and after a few free points it does start<br/>
&gt; charging. Languages and <br/>
&gt; other skills like 1 hb 2 hb and slashing can be<br/>
&gt; trained way on past <br/>
&gt; 21 at your trainer depending on your level.  My<br/>
&gt; druid has always used <br/>
&gt; a 1hb When I decided to het a scimitar at lv 48 I<br/>
&gt; trained as high as <br/>
&gt; I could and it was costing several plat a point  I<br/>
&gt; paid over a <br/>
&gt; hundred to gain skill level at trainer.  <br/>
&gt;     I have been on almost 4 years and it has been<br/>
&gt; this way the entire <br/>
&gt; time I have  played. I beleive the reason trade<br/>
&gt; skills are capped at <br/>
&gt; 21 is to create player based economy for and to<br/>
&gt; reward those willing <br/>
&gt; to go out and put the work in something.<br/>
