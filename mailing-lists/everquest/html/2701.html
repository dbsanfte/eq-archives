<br/>
G&#39;Fay is famous for the /ooc beggar.  I, like you, usually end up &quot;chiding&quot;<br/>
any beggar that pollutes the chat with a constant cry for platinum or even<br/>
Power Leveling and gear. But, I have never been accused of being too harsh<br/>
with someone.  Most people start sending me tells agreeing with me about<br/>
stupid beggars, and then they /ooc support to my discouragement of begging.<br/>
And NOTHING pisses me off more than the ungrateful player. I have on<br/>
occasion given some plat or newbie gear to people that wouldn&#39;t stop begging<br/>
just to shut them up. And yes, I would say that most of the begging souls<br/>
that I have donated anything to were just as ungrateful as the chap that you<br/>
described.  They can&#39;t even bother to type 2 letters -TY- or God forbid that<br/>
they might actually /bow or /kneel or /thank...  &lt;:-P&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I too often seek out young players above 3rd or 4th season that appear to be<br/>
working hard to advance themselves the way that most of us did as<br/>
NewB&#39;s....and while I expect nothing in return for the small gifts that I<br/>
give. I find that more often than not these players are very thankful and<br/>
benevolent.  It just makes me feel all warm and fuzzy to make some new<br/>
player&#39;s day.<br/>
I have found that it &quot;pays&quot; to work hard for the things that you want--in RL<br/>
and in EQ.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was going to say something about how all beggars should publicly die slow<br/>
cruel deaths in explicit detail, but I&#39;ll leave it to your imagination----<br/>

( I can be found on the Druzzil Ro server at odd times of the day and night,<br/>
feel free to say hello or even BEG from me, well that is to say that if you<br/>
would like to make the list of people that will never ever ever get a free<br/>
or cheap REZ from me you should definitely beg.)</div>
