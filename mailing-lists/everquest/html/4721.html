<div id="ygrps-yiv-652467440">That sounds like fun. I am trying to level up my enchanter right no <br/>
tho, seems harder than heck. IF I can make it to level 30 then it <br/>
would be fun to make another char too :)<br/>

&gt;   Wanting to meet new poeple and make some new friends.  I would <br/>
like <br/>

&gt; eastern time.  We all start new toons and only play them once a <br/>
week <br/>
&gt; on game night unless you miss a night and need to make up lvs. <br/>
&gt;    Any server or server type is good to me PVP, PVE, or blue , Even <br/>
&gt; blue and we follow discord.  We could all play one type of toon <br/>
&gt; (beastlords or mages) or shoot for balnce or all iskar some thing <br/>
&gt; like that.   Please post if you would be interested in joing we <br/>
will <br/>
&gt; all be making new toons thatway we are all equal and broke.<br/>
