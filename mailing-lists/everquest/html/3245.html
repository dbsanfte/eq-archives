<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882077509">I wish I could. But my phone company has a monopoly in the area and won&#39;t do<br/>
anything about it. I can&#39;t even get them to do maintenance that they are<br/>
supposed to be required to do. I&#39;m going to have to call someone above their<br/>
heads to get something done.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I absolutely hate game death and try to avoid it whenever possible.<br/>
&gt; I let<br/>
&gt; &gt; people know right off that if I think I am going to get killed I<br/>
&gt; will flee.<br/>
&gt; &gt; A dead cleric isn&#39;t very helpful. Especially since I only have a<br/>
&gt; 21.6k<br/>
&gt; &gt; connection and we&#39;re talking about waiting 5 or more minutes to<br/>
&gt; reload from<br/>
&gt; &gt; death. When my mother is playing also, my zoning like that can<br/>
&gt; cause her to<br/>
&gt; &gt; lag very badly. If she has to zone or gets killed then one or both<br/>
&gt; of us get<br/>
&gt; &gt; booted offline. And I lose alot of xp. So that isn&#39;t fun.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; My locution in the previous message expressed my feelings toward<br/>
&gt; game<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; death, and raised my curiosity. What are other player&#39;s attitudes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; toward game death?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I play solo most of the time, and haven&#39;t had a guild to depend on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; since Wave of Change faded away. So, death, especially death in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; awkward circumstances, is more serious to my character. I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; call on my guild reserector to pull my butt out of the grave, nor<br/>
&gt; do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have high level guildies to drag my corpse out from under some big<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; nasty.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; My son-in-law plays with abandon. He leaves corpses all over the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; place, joins groups readily, and seems to have great fun doing all<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; My son, on the other hand, is in a powerful guild on our server.<br/>
&gt; He<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is less cautious than me, but still uses sound strategy and<br/>
&gt; tactics<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and utilized his guild to advance on his goals. His guild is the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Guardian Alliance on Zeb.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I figure I will have to do the guild and group thing soon, but<br/>
&gt; enjoy<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; my independence enough that I want to do so as late in my career<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; possible.<br/>
