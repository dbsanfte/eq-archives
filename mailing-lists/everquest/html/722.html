 </span></blockquote>Ummmm. Cleric quests are completely pointless .. Sit in a burnt out<br/>
house in Kithicor for 8 hours, then go to a tree stump and sit there for<br/>
8 hours (BTW nothing to kill in kithicor to pass the time). Do some<br/>
running. Pay 250pp and get a pair of boots only slight better then<br/>
bronze or steelplate and worse then Rubi.<br/>
<br/>
SK&#39;s and Pala&#39;s is much much worse.<br/>
<br/>
Why is the chain wearing classes quest armour higher AC and stats then<br/>
some of plate wearing classes ?<br/>
<br/>
Warrior : AC and stats better then rubi.<br/>
Ranger, Shaman, Rogue, bard : AC as good and stats better then rubi.<br/>
Clerics, palas and sk&#39;s : AC worse (and for cleric stats pretty useless<br/>
except for bracers).<br/>
