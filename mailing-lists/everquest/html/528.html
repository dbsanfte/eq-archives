<div id="ygrps-yiv-936651098">I am not sure when Verant stated this, but the survey has been up for a couple<br/>
of weeks now, just not that many votes.. Sorry the alternatives were too b&w<br/>
though, if I had not made that survey at 4am in the morning after playing EQ for<br/>
9 hours straight it might have been better.. hee hee..<br/>
<br/>
I think changing the code so that it takes into account the damage dealth to<br/>
players would fix alot of things, not just kill stealing, for example I met a<br/>
level 27 player in Befallen about a week ago that was twinking a level 12 friend<br/>
by fetching kills and standing and just taunting and taking the damage from the<br/>
mob while the low level whopped it.. This would not work with fixed code..<br/>

&gt; I have to comment that I decline to respond to the questionnaire because I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t like the choices - it is too black and white...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t kill-steal - and I don&#39;t think it is in the spirit of role-play.<br/>
&gt; And I also don&#39;t think it &quot;ruins&quot; the game.  I think that simply there are<br/>
&gt; &quot;problems&quot; with the code as it is designed to determine who gets credit for<br/>
&gt; the kill.  I think that minor not drastic changes are in order.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Regardless - you are a bit out of date in that Verant has acknowledged the<br/>
&gt; problem and will be addressing it.  They stated (and I&#39;m paraphrasing) that<br/>
&gt; the current system is such that it rewards solo over groups and they want to<br/>
&gt; change it to tilt towards group - since their philosophy of the game is to<br/>
&gt; promote grouping.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The way I see it - the main problem is that it only looks at damage against<br/>
&gt; the mob and doesn&#39;t incorporate the damage that the players receive...<br/>
