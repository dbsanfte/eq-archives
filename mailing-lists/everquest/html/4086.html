<p>took me a few hours to get all the four peices from the Mages in Njnina - theres some on the second floor and first floor at least 20 of them in the zone but they have about a 10min respawn least it felt like it when i was camping them, the whole quest for each item can be found at alakazam and they start in temple of ro. whilst you are in Najina its worthwhile picking up the pages for your epic as well. every mage should get all four as you will find you will be using all 4 pets alot well at least 3 of them the fire pet isnt very useful. for each item u need 4 things 3 of them are drops plus a gem but overall u can buy most of these like the giant toes. In general for all things Everquest you only need 3 websites these are castersrealm, alakazam and eqtraders they also have links to the best class websites for specific stuff but on the whole just about everything can be found on those websites.</p>
