<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518405292">My favorite zone to level 12 - 19 is Kurn&#39;s Tower.  It&#39;s really easy to get<br/>
to if you have Planes of Power too, just take the Cabillis port and head<br/>
straight for the huge tower (just don&#39;t go anywher near to Cabillis itself).<br/>
It&#39;s fantastic xp, either solo the floor where you zone in and the floor<br/>
above or get a group and head into the basement.  The skellies here are<br/>
easier that their level suggests (something very rare in eq). I remember<br/>
starting a new iksar when kunark was released and killing yellow cons with<br/>
my tarnished sword :-)<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t have PoP, Kurn&#39;s can be tough to get to.  My favorite place<br/>
before PoP came out was Unrest. This place is famous for it&#39;s trains, but if<br/>
you follow the zone wall to the left and pull things to the side wall, you<br/>
should aviod all of the trains.  You should easily be able to solo Death<br/>
beetles, Tormented dead and greater skellies, just stick to the things on<br/>
the grass and keep out of the house and you should get great xp from 15 to<br/>
about 17 (yay! dual wield time).<br/>
<br/>
When you hit 17, head to Paludal, get a group at the bandits and you will be<br/>
lvl 25 before you know it =)<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
