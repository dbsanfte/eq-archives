<div id="ygrps-yiv-953113250">You&#39;re just level 10 now. Shaman, at the higher<br/>
levels, don&#39;t melee very much, if at all. You&#39;ll be<br/>
there to buff your group and debuff and slow the mob<br/>
mostly. So you want to make sure your spells aren&#39;t<br/>
fizzling every time you try to cast them. Power<br/>
leveling will increase the chances that your spells<br/>
will fizzle more often.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you zoom up there in levels, you may not<br/>
quite know how to play your character. The game gets a<br/>
bit different after level 25, and changes greatly<br/>
after 50. So you should take your time and enjoy the<br/>
game, and learn how to play your character well. :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hey, I wouldn&#39;t Power lvl a caster. In my opnion,<br/>
&gt; &gt; you need to be working on your spell skills and<br/>
&gt; &gt; power lvling will get you past your skill and your<br/>
&gt; &gt; spells will fizzle alot. Just what I learned the<br/>
&gt; &gt; hard way. Hope it helps.<br/>
