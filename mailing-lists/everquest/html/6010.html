  <div><br></div><tt>True. I had people laughing at me when I was in my 40s and 
  50s level range because I wanted to melee a bit and let the mobs try to hit me 
  to make my defense go up. They said I would never need defense and I didn&#39;t 
  need to worry about it. However, being able to dodge hits can really come in 
  handy and sometimes I have had to melee mobs to death when oom and having to 
  kill a mob that is running away. A single bash can be the difference between 
  killing a mob and getting a ton of adds.<br>-Su<br><br>======== At 2004-12-18,

  focus on your <br>battle skills. Trust me, at the lower levels that is a 
  perfect time to <br>get the skills built up. I can understand wanting to go in 
  and just beat <br>the heck out of everything and being uber and killing it all 
  in one <br>shot. But ponder this, When you get to be up in levels (50&#39;s, 60&#39;s, 
  and <br>70&#39;s) you are going to be taking on some majorly nasty monsters. If 
  you <br>have just gained levels and have an uber weapon but never really 
  worked <br>on your fighting skills and they are low, it&#39;s not going to help 
  you or <br>your party out very much. Actually you will hurt your group more 
  than <br>help them. Now being a Shammy you have some awesome spells at higher 
  <br>levels. This is another thing I would suggest focusing on. If your at a 
  <br>higher level and your fighting say a dragon and 60% of your casts fizz 
  <br>then you may as well run or be able to hit! (See first part) otherwise 
  <br>your gonna get killed or your group killed.<br><br>That&#39;s just my 2 
  cents.<br><br><br><br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel="nofollow"
