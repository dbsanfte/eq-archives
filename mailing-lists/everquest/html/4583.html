&gt; First of all, I&#39;d like to wish everyone a Happy Easter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Have a question. I did the Stein Quest twice today. Cast Illusion:DE<br/>
&gt; on my Lvl 14 Erudite Enchanter, and cast Alliance on Clurg. I conned<br/>
&gt; Clurg as Amiable both times. Both times I said &quot;What special book&quot;,<br/>
&gt; he replied, and I gave him the compodium. Then he said something<br/>
&gt; like &quot;You must have worked hard to get my book, I am indebted to you.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t like being indebted, so take this as payment&quot;. He didn&#39;t give<br/>
&gt; me anything; no PP, no stein. I petitioned the GM. Does anyone have a<br/>
&gt; clue as to what is going on?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
