<div id="ygrps-yiv-162692185">Run away? Really? That has never happened when I used flash of light. They<br/>
always make a b-line straight toward me and can cast spells and hit me<br/>

worn off.<br/>

Ah...those are not really upgrades. They are different spells....last longer<br/>
but break easier with damage. I never use them either. And here is something<br/>
that can help you....root...Flash of Light...blast at will. When Root breaks<br/>
the Flash of light will cause them to run away from you.<br/>

  Actually what I meant is that I never bothered with the upgrades to root..<br/>
I still use root quite a bit =D<br/>

    Didn&#39;t bother with root?? I have a level 50 Ogre Shaman that STILL uses<br/>
root to this day. Get all your spells...you might be surprised how useful<br/>
they can be.<br/>

      I say go with the vah shir shaman &lt;grin&gt; I play one & it&#39;s awsome.<br/>
you are not kos in many places plus,  the vah shir look cool =D  Shamans get<br/>
root at 14 and a couple others which I never bothered with as tthe mobs have<br/>
a chance to break the root with every hit with the other roots.<br/>

        the only problem I foresee with using a troll shaman is that<br/>
wonderful 20% xp penalty.  you could go with a dark elf shadowknight<br/>
(clinging darkness at 15) and a barb or vah shir shaman, thereby not having<br/>
to worry about the xp penalty, and getting a snare type spell at 15.  you<br/>
could also use a druid for the healer type, and they get snare fairly early,<br/>
(I&#39;m not a big fan of druids, but if you like their play style, good on ya)<br/>
plus heals, and regen.  a druid combo with a warrior, SK, or pally could be<br/>
a very easy leveling pair.   tis your choice on what to use as a duo, just<br/>
be aware that there are lots of problems with pet pathing in dungeons.<br/>

          Necros are pretty nice though. They got snare, mez, healing and<br/>
damage over time. Insane mana regen. A good pet. Summon corpse. I could<br/>
summon my corpses if they die, and then rez them to get the exp back.<br/>
<br/>
          I guess I&#39;m gonna go with the shaman though. Sounds like a Paladin<br/>
should be able to kill just about anything with 1375 extra hp and their mana<br/>
to life conversion spell and Regrowth and Torpor cast on them against a<br/>
slowed and dotted mob.<br/>
<br/>
          I&#39;ll use a Troll shaman too for the snare which would be really<br/>
useful in a dungeon.<br/>

              I have two computers and two accounts and I want to play two<br/>
characters to at least level 50. I want to be able to go into dungeons for<br/>
experience instead of outdoor kiting. One of the characters I would like to<br/>
be is a paladin. I have been playing a paladin/magician duo and it seems<br/>
really good for dungeon play. I have been looking at necromancers, shaman<br/>
and druids as well. They all seem to have their strengths and weaknesses.<br/>
Paladin/Shaman duo seems really good, as the Shaman would be like a third<br/>
tank. The others would go down fast when swarmed.<br/>
