<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795984365">I probably should build when the time comes. I just remember building <br/>
in the 80&#39;s. IRQ conflicts. Cheap products (I built from crap and <br/>
scrap). It was fun then. So was working on my own car.<br/>
<br/>
Not the same so many years later. Especially reading horror stories <br/>
of component losses due to improperly mounted heat sinks and bad heat <br/>
management. <br/>
<br/>
Still, I would get just the machine I want, designed specifically for <br/>
gaming. I really should do it.<br/>

less than<br/>
&gt; $1700 and they are fully upgradeable :)  I recently built one for <br/>
my husband<br/>
&gt; so that we could play together.  Case, 19&quot; monitor, keyboard, <br/>
optical mouse,<br/>
&gt; motherboard w/ AMD 1.3 processor, Audigy MP3 sound card, GEforce 3 <br/>
video<br/>
&gt; card, 512 megs of ram, 60 gig hard drive, CD/RW drive and <br/>
speakers.....<br/>
&gt; around $1000.  There are also advantages to being able to load only <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; software you want on a blank hard drive.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s really not hard to build your own :)<br/>
