	First of all, may I ask you to trim your posts. I am not trying to<br/>
be a a$$ or anything but there are a lot of people that have to pay for<br/>
internet services by the minute, like Europe and Japan and download<br/>
their Email. You just had a 23K message that had two lines in it. So<br/>
please Delete any un-needed messages when you want to ask a <br/>
question or reply to a message. Thanks :) (Please Note the Smiley<br/>
Face - No Flame Intended)<br/>
<br/>
	Second, I have a SB Live! also and have music in Certain<br/>
places but you should check the Options when you log on. Not the<br/>
Initial Screen but the main screen when your character is in the<br/>
Zone that you are playing in. As soon as you log on you will see the<br/>
Windowed Screen with the text box at the bottom. Look up on the<br/>
left side of the screen and you should see the Options button. Click<br/>
on it and it should give you a box that has Display, Filters, Sounds,<br/>
Etc. Click on the Sound and make sure that the music is turned up.<br/>
When I installed EQ, mine was turned all the way down and I had<br/>
to turn it up to get the music.<br/>
<br/>
	Hope this helps and again the 1st point was not a flame but<br/>
just a comment. <br/>
