<div id="ygrps-yiv-835964222">The way quivers SHOULD work is you fill it up with the<br/>
SAME arror type.  Once full you put one stack in your<br/>
ammo slot.<br/>
<br/>
It should dwindle every arrow until you totally run<br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
This is how mine works all the time<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>

&gt; I have a 13 Iksar Monk<br/>
&gt; but have been playing my 5 Wood Elf Ranger lately.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My ranger has a quiver that he keeps his arrows in. <br/>
&gt; I saw a tip when I<br/>
&gt; logged on that says keeping arrows in a quiver<br/>
&gt; decreases attack time.  I can<br/>
&gt; not get him to draw from his quiver.  The only<br/>
&gt; arrows he uses are in the<br/>
&gt; ammo slot.  The quiver will not fit in the ammo<br/>
&gt; slot.  If I have no arrows<br/>
&gt; in the ammo slot I get a message &quot;Out Of Ammunition&quot;<br/>
&gt; when I try and use my<br/>
&gt; bow, even with my quiver full.  I have tried putting<br/>
&gt; the quiver on my back<br/>
&gt; and it won&#39;t fit there either.  I have asked a bunch<br/>
&gt; of people in game with<br/>
&gt; no luck, searched the web and looked in my hint<br/>
&gt; book.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While on the subject of archers, my bow and arrows<br/>
&gt; each have a range and<br/>
&gt; damage rating.  My bow is Range 75 Damage 8 (I<br/>
&gt; think).  My arrows are Range<br/>
&gt; 25 Damage 1.  What is my range and damage?  100 and<br/>
&gt; 9 by adding the numbers,<br/>
&gt; 25 and 1 taking the lower of each?  Something else?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
