 </span></blockquote>There was a recent survey done and posted on Everlore about women in <br/>
EQ.  It turns out that the majority of players are male, big <br/>
surprise.  And that almost 50% of all female characters are really <br/>
guys.<br/>
<br/>
Women generally play female characters, but even here in fantasyland <br/>
the are some players and guilds that don&#39;t take a female character <br/>
seriously!  The male character seems to get more respect and <br/>
leadership positions in these situations.  So some women play male <br/>
characters and see a difference in how they are treated by these same <br/>
people!  It&#39;s sad.<br/>
<br/>
And even I have been known to be soft on the ladies.  Hey, it&#39;s a <br/>
game of Chivalry after all!<br/>
