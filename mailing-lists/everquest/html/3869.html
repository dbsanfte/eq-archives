<b>Subject:</b> need help to keep &quot;Latrodectus Mactans&quot; alive <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244938990">it took me quite some time, after asking Su, that i would like to<br/>
post this email asking for help, to make my guild survive.<br/>
<br/>
one of the reasons this took me so long is, that may feelings about<br/>
EQ were - say - &quot;disturbed&quot; by some RL events and i am close to<br/>
quitting EQ if i don&#39;t have some fun, or find some interesting<br/>
activity within the game soon.<br/>
<br/>
what i want to ask for is, that even if you don&#39;t play on Tarew Marr<br/>
(or should i say especially), some add an alt to my guild<br/>
&quot;Latrodectus Mactans&quot; (latin for &quot;Black Widow&quot;). this guild was<br/>
basically ment for alt chars, but it started to become the home for<br/>
me and some friends. and we always have been to a very low number of<br/>
chars (better say accounts) within the guild, because our mains are<br/>
with other guilds.<br/>
<br/>
some of the RL events have been, that some friends quitted EQ or<br/>
moved to another server. the reason for this are, that half of the<br/>
guild founders are from europe (germany and switzerland) and the<br/>
other half are from the states.<br/>
<br/>
currently if you look up the guild, you may see up to four (sometimes<br/>
five) people online: one char belongs to a RL coworker, and i can be<br/>
online with up to three chars (and sometimes my ex-leader of our<br/>
ex-guild is playing her lower level mage).<br/>
<br/>
may main goal is to keep the guild alive as long as possible.<br/>
<br/>
if some who join are interrested in an active guild (and we have some<br/>
more players), i could also stage raids at different levels.<br/>
<br/>
the most important restriction for people who want to join this guild<br/>
is that the level of the char must be two (2) or greater.<br/>
<br/>
to contact me, you have two options: in game (tell Biltilie, Delaney,<br/>
Urva, Udaena, Ldara, Zimboka, or Nadja) or write me an email<br/>
	mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:biltilie@...">biltilie@...</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance<br/>
