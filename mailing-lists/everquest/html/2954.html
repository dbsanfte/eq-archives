<div id="ygrps-yiv-1085536985">To clarify that a bit, the lag meter monitors the condition of your <br/>
connection. I don&#39;t really know what the various numbers mean, but as <br/>
your bar goes red and shrinks, you may expect to be disconnected. <br/>
This may be at the game server or your internet connection. When you <br/>
are disconnected you go &quot;link dead.&quot; Inconvenient most of the time, <br/>
deadly if you are in battle.<br/>
<br/>
If you are in a critical situation and your bar keeps going red then <br/>
back to green, it is often wise to move somewhere safe until the lag <br/>
problem goes away. The better your system the less lag you get on <br/>
your end, but there are still connection and server issues which will <br/>
give you some lag. Another aspect of the game to learn, Lag <br/>
Management.<br/>

&gt;   1.  In the game on the main screen on the middle right is a green <br/>
bar <br/>
&gt;   with a number , a percentage, another percentage, and a second <br/>
number <br/>
&gt;   (always changing), what is it? I couldn&#39;t find in the manual. </span></blockquote></div>
