<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-992865766">Hello Peg let me one of the first to welcome you to the best chat room in<br/>
the world =) I have to say your newbie saga was fun interesting to read, it<br/>
brought back memories of when I was a newbie..heh heh..I remember my first<br/>
character I made was a dark elf necromancer..I had no idea how to open doors<br/>
so I would wait for someone to walk thru and I would rush in lol..but anyway<br/>
though I will try to answer your questions the best I can.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
playing EQ for about 2 and a half years now and my highest character is a 65<br/>
warrior so I have plenty of experience in EQ.  Ok to start with<br/>
powerleveling (aka PL) is when a high lvl character casts &quot;buffs&quot; on you<br/>
that increase your stats by insane amounts (a lvl 1 with over 1,000 hit<br/>
points, str of 180, etc) and the way you can vertify if you are buffed is<br/>
you can check your upper right window..if you have a buff (or debuff) then a<br/>
symbol will appear in that window.  The type of symbol that appears depends<br/>
on the buff.  You can put your mouse pointer on that symbol and it will tell<br/>
you the name of the buff.  Another way you can tell is to press the &quot;i&quot;<br/>
button to bring up your inventory, it will show your stats and if any of<br/>
your stats are way above normall then you are buffed.  And FYI that<br/>
stanchion with a book on top of it is a portal to the Plane of Knowledge.<br/>
These portals are just about in every city so it makes traveling alot easier<br/>
than it used to be.  And another thing to open up any container all you have<br/>
to do is right click it..you can also right click and hold on any item and<br/>
you&#39;ll see it&#39;s description like what it is, weither the item is no rent, no<br/>
drop, lore, etc.  Now at your lvl keep doing what you are doing hunting in<br/>
the newbie zones and cities, always &quot;con&quot; creatures (aka &quot;mobs&quot; - mobile<br/>
objects) by selecting any mob and pressing c, your EQ guide should cover the<br/>
details on conning.  Now here is some advice, as a melee class you must work<br/>
on your taunt skill as often as possible, I reccomend making a taunt hot<br/>
button and have that button set up so when you press q for example you would<br/>
taunt.  Another thing you should work on is trying to keep your weapons<br/>
skills as balenced as possible..try to keep 1hs 2hs..etc..in somewhat equal<br/>
amounts (espically 2hs since your epic is a 2hs weapon).  The reason why I<br/>
reccomend keeping your weapon skills balenced is that if you happen to come<br/>
across a really nice pierceing weapon or 1hb wep but your skill in that<br/>
weapon is only 2 then you would be very effective with that weapon.  I<br/>
always try to practice in groups..it just makes your skill go up faster<br/>
since there is less downtime then going at it alone.  Also keep up your bash<br/>
skill, your gonna use that skill the majority of your time playing a pally.<br/>
Well I guess thats all the advice I can give you for now..good luck and<br/>
happy hunting!<br/>
