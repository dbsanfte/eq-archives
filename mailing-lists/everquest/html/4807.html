<div id="ygrps-yiv-565660187">Hi Donna!<br/>
I pre-ordered Lost Dungeons and so far nothing unusual has happened to me.<br/>
*knock on woodelf*<br/>
I thought about cancelling and buying the CD but it would just be one more<br/>
thing to worry about from the post office.<br/>
I like the idea of it being $5 cheaper to buy the online version.<br/>

&gt;Be careful if your thinking of ordering Lost Dungeons of Norrath. Theres<br/>
 </span></blockquote>all kinds of problems with it. A fellow Guildie pre &gt;ordered it and last<br/>
night when he got killed he deleveled 7 levels. Here&#39;s a link to the kind of<br/>
problems everyone is having.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  So.. Anyone pre-order Lost Dungeons of Norrath? And is anyone going to<br/>
wait<br/>
  to buy the storebought CD version that comes with a real life gift as well<br/>
  as an in-game gift of an 8 slot weight reduction bag for one character?<br/>
  luv,<br/>
