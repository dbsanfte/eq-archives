<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266457927">Hi there!<br/>
<br/>
Are there any high level Rangers on this list that could tell me a little about Archery please?  I created a Woodelf Ranger yesterday and planned to focus on this skill, but a friend has just told me that Archery is broken and serves no purpose but to pull albeit from great distances.  I was hoping that a well developed archer, along with snare could do most damage to mobs before its arrival.  If this not true I find it staggering.  Its fine for casters to snare, DD and DoT - ie fighting from a distance, but not bow-wielders?  <br/>
Any advice and general observations would be kindly met<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
