<div id="ygrps-yiv-76198779"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I suck at selling and can&#39;t go into the bazaar anymore. Sharing a network<br/>
&gt; with 4 computers with only a 19.2kbps connection really really blows. I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t even play EQ if one person has a text based rpg going on online now.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i saw some of your postings about not being able to enter bazaar.<br/>
i think it is either your connection or the gfx card is &quot;too small&quot;.<br/>
have a look further down, i wrote some more things down there...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;  in WW wolves drop a pelt, that is sold for 400pp to 600pp each. well,<br/>
&gt; &gt; some still ask for 1000pp for it (i believe it is used for<br/>
 </span></blockquote>blacksmithing).<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; Wow. WW is what now? warsilk woods? What lvl are they?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sorry... forgot about that zone... i was referring to Western Wastes.<br/>
and the right name of the wolves is &quot;Velium Hounds&quot;. the wolves<br/>
are 49 to 51 i think and i can only solo them pet-chaining. one wolf<br/>
needs up to four, sometimes five (air) pets.<br/>
<br/>
no discussion about pet&#39;s here: at my level only air is useful.<br/>
next best choice would be water. earth is only a good chioce if<br/>
you duo with a good healer (eg CH)... and fire... not here...<br/>
<br/>
my heart rate is constant at the level like when i walked through<br/>
Kael Drakkel for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
getting there can be sort of an adventure for non-porters:<br/>
    Cobalt Scar -&gt; Siren&#39;s Grotto -&gt; Western Wastes<br/>
<br/>
it is really nice to have a wizzy and druid alt... especially<br/>
if they are on another account and you have more than one<br/>
system to play... :-)<br/>
<br/>
and having a cleric on a third account with even one more<br/>
system availible to play, makes me feel much better hunting<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
huh... did i mention i am maxxed ally on CoV faction (those<br/>
drakes in Skyshrine)... also most of my alts have good CoV<br/>
faction... it makes it much easier to stay alive in WW.<br/>
<br/>
actually there aren&#39;t many critters i could hunt in WW without<br/>
hurting my CoV faction. well, and if there is one of those wurms,<br/>
i just run... or gate...<br/>
<br/>
here is the link to the mobs:<br/>
    <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=108">http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=108</a><br/>
<br/>
think of this zone like the sandy area of South Ro:<br/>
 - replace the sand with ice... looks almost like eastern wastes<br/>
 - replace all the undead with wyverns (CoV faction)<br/>
 - replace all the spiders with (named) drakes (CoV faction)<br/>
 - add some Brontos<br/>
 - add many Ice Burrower (really big wurms)<br/>
 - add _some_ Velium Hounds<br/>
 - add some more things that want to kill you...<br/>
 - and of course some NPCs<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yeah, but by the time I can actually hit a key I&#39;m kicked. :-( It takes me<br/>
&gt; 10 minutes to zone in and then boom. disconnected.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>argl... this is pretty ugly... :-(((<br/>
<br/>
maybe switch to top-down-view before entering the zone.<br/>
<br/>
my smallest system (p2/300, 512mb, tnt2) has some problems with<br/>
the game (old zones are the fastest), but still works pretty good.<br/>
actually i use that system for my trader and bazaar is no problem at<br/>
all. about zoning: it is faster than all my other systems...<br/>
<br/>
the bigger systems are a notebook and a desktop, each with a<br/>
P3 (notebook 1.12GHz, desktop 933MHz) and nVidia chips<br/>
(notebook geforce 2 go, desktop geforce 3 ti550). all systems<br/>
have a fixed swap file with 4095MB (limitation is because of<br/>
windows 2k, i think XP can use bigger ones). most EQ options<br/>
are turned off, no music, &quot;not much&quot; sound.<br/>
<br/>
the notebook gets slower in bazaar at a resolution of 1024x768.<br/>
the desktop hasn&#39;t too many problems even at 1600x1200. other<br/>
zones, like wakening lands (eg with many trees, and other stuff)<br/>
or some of the new LoY zones give those boxes very much<br/>
trouble.<br/>
<br/>
all my systems are connected to the internet using a PPC/G4<br/>
based linux system connected to DSL (actually the german<br/>
&quot;T-DSL&quot; variant). the major problems i have is the connection<br/>
to the states... on the other hand, sometimes it is hard to believe<br/>
that the servers (eg Tarew Marr) is located overseas.<br/>
