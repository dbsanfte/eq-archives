<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] intelligent weapons <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604618983">I wonder if the weapons will like refuse to fight? Or if they will actually hit better or something. I wish there was a way to upgrade epic weapons (other than adding an augment stone). I would love for my Water Sprinkler of Nem Ankh to have better speed and damage. Or even a proc of some kind. You&#39;d think that bc it&#39;s epic it would have better features. Although I can&#39;t complain about the rez.<br/>
