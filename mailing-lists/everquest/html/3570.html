<div id="ygrps-yiv-1669179681">Hey Rob,<br/>
Thanks for the help and advice but it mysteriously came <br/>
back to life last night as if nothing ever happened! <br/>
Damn computers! The problem was that I couldn&#39;t even get <br/>
to a point where I could run the system restore option. <br/>
As I start up the first thing I see is the Dell splash <br/>
screen then it would proceed into booting up windows. <br/>
Well it would get passed the Dell screen and then <br/>
immediately go to a white screen telling me it couldn&#39;t <br/>
find any drives. Usually one can boot off a floppy or <br/>
CDRom, I couldn&#39;t even do that! Being a laptop and the <br/>
drives are interchangeable, I wasn&#39;t even getting power <br/>
to the other drives. I was figuring something went wrong <br/>
with the SCSI management on a hardware basis and that <br/>
the only repair option was to send it in. I hadn&#39;t <br/>
contacted Dell yet, I was mostly venting and throwing a <br/>
fit. ;-) When I went to Dell&#39;s site to chat with support <br/>
the stupid thing started working again and has been fine <br/>
ever since. I uninstalled SP3 though!<br/>
My level is pretty good, thanks for the consideration, <br/>
not to many people are that way anymore. I&#39;m getting <br/>
ready to test on my Win2k MCSE so wish me luck! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
Steve</div>
