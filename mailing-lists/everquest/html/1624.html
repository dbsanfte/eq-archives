<div id="ygrps-yiv-441376426">LOL. There are quite a few rl females in my guilds. But most of the people<br/>
think I&#39;m a male. They don&#39;t know I&#39;m a female. Even when I&#39;m playing a<br/>
female character. Kinda funny. Especially when I&#39;m playing a male character<br/>
and someone who knows me in rl refers to me as &quot;she&quot;.<br/>
luv,<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m one of the very few females in my guild. Everyone always seems to figure<br/>
out I&#39;m a rl female too...not sure why!<br/>

  Do things ever happen on your server and you want to tell someone but no<br/>
one<br/>
  you know will care?  Does that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe it&#39;s just because I&#39;m a female and feel the need to gossip.  I don&#39;t<br/>
  know any females in RL that play the game.  Only my husband and his<br/>
friends.<br/>
  They don&#39;t care about the gossip of the game.<br/>
<br/>
  The funniest things I see go on between males and females.  Jealously<br/>
mainly.<br/>
   Female A gets jealous when Female B is flirting with Male A who &quot;belongs&quot;<br/>
to<br/>
  Female A.  Male C is married to Female C.  Female C&#39;s alt is engaged to<br/>
Male<br/>
  D.  Male C doesn&#39;t like that Female C&#39;s alt is engaged to someone else.<br/>
  Stuff like that...I find it amusing.  Everquest could turn into this huge<br/>
  soap opera.  Who cares about loot, who&#39;s &quot;cheating&quot; on who?  It&#39;s just a<br/>
game<br/>
  and sometimes people really take it seriously.<br/>
<br/>
  And since we have a former guide (or where you a GM) on here I have a<br/>
  question.  When you get married and you take the surname of your<br/>
  husband...can you hypenate???  I don&#39;t like his last name (my RL husband&#39;s<br/>
  character that is).  It doesn&#39;t sound &quot;catchy&quot; with my first name.<br/>
<br/>
  Ok and I didn&#39;t know you could get divorced in Norrath.  I just find that<br/>
  funny too.  I might want to marry my RL husband&#39;s character just to<br/>
divorce<br/>
  him.  He doesn&#39;t take out the trash one night...I divorce him in EQ.  LOL.<br/>
<br/>
  Ok so anyway.<br/>
<br/>
  Also, I wonder how many of Norrath marriages have one person being a young<br/>
14<br/>
  to 16 year old male and the other either an old guy pretending to be a<br/>
female<br/>
  or an older female.<br/>
<br/>
  What do you think the percentage of actual female players versus actual<br/>
male<br/>
  players are in the game?<br/>
