<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Appreciate the response but I was hunting with 
others, no one I know personally, and when I died I figured to just go back, but 
when I got back my corspe was gone.&nbsp; I had 2 orc centurions on me and none

  <div><br></div><tt>If you die at levels below 5 you should resurrect with five 
  days of <br>food and water. If your corpse had nothing on it, it may have 
  <br>disappeared, but your own anwswer is most likely. You misplaced your 
  <br>corpse. Dying at levels below five is set to be low-penalty (you lose 
  <br>very little and get food and water when you come back) to make the 
  <br>early learning a bit easier.<br><br>There are tools to find corpses, sold 
  by merchants. However, it is <br>best to learn to die with finding your corpse 
  in mind. Try to look <br>around at landmarks when death is clearly coming. Try 
  to be near some <br>object you can find easily when you come back. And unless 
  you don&#39;t <br>mind having to do this often, learn to fight in such a way as to 
  <br>seldom die. Some gamers like to take the risks leading to frequent 
  <br>deaths, but I prefer to hunt with care and die seldom. Seems more in 
  <br>the spirit of the game to me.<br><br>Good hunting to you.<br><br>Barto

  had a 4th level Druid in the <br>city of Elves and while out at the Orc Camp, 
  with others, I got <br>killed by an Orc Centurian and when I returned to get 
  my corpse, <br>nothing was there.&nbsp; It was not more than 4 minutes when I 
  returned.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Question: Is it possible for someone to Steal or 
  Loot my corpse? <br>The book says no but I beg to differ.<br>&gt; Is it 
  possible that I had two corpses out there? Meaning, When I <br>went back with 
  a dead body I died again?&nbsp; Which meant I found the <br>wrong corpse? 
  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; And to add one last question, &quot;what do I do now? seeing as I 
  have <br>no food, no money, no nothing?&quot;&nbsp; Do I beg or do I start another 
  char?<br>&gt; This game is totally fun but with the fact of trying to learn 
  which <br>way to go all the time and dying, it is starting to get to 
  me,<br>&gt; I don&#39;t want to give up just yet and I turned to this board since 
  <br>the Chat from the game options was USELESS.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Please help 
  and Thanks in advance<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Rob<br><br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit
