<div id="ygrps-yiv-744636980">Well, you can go to Paludal Caverns on Luclin. Take the entrance from<br/>
Shadeweaver&#39;s Thicket, though. First, you can start by killing the weakest<br/>
creatures near the entrance. Around 15th, you can move in and fight the<br/>
plerg fiends until the XP starts slowing down. After that, move in deeper to<br/>
kill the phlarg fiends. That can easily sustain you until close to 20th<br/>
level. I think I managed to hunt there with my ranger off and on until<br/>
around 22nd (I bounced back and forth from Lake of Ill Omen to Paludal<br/>
Caverns).<br/>

I am fairly new to EQ and have been trying various class-race combos to see<br/>
what I like.  I now have three character between level 10 and 15.  I have<br/>
been going to Crushbone alot to hunt, and the tower in the field of bone is<br/>
cool but I am getting tired of the same old stuff.  Where else can a<br/>
character in the 10-20 range go to hunt where he can find a group easily?  I<br/>
have looked over the EQ Atlas and see a lot of stuff for 1-10 and 30+.<br/>
Since I may try some more class-race combos before I try and take anybody<br/>
over 20 I could use some more places to fill the gap between newbie and<br/>
experienced.  I am not interested in power-leveling.<br/>
<br/>
I have EQ Evolution, so every expansion but LDON.  I play on the Tunare<br/>
(sp?) server.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
