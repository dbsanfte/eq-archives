<div id="ygrps-yiv-803330297">I am fairly new to EQ and have been trying various class-race combos to see<br/>
what I like.  I now have three character between level 10 and 15.  I have<br/>
been going to Crushbone alot to hunt, and the tower in the field of bone is<br/>
cool but I am getting tired of the same old stuff.  Where else can a<br/>
character in the 10-20 range go to hunt where he can find a group easily?  I<br/>
have looked over the EQ Atlas and see a lot of stuff for 1-10 and 30+.<br/>
Since I may try some more class-race combos before I try and take anybody<br/>
over 20 I could use some more places to fill the gap between newbie and<br/>
experienced.  I am not interested in power-leveling.<br/>
<br/>
I have EQ Evolution, so every expansion but LDON.  I play on the Tunare<br/>
(sp?) server.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</div>
