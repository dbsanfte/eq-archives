<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1164662993">Kill the goblins. Kill lots and lots of runnyeye goblins. This increases<br/>
your faction with the people in Kaladim. Oh, and killing the BB bandits will<br/>
increase your faction with the citizens of Kaladim. Possibly the Stormguard<br/>
too. So get a group and pick off the bandits. Beware that PegLeg and his<br/>
group undercon. They may be green but they hit hard and fast. They tend not<br/>
to stay rooted very long. They like to gang up on you. So get someone who<br/>
can harmony/mezmerize or snare. Then kick the crap out of em one at a time.<br/>
If a lesser spirit spawns when you kill Peg Leg do NOT kill it. It is bad<br/>
faction with shamans if you do.<br/>
Also, keep the Runnyeye Warbeads to turn in to the guy in the same building<br/>
as the guy who takes the belts and pads.<br/>
Byzar Bloodforge I think..<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m currently killing everything in Crushbone (or will be when I make 15)<br/>
&gt; for faction with Storm Guards (dwarven guards in BB and Kaladim&#39;s warrior<br/>
&gt; guild)<br/>
&gt; Then I&#39;ll start turning in the pads/belts for faction.  I don&#39;t think<br/>
&gt; this&#39;ll help with the merchants....any help?<br/>
