<div><font face="Arial" size="2">That&#39;s not actually so uncommon.&nbsp; Sometimes it 
can be attributed to PL&#39;ing but doesn&#39;t always have to be.&nbsp; I have 4 druids 
across 3 servers who are all over level 50 and suck at Divination.&nbsp; None of 
them were power leveled.&nbsp; Just that Divination is the least used casting 
skill.&nbsp; The only line of spells druids have that use it are Invis and See 
Invis spells.&nbsp; Well, Spirit Of Eagle and Flight of Eagles comes with See 
Invis, but that&#39;s Alteration.&nbsp; And most high level druid armor since Planes 
of Power comes with Perma-See Invis while worn.&nbsp; And prior to level 50, 
there aren&#39;t that many mobs you go up against that require the need for See 
Invis or Invisibility.&nbsp; But then when you have to run through Nobles 
Causeway or WOS, you make sure you&#39;ve spent a few hours raising that Divination 
skill beforehand.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The enchanter off tanking is a better example of 
someone being PL&#39;d and not knowing how to play the character. A better example 
would be a cleric who was PL&#39;d and fizzles every time he tries to heal in a 
group so resorts to off tanking as well.&nbsp; </font></div>

    would<br>leave the guild and join another guild that was more liberal

    you&#39;ve seen the enchanter who<br>joins a pick up group, and when you get 
    adds, they start off tanking<br>instead of mezzing the adds.&nbsp; That is 
    just scary to me, LOL.<br><br>--- In EverQuest@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Wulfric

    [EverQuest] Powerleveling<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does anyone 
    else see PLing beyond level 20 as wrong?&nbsp; I mean, 
    if<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; you&#39;re trying to catch up to someone else to be able 
    to group with<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; them (and you&#39;ve actually gotten a toon 
    above 20 before), then I could<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; see it.&nbsp; But 
    powerleveling people up to 20+, just because they want 
    to<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; be uber and go to better zones for better drops isn&#39;t 
    teaching them<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; how to play their character very well, 
    IMO.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have more fun fighting and scratching my 
    way toward 70, than just<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; killing the same mobs over and 
    over until they turn blue, them moving<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; to another zone 
    to kill tougher stuff.&nbsp; To me, it&#39;s the journey and<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    learning to play your character properly.&nbsp; Nothing irks me more 
    than<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; to group with someone who is level 60, but has no 
    real clue as to how<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; to play their toon.&nbsp; It steals 
    from everyone in the groups good<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; experience to have to 
    &quot;take care of&quot; the newb who was PL&#39;d to 60.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;
