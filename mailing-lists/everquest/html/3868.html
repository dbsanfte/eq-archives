<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607672220">hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
i am not sure if this already exists, but is there a newbie FAQ<br/>
availible? we could collect those links, and put them in the groups<br/>
link section, or collect them in a file.<br/>
<br/>
maybe we can make a FAQ/guide here, as we have old and new<br/>
players in this group. the new players can collect the answers, and<br/>
we older ones try to give suitable answers. maybe add some<br/>
examples for, how to find your guild leader, doing the first fights,<br/>
interact with a merchant, or how to find and do quests.<br/>
<br/>
i had a very nice guide to blacksmithing, with screenshots of all<br/>
important items. i hope i still find my printed copy, because the<br/>
site it was one, went offline about two years ago. but i loved the<br/>
style of this guide. some pictures and some text, not too much<br/>
of either ... and somehow smithing got easy ... well, without the<br/>
needed plat, it was still pretty painful to do anything at all ;-)<br/>
