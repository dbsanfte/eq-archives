<div id="ygrps-yiv-803722628">Having finally made level 14 as a druid halfling, I began traveling <br/>
and seeing more of the world. However, I did a bit of hunting in the <br/>
Karanas which eventually put my level in jeopardy. I sought a way to <br/>
get to the middle of 14 so that I could risk death a few times <br/>
without losing my ability to sow and bind myself. These spells were <br/>
critical to my freedom of travel.<br/>
<br/>
I discovered the mail run. Being from Rivervale I knew that my home <br/>
was in the middle of the contenent. I could take runs to Qeynos or <br/>
Freeport with reasonable ease. When I discovered High Pass as a mail <br/>
destination, the pattern was set.<br/>
<br/>
I bound myself in High Pass Keep, just beside the bard who gives and <br/>
receives the mail there. Take the Freeport mail from that bard, run <br/>
to Rivervale. Take the mail from there to Freeport. Run to Freeport. <br/>
Deliver mail. Take the mail for High Pass. Gate to High Pass. Do it <br/>
again. <br/>
<br/>
I did this until my level 14 was secure. Made some cash, gained <br/>
experience. Now I am ready for a bit more adventure.<br/>
