<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729944689"><p>I had all my bank slots full too. I just bought the trader satchels, and switched everything from what was in my bank containers to the new satchels, then put them in the bank, then sold my old containers. I only have two satchels that I keep in the bank. You can put anything in them, they are huge!
