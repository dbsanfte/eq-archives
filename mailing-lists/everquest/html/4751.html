<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I agree with Su.&nbsp; Also to add, I have a 
druid.&nbsp; I can cast more than 3 spells on full mana.&nbsp; It also does not 
take me 20 minutes to meditate to full.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know what race you chose 
for your druid, but when it comes to druids, wisdom counts.&nbsp; The higher the 
wisdom, the larger the mana pool you have, and the quicker you can 
meditate.&nbsp; Wood elves and halflings have the highest wisdom for the druid 
class.&nbsp; Half elves and humans do not.&nbsp; Now you can raise your wisdom 
with some gear, but most likely it will never be as high as a wood elf or 
halfling druid - assuming the creator dumped all their bonus points into 
wisdom.&nbsp; Curiously enough, I think the game has gotten a lot easier to play 
since I started playing over two years ago.&nbsp; The advent of the windows GUI 
really helped a lot, especially making everything in XML so it&#39;s customizable by 
users.&nbsp; Also, not having to look at your spell book when you med helped a 
lot.&nbsp; I really like not losing my corpse or xp if I die before level 
10.&nbsp; Face the reality, buffs and everything else will eventually be nerfed 
as new expansion packs come out and more people start reaching higher 
levels.&nbsp; KEI might have been nerfed, but eventually something better will 
replace it.&nbsp; There are so many better objects in the game now than there 
were before.&nbsp; As people get higher and higher level, they may have to 
revamp zones to make them more challenging to those players.&nbsp; This is 
probably easier than creating all new zones.&nbsp; No matter what they do there 
will always be bugs, but they will fix those bugs and introduce new bugs.&nbsp; 
This is why they say the world is constantly evolving and changing.&nbsp; These 
changes are one thing that makes the game so unique because it makes the world 
have a life of its own.&nbsp; I am sure if you send in your letter, Sony will be 
kind enough to respond back to you with a prefabricated form letter explaining 
that they appreciate your comments and concerns, but as they have already 
explained the world is constantly changing, they apologize they cannot please 
all of the people all of the time.&nbsp; And it will be signed with the most 
sincerest heart-felt sympathies of the President of Sony Online Entertainment 
him/her self, whomever that may be.&nbsp; Then you can take this letter of 
professional courtesy and frame it and hang it on your wall to remind you of the 
tooth and nail battle that you fought to make Sony recognize your side of the 
story.&nbsp; And I am sure your eyes will glance up at it every time you log on 
to Dark Ages of Camelot.</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>I mean this in the nicest way possible, but if you spelled 
  things <br>correctly, it might help your case a little more. I&#39;m not trying to 
  <br>insult you, but if I were someone working for Sony and I saw the 
  <br>spelling errors in this I would assume that you were either a child <br>or 
  that you didn&#39;t really care enough about the message to use <br>correct 
  spelling.<br>A few things to point out: the correct spelling is Verant. 
  However <br>Verant no longer has anything to do with Everquest. Quitting is 
  the <br>correct spelling. Meditating, Originally, Having, Minutes, Available, 
  <br>Appreciate and so forth. Spellcheck can run a long ways.<br>I hope you 
  don&#39;t use &quot;horse shit&quot; as an expression in your letter.<br>That said, I can 
  understand why they &quot;nerfed&quot; C2 and C3. It made it <br>harder for lower level 
  enchanters to compete with higher level <br>enchanters in selling their buffs, 
  and it made fighting less <br>challenging for lower level characters than the 
  creators had <br>intended. Basically, players became so dependent on the buffs 
  that <br>they did not learn how to conserve mana and play the characters in a 
  <br>manner the creators had intended.<br>It did not take the fun out of the 
  game. There are still many things <br>to enjoy. Some of the changes have made 
  the game more exciting. They <br>have also added new quests for lower level 
  characters and added some <br>features to make things easier for new 
  characters that are just <br>starting out.<br>Some examples: When I first 
  started out if you were low level and you <br>died you had a short period of 
  time to get your corpse back. If you <br>did not you lost it and all of your 
  gear. And you lost xp even at <br>level 6. Now you don&#39;t lose your corpse or 
  xp until level 10.<br>There is a feedback system you can use and you can email 
  customer <br>service. I think that quitting EverQuest over a few changes is a 
  bit <br>extreme. But I guess what it comes down to is your enjoyment of the 
  <br>game. If you no longer enjoy it, then you do not have to 
  play.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br><br>--- In EverQuest@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Connor

  changes sony/varent has induced into this game <br>&gt; such as revamping some 
  perfectly fine zones and make them harder <br>than <br>&gt; orginaly, and 
  swiping c3 and even c2 from our collective grasp, my <br>&gt; famley members 
  who play this game will be writing sony and they <br>will <br>&gt; shortly and 
  most likely <br>&gt; be quiting this game, which in effect may lead to my 
  defection as <br>&gt; well due to the incressing dificulty of this so call 
  &quot;class <br>balancing&quot;<br>&gt; now mind you this is total horse shit on sonys 
  part, and they are <br>&gt; taking all the fun and adventur out of this game 
  by making every <br>&gt; thing totaly impossible and un reachable, now i know 
  not every one <br>&gt; feels like this but not every one is a druid who with 
  out c3 can <br>&gt; cast no more that 3 spells with out haveing to sit for 20 
  minets <br>and <br>&gt; meddititing for example<br>&gt; <br>&gt; What im 
  asking my fellow everquest players and there friends is for <br>&gt; there 
  suport in the effort we are trying to get sony to see, that <br>&gt; they are 
  systematicly desimating a game that once was fun and <br>&gt; enjoyable. Once 
  this letter is writin i will have it in <br>&gt; the forums here with sonys 
  email which we have directed these <br>coments.<br>&gt; We would appriciate 
  the suport of our fellow gamers and friends if <br>&gt; they too would also 
  after that time email sony and the like with <br>&gt; their concers and grips- 
  please once this is posted consider our <br>&gt; request as some one has to 
  fight back again the few who decide they <br>&gt; need to nerf our spells, our 
  strengh and our fun in this game <br>&gt; <br>&gt; I will be posting the 
  letter and the email address as soon as it is <br>&gt; made aviabel and i will 
  be posting this accross as many forums as i <br>&gt; can find hoping to fight 
  back against the evil that is the <br>everquest <br>&gt; managemnt. <br>&gt;
