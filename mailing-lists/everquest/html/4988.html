So I take it you never heard of the smithing quest out of Shar Vahl.  There<br/>
is a smithing quest there that you can use to get to 250 for little money,<br/>
just need to do a lot of farming.  There are two mobs there that drop the<br/>
items needed for smithing.  The owlbears and sonic wolves drop different<br/>
substances that are used together with metal rings to make humming<br/>
orbs...these triv around 180 making it easy to get smithing up for just the<br/>
cost of making the rings...no water needed.  The only problem is these<br/>
substances drop the most often when the mobs control the islands in the<br/>
south of the Hollowshade zone.  That being the case most people trigger the<br/>
war to get the owlbears or sonic wolves to overrun the grimling there and<br/>
make the islands their home.  once you reach 180 or so in smithing you can<br/>
start making Shadowscream armor.  Forgot what piece it was, but one part<br/>
trivs at 208, another around 225, and the boots triv at 250+.  For just the<br/>
cost of the mold, the cost of making the humming orbs, and the swirling<br/>
shadows...you can get your smithing to GM.  Is that not reason enough to<br/>
camp the mobs in Hollowshade? </span></blockquote></div>
