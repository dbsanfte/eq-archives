Those are all understandable arguments. In my example<br/>
I stated specifically, the home of the halflings.<br/>
<br/>
You may not know your way around but I bet you all<br/>
know the starting zones of the races?  Home of the<br/>
halflings, just happened to be the Fastest way to any<br/>
bank pre-planes of power.  Circle of Misty was the<br/>
most used spell in the game prior to that.  <br/>
<br/>
But we all have seen the BOUGHT toon regardless.  <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy all, and get out and see the world    :)<br/>
