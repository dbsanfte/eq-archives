funny... I always play female characters, mostly human, one Iksar shaman, and I 
never have any problems with the guys listening to me.&nbsp; Of course, the 
third time we aggro the whole camp I would have yelled at the guys in all caps 
and dropped all &quot;please&quot;s from the request, lol.&nbsp; Happens again, I&#39;d tell 
them to fall back or I&#39;m leaving the group.&nbsp; Still don&#39;t listen and I&#39;m out 
the door... you don&#39;t need a group like that.</span></font></div>

 size="2">I don&#39;t have any male characters. &nbsp;I don&#39;t know why exactly. 
  &nbsp;I have noticed <br>that my wood elf rogue has been given ALOT of stuff. 
  &nbsp;I don&#39;t ask, these <br>people just come up and give it to me. &nbsp;The 
  other day my rogue was the group <br>leader at Orc 1 in EC. &nbsp;Maybe I 
  should have used a male character because I <br>can&#39;t tell you how many times 
  I said please move back, the whole camp will <br>aggro on us when they spawn 
  if we are too close, please move back, add, add, <br>add, ok let&#39;s move back, 
  we&#39;re pulling the whole camp, hey move back, please <br>move back. &nbsp;Over 
  and over and over. &nbsp;They never did listen. &nbsp;There was 2 who <br>were 
  especially bad about it. &nbsp;After my guildmate had dinged, I left the 
  <br>camp. &nbsp;I was just tired of trying to explain that the closer we 
  stood, that <br>every spawn would aggro on us no matter if we were ready for 
  them or not. &nbsp; <br>And the 2 just didn&#39;t seem to have that figured out. 
  &nbsp;I wonder if they would <br>have listened to me if I was something other 
  than a cute female wood elf. &nbsp;LOL <br><br>Lena
