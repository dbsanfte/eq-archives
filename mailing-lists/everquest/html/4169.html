<div id="ygrps-yiv-190707165">A lot of difference.  The Ti has a much faster redraw rate so graphics will<br/>
look cleaner and more detailed when you turn or move.  Also faster<br/>
processing and memory so it cuts down on internal system lag.  A better<br/>
video card can sometimes compensate for a slower system. Also, the Ti is<br/>
made from titanium which is much more heat resistant than previous cards.<br/>
So the card doesnt get as hot and there is less chance of failure later on.<br/>
Overall it&#39;s a good card for the money. I plan on getting the 128MB Ti for<br/>
my P4 once I get moved into my new apartment.<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] video cards<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    I have a question for you all.  I am picking up a GeForce4 TI 4200 64 mb<br/>
video card and I was wondering how much of a difference that was from a<br/>
GeForce4 MX440 04 mb video card.  Will I see much of a difference?  I was<br/>
just wondering about that because I remember a while back a discussion about<br/>
the cards on this board before.  Well I would apperciate any comments on<br/>
this topic.  according to the manufacturer did say theis card did better<br/>
than thier 128 mb version of the same card due to the clock speed of the<br/>
ram.  Just what i have heard. </span></blockquote></div>
