Maybe it&#39;s something that is said mostly on your<br/>
server? The &quot;lingo&quot; can vary slightly from server to<br/>
server.<br/>
<br/>
My guess though is it&#39;s a way to see just who all in<br/>
the zone is LFG, since a lot of people don&#39;t use the<br/>
/lfg tool.<br/>

&gt; What does it mean <br/>
&gt; when a person shouts &quot;looking for group check&quot;? <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been playing <br/>
&gt; for just over a year and have never quite figured<br/>
&gt; out if this means <br/>
&gt; that the person is looking for new group members or<br/>
&gt; if they are <br/>
&gt; acoounting for the members that are already in the<br/>
&gt; group.  Just a <br/>
&gt; question from someone who simply does not know.<br/>

&gt; Thanks<br/>
