<div id="ygrps-yiv-1440225551">Speaking of bugs...<br/>
I was at the chat waiting for error 1018 to clear and the GM was saying that<br/>
there is a known issue with dialup not letting people past character select.<br/>
There are people with dialup accounts who haven&#39;t been able to login for 2<br/>
months now.<br/>
I&#39;m interested in hearing about other bug as well. I&#39;m thinking of compiling<br/>
a list.<br/>
