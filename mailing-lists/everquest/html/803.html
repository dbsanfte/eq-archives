<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424777295">I&#39;m also high lvl and it only slightly bothers me.. just common curtosy to<br/>
say hi is all I ask.. I even put it in my bio tho.. which says something<br/>
like:  &quot;Hi!  being nosey eh? I like to check out ppls stuff too but least<br/>
you can do is say hi!  I don&#39;t bite.. well not hard anyway =P&quot;  so it&#39;s just<br/>
a joke.. but some even after reading that, some still take their looksie and<br/>
walk off.. oh well.. some ppl are just that way.. I don&#39;t give it more than<br/>
a 2 second thought or anything =)  the majority ask where&#39;d ya get this or<br/>
what&#39;s the stats on that.. or some simply say WOW!  if I have time I always<br/>
am happy to talk about whatever I got and where cause I&#39;m happy to have been<br/>
lucky enough to get those things =)<br/>

&gt; Being a rather high level warrior.. I get inspected constantly by lowbies<br/>
&gt; and I inspect/am inspected by people my level all the time.  It in no way<br/>
&gt; bothers me, and if it does, it just shows you&#39;re getting into the game a<br/>
&gt; little too much.  The only time this should ever make you feel uneasy is<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re on a PvP server because they&#39;re scoping for your items to see if<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; should kill you usually.  If this honestly bothers you, I would imagine<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; the type of person who is claustrophobic or who gets upset if someone<br/>
bumps<br/>
&gt; into you in the subway or something along those lines.  Eventually, you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; take it with an air of pride must likely, because it&#39;s usually just<br/>
newbies<br/>
&gt; gawking over your equipment. </span></blockquote></div>
