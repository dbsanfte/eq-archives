<div id="ygrps-yiv-597007255">Hi gang,<br/>
I just wanted to take a moment and thank any and all of you on this list<br/>
I may have come across during my Warrior&#39;s, (Genmay), travels to and<br/>
from Ak&#39;Anon and Felwith. The SOW&#39;s were perfect, it makes the trips so<br/>
much faster! As for the extra buffs those were wonderful too! Lately<br/>
I&#39;ve had a thing going on with a large plagued rat over in Steamfront<br/>
who seems to find me every time and kills me! With the buffs I can make<br/>
it to the gates of the city and the guards take care of him. I swear<br/>
when I get a couple of levels higher I&#39;m going to defeat that darn rat!<br/>
;-)<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting!<br/>
Durgaa:	9th level Wood Elf Ranger<br/>
Shizney:	5th level Gnome Mage<br/>
Genmay:	6th level Gnome Warrior</div>
