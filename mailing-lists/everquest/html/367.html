<div id="ygrps-yiv-769780253">Scruffy is a pet of one of the guards, suggest leaving that critter alone.<br/>
Have noticed that people with slower computers actually move slower in the<br/>
game.  My best friend was complaining constantly until i built him a P2 350.<br/>
May have something to do with the rate at which information is processed and<br/>
returned to the server (?)....now he says his performance in &quot;running away&quot;<br/>
seems to match other classes of his kind (always depends on how much weight<br/>
your carrying).  some creatures your not going to outrun no matter how much<br/>
you try or how light you are.  they are simply faster than us bipeds....<br/>

&gt;Hello,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This may sound like a newbie question, but that&#39;s probably because I&#39;m a<br/>
&gt;newbie. First question, is, no matter how hard I try, I can NEVER run away<br/>
&gt;form anything. I jump while I run. I have tried strafing to the side while<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;run. I just can&#39;t seem to do it. Also, I have seen a rat named &quot;Scruffy&quot;<br/>
&gt;several times. Does this thing serve any purpose besides an extra rat?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks,<br/>
