<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051925857">what about time requirements??<br/>
EQ demands absolutely all your spare time to enjoy the<br/>
game... you know things like you have to camp for a<br/>
particular quest item for hours, sometimes days...<br/>
<br/>
Is this needed in DAoC? I played EQ for a while until<br/>
I realized it took up almost my whole life...lol.. I<br/>
don&#39;t wish to start on another MMORPG that&#39;s like<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
I heard AO is pretty good since there&#39;s that mission<br/>
console thingy that supposedly eliminates camping...<br/>

&gt; we play the best game.  It&#39;s nice to have the<br/>
&gt; marketplace competition as each game tries to outdo<br/>
&gt; the other.  There&#39;s nothing wrong or disloyal in<br/>
&gt; switching RPGs, and there will be nothing wrong with<br/>
&gt; switching back if/when EQ revamps itself.<br/>

&gt;   I must say that I too have made the switch,<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t touched EQ since DAoC came out.  Dark Age<br/>
&gt; has had the benefit of hindsight and learning from<br/>
&gt; EQ&#39;s mistakes.  They have built upon them.  There is<br/>
&gt; less downtime, more character specialization, less<br/>
&gt; annoying corpse runs, better graphics, easier<br/>
&gt; grouping, and better pvp.  DAoC is better than EQ<br/>
&gt; currently, however, to EQ&#39;s credit -- Dark Age<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t be what it is if it hadn&#39;t been for EQ&#39;s<br/>
&gt; experience.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   If you like EQ, I think you&#39;ll like Dark Age if<br/>
&gt; not as much, perhaps better.  The only drawback is<br/>
&gt; that you need a pretty high-end system for smooth<br/>
&gt; play (particularly a good graphics card).<br/>

&gt;     My husband has been playing it.  In fact, after<br/>
&gt; a few days, he cancelled his EQ account and is<br/>
&gt; solely playing DAoC.  He keeps telling me to try it<br/>
&gt; but I tell him I like EQ just fine.  From watching<br/>
&gt; him, I can tell I don&#39;t wanna play.  BUT he&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; hardcore gamer and EQ and Solitaire are the only<br/>
&gt; games I play.  He says it&#39;s like EQ but better.   <br/>
