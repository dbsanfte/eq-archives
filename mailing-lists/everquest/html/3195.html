<div id="ygrps-yiv-40718432">Uh oh.<br/>
This does not sound good since you are not on Druzzil<br/>
Ro, if I remember correctly and I had the same problem<br/>
on that server.<br/>
<br/>
I heard you can petition and a GM will port you there<br/>
<br/>
I ended up going to oasis and going that way.<br/>
it is trickier since in the overthere good races are<br/>
KOS but I managed to jump off that boat and swim to<br/>
the shore.  I did not manage to get through the other<br/>
zones though.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>

&gt; druid. I will be needing Brute hides, and so was<br/>
&gt; ready to go and hunt <br/>
&gt; them. However, the shuttles in Butcherblock never<br/>
&gt; met the boat. I <br/>
&gt; tried three times, three different shuttles, and<br/>
&gt; they went out to <br/>
&gt; Timerous Deep, got close to the boat, then the boat<br/>
&gt; left. The <br/>
&gt; shuttles just went back to BB.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That avenue being out, I returned to SK to pick off<br/>
&gt; gnolls, and <br/>
&gt; forage Plains Pebbles. I almost have my bank tool<br/>
&gt; box full of them. <br/>
&gt; have about eight to go. So, decided to stay there<br/>
&gt; until I get the <br/>
&gt; rest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Plus I have been getting fs weapons from the gnolls,<br/>
&gt; which I have <br/>
&gt; tried to make into another Vale Sewing Kit to sell.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope they get the boat fixed. For my first trip I<br/>
&gt; want to do it the <br/>
&gt; old-fashioned way.<br/>
