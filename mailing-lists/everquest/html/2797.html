<p>hehe i dont even dare to think how much i spent on GW stuff in the last 13 years :( hell in the last 10 years even :( use to be ok at 40p a figure but now they milking everyone real bad, anyway</p>
<p>as far as evequest is concerned the monthly charge was and is secondry to lag, and playability, i spent about a month trying out all the other mmporgs that were out such as UO, AC, and that silly sci-fi one which i thought suked real bad anyway. but i found them all to be overly complicated or laggy.</p>
<p>i choose eq because me and my family are able to play at the same time sharing the same 56k connection without any probs, although we do use state of the art machines being constantly upgraded, although no ge-force 4 yet, (only the foolish would throw away 300 on a geforce card just now, when they will be 200 ina few months).</p>
<p>back to the point: i think that the $12 or so that it costs is ok just now, even taking into account the 3 accounts we have, but if it went up to $20 or so i think that would be to much, allowing for the exchange rate i pay about ï¿½8-9 per account&nbsp;after the $12 increase.</p>

<div></div>&gt;A fellow GW player........NICE 
<div></div>&gt;OH BOY do I know how you feel there. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;I think I have spent 3000.00 in the last 7 years on my 
<div></div>&gt;minis. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Even 20 per month I could tolerate but anything above 
<div></div>&gt;that would be pushing it. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;I am a Network Systems guy so I know what it takes to 
<div></div>&gt;make this game run and be stable, let alone program 
<div></div>&gt;the thing. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Giving us a better product comes with a small price I 
<div></div>&gt;guess. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;I think the 12 is fair. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;2 cents............

<div></div>&gt; &gt; My previous post touched on this. I have thought 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; about it a bit. We 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; pay less than $200 a year just to play. Not bad. I 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; spent at least 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; $500 on GamesWorkshop products each year when I was 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; more active 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; there. 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t have a problem dropping the monthly fee. It 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; is quite 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; reasonable. I might be able to dump another $500 a 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; year into 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; upgrades. Unfortunately, my machine is now pretty 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; much maxed. So I 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; must hope that I can hold out at the present level 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; long enough to get 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; together the funds for a more upgradeable tower. 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; 
<div></div>&gt; &gt; How much are others willing to pay to play?
