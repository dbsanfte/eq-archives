snag is that it only takes two people with track to<br/>
comfortably kill the Mammoths as fast as they pop.<br/>
Three and the zone is over hunted. Thus I don&#39;t<br/>
recommend going there to anyone but druids. Track is<br/>
absolutely essential or you just plain won&#39;t get any<br/>
mobs, and even more important is the ability to leave<br/>
and go hunt in SK or somewhere else when the zone is<br/>
overcrowded.<br/>
