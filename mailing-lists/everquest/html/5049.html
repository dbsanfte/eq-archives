<div id="ygrps-yiv-1772544285">Hiya ya&#39;ll, I actually ahve a couple quick questions, i tend to stay quiet,<br/>
read the emails, and learn from that but now i&#39;m at a cross roads and some<br/>
advice would be great. I just dinged 51, i&#39;m a De Wizzy (with faction issues<br/>
in Nek and i have no idea what i did to get that way) now i am curious about<br/>
2 things, levels vs AA and where can i go to get good xp w/ low risk to my<br/>
life, and, (ok so maybe 3 questions) where /how should i spend my AA points<br/>
(as i get them)<br/>
that about does it,<br/>
i play on Thouxle Paelles, usually from 11pm est-2am or so, and most<br/>
weekends if anyone wants to look me up<br/>
