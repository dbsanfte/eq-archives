<div id="ygrps-yiv-554313905">Sounds like the problem everyone was having when Luclin first came out. If I<br/>
remember correctly it was a problem with the video card drivers. Try<br/>
checking tech on the sony website and see if they&#39;ve got updated drivers for<br/>
your card. or if your cards even compatible. and make sure you&#39;re running<br/>
the right version of Direct X</div>
