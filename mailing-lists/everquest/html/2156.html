<div id="ygrps-yiv-1630951735">I pay for the game with an atm card. They accepted it when I started <br/>
and have accepted it since. However, the recommendation of the <br/>
prepaid card is a very good one. I am sure that the gods of gaming <br/>
could see the value in such cards, insuring that the customers <br/>
without credit cards could still play the game.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck in the game, but I wish you no luck in finding someone to <br/>
give you the information you want. That you might get from a friend <br/>
or family, but a stranger who gives that info out would at best soon <br/>
have a stripped character. Most of the in-game thefts are from unwise <br/>
sharing, not clever hacking.<br/>
