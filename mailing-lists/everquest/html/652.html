<b>Subject:</b> GM&#39;s and Guild Support <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648268093">Anyone have any ideas as to when GM&#39;s are on the Bertoxx server to finalize <br/>
an approved guild? I&#39;ve been trying to meet up with one since  Saturday, but <br/>
they haven&#39;t shown like they&#39;re supposed to. I was also available during <br/>
they&#39;re old posted hours that they&#39;re supposed to take care of the <br/>
&quot;guilding&quot; process, I petitioned, and still nothing. This is getting really <br/>
old quick.</div>
