<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207894144"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I sort of enjoy the newbie questions and silly<br/>
&gt; posts...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Me too as for the newbie questions that is the main reason the new <br/>
group was formed to keep the quwstions and strings on EQ and not on <br/>
spam, and &quot;check out this website and the pics...ect&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
maybe I used words to &quot;strong&quot; for some but there are people who just <br/>
what to get and share info. on eq. Other groups allow non-EQ strings <br/>
and posts. That what we are trying to Avoid here. &quot;Just EQ, and <br/>
nothing but the EQ ma&#39;am&quot; a para-phrasa from the old TV show &quot;DRAGNET&quot;<br/>
