<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101246648">I see it like this Su.<br/>
<br/>
A) it is probably a simple billing mistake<br/>
B) SOE screwed up and should have backups of the char<br/>
data files IF they are gone or damaged<br/>
C) this is just another example of why we all need to<br/>
start griping more and letting them know that after 6<br/>
friggin years they should fix some crap.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry though, I am sure yer cleric and your<br/>
bro&#39;s SK are fine.  I think that SOEs servers are just<br/>
having some probs, especially since Katelya saw Drago<br/>
on not too long ago as a level 10 ranger running<br/>
around in Kelethin, but then I was able to log right<br/>
in and be my uber bad arse putting an arrow in<br/>
whatever moves ranger self and went on to go tank a<br/>
few baddies in WoS just to annoy the cleric I was<br/>
with.  (That&#39;s right, I have said it before and I will<br/>
say it again... all your Norrath are belong to<br/>
ME!!!!!)<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry sis, I am sure your account is peachy and<br/>
everything is cool.  BTW, tell Scotty hello for me<br/>
when you e-mail him next.<br/>
