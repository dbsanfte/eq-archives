<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001711446">To use an example when your system lags and you approach a Merchant, the<br/>
merchant seems to be selling nothing until the data that would tell your<br/>
system what is for sale gets transfered.. <br/>
<br/>
To keep the lag down to what it is, most of the data that you mention is not<br/>
transfered until its in your make a request..  any information concerning<br/>
graphics is already stored on your system, your system simply needs to know<br/>
what items to load by label, what each PC has -  the location of each NPC<br/>
and corpse. Since they use a database form inwhich to store this temporary<br/>
data ( in a text form ) the transer time is very slight..  for the most part<br/>
i would think that the time it takes you to enter a zone is based on this:<br/>
<br/>
1. closing your connection with one server  ( there are a minimum of 10<br/>
servers per World server<br/>
2. connecting to a new zone server<br/>
3. zone server transfers PC information and world conditions<br/>
4. your system loads the graphic data that is stored locally<br/>
5. tell the server your system is ready and your dropped into the zone..<br/>
<br/>
Just a logical guess.. via observation of the game and its proformance.<br/>
<br/>

Are you sure about that? That doesnt seem to make<br/>
sense. The only reason I can think of is that when you<br/>
load a zone you need to recieve lots of packets<br/>
containing info on the position and status of each NPC<br/>
and PC in the zone. What items are for sale for how<br/>
much and what kinda loot each mob has although that<br/>
info could wait untill the kill. I also thought maybe<br/>
the Eq each PC was carrying would have to be<br/>
transfered as well. Or at least the texture map for<br/>
each diferent item and which character might be<br/>
associated with which particular texture map. <br/>
After the zone is loaded you only need to recieve<br/>
updates. Also obviuosly the graphics change but these<br/>
are locally stored and load rather quickly. I think if<br/>
the Zone was on a different server it would load<br/>
quicker. As each physical machine is supporting fewer<br/>
players they can spend more time sending info and less<br/>
time crunching data. I agree about pipe and processor<br/>
size I have a cable modem and an AMD 333 and I zone in<br/>
about 8-10 seconds sometimes faster depending on the<br/>
zone and I would guess how crowded it is. <br/>

&gt; The reason it takes so long to go from zone to zone<br/>
&gt; is your going to another <br/>
&gt; server.<br/>
