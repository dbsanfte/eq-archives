<div id="ygrps-yiv-594281368">First of all, I&#39;d like to wish everyone a Happy Easter.<br/>
<br/>
Have a question. I did the Stein Quest twice today. Cast Illusion:DE <br/>
on my Lvl 14 Erudite Enchanter, and cast Alliance on Clurg. I conned <br/>
Clurg as Amiable both times. Both times I said &quot;What special book&quot;, <br/>
he replied, and I gave him the compodium. Then he said something <br/>
like &quot;You must have worked hard to get my book, I am indebted to you. <br/>
I don&#39;t like being indebted, so take this as payment&quot;. He didn&#39;t give <br/>
me anything; no PP, no stein. I petitioned the GM. Does anyone have a <br/>
clue as to what is going on?</div>
