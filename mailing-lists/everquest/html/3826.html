<div id="ygrps-yiv-91773538">Well , most of the people in this list wont be too affected by these<br/>
changes. Laine seems to hit the mark pretty well though.<br/>
<br/>
About ch, tell me the same 3 months into PoP ^_^. Im sure it wont be a real<br/>
problem though as basing the heals around a spell that clerics get at<br/>
level39 is ...odd. So this is probably a good change in the long run. 7500<br/>
for a cleric without Aas, and like 7800hps with some points spent. Not a big<br/>
deal now. Our tanks are hovering slightly above 7k hps and the highest one<br/>
passed 7500 like a two months ago. So not many get this high.<br/>
<br/>
Monks, well yes Id agree thay are overpowered - they are actually a LEATHER<br/>
CLASS and outtanks any hybrid and in some cases even warriors. So it was<br/>
logical. Took some time to figure this out heh...Lower defense will hurt<br/>
soloing and pulling. More tag teams required during pulls, this is good, and<br/>
making soloing harder is also good. Its either this or upgrade all other<br/>
plate/chain classes and big changes take time to balance.<br/>
<br/>
Manaburn - The Wizards brought themself into this situation no one else.<br/>
Good change. Seeing epic scales in the Bazaar for sale by Wizards only for<br/>
100K is really rude. IT was meant to help guilds fighting bossmobs with high<br/>
resistrates as a way to get unresistable damage. It still works but have to<br/>
be spread out in time now. Dont blame anyone else. <br/>
<br/>
Mod rods - This is a HUGE change to high end raiding. Good rod management<br/>
results in infinate mana at the moment. The problem we have now is the aggro<br/>
management, mana is no longer a problem. This is needed cause of the<br/>
duration of fights in Luclin are ridculously long. So the Luclin raid<br/>
problem is aggro management, both on Maintank and on Rampage tank. Handle<br/>
this and you can beat just about any mob with correct amount of people. Dont<br/>
handle this and you cant kill anything even with overkill amount of people.<br/>
(more or less). The mod changes are that the mod2 will not be droppable<br/>
anymore, its summoned onto target. So Mage targets cleric, summons rod. Rod<br/>
reuse time for cleric will be 60 sec. 450hps lost for 360 mana, pretty good<br/>
ratio. So this limits the manapool of a guild some and will maybe demand<br/>
some manafeeding from the necros again yay, go verant, im sure necros are<br/>
happy now~ They can deal like a lot of damage but have to feed cleric to<br/>
keep tank alive... Without adjusting hitpoints down of luclin bosses a fight<br/>
like Arch Lich Rhag&#39;Zadune will be 100* harder now. So of course something<br/>
will be done, not sure how much and how yet, this hasnt been announced and<br/>
probably wont be. Its for the players to find out. The overall goal of this<br/>
change is to make fights shorter. Its very double edged to me, if I worked<br/>
for Verant i would *not* have done it this way. It would have been much<br/>
smarter to flag the rod2 as a spell not castable in PoP and keep Luclin<br/>
content as it is. Then a guild progressing through different expansions need<br/>
to adjust tactics to each expansion. Just introduce a mod3 for PoP and<br/>
handle the fights there as you want for this expansion. <br/>
<br/>
Time will tell what will happen here.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
-  Cleric CH will only heal up to 7,500 HP, instead of <br/>
the 10,000 previously<br/>
<br/>
Only affect it could have is making raids even more dependant on clerics,<br/>
less healing=more clerics. VI said this will open up for new healing spells<br/>
tho, to soon to say what impact it will have. As for today, no impact at<br/>
all. Getting 7.5k hps ain&#39;t that common =P<br/>
<br/>
-  Monks won&#39;t avoid damage as easily as previously<br/>
<br/>
Could see it comming. Monks were to good.<br/>
<br/>
-  Manaburn will only work once per minute on a mob<br/>
<br/>
Will remove mb groups, big deal.<br/>
<br/>
-  A bunch of Mod Rod changes.<br/>
<br/>
To early to say, VI said they will tweak &quot;uber mobs&quot; to avoid 20 minute<br/>
fights but who knows. Differens from today will be that mages won&#39;t be doing<br/>
mod rod carpets.<br/>
