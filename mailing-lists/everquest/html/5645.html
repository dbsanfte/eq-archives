<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833752253">I upgraded a machine from ME to XP Pro once, and it<br/>
upgraded fine. With the XP CD you can choose to either<br/>
upgrade or reformat. After you put the XP CD in, one<br/>
of the first options will have a drop down menu,<br/>
asking if you want an upgrade or full installation.<br/>
Just pick upgrade, and it should over-write ME just<br/>
fine. (you can also choose to keep some of ME on the<br/>
machine, in case you have to roll back your OS)<br/>
<br/>
Only pick full installation if you want all your files<br/>
wiped out and a fresh installation of XP (which can be<br/>
a good thing, most machines need a reformat at some<br/>
point in time) Just make sure you back up any files<br/>
you want to keep.<br/>
