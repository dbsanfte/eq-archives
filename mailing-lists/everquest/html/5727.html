<div id="ygrps-yiv-1601466224">Ah... too bad about the buddy key thing. As for<br/>
getting my sis the game itself, I know she wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
too hip on that right away, even though there&#39;s still<br/>
a free 30 day trial. She wouldn&#39;t want to buy the CD&#39;s<br/>
without trying the game first. She&#39;s funny like that,<br/>
hehe.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m not sweating it though cause I dont really have<br/>

&gt; just go to waste.  However, I do have the EverQuest<br/>

&gt; 3rd account once I got another computer powerful<br/>
&gt; enough to run it.  But I may end up selling it to<br/>
&gt; someone or giving it away as a gift if I come across<br/>
&gt; anyone who might want to start playing.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I was wondering if anyone knows if there is a way<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt;   request one of these keys? I have an EQ acount<br/>
&gt;   already, but I believe it must have been inactive<br/>
&gt; when<br/>
&gt;   they first sent the buddy keys out. I recently<br/>
&gt;   re-subscribed at the first of June, so I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; sure<br/>
&gt;   when these keys came out. I was kind of hoping to<br/>
&gt; get<br/>
&gt;   one for my sister. :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Thanks<br/>
