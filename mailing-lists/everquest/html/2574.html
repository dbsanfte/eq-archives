 </span></blockquote>actually it is cheaper to buy some weapons from other players,<br/>
especially after the game is somewhat &quot;old&quot;, in other words<br/>
there are so many high level people out there.<br/>
<br/>
but you don&#39;t have to look at the things offered in EC, because<br/>
almost everything there sold is &quot;stylish&quot; or &quot;ueber&quot;. so IMHO the<br/>
prices there are so high because people are willing to pay high<br/>
prices to get one of those kinky new weapons.<br/>
<br/>
when i was young i tried to get some magic pieces as well. (i<br/>
started with warrior chars as well - IMHO a good thing to do, to<br/>
learn the game mechanics) and i always wanted to hunt those nasty<br/>
skellies in tundra, but they could only be hit by magic weapons.<br/>
<br/>
my dream weapon as this time were barbed whips and langseax swords.<br/>
because i couldn&#39;t afford them, i got tentacle whips from someone<br/>
for 20pp each. now those weapons are almost always destroyed when<br/>
looted because they don&#39;t even give good money at the merchants.<br/>
<br/>
and the kunark, velious and luclin expansion gave so many new weapons<br/>
that the old ones almost got unknown (better say ignored), on the other<br/>
hand you can get magic weapons cheaper now.<br/>
<br/>
and now compare prices with those combine weapons sold in EC at the<br/>
shady. i think they are the only magic weapons you can buy from an<br/>
old world merchant (actually don&#39;t know of any other merchant). and<br/>
i think gypsie camps have merchants selling some weapons as well ...<br/>
i am not sure if those were magic ones ... oh the old days ... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
if you play on Tarem Warr, we could arrange a meeting: i think i still<br/>
have many things on my different chars, i don&#39;t really need.<br/>
<br/>
take care<br/>
