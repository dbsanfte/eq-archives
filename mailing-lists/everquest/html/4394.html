<div id="ygrps-yiv-1635486598">I know what you mean exactly! I don&#39;t understand at all why horses are so <br/>
expensive... it&#39;s not like they do that much. Being a druid, I don&#39;t need <br/>
one for fast transportation. It should be easier to get one. A lot of people <br/>
only buy them because they think others will praise their characters. I get <br/>
so annoyed with it, I turn horse graphics off a lot! That way NO ONE has <br/>
one, LOL.<br/>
