 </span></blockquote>there are hints about the bandwidth EQ needs on the official EQ site,<br/>
but it is somewhat hard to find ... it is sort of information for ISPs<br/>
so they know how much traffic within an hour or so can occur playing<br/>
this game.<br/>
<br/>
i only tried those &quot;multiple&quot; sessions using ISDN and T-DSL (the &quot;T&quot;<br/>
just stands for the german provider &quot;t-online&quot;; they give almost every-<br/>
thing a name starting with &quot;t-&quot; ... the only thing you can&#39;t get from<br/>
them is a t-rex ;-)<br/>
<br/>
what i learned is, that you even can have a good system (fast cpu, good<br/>
gfx cars, enough memory), but having a not so good or worse connection<br/>
can extremly slow down your system (basically this is a problem of the<br/>
protocols used to transfer packets over the internet).<br/>
<br/>
so if you start to think about doing this, check for a very fast and<br/>
reliable connection. best thing is to ask high level bards, what ISPs<br/>
they use.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>well, one or two extra arms, and a secondary brain would help ... ;-)<br/>
and it isn&#39;t too hard at all with the &quot;right&quot; group, because i almost<br/>
play (pure) casters, so you don&#39;t really have to do things, like bards<br/>
or warriors/monks/rogues. on the other hand, controlling three casters<br/>
makes them actually enjoyable, even at times, when they still have to<br/>
look at the spellbook (when medding).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
take care everyone<br/>
