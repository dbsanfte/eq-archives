 </span></blockquote>Perhaps, but IMO the main benefit of no-drop items is<br/>
to elimiate item-farming casters who seem to *love* to<br/>
camp tank equipment (BIBS, PGT and BI Crown come to<br/>
mind as a few particularly common examples) and then<br/>
proclaim over auction these items are for trade only,<br/>
or are available only for incredibly high sums.<br/>
<br/>
ANYTHING that gets rid of the item-farmers is A GOOD<br/>
THING for the game.  Camp for an item you need/want,<br/>
get it, move on.  Don&#39;t sit there and collect a bunch<br/>
so you can sell them.  Others want to have fun getting<br/>
stuff too you know.<br/>
<br/>
Level Caps would be A BAD THING.  I think the damage<br/>
caps and effect processing limits are sufficient.  The<br/>
only glaring offense that level caps would prevent is<br/>
people twinking down their other characters/friends<br/>
with stuff the other character(s) are incapable of<br/>
purchasing or looting (like a Wizard getting PGT and<br/>
Darkwood for his new Warrior or BS Tunic for his<br/>
friend&#39;s Cleric).<br/>
