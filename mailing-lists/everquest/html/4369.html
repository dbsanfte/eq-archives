<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480898483">The weapon and tunic given to you by your trainer at creation should <br/>
eqip. They were made especially for your character. I can&#39;t imagine <br/>
why your club wouldnt work if it is the one given at start up. You do <br/>
not need hand-to-hand to use club. That is for exactly what it says-<br/>
hand to hand combat. :)<br/>
