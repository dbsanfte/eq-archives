You need an option to turn off the music... it really slows the site down..<br/>
and is very annoying after more than a few seconds<br/>
<br/>
And when I say its slows it down, I have a 512K cable connection and it took<br/>
about 12 seconds to finish displaying the first time i visited any page...<br/>
subsequent wisits were quicker, as the images were cached.<br/>
<br/>
I also found the graphics a bit garish, and there is an annoying black line<br/>
flashing under the dragon animation (I think a frame or two of the animation<br/>
are smaller than the rest)<br/>
<br/>
And just because you *can* have objects whirling around the screen when they<br/>
are loaded, before settling in to position, it doesn&#39;t necessarilly follow<br/>
that you *should*.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, the art of successful web design is understated elegance. A simple,<br/>
muted colour scheme with sufficient added graphics to enhance content,<br/>
without distracting from it. Look at Allakazans, EQAtlas or Castersrealm...<br/>
all examples of sites I return to time and time again that are easy to read<br/>
and obtain information from, yet with distinctive appearances that are easy<br/>
on the eye. Excluding ads, how much animation or bold bright colouring is<br/>
there on theses sites... not much<br/>
<br/>
Imagine if all books were like those birthday cards that play a tune when<br/>
you open them, each paragraphe in a different font, with flashing borders<br/>
and animated page numbers throughout the text... you would hardly want to re<br/>
ad them.<br/>
