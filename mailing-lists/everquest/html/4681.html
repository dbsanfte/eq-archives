<div id="ygrps-yiv-733812733">Quick question regarding the deleted char question.... if i cant play for a few months, stop payment on the account. How long is my char saved, is there a way to save it wehn I feel like coming back to play?  These next few months are filled with many things that will keep me away from home, lots of traveling, and I would rather nor waste the money when I could keep my chars in tact thru some means.  Thanks.<br/>
