<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133662963">I don&#39;t know for sure, but I believe I read on one of the EQ tech boards<br/>
that the time it takes to load a new zone is dependent (among other<br/>
things) on how fast your computer can load the textures and images used in<br/>
that new zone.  From experience, I did notice a slight increase in the<br/>
time it took to zone when I upgraded my AMD athlon 600 from 64 megs to 192<br/>
megs.  Of course, 64 was a little under powered anyway so I might have just<br/>
brought it up to normal speed...<br/>
