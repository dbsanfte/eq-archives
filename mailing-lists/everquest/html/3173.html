&gt; I got it figured out!! First of all, THANK YOU for all of your <br/>
&gt; replies!<br/>
&gt; Well, here&#39;s the fix: <br/>
&gt; I knew that you spoke truth when you mentioned the background <br/>
&gt; processes.  but when I went to msconfig and unchecked everything- <br/>
no <br/>
&gt; help. although avail went up to 93megs (from 20). <br/>
&gt; I then tried checking diagnostic startup, it&#39;s the option that says <br/>
&gt; that it omly loads essential stuff...DO NOT DO THIS IN XP!!!<br/>
&gt; the probem is that one of the programs that gets unchecked has to <br/>
do <br/>
&gt; with activation confirmation, so when I rebooted- it said that it <br/>
&gt; was unable to be confirmed. I had to call the 888 number and go all <br/>
&gt; through activation again because the internet connection was also <br/>
&gt; shut down.<br/>
&gt; here&#39;s what I turned off:<br/>
&gt; deactivated everything in startup (in msconfig)<br/>
&gt; unceckecked the following in services:<br/>
&gt; clipbook<br/>
&gt; cd burning<br/>
&gt; messenger<br/>
&gt; removable storage<br/>
&gt; remote desktop help<br/>
&gt; true vector (for zonealarm)<br/>
&gt; uninteruptable p.s.<br/>
&gt; M$ firewall utility<br/>
&gt; I did this and couldn&#39;t get a connection, then I started up <br/>
&gt; zonealarm and voila! I&#39;m killin&#39; gnomepups!!  I&#39;m geussing I need <br/>
&gt; mor ram?<br/>
&gt; anyways thanks!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m going to try them on monday.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW I did try using a 16&quot; housefan directed into the open case- <br/>
&gt; no<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; change in symptoms.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I just know that the cause is going to be the same as most other<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; probs so far: drivers. I&#39;ve tried to update them, nvidea is <br/>
&gt; updated<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (signed and everything!!) but the 4in1 and av97 8233 onboard <br/>
&gt; sound<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; drivers don&#39;t want to load right.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the replys!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Eek. You might not want to put a housefan that close to your <br/>
&gt; computer. Fans<br/>
&gt; &gt; that size have an electromagnetic field that can cause problems. <br/>
&gt; Some fans<br/>
&gt; &gt; can disrupt monitors if too close. It can even erase or corrupt <br/>
&gt; data on your<br/>
&gt; &gt; harddrive. It&#39;s best to use a device specifically designed for <br/>
use <br/>
&gt; with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; computer rather than something like that.<br/>
&gt; &gt; luv,<br/>
