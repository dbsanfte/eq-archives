<div>Like any mmorpg, there is a monthly fee to play. However, I&#39;ve found that the amount of time I spend on the game, I more than get my money&#39;s worth out of it. I have friends who refuse to play because of the monthly fee, and I have friends who are so hooked on the game that they are thinking of getting the Legends subscription, which is much higher, per month. (And from what I&#39;ve seen doesn&#39;t add TOO much, just that you get things first.) The fee is (if I remember correctly) $12.95 for a regular subscription and 40 something for a legends subscription. </div>

<div>I do think the original game is worth it even though 2 comes out soon. Everquest 2 will be a totally different game, set in the same world but years later. And from what I&#39;ve heard, improvements on eq1 will continue even after 2 is released.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But, it is a personal decision if you want to spend the money or not.</div>
