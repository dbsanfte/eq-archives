<div id="ygrps-yiv-487251305">Oh yeah, I know that. It&#39;s ALWAYS a good idea to con any mobs you can see.<br/>
And if you are able to sow yourself, I suggest you do that. Bc at least with<br/>
sow you can outrun the giants. You may not be able to outrun some of the<br/>
other mobs though. But camo is good to avoid goblins and a few others. I&#39;m<br/>
not saying you should feel completely safe when in camo. But some giants<br/>
can&#39;t see through camo. I know bc I took a ranger through that zone with<br/>
camo and all of the giants I encountered conned indifferent. Now, that was<br/>
just my experience. I know that there are mobs that do see thru invis. One<br/>
must always be careful.<br/>
Btw, do the guards at Felwithe see through invis?<br/>
