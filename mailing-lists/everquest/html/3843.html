say, if i wouldn&#39;t have four EQ accounts, i would have added EnB. but<br/>
another additional two accounts paying $12 or $13 for each of them<br/>
was too much for me.<br/>
<br/>
i tried AO (Anarchy Online) and Neocron as well, but somehow i liked<br/>
EnB most of the future settings ... maybe because it is sort of an<br/>
&quot;Elite&quot; or &quot;Tradewars&quot; game with many interesting ideas. actually i<br/>
found some UO, ans many EQ and DAoC players in EnB.<br/>
