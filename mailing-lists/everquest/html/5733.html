<b>Subject:</b> I need J-boots <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-302042187">I am looking for the boots that let your character run as though she <br/>
has SOW cast on her.  I&#39;ve been told to get J-Boots.  But they do not <br/>
show up in the bazaar under that name.  What is the real name of <br/>
these boots.  And do any of you know where they drop from?<br/>
<br/>
Also I have an un used trial key if any one needs it.</div>
