&gt; WOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
&gt; After a long long long time of working on my skills, farming the <br/>
items, and<br/>
&gt; spending almost all of my money... I finally did it!<br/>
&gt; I failed a combine a couple times and lost two runed sea shells <br/>
(which were<br/>
&gt; the most expensive thing I had to buy for it-- I tried hunting in <br/>
SG but<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t have any luck). I got my JC to 173, my tailoring to 176, <br/>
fletching to<br/>
&gt; 180, brewing to 184, pottery to 154, and smithing to 112. I got <br/>
impatient on<br/>
&gt; the pottery and just asked someone to put the water and the velium <br/>
powder<br/>
&gt; (made from the runed sea shell and a small brick of velium in a <br/>
mortar and<br/>
&gt; pestle-- no fail combine) in a pottery wheel and got my Unfired <br/>
Rune. I<br/>
&gt; fired the rune. I bought a geerlok gemsetter. Borrowed a geerlok <br/>
planing<br/>
&gt; tool for my fletching for the combines. and borrowed a geerlok <br/>
sewing kit<br/>
&gt; for the final combine. Had C3 on and success!!<br/>
&gt; I now have my Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl!<br/>
&gt; Now I need to work on JC and Smithing some more for my 8th shawl...<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>
