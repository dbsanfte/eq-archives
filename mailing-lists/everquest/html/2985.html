<b>Subject:</b> Who needs sleep? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1362096047">I haven&#39;t played in days. Been tired, so I have actually opted to <br/>
sleep rather than stay up late/get up early to play. I work twelve <br/>
hour shifts, so getting an hour a day cuts into my sleep time. Most <br/>
of the time it is worth while, but this week I have needed the sleep.<br/>
<br/>
The up side of my work schedule is that I get three or four days off <br/>
each week. If I don&#39;t work overtime, I get lots of hours to game. Not <br/>
a bad deal, most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
Now if only I could play at work. <br/>
<br/>
Hmmm.<br/>
