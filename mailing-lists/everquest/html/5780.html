In<br>case you are not familiar with them, these are not the ones you buy at Radio<br>Shack. They are specifically designed for racing and my radio alone cost<br>more then the most expensive car at Radio Shack. If you are familiar, I run<br>in the Stock Truck class with an Associated T3.<br><br>The bodies of the vehicles are made of clear Lexan and are painted on the<br>inside to keep the paint from coming off during collisions. There is a glue<br>available that will let you glue pictures from magazines to the inside of<br>your vehicle before you paint it. The paper you use in your printer is to<br>thick and tends to peel off, it needs to be the thinner paper used
 in<br>magazines.<br><br>I want to make an EQ body for the on-road car I will be getting soon.<br>Imagine if Sony sponsored a NASCAR car for EverQuest. If anybody has any<br>computer or video game magazines with EQ related ads or other color pictures<br>I would very much like to get some. They can be for EQ, EQII, EQ Adventures,<br>Champions of Norrath or any of the EQ games. I will cut out the pics I need<br>so most anything has potential. I will take pages ripped out or entire<br>magazines. I will pay shipping and reimburse for the magazine. They will<br>need to be kept FLAT, if they have creases they will not be any good for my<br>purposes. I am located in the US if that helps.<br><br>I have the maps that came with EQ Evolution and may use some of them. The<br>manual is B&amp;W so not much use.<br><br>If I get enough pictures to do up the body I will gladly post pics of it<br>when done.<br><br>&quot;I brake for loot!&quot;<br></blockquote><p>
