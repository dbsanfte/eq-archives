I must say, I think the new policy is rather silly... a true case of<br/>
throwing the baby out with the bath water (it&#39;s an old saying okay?  Seems<br/>
to fit here)<br/>
<br/>
Verant must want a lot of people available when Star Wars Galaxies comes<br/>
online.  Or Anarchy online.<br/>
<br/>
When calculating the cost of their crappy customer service I sure hope<br/>
they&#39;re not taking into account the fees of the amateur guides who would<br/>
normally be paying to play EQ.  And yes, I consider any company who makes<br/>
you wait up to three hours just to *answer* a complaint crappy... if you get<br/>
an answer at all.  Apparently /petition requests get purged from the lists<br/>
if they sit there more than 3 hours.  Would you sit on hold on the phone for<br/>
three hours with or without an 800 line?  I sure wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
My guild has people who are also interested in playing other MMORPG&#39;s, some<br/>
of us are in Beta for Anarchy Online, and believe you me, if enough of us<br/>
are interested we&#39;ll be porting the guild over to a new game.  Why stay with<br/>
a company who assumes we are guilty or too stupid to own an account?  Plus<br/>
if you share a PC, or are on a home network and are connected to the PC of<br/>
someone who is NOT computer savvy, you are also vulnerable.  I don&#39;t think<br/>
the average home user should have an MS Certification in Network<br/>
administration just to play a game.<br/>

&gt; My question is, why can&#39;t V simply transfer my stuff from my<br/>
&gt; hacked account<br/>
&gt; to a new account that I create?? The attitude of you just get banned and<br/>
&gt; lose everything that you&#39;ve worked hard for PERIOD really is a<br/>
&gt; poor customer<br/>
&gt; service attitude for something that we pay monthly to do.<br/>
