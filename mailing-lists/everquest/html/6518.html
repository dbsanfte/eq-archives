<div id="ygrps-yiv-749791303">I&#39;m an old EQ player from the Kunark days who left for (shiver) EQ2<br/>
then for another MMORG. I&#39;m thinking of making a return to EQ1 as the<br/>
bug to play seems to have left for the other game....tooo many kids<br/>
and it&#39;s becoming a job. I remember many sleepless nights exploring<br/>
Norath, Grinding with others on the plains of Karana and actually<br/>
enjoying it. Anyone still out there? I&#39;ve looked at the forum activity<br/>
and wasn&#39;t very hopeful, but the game looks to be active as far as<br/>
current expansions and whatnot.</div>
