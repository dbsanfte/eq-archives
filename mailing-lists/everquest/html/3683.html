<div id="ygrps-yiv-23949439">You have to put the sense heading button in the same place for all <br/>
your characters for this to work well.  Be sure not to place a <br/>
hotkey/social in that spot that you dont want to go off automatically <br/>
(like spells or something).  I also map senseheading to all the <br/>
hotkey pages that I use to the same location for all my characters, <br/>
that way if you change hotkey pages, then it will still be set right, <br/>
and it will remind you not to place a hotkey in that spot later.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps some.<br/>

&gt; &gt; What my son and I did was to map the hot key to the right turn<br/>
&gt; &gt; button. Every time we turn right, we sense heading. Builds skill<br/>
&gt; &gt; quickly. Can be done for foraging, as well, but you end up with <br/>
stuff<br/>
&gt; &gt; on your cursor as you run around. Not always a good thing.<br/>
