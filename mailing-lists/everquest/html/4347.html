<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699413342">&lt;&lt;I have a shaman so I can&#39;t use my club. I tried to equip it with no <br/>
success.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
left click on your club and drag it to the large square area on your<br/>
inventory screen, this is the auto equip. if it pops back into your<br/>
inventory instead of going into your primary weapon slot, then either<br/>
you&#39;ve got something already there or you&#39;re having technical<br/>
difficulties. i played a vah-shir shaman for quite some time.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have no money. No one wants to buy mushrooms (must be a <br/>
drug free town). I think that I need to somehow come up with some <br/>
money so that I can buy a scroll with a spell that can do damage. I <br/>
don&#39;t seem to be able to kill anything bare handed. I just keep <br/>
getting killed. Does anybody have any suggestions?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
the are you should be in to kill things should be over the bridge. make<br/>
sure to take the bridge on the side of the city that had registrar<br/>
bindarah on it. keep going and you&#39;ll eventually zone and come out in an<br/>
area that has lots of vah-shir under tents. fight the creatures in this<br/>
area if you haven&#39;t been already, they are the easiest. after they&#39;re<br/>
dead right click on their corpses and loot all the goodies off of them<br/>
when they have them. these are the things you sell for cash.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I could delete the character, start over, maybe sell one or both of <br/>
my spell scrolls and buy an attack spell scroll. But do I really <br/>
need to? Is there still hope for my character?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
number one, you can&#39;t sell scrolls once they&#39;ve been scribed into your<br/>
spell book. they&#39;re yours for life. back in the room where you met your<br/>
shaman guild trainer, right click him and put training points in 1hand<br/>
blunt. just outside of this room there is another room with people<br/>
called scribes, they sell your spells. right click them to see what<br/>
they&#39;ve got to sell an then right click and hold on each spell to see<br/>
the info on them. each spell will tell you what level you have to be to<br/>
use it. keep looking through the scribes until you find the one selling<br/>
your level 1 spells.<br/>
<br/>
hope this helps. if you were on the ayonae ro server i could meet and<br/>
help you out personally.<br/>
