&lt;&lt; I have seen one PC and one NPC that have what looks like a glowing, <br/>
flashing <br/>
 shield on thier left arm.  When I inspected the PC with this flashing thing <br/>
 going on, she had a &quot;Light Globe&quot; (not Lightstone) in one of her melee <br/>
slots, <br/>
 so I assume it was not a shiled but rather a light source.  I really wanna <br/>
 try to get one of these Light Globes.  Any one know where I can? &gt;&gt;<br/>

I think this is the summon light globe spell a wiz can get at like level one.</div>
