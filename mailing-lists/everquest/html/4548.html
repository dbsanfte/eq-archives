<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I recently installed EQ on a second box in my 
house, the video card it has in it is the old 3dfx voodoo banshee, do any of you 
know where I could find the most compatible driver to run EQ, Ive been 
frustraded the past couple of days in trying to get that computer up and 
running, yesterday I finnaly found on that makes EQ work, but If I zone into any 
zone with people in the game freezes up and sometimes drops me back to the 
desktop, It has 128 megs of ram in the PII PC, I will have 256 in a 
couple&nbsp;of days I have all of the luclan models turned off.&nbsp; I will 
probably just get a new Vid card but for now want to know If I can make this one 
work.</font></div>
