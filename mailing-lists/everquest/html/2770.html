<div id="ygrps-yiv-899168129">Not a bad idea. However, we are playing around the world, and so <br/>
around the clock. Still, if you have a good alt, you could park your <br/>
ranger in Everfrost and hunt when it is good. When it is not so good <br/>
you can camp the ranger and switch to your alt.<br/>
<br/>
I recommend finding a high point overlooking the frozen river. You <br/>
can see the mammoths coming and intercept. You can often see if it <br/>
has been grabbed by another player or group as well, allowing you to <br/>
focus on another target.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt;Over eight pp per tusk for my druid halfling selling<br/>
&gt;   &gt;at home in Rivervale. Pretty profitable and exp as<br/>
&gt;   &gt;well. Glad I moved to Everfrost.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Best cash in the game at that level range, the only<br/>
&gt;   snag is that it only takes two people with track to<br/>
&gt;   comfortably kill the Mammoths as fast as they pop.<br/>
&gt;   Three and the zone is over hunted. Thus I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;   recommend going there to anyone but druids. Track is<br/>
&gt;   absolutely essential or you just plain won&#39;t get any<br/>
&gt;   mobs, and even more important is the ability to leave<br/>
&gt;   and go hunt in SK or somewhere else when the zone is<br/>
&gt;   overcrowded.<br/>
