<div id="ygrps-yiv-524865515">Personal experience with respect to Gateway computers:<br/>
<br/>
They are decent computers (I have three in fact), but I recently bought the<br/>
1.2 gHz AMD Gateway with the GeForce 2 Ultra and SB Live cards in it, and EQ<br/>
would totally lock up every time I played. I could not re-boot, turn off the<br/>
PC, or anything, but had to actually unplug the power cord, wait, and then<br/>
plug it back in to even get the computer to work. I had to download a bunch<br/>
of tweaks and drivers from Via, NVidia, Microsoft, etc. (none of the Gateway<br/>
stock drivers are now on the computer, including the motherboard chipset<br/>
driver), and now it works fine, but I was ready to send it back to Gateway<br/>
at first.<br/>

&gt; My dad got an HP with a 1Ghz processor and some type of Nvidia card.<br/>
Nvidia<br/>
&gt; bought 3dfx so their cards are more likely to be compatible with EQ-- the<br/>
&gt; later ones that is.<br/>
&gt; The voodoo 5 works pretty well. I recommend a 32bit rather than 16bit.<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s a sound card.. live audio or something-- I have to ask what it was<br/>
&gt; again. it sound really really cool.<br/>
&gt; I hear Gateway is good if you buy during the right time in the season.<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>
