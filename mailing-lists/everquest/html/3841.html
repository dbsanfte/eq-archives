&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have not been playing EQ for years but I have played<br/>
&gt; for about 10 months and I feel I need to shed some<br/>
&gt; food for thought on this topic.......<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can see why people suggest Stamina but I think it<br/>
&gt; depends on a few factors first.  If you are totally<br/>
&gt; new and don&#39;t know much about EQ NOR have a high level<br/>
&gt; alt, I would Really have to say to put the extra in<br/>
&gt; Str.  The reason is because Chainmail is still heavy<br/>
&gt; and when have a full suit of Mail you will have about<br/>
&gt; 10-20 pts of weight to allow for loot.  This is not<br/>
&gt; much at all.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I spent most of my pre-40 levels overweight and it&#39;s <br/>
really not all that big of a deal.  And by the time that <br/>
you are able to get all of the components to finish the <br/>
newbie armor quests, you should have either enough cash <br/>
or the components to have someone make you weight <br/>
reduction bags or will have quested one or 2 on your <br/>
own).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; NOW, if you have an alt and are twinked, we all know<br/>
&gt; what this means, then I can see why to put in Stamina.<br/>
&gt; Since most will have a full suit of Ivory etched<br/>
&gt; armow which does not weight all that much as compared<br/>
&gt; to Chain.  Plus twinks will tend to CHAIN pull, like<br/>
&gt; the example we saw in the keep.  Meaning, pulling so<br/>
&gt; much or the ranger being the main tank that you need<br/>
&gt; to worry about Stamina.  If you have one or two<br/>
&gt; warriors, a ranger should not worry about STA since<br/>
&gt; his/her role is to assist and draw aggro if tank gets<br/>
&gt; hurt to bad. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rangers SHOULD worry about STA, whether you are twinked <br/>
or now, especially if you are using heavy weapons.  Pre <br/>
100 STA, your stamina bar does mean something......post <br/>
100, it really means nothing.  <br/>
<br/>
As well, STA = HP.  After AC, HP&#39;s are king (and since <br/>
there is a soft AC cap, once you get to the highest <br/>
levels, HP and STA gear gains far more importance than <br/>
AC).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Summary:  For a totally new player I still suggest STR<br/>
&gt; and rely on others to assist in your flaws, like the<br/>
&gt; druid partner.  If you have alts and good weaps, then<br/>
&gt; yes maybe STA is the way to go.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>STR items are very easily obtained.  It&#39;s really not <br/>
worth it to put that many points into STR.  Even new <br/>
players can get their STR up to decent levels easy <br/>
enough to make it without having to put any points in <br/>
STR.<br/>
<br/>
If I knew what I know now when I created my Ranger <br/>
almost 2 years ago, there is no quetion I would have put <br/>
all of my points into STA (I did put a few in).  It&#39;s <br/>
took me 50+ levels to get my STA up to acceptable <br/>
levels, while STR wasn&#39;t all that much of a problem, <br/>
especially since you get STR spells eventually anyway.</div>
