Subject: Important notice about your ONElist community<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Dear ONElist Moderator/Owner,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ONElist recently merged with eGroups, another leading provider of email<br/>
&gt; groups.  Since the merger, we&#39;ve been working hard behind the scenes to<br/>
&gt; ensure a smooth integration of the two services.  Part of this process<br/>
&gt; requires that all communities have unique names<br/>
&gt; (i.e., <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:communityname@onelist.com">communityname@onelist.com</a>).  We are contacting you because your<br/>
&gt; community, EverQuest, has the same name as another community<br/>
&gt; on the new service.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve been working closely with our moderators to develop a system for<br/>
&gt; determining which communities will need a new name.  This system takes<br/>
&gt; into account the following criteria:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1. How long the community has been in existence<br/>
&gt; 2. The size of the community<br/>
&gt; 3. The activity level of the community<br/>
&gt; 4. Whether the community is an announcement community or a discussion<br/>
&gt; community<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Over the next few days, we&#39;ll use this system to identify which communities<br/>
&gt; will need to be renamed.  If your community does need to be renamed, you<br/>
&gt; will receive an email from us on or before February 22, 2000.  If you do<br/>
&gt; not receive an email from us, then your community will not need to be<br/>
&gt; renamed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you for your patience and cooperation throughout this process.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sincerely,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The ONElist Team<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; </span></blockquote></div>
