<br/>
Everything is camped. <br/>
<br/>
Your corpse will always end up halfway inside a mountain, nowhere in <br/>
sight of the roads, or under a tree. <br/>
<br/>
The skeleton in front of you is there to distract you from the <br/>
Kodiak approaching behind you. <br/>
<br/>
If your attack is going really well, you are in an ambush. <br/>
<br/>
If the MOBs are within range, so are you. <br/>
<br/>
The tougher MOBs invariably attack on two occasions: <br/>
<br/>
when they&#39;re ready. <br/>
<br/>
when you&#39;re not. <br/>
<br/>
One MOB is never enough, but two can be entirely too many. <br/>
<br/>
The MOB is not retreating; it&#39;s just going to get its friends. <br/>
<br/>
The MOBs you never encounter when armed and buffed always appear <br/>
during your corpse run. <br/>
<br/>
The MOB you&#39;ve been camping for hours always spawns 18 seconds after <br/>
you leave. <br/>
<br/>
Teamwork is essential; it gives the MOBs other people to attack. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t ever be the first, don&#39;t ever be the last, and don&#39;t ever <br/>
volunteer to do anything. <br/>
<br/>
For every action, there is an equal and opposite criticism. <br/>
<br/>
The greatest danger to your group is a Paladin with a map and a <br/>
plan. <br/>
<br/>
When the going gets tough, the tank goes linkdead. <br/>
<br/>
A group without healers or bandages is not a group for long. <br/>
<br/>
Your buffs will fade when you need them the most. <br/>
<br/>
Whenever you have plenty of mana, you never miss. Whenever you are <br/>
low on mana, every spell fizzles. <br/>
<br/>
When in doubt, gate. <br/>
<br/>
There is not a single bathroom in all of Norrath. <br/>
<br/>
The Armor Class of a piece of armor is inversely proportional as to <br/>
how good it looks on you. <br/>
<br/>
The item that you want the most drops the rarest. <br/>
<br/>
The item that you want the most is out of your price range. <br/>
<br/>
The item that you want the most was sold at an auction while you <br/>
were offline. <br/>
<br/>
The item that you want the most was picked up by some moron who <br/>
didn&#39;t know the definition of &quot;No Drop&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
The item you&#39;ll need tomorrow is No Rent. <br/>
<br/>
The item you accidentally drop will be the most <br/>
valuable/powerful/important item you carry. <br/>
<br/>
If you can afford it, it&#39;s not for sale. <br/>
<br/>
If you want two of them, it&#39;s a Lore item. <br/>
<br/>
If you want to sell it, it&#39;s a No Drop item. <br/>
<br/>
The High Quality Bear Skin drops every 28 days, the same schedule as <br/>
PMS. Coincidence? <br/>
<br/>
Even greens kill. <br/>
<br/>
Backstab means never having to say you&#39;re sorry. <br/>
<br/>
A bow without arrows seems awfully heavy all of a sudden. <br/>
<br/>
Merchants are perfectly capable of kicking tail and taking names. <br/>
<br/>
Trains have the right of way. <br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s stupid but it works, it isn&#39;t stupid. <br/>
<br/>
The guards are never there when you need them. <br/>
<br/>
Misuse of a combine button in a hurry = highly colorful language. <br/>
<br/>
The time it takes to upload the newest patch is directly <br/>
proportional to your eagerness to log on. <br/>
<br/>
No two people have ever agreed on a single, precise definition of a <br/>
twink. <br/>
<br/>
Never forget that your newbie weapon was crafted by the lowest <br/>
bidder. <br/>
<br/>
A roleplayer drinks to increase his alcohol tolerance; an idiot does <br/>
it in the Kelethin treetops. <br/>
<br/>
Having a tenth of a bubble of health left is Nature&#39;s way of telling <br/>
you to slow down. <br/>
<br/>
Gnome wizards are proof positive that size does not matter. <br/>
<br/>
The greatest mystery in Norrath is how NPCs figure out what religion <br/>
you are just by looking at you. <br/>
<br/>
Every shaman on Norrath at one point in his or her life has done the <br/>
pig joke when someone asked for a SOW. <br/>
<br/>
Only twelve people in all of Norrath are truly happy with their last <br/>
names. <br/>
<br/>
The last bubble takes forever to fill. <br/>
<br/>
It is somehow discouraging to realize that Qeynos is &quot;SonyEQ&quot; <br/>
spelled backwards.</div>
