<div id="ygrps-yiv-562433765">I am a newbie.  I tried to get an answer to this by searching the <br/>
archives first!  I am about to start my everquest experience.  There <br/>
is so much data out there that it is difficult to find a starting <br/>
point.  Any suggestions or advice before I begin will be appreciated!</div>
