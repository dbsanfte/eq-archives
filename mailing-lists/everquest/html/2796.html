OH BOY do I know how you feel there.<br/>
<br/>
I think I have spent 3000.00 in the last 7 years on my<br/>
minis.<br/>
<br/>
Even 20 per month I could tolerate but anything above<br/>
that would be pushing it.<br/>
<br/>
I am a Network Systems guy so I know what it takes to<br/>
make this game run and be stable, let alone program<br/>
the thing.<br/>
<br/>
Giving us a better product comes with a small price I<br/>
guess.<br/>
<br/>
I think the 12 is fair.<br/>
<br/>
2 cents............<br/>

&gt; $500 on GamesWorkshop products each year when I was<br/>
&gt; more active <br/>
&gt; there. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t have a problem dropping the monthly fee. It<br/>
&gt; is quite <br/>
&gt; reasonable. I might be able to dump another $500 a<br/>
&gt; year into <br/>
&gt; upgrades. Unfortunately, my machine is now pretty<br/>
&gt; much maxed. So I <br/>
&gt; must hope that I can hold out at the present level<br/>
&gt; long enough to get <br/>
&gt; together the funds for a more upgradeable tower.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How much are others willing to pay to play?<br/>
