<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092483707">hello :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m completely new to EQ but absolutely fascinated. Dying to try it <br/>
out. I read today that a mid-level player can let a friend play for <br/>
free for about a month. It sounds great. I asked a friend on Icq but <br/>
her account is paid for by someone else so that&#39;s out of the <br/>
question.<br/>
This probably looks very silly but I&#39;m willing to take the risk. <br/>
Could someone please do this for me? <br/>
I&#39;m loyal and trustworthy. <br/>
Thanks :D<br/>
