<div id="ygrps-yiv-909984665">If you ever get bored and sit around in Misty Thicket when someone is<br/>
killing Deputies, they drop a Squad Ring which is + to charisma. I can&#39;t<br/>
remember how much to charisma though. It&#39;s No Drop. I helped a guy by going<br/>
and selling the spears he looted and giving him all the plat back from it so<br/>
he let me loot the ring with a couple of my alts.<br/>
I still think that horsies and dinos should have inventory space to carry<br/>
things. Like pack mules and stuff in D&D.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Yup, I couldn&#39;t agree more. I bought my druid two Opal Encrusted Steins a<br/>
&gt; long time ago. They hike his charisma up to 105 when I carry them both and<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s definitely very helpful.<br/>
