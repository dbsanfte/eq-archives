<br/>
You definitely make some valid points.  I find the &quot;secret nerfing&quot; to be<br/>
very frustrating. I do think, though that perhaps some of what may appear to<br/>
&quot;nerfing&quot; may be the introduction of new bugs as they attempt to fix old<br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
I hate to take some issue with your comments - particularly your assertion<br/>
(in your second post) that &quot;and Verant chooses to<br/>
ignore those suggestions even though they&#39;re easily implementable&quot;<br/>
<br/>
First of all - your are 1 of 125,000 customers.  To be surprised that Verant<br/>
seems to ignore your suggestion is, to say the least, naive.  How much time<br/>
do they have to respond to suggestion vs. implementing their own?  Also -<br/>
your suggestions may be in direct contraction to what others are suggesting.<br/>
So it&#39;s not really fair to say you&#39;re being ignored...<br/>
<br/>
Also - it&#39;s impossible for anyone who doesn&#39;t have access to the EQ source<br/>
code and database definition to know how easy to implement any change is.<br/>
Very often what seems (even to the programmer!) to be an easy change can<br/>
cause major problems with the code.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 1.) To spur a &quot;player run&quot; economy, add in item durability on armor,<br/>
weapons<br/>
&gt; and such. The appropriate trade skill could repair the items durability -<br/>
IE<br/>
&gt; smithing for armor and weapons, tailoring for clothing and tailor made<br/>
&gt; items, bowyer/fletching to fix bows etc etc. If the player made repairs in<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; shop with all the &quot;tools&quot; needed are assume to be handy, then there&#39;d be<br/>
no<br/>
&gt; reduction in the items durability. If it was done &quot;out in the field&quot;, IE<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; in a shop with the proper tools, then there&#39;d be a permanent reduction in<br/>
&gt; the max durability of the item. Also, have NPC&#39;s that you could go to who<br/>
&gt; could also make these repairs (of course the NPC would charge more). If<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; items durability hits zero, then there&#39;d be a chance of it breaking every<br/>
&gt; time it was used. If the item breaks, it would be permanently and totally<br/>
&gt; useless.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see how you can imagine this would be easy to implement.  Verant<br/>
recently admitted that they had to dramatically change the way corpses decay<br/>
because the number of items in the item database was overwhelming.  To<br/>
implement this - they would have to make an enormous change to each and<br/>
every item in the database and all the code necessary to support it.  I<br/>
doubt that this could be added even in an expansion pack but only when &quot;EQ2&quot;<br/>
comes out.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand - I agree that it&#39;s a great suggestion...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 2.) Have additional modes of transportation in the future add on - IE<br/>
&gt; Horses, Flying Mounts etc. as an alternative to JBoots. The graphics are<br/>
&gt; already in the game for them both. It would take some minor adjustments to<br/>
&gt; add them in, and make them fully functional.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I vaguely recall Verant talking about this - and that they had problems.<br/>
But assuming I&#39;m wrong - I doubt it&#39;s a &quot;minor&quot; adjustment to graphically<br/>
represent this.  However - it would be nice thing to have - even if they<br/>
&quot;kludged&quot; the graphics.  Probably easily done in the expansion at worst<br/>
case.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 3.) Have NPC&#39;s in key locations that you could pay to bind you to an area.<br/>
&gt; Would have fixed the need to remove the Ring of the Dead (which should<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; worked before they put it on the live servers). Instead, they removed the<br/>
&gt; ring (another band aid patch).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is is a popular request - but Verant HAS addressed this issue.  They<br/>
said it would negatively affect dynamics of having the players bind.  Player<br/>
economy blah-blah-blah..  Most people disagree with them...  Remember the<br/>
designers have very strong opinions regarding the philoposphy of design.<br/>
It&#39;s their party - they can cry if they want to...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 4.) Have rubi as a lore, no drop quest loot for a long, involved and hard<br/>
&gt; quest. Would have fixed the need to remove it to decrease camping/farming<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; the armor. Instead, they removed it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They did exactly that - but felt the need to make specific armor types per<br/>
class to continue to balance the classes the way they saw fit.  I&#39;m a bard<br/>
and they have Lambient Armor (stupid name) - not sure if they have<br/>
implemented all class&#39; armors - perhaps that&#39;s the problem.<br/>
<br/>
In summary - it seems to me you have some strong opinions regarding the way<br/>
the game should be implemented vs. Verant&#39;s - I&#39;m not surprised you are<br/>
losing interest in the game.  Unfortunately - I think you&#39;ll find that it&#39;s<br/>
the best the market has yet to offer.  To add insult to injury - one of the<br/>
key players - Sierra - has reorganized - and put their &quot;Middle Earth&quot;<br/>
project on ice.  They claim it&#39;s just on hold - not cancelled - but I&#39;m<br/>
skeptical.  The project that would most interest you would be &quot;Neverwinter&quot;.<br/>
It&#39;s based on the Baldur&#39;s Gate Engine - and will allow players to set up<br/>
their own servers - tweaking the rules as they see fit...<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you!<br/>
