<div id="ygrps-yiv-659688410">I&#39;m on Bertoxx......<br/>
Anyway....It&#39;s a good thing to help newbie&#39;s when you see one.  Helped a<br/>
newbie by explaining the /loc command and showing him around Kelethin.<br/>
turns out that that made his level 40 brother very happy...now he wants to<br/>
make me happy (hopefully NOT in that way)<br/>
<br/>
so...the moral of the story is:<br/>
<br/>
Help newbies....you just might be helping them help you in the long run.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sarakan the helpful</div>
