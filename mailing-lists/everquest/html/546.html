<div id="ygrps-yiv-905079927">Not to be rough about it, but frankly you&#39;re shit out of luck.  I&#39;m on the <br/>
reimbursement list too - have been for over a month now.  Just go out and <br/>
hunt little newbie-ish things to get enough cash for food, and work your way <br/>
back to where you were.  Or if you&#39;re lucky like me, friends will help you <br/>
to recoup your loss (Thanks again Natalia, Arith, Lanor).<br/>
<br/>
Verant has no way of knowing if you&#39;re lying or not...and frankly, if you <br/>
manage to bug them into giving it to you - let me know...I think I lost a <br/>
shiny metallic robe too....</div>
