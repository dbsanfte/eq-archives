<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-844789063">This is sound advice and got me thinking.<br/>
<br/>
I have wanted to start a guild for a while now.  I<br/>
have only been playing since January and have 4 chars,<br/>
nothing above 20 level, yet close.  18 Druid, 18 Mage,<br/>
17 Ranger, and 13 Rogue.<br/>
<br/>
I am 37 years old and understand what it takes to form<br/>
a gaming group, since I have in the past.  Here are my<br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
But first the Goal of the guild and its purpose would<br/>
be as follows.:<br/>
 &quot;To promote a good gaming experience, meet fellow<br/>
players to build relationships/friendships, help<br/>
others when possible, and most important, to have fun<br/>
at what we do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That said,:<br/>
<br/>
1. You mention having GOOD funding.  Well, certainly<br/>
with no chars over 20 you can imagine I have like 300<br/>
PP combined if lucky. I would be looking to find new<br/>
players to EQ which would entice them to join my guild<br/>
for friendships and not freebies nor to promote<br/>
twinkies.  In fact, I would rather oppose twinkies for<br/>
this guild since there are plenty of others that<br/>
approve of it.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Loot would be ALWAYS keep split on, even on a<br/>
raid, and randomize anything worth while.  I would not<br/>
expect a char who earns some good PP on his own to<br/>
stash it in the guild vault, per se, but I might<br/>
decide to have them pay dues, or even after a raid,<br/>
donate something to the guild.<br/>
<br/>
Well to keep this short, what do you think?<br/>
Am I not at all high enough to even consider this or<br/>
can this work?<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts are appreciated, criticize away.<br/>

&gt; without a set goal just<br/>
&gt; inviting people randomly for no apparent reason.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The most important things that needs to be adressed<br/>
&gt; by a guild is:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Handling of loot (this is a central driving force<br/>
&gt; for many playing eq, like<br/>
&gt; it or not)<br/>
&gt; Leading events/Raids<br/>
&gt; Handling of recruiting<br/>
&gt; Selling off uneeded loot to finance guild<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The most common misconception (in my opinion) is<br/>
&gt; that cause youre a part of<br/>
&gt; a guild you get groups and items for free. You dont.<br/>
&gt; You work for them and<br/>
&gt; sometimes group within guild sometimes outside. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also running a guild costs in game money. Make sure<br/>
&gt; guild is well on<br/>
&gt; finances so you can give<br/>
&gt; clerics/chanters/wizards/magicians reagents for<br/>
&gt; raiding and not worry about beeing broke all the<br/>
&gt; time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Structure and leadership organization. How many<br/>
&gt; officers, what do they do,<br/>
&gt; is there a set chain of command. Democracy is good,<br/>
&gt; but not in all<br/>
&gt; questions. The larger you get the more likely that<br/>
&gt; one person doesnt like<br/>
&gt; another, this happens but they still need to be able<br/>
&gt; to respect each other.<br/>
&gt; Differences in opinions and personality exists, deal<br/>
&gt; with it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To simplify these tasks its much easier to have<br/>
&gt; offline boards that can<br/>
&gt; handle organizational tasks apart from the online<br/>
&gt; enjoyment. This is pretty<br/>
&gt; much the same as playing for a team in any sport<br/>
&gt; that requires 10+ people.<br/>
&gt; How well everyone understands and likes the goal of<br/>
&gt; the guild will determine<br/>
&gt; how successful you are. Its a bit harder here cause<br/>
&gt; things that are written<br/>
&gt; can easily be misunderstood cause of age and<br/>
&gt; language differences. Be very<br/>
&gt; clear, try to print a set of rules or guildelines. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Encourage people to be a part of the team...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just some small tips from the top of my head.<br/>
