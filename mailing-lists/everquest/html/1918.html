<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things; the decayed and<br/>
&gt;degraded state of moral and patriotic feelings which thinks that nothing<br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;worth war is much worse.  A man who has nothing for which he is willing<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept<br/>
&gt;so<br/>
&gt;by the exertions of better men than himself.&quot; -- John Stuart Mill, 19th<br/>
&gt;century British Philosopher, 20May1806-08May1873<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;------------------<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;              I arrived in Moscow, Idaho (Home of Idaho University<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; -one block from Best Western) and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;              went to dinner at Best Western. About 85-100 people<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; were in the Restaurant. I&#39;m at a table for about 5 minutes when this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Group&quot; comes in (20 people). They have Anti-War  Picket Signs with<br/>
&gt;them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It appears that two of these demonstrators are Professor&#39;s. They all<br/>
&gt;sit<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; at a large round table behind me and begin to talk very loudly about<br/>
&gt;US<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; atrocities in Afghanistan. One of the &quot;Professors&quot; stands up and<br/>
&gt;gives a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; brief talk about how the &quot;US is famous for atrocities and Afghanistan<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; will be no different. One of the students asked a question about Viet<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Nam<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; POW&#39;s. The &quot;Professor&quot; make a comment about how that was only US<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; propaganda about poor treatment of POW&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;              OK - I&#39;m really mad now and I jump up and go over to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; their table.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;              (In retrospect - Over the entrance to the Restaurant<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is a Huge American Flag. On each table is an American Flag and a<br/>
&gt;small<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hand painted sign &quot;United We Stand&quot;)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;              I excuse myself and ask the Professor If I can ask<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; him a question. He says yes so I ask him that he appears to be of age<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have served in Viet Nam. Did he serve. His answer was &quot;NO - I<br/>
&gt;defended<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; this Campus and told the truth to the Students:. I then asked if he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; remembered what he was doing on February 16, 1969. When he answered<br/>
&gt;&quot;Of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Course Not - that was too long ago&quot;. I responded, &quot;That&#39;s funny, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; remember what I was doing. that was the second day of my capture and<br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt; &gt; had<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; been standing in a bamboo cage for 24 hours with water up to my<br/>
&gt;chest&quot;.<br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; then said &quot;Sir, your comments about how POW&#39;s in Nam were treated are<br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lie and I personally say to you, you are a FU***** Liar as you never<br/>
&gt;were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there. I was a POW and they did not treat our POW&#39;s humanly. The only<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; other person I have ever heard make the statements like you have is,<br/>
&gt;Jane<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Fonda. Is she telling the truth and not me.?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;              He stood up  and after about 10 seconds said&quot; Jane<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is a great Patriot and I cannot visualize her lying&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;              With that, I reached over and grabbed the small<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; American Flag and United We Stand Sign and said, &quot;I&#39;m taking this<br/>
&gt;back<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; my table where it can be appreciated&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;              No one said a word to me as I started to walk back.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; However after a few seconds, people started standing up and<br/>
&gt;applauding<br/>
&gt; &gt; all<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; around the restaurant. Two men got up from a table across the room<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; walked over to me. The first identified himself as former US Marine<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Lieutenant Flynn and the other man was former Gunnery Sergeant<br/>
&gt;Graboski.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; In a loud voice after introducing themselves, Lt. Flynn said they<br/>
&gt;were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; former Marine Guards at a US Embassy. He then said &quot; WE are over at<br/>
&gt;this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; table to defend the US Flag from all Foes both foreign and domestic&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; They<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; then sat down and asked their Waitress to bring their meals over to<br/>
&gt;my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; table. A few more minutes went by with loud comments from the<br/>
&gt;&quot;Anti-War&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; table and all of a sudden, &quot;Gunny&quot; Sergeant Graboski stood up and in<br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; loud voice said &quot;All of you heard what the President said the other<br/>
&gt; &gt; night.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; You are either with the United Stated or you are with the<br/>
&gt;Terrorists&quot;.<br/>
&gt;He<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; then said &quot;Please stand and join me in God Bless America&quot;. As he<br/>
&gt;started<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; singing, people all around the restaurant, stood up and joined in.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Several<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the students at the &quot;Anti-War&quot; table also stood up half way<br/>
&gt;through<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; song and joined in. Both Professors and the majority of the students<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; remained seated and refused to sing. At the end there was a great<br/>
&gt; &gt; ovation.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The Manager came up to my table (He and his staff came out from the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; kitchen and sang).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;              He thanked me for what I started and then went over<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to the Anti-War table and asked them to leave. &quot;I will pay for what<br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have had so far but I cannot in good conscience serve you - get out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; now!!). One of the Professors then made a remark &quot;Well, we are not<br/>
&gt;going<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to pay one dime for how shabbily we have been treated&quot;. As they were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; leaving, one customer stood up and said &quot;Manager, here is $5  towards<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; their bill, anyone else willing to chip in to get this scum out of<br/>
&gt;here&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; All over the restaurant, people stood up reaching for their wallet<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; saying &quot;I&#39;ll chip in&quot;. The Manager in tears said &quot;My family is from<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Poland, I am now a citizen and am so proud of what I see tonight.&quot; He<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; started crying and a couple of the waitresses helped him into the<br/>
&gt; &gt; kitchen.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;              The two Marine and I were there for about another 20<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; minutes and finished our meal. The Hostess came up to us and showed<br/>
&gt;over<br/>
&gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; $100 dollars that all the other tables had told their Waitresses to<br/>
&gt;give<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; towards our bill. I thanked her but said I could not take the money.<br/>
&gt;Lt<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Flynn said how abut about donating it in the Restaurant&#39;s name to the<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;New<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; York Relief Fund. so I guess that&#39;s what will happen. I just can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; believe how Americans are coming together now.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;              Just thought you would like to hear how the rest of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the country is reacting to what happened!!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
