<div id="ygrps-yiv-152745600">The boats are really slow and awkward to use. You are<br/>
better off swimming. <br/>
<br/>
As far as plat.<br/>
<br/>
1. Buy 2 opal encrusted steins to boost your charisma<br/>
when selling. <br/>
<br/>
2. Farm fine steel weapons. They sell for around 5pp<br/>
with 105 charisma to vendors. Places to farm FS<br/>
include Sol A, Lower Guk, Runnyeye etc.<br/>
<br/>
3. Acrylia caverns in velious. Farm fine steel, velium<br/>
blocks, spider silk, gems etc.  Sell velium and silk<br/>
to players in bazaar. On Vazaelle you can sell velium<br/>
blocks of various sizes from 40pp to 90pp per block.<br/>
<br/>
4. LDON adventures yield good plat and you gain exp at<br/>
the same time.<br/>
<br/>
5. Loy. Go to Dulak&#39;s harbor and kill pirates. They<br/>
drop 4-5 pp plus weapons that sell for around 5pp to<br/>
vendors and the occasional high-end gems. Diamonds,<br/>
blue diamonds etc. <br/>
<br/>
6. Farm tradeskill items. Spider silks sell for around<br/>
20-30pp per stack. Spiderling silks for around the<br/>
same. Animal pelts sell pretty good too. For spider<br/>
silks hunt crag spiders in east karana. Kill<br/>
spiderlings in everfrost or innothule swamp. For pelts<br/>
my favorite place is the karanas and stonebrunt<br/>
mountains.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
