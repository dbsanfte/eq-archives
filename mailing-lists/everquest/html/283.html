<b>Subject:</b> Launching of the TIP List!!!!! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1426786572">Hear Ye, Hear Ye  - Announcing the EQonelist Everquest TIP List!!  I have <br/>
learned over my many years of traveling throughout the great world of <br/>
Norrath, that the more I THINK I know about this world, the more I realize <br/>
how much I DON&#39;T know.  For that reason my fellow adventurers, I propose that <br/>
we generate a list of TIPS that each of us can both share with others and <br/>
learn from for ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
Here are my proposed rules (subject to modification and advice from others):<br/>
<br/>
1) Only provide 1 or 2 tips at a time, you can add others each day, but lets <br/>
keep these posts short, pithy and informative (less time reading is more time <br/>
playing!!)<br/>
<br/>
2) Tips can be general, trade, race or class specific, so to save time for <br/>
all, use the subject line in your post to announce what kind of tip you are <br/>
providing. ie -  &quot;General TIP&quot;, Tailoring TIP&quot;, &quot;Wizard TIP&quot;, &quot;Human TIP&quot; <br/>
.....,<br/>
<br/>
3)  The best TIPS will be those that are not readily apparent, found in the <br/>
manual or just plain common sense.  This list should appeal to both newbies <br/>
and veterans alike, but the best TIPS will be those that someone reads and <br/>
goes &quot;ahhhhh, wow - I never knew that!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, I think that&#39;s enough of a format to see how this works.  So come on <br/>
lads and lasses, let&#39;s start an information revolution the likes of this <br/>
LISTSERV has never seen!<br/>
<br/>
To get this EQonelist EverQuest TIP LIST off the ground, I will submit my <br/>
first two TIPS:<br/>
<br/>
GENERAL TIP<br/>
<br/>
1)  When trading with NPCs in a new city or town (or any town for that <br/>
matter) /con (&quot;consider&quot;) a bunch of the trading NPCs and see which ones look <br/>
at you the friendliest.  You will get better prices for both sales and <br/>
purchases of items from these NPCs than ones who look at you indifferently or <br/>
negatively.  This can save you up 30%!!!!<br/>
<br/>
GENERAL TIP<br/>
<br/>
2)  Never  /shout &quot;HELP!&quot;  - Shouts are heard throughout the entire zone and <br/>
most players that could help you realize that the zone is huge and you are <br/>
unlikely to be near enough to rescue, thus, they will rarely bother to even <br/>
look.  Always use /say &quot;help&quot;  - Then, whoever hears it will know that you <br/>
are in the immediate area and will often come to your aid. <br/>
