<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-4876293">Yes.. to both of your statements.. If that was the<br/>
case, mind you that�s such a far fetched example of<br/>
someone hacking your system for the mere purpose of<br/>
stealing your everquest account.  It&#39;s still under the<br/>
responsibility of the player.  How could you ever<br/>
prove to Verant that your account was hacked in such<br/>
fashion?  I guess they should just recreate objects<br/>
that you have deleted accidentally too.  They are<br/>
responsible for the program and its integrity itself<br/>
not for the inability for its users to properly defend<br/>
themselves.  They&#39;ve implemented a lot of changes to<br/>
help protect the player from themselves =) and the<br/>
community of EQ players at large are happy.  I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t worry about that new statement, GMs can do<br/>
whatever they want, its simply path the company would<br/>
like to follow for a majority.  <br/>
<br/>
Personal responsibility sucks sure.. btw.. My free<br/>
lunch has arrived�=).<br/>
