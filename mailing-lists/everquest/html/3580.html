<div id="ygrps-yiv-943319285"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I usually play on Solsek Ro but I might do the server change option.<br/>
&gt; There is another player that won&#39;t leave me alone even after I&#39;ve asked<br/>
&gt; him several times and petitioned. I don&#39;t play EQ to &quot;hook up&quot; I play to<br/>
&gt; have fun and do my little quests.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm.. Have you put this person on ignore? If he harasses you after putting<br/>
him on ignore (say he creates another character) /report him if he continues<br/>
to bother you. If the GM in-game does not answer your petition, I suggest<br/>
you contact your server GM via the website.<br/>
