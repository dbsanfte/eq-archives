I&#39;ve already taken care of that.  The new system has a 400 watt ceramic power supply (better for heat retention and cooling.).  The system the card is in now has a 250 watt power supply and it still runs fine.  The Radeon cards that need more power generally come with their own cooling fan and power connector.  The 9600XT does not so it works fine.<br/>
