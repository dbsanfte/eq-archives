 </span></blockquote>1st, go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eqatlas.com/velious/easternwastesmap.html">http://www.eqatlas.com/velious/easternwastesmap.html</a> and have<br/>
a look at the map.<br/>
<br/>
locate &quot;6&quot; (in the center of the map): that&#39;s the orc fort. you need<br/>
invis (or some good cleric buffs) to go in there (some things are still<br/>
blue to my lvl 53 char).<br/>
<br/>
go to the entrance of the fort, it is facing north. the way into CC is<br/>
in a small house in the back of the fort. when running inside the fort,<br/>
i normally take the right way around the house, because i believe the<br/>
small house is more to the right and not on the same height as the<br/>
entrance.<br/>
<br/>
the small house has a lattice(/trellis - not sure which is the right<br/>
word (english isn&#39;t my native tongue) you have to open. inside is a<br/>
porter gem, you have to click, to enter CC.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
take care<br/>
