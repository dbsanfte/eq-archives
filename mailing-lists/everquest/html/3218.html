<div id="ygrps-yiv-886093525">Hey Rich, <br/>
	Thanks for the info. Actually I&#39;m tooling down my list of<br/>
characters that I play. Frankly I really only play a couple of them half<br/>
the time, my Ranger and my Magician.  <br/>
	My &quot;break&quot; was for about 10 months. I had gotten into another<br/>
game called Motor City Online which was fun but lacked the<br/>
&quot;personalities&quot; of EQ. SO I&#39;m back and having fun again, I have all this<br/>
week off so I&#39;m doing some major playing! <br/>
