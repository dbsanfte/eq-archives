<b>Subject:</b> Pet focus item quests <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893616289">I have a mage that is doing the pet focus item quests that are given by Vira <br/>
in Solusek&#39;s Eye, and  I have already turned in the required items and <br/>
received my Stein of Ulissa. However, when I tried to turn in the items for <br/>
my Broom of Trillion, Vira told me that Solusek Ro did not accept half <br/>
measures, kept my items, and did not give me the focus item.<br/>
<br/>
She evidently felt that I had somehow failed to properly fulfill the quest, <br/>
yet I am certain I gave her all the correct items. When offering her an item, <br/>
the 4-slot trade-box opens with that item in the first slot. Does it matter <br/>
what order the items are placed in the slots? <br/>
<br/>
The other thing I wonder about is that after I turned in my items and received  <br/>
the stein, I talked to her about all of the other focus quests. I do not <br/>
remember what order we discussed them, but could she only be remembering the <br/>
last one we discussed and it was not for the broom?<br/>
