<div id="ygrps-yiv-1582060990">See, that&#39;s really the problem.  Verant &quot;Doesn&#39;t know&quot; if you are lying or<br/>
at least that&#39;s what they claim.  I really want to know why there is a<br/>
message every few minutes on my screen telling me that my character is saved<br/>
if they refuse to use that info to help players who have been destroyed by<br/>
bugs that should have been squashed in beta.  I&#39;ve been lucky and have not<br/>
lost items due to bugs, it&#39;s happened to a good friend of mine, he just gave<br/>
up that character, didn&#39;t want to deal with that crap.  Verant doesn&#39;t seem<br/>
to understand that we pay money to play this game and we shouldn&#39;t have to<br/>
&quot;just deal&quot; with these kind of programming mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
They could have programmed the game with more logging to know what happened<br/>
when a character dies and know what they had when they died so they could be<br/>
restored without worry that you really traded your items to a friend before<br/>
dieing on the boat but they made the decision not to, apparently, or to not<br/>
use that data and instead they just have their GM&#39;s give the same line of<br/>
garbage every time that they can&#39;t do anything.<br/>
<br/>
One of the biggest problems with this game right now is their severe lack of<br/>
customer service and their lack of being responsible for the bugs in the<br/>
game.  BAH<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll get off my soapbox now.<br/>

Not to be rough about it, but frankly you&#39;re shit out of luck.  I&#39;m on the<br/>
reimbursement list too - have been for over a month now.  Just go out and<br/>
hunt little newbie-ish things to get enough cash for food, and work your way<br/>
back to where you were.  Or if you&#39;re lucky like me, friends will help you<br/>
to recoup your loss (Thanks again Natalia, Arith, Lanor).<br/>
<br/>
Verant has no way of knowing if you&#39;re lying or not...and frankly, if you<br/>
manage to bug them into giving it to you - let me know...I think I lost a<br/>
shiny metallic robe too....<br/>
