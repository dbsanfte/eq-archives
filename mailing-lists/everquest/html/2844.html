<div id="ygrps-yiv-1408644619">Ooops...looks like i stepped on a few toes and rattled<br/>
a few nerves...was not my intention but rather<br/>
expressing my &quot;frustrations&quot; of the moment.  Will be<br/>
sure not to do that again...and to whoever made the<br/>
comment about those who pay more SHOULD get the<br/>
perks...you are right and I humbly beg forgiveness for<br/>
valuing &quot;loyalty&quot; over &quot;greed&quot;.  Not all who play are<br/>
lucky enough to have bottomless BP&#39;s full of plat  :-P<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I tried AO when it first came out.  It was so laggy<br/>
&gt; you really <br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t play.  I gave it 6 weeks and saw only minor<br/>
&gt; improvements.  <br/>
&gt; But the worst part were the missions all got boring.<br/>
&gt;  Go here, kill <br/>
&gt; this, sometimes bring it back, oh sorry that mission<br/>
&gt; is broken, you <br/>
&gt; get nothing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And you think Verant customer service is bad!  Read<br/>
&gt; some of the AO <br/>
&gt; sites.  You can find them on most of the major EQ<br/>
&gt; sites.  These guys <br/>
&gt; were terrible!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll stick with EQ.  No, I haven&#39;t seen a GM event<br/>
&gt; in months, but on <br/>
&gt; TT our GM&#39;s seem to be asleep at the wheel anyway. <br/>
&gt; At least until <br/>
&gt; Star Wars comes out... <br/>
