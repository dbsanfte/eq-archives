<div id="ygrps-yiv-756417486">Got on in the bazaar at a good time, with few enough people that the <br/>
lag was not terminal.<br/>
<br/>
Buy a trader satchel, load it up. Find a spot on one of the trading <br/>
platforms. You cannot trade if you are not on a platform. Type /trade<br/>
and set your prices. Hit List Items so others can scan the list. Now <br/>
either sit there and chat or afk and do something else.<br/>
<br/>
I sold for an hour, but no buyers. Then I scanned the shopping list <br/>
and found a hq brute hide for 5pp. Seemed a good deal, so I bought <br/>
it, banked, and logged.<br/>
<br/>
This is a fabulous setup once you get it set up. Find a spot on the <br/>
platform and your toon can sell all day while you work or sleep. Just <br/>
the thing when you actually want to eat in real life. A real meal, I <br/>
mean, not just gamer food.<br/>

&gt; Heh.<br/>
&gt; How do you set up to sell in the bazaar anyways?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Went there this morning to set up some sales. Lag was terrible. It<br/>
&gt; &gt; was hard to even get my cursor on target. I suppose it will be ok<br/>
&gt; &gt; once I get set up to sell, but the set up is terrible. Move <br/>
cursor.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Not on object. Move a bit more. Not on object. Move back. Click.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t have object. Click again. Hmph. Had object but didn&#39;t know <br/>
it,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and just put it back. Click...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Took so long that I didn&#39;t finish setting up before I had to log. <br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t have logged if I could have left my toon to do business<br/>
&gt; &gt; while I was gone, but no such luck.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I just gotta get another machine, faster connection, and retire <br/>
from<br/>
&gt; &gt; my job so that I can play all the time.<br/>
