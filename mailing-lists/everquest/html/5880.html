<div id="ygrps-yiv-492290128">The Omens of War expansion introduced &quot;tasks&quot; that your character can<br/>
obtain from various &quot;Taskmasters&quot; around Norrath. Tasks are available<br/>
to characters as low as level 3, and the low-level Taskmaster is in<br/>
your home town. I&#39;ve done tasks with various toons at levels 10, 20,<br/>
31, and 65 now. The experience reward is decent at all those levels.<br/>
The lower-leveled tasks mostly force you to explore around and learn<br/>
the environment and worthwhile just for that.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a sorta newby question.  Last spring I bought Evolution<br/>
&gt; thinking I would<br/>
&gt; re-join Norrath.  Well, apparently not!  My system couldn&#39;t handle<br/>
&gt; the change<br/>
&gt; on the first of April (no matter what I tried, my sad, tired machine<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t deal<br/>
&gt; with the changes).  So, now I have a new machine that will work with<br/>
&gt; the game<br/>
&gt; and will be getting dsl shortly.   I will be using the game I bought<br/>
&gt; (Evolution) and<br/>
&gt; would like to know if any of the expansions beyond LoY offer anything<br/>
&gt; for the<br/>
&gt; &#39;new&#39;, young player or if they are mostly for above levels 20, 30,<br/>
&gt; 40, 50 or more?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I first played (on a borrowed account to see if I would like it)<br/>
&gt; I couldn&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; out of the room/building where I was created!!!  It was hysterical! <br/>
&gt; My Mentor had<br/>
&gt; to come get me!  and he was kos in Felwithe!  I definately won&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; repeating <br/>
&gt; that scenario......LOL<br/>
