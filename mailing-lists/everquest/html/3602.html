<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023771958">Ok Savawulf, I&#39;m a little confused here and I apologize. The first thing<br/>
I want to get cleared up is, are there any legal ramifications in the<br/>
real world that any of us whom may decide to assist you in this &quot;quest&quot;<br/>
can get into? I mean no insult by this question; just want to clear up<br/>
any confusion. <br/>
Second, do I understand correctly that this is a harmless role-playing<br/>
game you two are doing and you would basically like some others to join<br/>
you or &quot;play along&quot; so to speak? If so hey I&#39;m cool with that.  <br/>
Third, got a pic of this evil dark elf? One can&#39;t very well go around<br/>
hacking every female dark elf they see. That would be like someone<br/>
running around saying that this watery tart threw him a sword and now he<br/>
is king that would be absurd! <br/>
<br/>
Oh and off topic, Dude! Your outfit rocks! <br/>

Subject: Savawulf&#39;s Ransom<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the scoop:<br/>
<br/>
Among my many characters I play a half-elf ranger named Savawulf on the<br/>
Cazic Thule server.  Savawulf is a member of the Draconis Rampant guild.<br/>
Recently some events have come to pass where Savawulf was wronged by<br/>
another member of the DR guild.  An evil dark elf necromancer named<br/>
Kethryveris Ashkeveron.  Watch out for her if you ever meet her.  She&#39;s<br/>
very evil and cannot be trusted!!!<br/>
<br/>
The story is thatSavawulf had a very valuable item stolen from him in<br/>
real life - out of game that is.  Now, the person behind the evil dark<br/>
elf lady is holding this item for ransom.  Seeing that I have  no<br/>
reprieve, I feel it is in my best interest for the safety of this item<br/>
to be returned that I just comply with her wishes.  Therefore, For the<br/>
full story, plese go to the following website:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/savawulf">http://www.geocities.com/savawulf</a><br/>
<br/>
You can find the details there.   Incidentally, I also cross posted this<br/>
to the Draconis Rampant message board, and curiously enough, the<br/>
Savatage fan page messageboard.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid to see what kind of responses I get.  I&#39;ll probably end up<br/>
getting sued by the band for copying their song without permission, but<br/>
that&#39;s a chance I&#39;m going to have to take if I am to get this very<br/>
valuable item back.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If this hsan&#39;t piqued your curiosity enough, I don&#39;t know what will.<br/>
<br/>
Check out the page.<br/>

Respectfully, <br/>
