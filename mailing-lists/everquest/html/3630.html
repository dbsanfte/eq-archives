<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004950881">I have been camping the brutes in Warsliks Woods. Only once have I <br/>
had to wait for the camp. That time I was following a Necro, lvl 30. <br/>
Watched his kills. Much faster than mine. Curious as to whether this <br/>
is normal.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps my technique is flakey. I ensnare, ensnarring root, dot, dot, <br/>
and med. Have to often refresh the root at least once. Then refresh <br/>
one dot. Dead brute. Not too fast, but affective. This is on dark <br/>
blue brutes with me at lvl 33.<br/>
<br/>
If it goes well I come out down only one bubble of mana. Usually at <br/>
least half. Only twice did I get low, and then I just burned the rest <br/>
on nukes to finish the kill. Didn&#39;t want to waste mana on roots that <br/>
weren&#39;t holding.<br/>
<br/>
I am working as a pure caster now, and this is my highest level <br/>
character. I am unfamiliar with hybrids, but watching a lower level <br/>
necro outpace my kills made me wonder if I could not do better.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>
