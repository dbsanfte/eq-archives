They are quite amusing to learn actually, if your into<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
And I agree with Kim, you need to be in the same zone,<br/>
you can&#39;t increase while teaching only the student,<br/>
and now when the skill goes up, you see it like you<br/>
were doing pottery or similar.  A nice addition IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>

&gt; &gt;   I don&#39;t know that languages and the teaching of<br/>
&gt; them has changed, <br/>
&gt; but I can state for sure that it WAS so that you<br/>
&gt; could teach <br/>
&gt; languages in a group and every person in the group<br/>
&gt; would get better <br/>
&gt; at it.  All you needed to do was to constantly spam<br/>
&gt; the group with <br/>
&gt; text in the language you wanted to teach, assuming<br/>
&gt; of course, you <br/>
&gt; knew the language.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   It&#39;s not uncommon for a guide or gm to make<br/>
&gt; claims about the game <br/>
&gt; as it is or was and for those claims to be totally<br/>
&gt; baseless, I <br/>
&gt; suspect that they lie as often as not.  Keep in mind<br/>
&gt; that the <br/>
&gt; development team recently suggested that people<br/>
&gt; could interupt a <br/>
&gt; spell being cast on horseback by making a hotkey<br/>
&gt; that consisted of <br/>
&gt; two lines, /dismount and /duck<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Anyone wanna explain why that won&#39;t work? <br/>
&gt; There&#39;s two reasons I <br/>
&gt; know of offhand.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;     I was curious what has changed about the<br/>
&gt; languages.  I used to <br/>
&gt; be able to teach a language to my group and get<br/>
&gt; better at it.  This <br/>
&gt; is no longer so, and I talked to a GM who told me<br/>
&gt; this was never so.  <br/>
&gt; I was also told that something changed in respect to<br/>
&gt; languages and <br/>
&gt; zoning or something.  I am quite curious about this,<br/>
&gt; as I am trying <br/>
&gt; to learn every language I can.  I was also curious<br/>
&gt; if you could teach <br/>
&gt; over your own knowledge in the language.  Thank you<br/>
&gt; in advance for <br/>
&gt; your replies. <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;     Reason 1:  You can&#39;t use hotkeys during spell<br/>
&gt; casting.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;     Reason B: /Duck is an emote, not an action. <br/>
&gt; it is NOT the same <br/>
&gt; as hitting the (D)uck key, which WILL instantly<br/>
&gt; interupt a spell <br/>
&gt; being cast.<br/>
