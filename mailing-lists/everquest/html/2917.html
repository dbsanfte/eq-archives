<div id="ygrps-yiv-347910195">I often have a hard time remembering that my characters are female when I&#39;m<br/>
playing them. And I often have people ask me if I&#39;m a guy playing a girl.<br/>
It&#39;s rather amusing.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I have both male and Female characters, mostly female but the only reason<br/>
 </span></blockquote>for me was for a bit of variety because all my characters are high elves,<br/>
and because I usually play with all 4 main chars at once, (works out real<br/>
good when u can control a cleric, druid, mage and a warrior yourself i.e. no<br/>
idiots getting you killed because they don&#39;t know what to do when everything<br/>
goes to buggery, even on my 56K freeserve connection (which surprised the<br/>
hell outta me thats for sure) but I digress, the only reason I use both male<br/>
and female models is as I said because I play high elves and since most<br/>
races are limited to a handful of different models male/female it can get<br/>
hard to make them look completely different from each other especially if<br/>
they are all wearing the same kind of gear like DRT&#39;s and leather, robes<br/>
etc. Although I find playing a character that is the same sex as me is<br/>
easier since I don&#39;t have to keep reminding myself what sex my char is.<br/>
