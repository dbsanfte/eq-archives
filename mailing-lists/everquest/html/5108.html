<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030758956">Yes. I have 5 on a single connection, myself. One is directly connected to<br/>
the DSL, and runs a program called Sygate which shares the connection to the<br/>
other machines. It has a special configuration package for EQ, but worked<br/>
fine without it, for me, so try working without it first. If you have any<br/>
trouble with it, email me, it has a few rare but known issues that can be<br/>
hard to diagnose but are pretty easy to fix.<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] Computer Question<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hello everyone I have question for you guys.  Now before I start off I am<br/>
&gt; just starting to learn the hardware side of computers so bear with me lol,<br/>
&gt; now my question is what items would be needed in order to have 3 computers<br/>
&gt; share 1 DSL line?  When I get back I&#39;m gonna buy a laptop and have one of<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; friends move in with me so we&#39;ll have 3 computers total on 1 DSL line<br/>
thats<br/>
&gt; the reason why I ask this question.  Thanks for any help you guys can give<br/>
&gt; me.<br/>
