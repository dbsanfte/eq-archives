<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I made a friend last night while I was camping a 
shralok pack, and I got it, and made a friend too. I also got the idol and the 
halberd. It was a good night. I am going to try to play with this person again 
and see if there is anything they want to camp. She plays a warrior and seemed 
to like my ranger buffs and sow. </font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>Well, how do you camp?&nbsp; Be prepared for long and 
  boring waits my <br>friend.&nbsp; If you are camping a rare spawn that&#39;s all 
  you can do.&nbsp; You <br>are usually focused on a certain item for a certain 
  quest, so that&#39;s <br>what keeps your interest up.&nbsp; This is where friends 
  or guildies help, <br>as you know they will ask for your help on their boring 
  camp.&nbsp; I&#39;m in <br>the midst of the Ivy Etched Armor quests and I have 
  several camps <br>ahead.&nbsp; One guy is an 8 hour pop, if he pop&#39;s!&nbsp; My 
  buddies gladly <br>come along, and there&#39;s usually a few people around to chat 
  with.&nbsp; <br>And there&#39;s always gems!<br><br>So, I would say look at what 
  you need for what you want, and plan for <br>it.&nbsp; Many guilds take in new 
  members in your level range, join up and <br>tell them what you want to 
  do.&nbsp; Odds are there will many people <br>willing to help you, as long as 
  you help them.<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit
