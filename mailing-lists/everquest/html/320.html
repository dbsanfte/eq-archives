<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839138769">If you have gotten this a second time, I am sorry.  I am <br/>
having problems with my email client and it came back to <br/>
me.  So I am resending a fresh copy.<br/>
----------------------------------------------<br/>
Well, I found a site that had alot of info on it about <br/>
Commands.  Some of it is in the text file from EQ, but <br/>
here it is explained better (i think anyway).<br/>
I have attached an edited version because it is too big <br/>
to put in this email effectively.<br/>
<br/>
the site is at:      <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.gamestats.com/">http://everquest.gamestats.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
look at the &quot;Commands&quot; link on the left.<br/>
<br/>
If there are more than this, let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Mytheril.</div>
