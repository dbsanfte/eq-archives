&gt; No, it actually makes it tougher. There&#39;s no more<br/>
&gt; single pulling, or FD splitting. If you get a mob<br/>
&gt; linked with 3 other mobs, they&#39;re all coming, and<br/>
&gt; you&#39;d better be ready for them.<br/>

for it.  EQ had &quot;linked&quot; mobs too, but you didn&#39;t know how many were <br/>
coming.  WoW has linked mobs, but you really can&#39;t tell which ones are <br/>
coming.<br/>

EQ2 was a rushed product that probably needs about 6 more months of <br/>
development time.  They rushed it out because of WoW and Christmas.  Not <br/>
much of a surprise since SoE drove EQ into the ground as well.</div>
