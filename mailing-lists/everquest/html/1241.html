<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864022328"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">My sons have been playing games since they were very young. &nbsp;At 5, my oldest 
<br>could beat all his dad&#39;s co-workers (computer programmers) at Tribes like it 
<br>was nothing. &nbsp;I guess when I think of kids playing I think of kids like them 
<br>who know games. &nbsp;When my son was recently tested for gifted at his school, 
<br>they commented on his superior high above average eye hand coordination. &nbsp;Go 
<br>figure LOL.

<br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote TYPE="CITE" style="BORDER-LEFT:#0000ff 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;">Well, this particular kid purposely got me killed (we were in group and were
<br>going to attack something together-- when I got aggrod on he did nothing to
<br>help). He waited until I was dead (and the mob was half dead) before
<br>attacking. When I respawned before he finished it off, he disbanded me so he
<br>would get all the xp. It really sucked.
<br>The kid shouldn&#39;t have been playing.
<br>I guess if the kids are supervised and know how to behave its ok.
<br>luv,
