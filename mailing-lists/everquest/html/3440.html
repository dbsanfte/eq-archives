<div id="ygrps-yiv-35259445">The event in Qeynos Hills is tied to Jaggedpine.  The Gnolls of <br/>
Blackburrow come pouring out to attack the entrance to Surefall.  The <br/>
defenders are from Surefall, all look like Wood Elves.  They have <br/>
archers and regular foot soldiers.  It was an awesome sight to see, <br/>
but very laggy.  My meter hit 6000 before it dropped me.  I&#39;ve <br/>
actually seen this twice, on 2 different servers.  I&#39;ve seen these <br/>
guys before so it may have happened more than once.  It might be a <br/>
recurring thing, like the ring war.  I haven&#39;t checked that out.  And <br/>
that majority of the Mobs were red to me!  Defending the homeland has <br/>
a heavy price to pay!<br/>

&gt; Speaking of jaggedpine I had someone beg me to come to Qeynos Hills <br/>
with<br/>
&gt; them to rez a bunch of people who were killed in some sort of GM <br/>
event. all<br/>
&gt; kinds of npcs were in front of surefall glade. I hung out and <br/>
rezzed people<br/>
&gt; then after waiting and finding they might not be able to make it <br/>
happen<br/>
&gt; again for another hour or more I decided to head out and get some <br/>
sleep.<br/>
&gt; Was anyone around for an event of that type in Qhills?<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Only 2 places like that are Vox&#39;s lair (only inside it where she <br/>
is, NOT<br/>
&gt; the rest of the zone) and Naggy&#39;s lair (same thing). Any OTHER part <br/>
of the<br/>
&gt; zone is 100% normal for all levels, and can be gone into. As for <br/>
exp...try<br/>
&gt; Karnor&#39;s and  OS. Jaggedpine might be a good bet too.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Ok now that my cleric is lvl 52, I&#39;m trying to find a good place <br/>
to hunt<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt;   get xp. Also, are there any parts of my epic that I can do out of <br/>
order.<br/>
&gt;   Like can I kill some mob in nagafen&#39;s lair or such without doing <br/>
the other<br/>
&gt;   parts first? Or does the king something or other.. whatever it is <br/>
there..<br/>
&gt;   does it have to be triggered by the quest to spawn? I&#39;m worried <br/>
that I<br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt;   hit one of those zones where if you are over 52 you will be <br/>
banished to<br/>
&gt; zone<br/>
&gt;   beginning so I want to do what I can while lower lvl and then do <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; higher<br/>
&gt;   lvl stuff once I&#39;ve gone up more.<br/>
&gt;   Any suggestions?<br/>
&gt;   luv,<br/>
&gt;   -Su<br/>
