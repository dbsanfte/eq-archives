<div id="ygrps-yiv-495653632">I&#39;ve only found a few problems and that&#39;s with LD.<br/>
If any of your group members go LD during the crawl and can&#39;t get back on<br/>
quickly you&#39;re pretty much screwed. And it&#39;s very difficult to do some of<br/>
the adventures without a mezzer.<br/>
And sometimes if you have to locate a mob and kill it before a certain<br/>
time-period is up, the mob doesn&#39;t spawn until literally 3 minutes before<br/>
time is up and you can&#39;t get to it before then. I haven&#39;t had much luck, but<br/>
hopefully the next time I actually get to play I&#39;ll have better luck. I<br/>
think the 7 level difference sucks though.<br/>

&gt; and the easy of loading it that way.  I also got the pack of Abu-Kar<br/>
&gt; and did the quest to upgrade it.  The Dungeons have a D&D feel, but<br/>
&gt; the whole system feels like AO to me.  But the XP and PP are great.<br/>
&gt; And some of the rewards are outta sight!<br/>
