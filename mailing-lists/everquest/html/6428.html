<div id="ygrps-yiv-1606126550">Not a bad set up thdeere so that&#39;s not it but since you mentioned you&#39;re on<br/>
a dial-up then that makes perfect sense.<br/>
<br/>
I used to have to do the same in PoK even with broadband. What really made<br/>
the difference for me was the addition of a new vid card. I picked up an<br/>
nVidia 5500 at Wal*Mart for $120 and it was well worth the investment. I<br/>
still lag occasionally but nothing compared to what I used to! <br/>

<br/>
My computer takes about 5-7 minutes to load from the char select screen. I<br/>
have 1gb ram, with an amd processor ( running win 2000 ) lol i was cheap,<br/>
but it works. However I am on dialup, as there isnt anything faster or<br/>
better in my area yet, tho i hear wi-fi is coming so....&lt;crossing fingers&gt;.<br/>
The huige wait tho, sometimes longer than the actual loading, is zoning into<br/>
PoK. It is is horribley long wait...worse if the character i want to play is<br/>
camped there...so until there is a change..I seldom go there now ort camp<br/>
there. I have a pocket cleric and chanter to temp/ virtue and kei, me in<br/>
nexus, so al is good.<br/>
   <br/>
  Tho I do have an issue with PoK..am I the only one that has to run around<br/>
PoK loking at their feet and suing the map so not to run into stuff? The lag<br/>
there, most times ( early morn seems to be best) is very bad...</div>
