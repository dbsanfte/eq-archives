<div id="ygrps-yiv-422807158">I have to admit that I raised an eyebrow after reading that the show that <br/>
wants to interview an EverQuest addict is called &#39;Call for Help.&#39; I think if <br/>
it was a different type of show, no one would have bashed it, but obviously <br/>
the only point they want an addict on it is so they can bash US. I have to <br/>
say, nice try, but no one wants to be put through that. We like EverQuest... <br/>
deal with it.<br/>
