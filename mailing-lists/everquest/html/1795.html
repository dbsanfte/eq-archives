<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113782907">strangely enough i play a lvl 15 druid on Terris Thule, too &lt;G&gt;  she looks like a twink though, because i&#39;ve spent so long<br/>
trading and selling in EC.<br/>
<br/>
some low to mid level must haves (in my op):<br/>
Moonstone Rings (3str/30mana) maybe 100pp for a pair<br/>
Foreman&#39;s Tunic (10ac/3str/3wis/0wt), 100pp or so<br/>
Platinum Armbands (3str/3wis), 150pp or so<br/>
Platinum Ruby Veil (4str/4wis), 200pp<br/>
Lizardscale Mantle (3int/3wis/5ac), about 100pp<br/>
<br/>
notice the trend?  i&#39;m a wood elf, so strength is always a good thing, and wisdom and mana for druids is always nice.<br/>
<br/>
some non-essentials that are still nice to have:<br/>
Icepaw War Claws (1hs 9/24 3agi), 250pp or so<br/>
Velium Round Shield (15ac i think and 0wt), 150pp but they go cheaper a lot<br/>
<br/>
the Testament of Vanear is a nice quest item, but 15 is a little low to get it without help.  it&#39;s 10wis/10mana, and my<br/>
friend did it solo at 24.  the worst part is it&#39;s nearly a 7 hour spawn rate and the guy that drops (dylln starshine in High<br/>
Hold Pass) has a high level buddy that will kill you dead.<br/>
<br/>
good hunting.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was wondering if anyone could give me some suggestions on armor for a 15th<br/>
&gt; lvl halfling druid.  I&#39;ve got a lumberjack&#39;s cap, splitpaw gloves, and a<br/>
&gt; brown chitin protector right now, but everything else is leather armor.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve also got a black enameled mace.  What sort of upgrades would make the<br/>
&gt; most sense right now?  Is there a piece or two of armor that I can&#39;t live<br/>
&gt; without?  I can&#39;t afford anything in the thousands, but I could swing a<br/>
&gt; couple hundred plats or a bit more for a good piece of armor.  I know it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; been said that I won&#39;t melee much after lvl 20, but I still want to keep up<br/>
&gt; my battle skills.  Besides, I mostly solo and enjoy banging on something<br/>
&gt; every once in a while when its hps have gotten low.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m on Terris Thule, by the way :)<br/>
