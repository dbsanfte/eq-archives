Subject: [EverQuest] Items in Chat<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Did a lot of searching the web and learned a lot more about EQ.  I can<br/>
play<br/>
&gt; CDs with my hot keys now and my social hot keys include the targets<br/>
name.<br/>
&gt; One thing I have not been able to find, is how people put items in<br/>
their<br/>
&gt; messages so you can click on them to see the specs.  Like when<br/>
somebody says<br/>
&gt; &quot;WTS a Sword.&quot; and the word Sword is in a different color and when you<br/>
click<br/>
&gt; on it you see the stats.<br/>
<br/>
In this case, assuming you had an item called &#39;Sword&#39; you would type<br/>
&quot;WTS a&quot; then press ALT and click on the item in question in your<br/>
inventory. This brings up a window with the items details. Click on the<br/>
picture of the item in that window and its item name will be pasted to<br/>
your chat cursor as a hotlink. Your chat bar would now say &quot;WTS a Sword&quot;<br/>
with Sword highlighted and a hotlink<br/>
