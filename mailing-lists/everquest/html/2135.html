<div id="ygrps-yiv-343694206">Where are you hunting?<br/>
If you&#39;re in Gfay area I can probably help you out sometime. A cool thing to<br/>
do is collect crushbone belts and turn them in. You get some patchwork armor<br/>
that you can wear. It&#39;s cruddy, but it&#39;s a start.<br/>
Basically kill critters til you get armor. When you start hunting higher<br/>
level mobs they start dropping more coin.<br/>
Most of my characters are on the Tribunal.<br/>
You can contact Elzeria, Damita, and Tiladanu (I know I&#39;m missing some but<br/>
can&#39;t remember their names right now).<br/>
What class and race? In a guild yet?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know I&#39;m about 20 years late, but I&#39;m making that transition from<br/>
&gt; Ultima Online and MUD to EQ.  I&#39;ve been enjoying it so far on the<br/>
&gt; Tribunal Server. THINGS ARE EXPENSIVE! Leveling is pretty balance.<br/>
&gt; Plenty of helpful players!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m just looking for advice on how to get more money.  A player gave<br/>
&gt; me a sweet sword does high damage, but other than that I&#39;m naked.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
