<div id="ygrps-yiv-1626639831">Before LoY, certain kinds of armor were dyable. Off<br/>
the top of my head, the only ones I can think of were<br/>
fine plate (which not many people wear anymore). I<br/>
don&#39;t know exactly how the dyes were made, but I&#39;m<br/>
pretty sure brewing was a part of it,and the<br/>
componants were dropped from mobs, for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
With LoY, all armor can be dyed. I&#39;ve only done a<br/>
little dying, but if I remember right, it requires<br/>
pottery and brewing, neither of which has to be *too*<br/>
high, but maybe at least around a skill of 100. The<br/>
dye is called Prismatic Dye, and you can usually find<br/>
someone selling it in the bazaar.<br/>
<br/>
Once you have the dye, all you do it open your<br/>
inventory, and at the bottom there is a &quot;dye&quot; button.<br/>
Just click on that, then pick the piece you want to<br/>
dye, and it does it for you automatically, as long as<br/>
the vial of dye is in your inventory.<br/>
<br/>
(and if I had bothered to read all this thread, I<br/>
would have seen that some of this info was already<br/>
given to you. Bad cleric, no cookie for you. hehe)<br/>

&gt; I just want to make sure before I go out and buy<br/>
&gt; that expansion. <br/>
&gt; Thanks for all your help :)<br/>

&gt; &gt;  EQtraders.com is the best place to learn recipes<br/>

&gt; &gt; The Plains root and water flask combination will<br/>
&gt; make Plains Dye. <br/>
&gt; &gt; This is used for LoY tailored robes not to dye<br/>
&gt; armor. <br/>
&gt; &gt;  If want you are wanting to do is change the color<br/>
&gt; of visible armor <br/>
&gt; &gt; on your toon, then here is what you need to do:<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt;  First, you need the LoY expansion.(just a<br/>
&gt; reminder)<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Now time to make some stuff:<br/>
&gt; &gt;     In a kiln put a Unfired Vial and a High<br/>
&gt; Quality Firing Sheet<br/>
&gt; &gt;   the trivial on this is 54. (pottery skill)<br/>
&gt; &gt;     In a brew barrel or medicine bag combine a<br/>
&gt; Prism Shard and <br/>
&gt; Glaze <br/>
&gt; &gt; Lacquer, this is also trivial at 54. (brewing<br/>
&gt; skill)<br/>
&gt; &gt;     You now will have a Dye Vial and Prismatic<br/>
&gt; Dye, combine these <br/>
&gt; two <br/>
&gt; &gt; items in a brew barrel or medicine bag. trivial at<br/>
&gt; 68<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;  On your inventory screen there is a button that<br/>
&gt; says dye. This is <br/>
&gt; &gt; used to pick the color to dye your armor.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
