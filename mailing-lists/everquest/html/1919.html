<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The time requirements are a little better because 
there&#39;s alot less twinking.&nbsp; You&#39;re not going to find 1st lvl chars with 
20th lvl gear.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t had a problem completing quests so far because of 
camping.&nbsp; The more a mob is camped, the less exp it yields.&nbsp; This 
prevents the powerlevelers from sitting in one place for days and killing the 
same thing over and over.&nbsp; I&#39;m a casual player as well and don&#39;t have time 
to keep up with the 15 years olds that play EQ for 12 hours a day.&nbsp; DAoC is 
much more attuned to how you&#39;re progressing, not someone else.</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>what about time requirements??<br>EQ demands absolutely all 
  your spare time to enjoy the<br>game... you know things like you have to camp 
  for a<br>particular quest item for hours, sometimes days...<br><br>Is this 
  needed in DAoC? I played EQ for a while until<br>I realized it took up almost 
  my whole life...lol.. I<br>don&#39;t wish to start on another MMORPG that&#39;s 
  like<br>that.<br><br>I heard AO is pretty good since there&#39;s that 
  mission<br>console thingy that supposedly eliminates camping...<br><br>---

  well.&nbsp; I think you&#39;re<br>&gt; right in that they&#39;ve built on EQ and are 
  better,<br>&gt; much in the same way that EQ was better than UO when<br>&gt; 
  it came out.&nbsp; I figure that we&#39;re all consumers and<br>&gt; we play the 
  best game.&nbsp; It&#39;s nice to have the<br>&gt; marketplace competition as each 
  game tries to outdo<br>&gt; the other.&nbsp; There&#39;s nothing wrong or disloyal 
  in<br>&gt; switching RPGs, and there will be nothing wrong with<br>&gt; 
  switching back if/when EQ revamps itself.<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; ----- Original

  <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must say that I too have made the 
  switch,<br>&gt; haven&#39;t touched EQ since DAoC came out.&nbsp; Dark Age<br>&gt; 
  has had the benefit of hindsight and learning from<br>&gt; EQ&#39;s 
  mistakes.&nbsp; They have built upon them.&nbsp; There is<br>&gt; less 
  downtime, more character specialization, less<br>&gt; annoying corpse runs, 
  better graphics, easier<br>&gt; grouping, and better pvp.&nbsp; DAoC is better 
  than EQ<br>&gt; currently, however, to EQ&#39;s credit -- Dark Age<br>&gt; 
  wouldn&#39;t be what it is if it hadn&#39;t been for EQ&#39;s<br>&gt; experience.<br>&gt; 
  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you like EQ, I think you&#39;ll like Dark Age if<br>&gt; 
  not as much, perhaps better.&nbsp; The only drawback is<br>&gt; that you need 
  a pretty high-end system for smooth<br>&gt; play (particularly a good graphics 
  card).<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -----Original

  husband has been playing it.&nbsp; In fact, after<br>&gt; a few days, he 
  cancelled his EQ account and is<br>&gt; solely playing DAoC.&nbsp; He keeps 
  telling me to try it<br>&gt; but I tell him I like EQ just fine.&nbsp; From 
  watching<br>&gt; him, I can tell I don&#39;t wanna play.&nbsp; BUT he&#39;s a<br>&gt; 
  hardcore gamer and EQ and Solitaire are the only<br>&gt; games I play.&nbsp; 
  He says it&#39;s like EQ but better.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&gt;
