<div id="ygrps-yiv-288068603">If you die at levels below 5 you should resurrect with five days of <br/>
food and water. If your corpse had nothing on it, it may have <br/>
disappeared, but your own anwswer is most likely. You misplaced your <br/>
corpse. Dying at levels below five is set to be low-penalty (you lose <br/>
very little and get food and water when you come back) to make the <br/>
early learning a bit easier.<br/>
<br/>
There are tools to find corpses, sold by merchants. However, it is <br/>
best to learn to die with finding your corpse in mind. Try to look <br/>
around at landmarks when death is clearly coming. Try to be near some <br/>
object you can find easily when you come back. And unless you don&#39;t <br/>
mind having to do this often, learn to fight in such a way as to <br/>
seldom die. Some gamers like to take the risks leading to frequent <br/>
deaths, but I prefer to hunt with care and die seldom. Seems more in <br/>
the spirit of the game to me.<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting to you.<br/>
