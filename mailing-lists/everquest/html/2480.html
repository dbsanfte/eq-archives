<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Thanks, all, for your responses. Since I can only add pci to my cheap<br/>
&gt; system (looked so nice last year when I knew so little) and my memory<br/>
&gt; is maxed at 256 (I really knew way too little), I may follow the<br/>
&gt; advice to wait for the 4 to come out and grab a 3 at discount.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Or I could win the lottery and buy a real computer.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have an Nvidia tnt2 64 graphics card. PCI. I have seen the gforce<br/>

&gt; &gt; for about $45. I am wondering if I can expect much improved<br/>
&gt; &gt; performance with the gforce 2. Both are pci, both 32k. I get lots<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; lag in Rivervale, most of Luclin, and some of the other cities. Not<br/>
&gt; &gt; everywhere, just where lots of people gather and the backgrounds<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; graphics intensive.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t have the money to go for the gforce 3, and I don&#39;t even<br/>
&gt; know<br/>
&gt; &gt; if the 3 comes in pci format. I need another hard disk as well as<br/>
&gt; &gt; doing a graphics upgrade, so the money needs to stay around that<br/>
&gt; $45.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would want a very obvious improvement to even bother with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; upgrade on the graphics.<br/>
