<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741143789"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Hmm.. So if I wanted to cancel casting I could click horsie away and duck?<br/>
&gt; Or is there too much delay?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i never tried it... when i am in a raid (no extreme zones), it don&#39;t care<br/>
too much about interrupting casts, and i nuke dead mobs quite often.<br/>
just to make sure they are really dead... ;-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; safefall is cool. I&#39;d like to see people jumping off kelethin on horses.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>there is sort of an &quot;feature&quot; (aka bug) in Plane of Sky.<br/>
<br/>
for those of you who don&#39;t know PoS:<br/>
 - you need a 46+ whizzy to get there<br/>
 - there are many small isles connected by &quot;teleports&quot;<br/>
 - you need some loot to get a key after you killed boss of isle<br/>
 - to leave PoS you jump of an isle and after you leave the zone<br/>
   you will keep on falling into the water in west freeport <br/>
 - on leaving the zone, all keys will vanish even if they<br/>
   aren&#39;t NO RENT<br/>
 - Call of Hero (Summon Player to casting Mage) does not<br/>
   work<br/>
 - levitate doesn&#39;t work (so no way back to 1st isle)<br/>
<br/>
so people try to keep keys on corpses or leave char logged in PoS.<br/>
the problems with corpses: they rot after a week, and you need it<br/>
on first isle. but it costs some pp to get necro up there to summon<br/>
corpse. and a logged out char can&#39;t just walk/fly back to 1st isle.<br/>
<br/>
on one of my last PoS raids i discovered the following thing: jump<br/>
off an isle mounted. when you reach the zoneline, you get the message<br/>
that you have fallen beneath the world and are moved to the safespot<br/>
in the zone... and this happens to be on 1st isle... ;-)<br/>
