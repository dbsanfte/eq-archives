&gt; Well I just want the armor of ro to reflect the amount of work we have to put in to get it, ranger/bard and shamans all have ALOT easier quests and their armor is alot better, which doesnt make sense.. Just make the armor reflect the difficulty of the quests is all I want.. Oh btw I finally got my smithing up to 101 after MANY hours of tedious work in the forge, not sure if 101 is enough though, anyone tried making ro armor with 101 skill? Anyone FAILED?<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am a level 41 Ranger.  I have played many other classes, some over 20, but not<br/>
&gt; &gt; many.  The paladin and ranger classes cannot be compared unless our spells are<br/>
&gt; &gt; left out.  When dueling, paladins have a small advantage.  When melee&#39;ing<br/>
&gt; &gt; creatures, Rangers can come into the lead, dmg-wise.  I believe that Rangers<br/>
&gt; &gt; cannot truly see how powerful they will be until level 30, when a glimpse can be<br/>
&gt; &gt; caught, then at 39 when we get our true spells that we needed at level 30.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think that from level 20 to 30 is when most people will quit EQ or their<br/>
&gt; &gt; character because they think another class is more attractive, and it may be..<br/>
&gt; &gt; it depends upon the person to truly master the character.  I can kill a level 50<br/>
&gt; &gt; Wizard in a duel.  If he got one Ice Comet off and a couple hits with his stick,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would be in the most trouble.  We cannot be compared.  All classes must work<br/>
&gt; &gt; together for a greater good.  I don&#39;t want to compare my 41 Ranger to a 41<br/>
&gt; &gt; Paladin.  I have great fun fighting with friends and helping them out with<br/>
&gt; &gt; things.  Don&#39;t complain about armor, weapons, spells, etc, because we are not<br/>
&gt; &gt; supposed to be gods at level 20, or 25, or 30, and we aren&#39;t supposed to be gods<br/>
&gt; &gt; at 50, or 75.  In a group, anything can be done.  No class can stand by itself.<br/>
&gt; &gt; It has been tried, and everyone who has tried failed, unless in some occasion<br/>
&gt; &gt; where 25 lvl 50 wizards got off ice comet at the same time at Vox or some other<br/>
&gt; &gt; beast.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Rock on with a character if you like that character, and dont ever delete your<br/>
&gt; &gt; character if you want to start a new one, because you will regret it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If you play on the Bertoxxulous server, you may know me and the Guardians of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Tunare, and if you want to see the power that a ranger or any other class for<br/>
&gt; &gt; that matter has, give me a tell.  I have friends, and we will gladly help you<br/>
&gt; &gt; see why you must stick with your character to the end, whenever that may be,<br/>
&gt; &gt; after 500+ hours of playtime.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I enjoy my Ranger character.. I just get tired of people complaining about<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; what their class doesn&#39;t have.  I only posted that to say hey don&#39;t single<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; out classes that have perceived problems compared to others.. Rangers to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Palaies in particular.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hehe, I remember when wizards were complaining that Ice Comet is just not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; powerful enough.  They claimed that without a more powerful spell, how could<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; they really be the masters of DD. =)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; And as for your fun comment.. &quot;Getting to 50 without having fun is plain<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stupid.&quot; Teamwork and using the class specific skills would add to the fun,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; posting everything on the internet is what sucks.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; PS..<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Was anyone online during the DE war last night.. What did you think of it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; all?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, come on, stop moaning.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; * Its weird that Rangers are better than Paladins in combats dont you think?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; * Bards get Track at lvl35.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; * The quest for SSoM is very simple to complete for the Ranger.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have some of Ranger friends and they are doing great. I also have some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Pally friends and they are also doing great. Why does everybody want to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the mightiest person in Norrath? I certainly do not. And wow people are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; posting spawns points on the Internet, thats just not good for the game.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Getting to 50 without having fun is plain stupid.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ENJOY THE RIDE.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My question is... When have the Rangers truly ever been upgrade?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     1.  Given &quot;Dances with Fire Flies spell&quot;  -  wow that&#39;s a winner<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     2.  Given Critical Hits with bows  -  that&#39;s a no brainer - even<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; though warriors cover all weapons<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     3.  Given Slightly Higher Caps on certain combat skills - making them<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at least similar, but lower, to the other combat classes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     4.  Given +4 SV against fire and cold - does this really matter,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seriously =)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That&#39;s it..<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     Sure I have track, but so do druids and bards.  Problem is, when all<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the quests and locations for MOBs are published on the internet, who needs<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that skill anymore.  I remember Brad saying that he wanted to make Rangers<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the masters of duel wield... well how bout increasing our percentages for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh well...   =) Lance<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       After the recent upgrade to the Ranger, Paladins were certain that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       next for enhancement. We waited patiently for the patch that was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supposed to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       be our salvation. Instead, what we received was armor quests that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were 10<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       times the length and 5 times more costly than any of the quest of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any other<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       class. And for all of that the armor stinks. Class specific plate<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; armor for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       the Paladin has less AC than that of the chain worn by the ranger.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Paladins<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       are the &quot;Holy Knight&quot; counterpart to the ranger. Yet, with the last<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       patches, the Ranger has been augmented so that he has more AC even<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; though he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       can wear no platemail. He also has higher skill caps, does nearly<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; twice the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       damage in battle, has spell equivalents to most of the Paladins<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spells yet<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       not confined to undead. Ensnare is far more effective that root.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Several<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       other spells and buffs of the druid class aren&#39;t nerfed , level<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wise, as with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       the paladin. The ranger can track. Whereas the paladin can point<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; himself in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       the direction of the nearest undead, unless of course if there is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pet in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       the area. Now to the arguements.<br/>
