<div id="ygrps-yiv-664417664">Hey Mike and welcome!<br>
<br>
there is a group or list (I haven&#39;t done much with it lately) but it&#39;s
something like Everquest Meetup (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.meetup.com/">http://everquest.meetup.com/</a> I
believethats the URL) <br>
<br>
So give us a little more info, What server, whats your current toon, act. <br>
<br>
I play on the Bristlebane server and have a Ranger (Main), mage, Druid,
Cleric, Warrior and Beast Lord. Main&#39;s in her 50&#39;s and the others are
22 - 30.<br>
<br>
(Thinking about it, if i could log all of them on at once I&#39;d have a heck of a group!) LOL<br>
