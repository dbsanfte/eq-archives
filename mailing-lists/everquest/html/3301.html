<div id="ygrps-yiv-1149358588">What might also be good is add a new class of guilds. <br/>
Say, &quot;Fellowships&quot;. The formal guilds could be loaded with management <br/>
functions. Fellowships would more like informal bodies of people who <br/>
wish to help each other out, but don&#39;t need lots of management tools <br/>
and don&#39;t want to have to fulfill raid obligations and such. Just a <br/>
name to identify with, and guildchat and such.<br/>

&gt; Hmm.. Yeah, guildfunding would make sense if it was somehow <br/>
implemented in<br/>
&gt; the game. Probably would have as much priority as oh, say making it <br/>
so<br/>
&gt; players can be merchants in the Bazaar. *g*<br/>
&gt; It would be nice if they could set up a system like that. Maybe we <br/>
should<br/>
&gt; feedback it. :-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I agree with Su on giving and such but I think Alex<br/>
&gt; &gt; was just stating managing monies and such.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Maybe a good thread would be<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Ideas on managing Guild Money!&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Verant should actually consider this topic in new<br/>
&gt; &gt; releases since it encourages grouping and Guild are<br/>
&gt; &gt; the best facilitator for that trait.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ive got a question for the list.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Its around the account is personal and cant be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; exchanged with outhers bla<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bla. I do agree very much that you shall keep your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; account safe and all<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this, but in a large scale operations guild its<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; IMPOSSIBLE to not share<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; account with a few people that you trust. This is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; essential to day to day<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; operations. You choose a couple of people who you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; trust and hand them your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; info.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Actually it is not impossible. Sharing account info<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is a way to get your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; guild banned from the game.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1 example. Guild property and funding. A single<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; person cannot manage the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trades/funds/hand out of items for the guild. This<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; would be a full time<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; job<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for 1 person in my guild. Our solution is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; separate account shared among<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the officers with mules for cash / gems / spells /<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; items. On our<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; messageboard transactions take place and a member<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; can ask any officer to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; complete a transaction once its validated on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; board. This is clearly<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; against<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the EULA but since there are no support for these<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; types of operations with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; central store for a guild we have not found a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; better way to handle work<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; like<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this. How do others solve these types of problems?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; See, we don&#39;t keep an armory in my guild. We used to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have one but the person<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; who had all the stuff either stopped playing or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; switched to a different<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; server so nobody could get the stuff.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Rather than having an armory, we help other members<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; obtain items if we can.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We believe that people should earn the items they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; get and they can either<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; buy them off of another member or we help them to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; obtain it. In some cases<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; items are given to members but it all depends on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; individual players and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; what they like to do. We don&#39;t like begging and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t want to encourage it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in our guild.<br/>
