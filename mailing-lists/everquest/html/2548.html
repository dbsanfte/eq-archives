<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244527536">Heh. Yeah. I&#39;ve found that being friendly with people is profitable. I don&#39;t<br/>
do it for money, I like to be nice and joke with people. The other day some<br/>
guy gave me 100pp just for emoting something.<br/>
And high lvl druids have been nice to my druid. One walked up and gave her a<br/>
bunch of armor, a Forest Loop, and a wraithbone hammer!<br/>
Very sweet of him.<br/>
luv,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Well, a FS Scimitar or War Hammer are good choices when you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; starting out.  There just aren&#39;t a lot of places to get it the GF<br/>
&gt; area.  Another option are the Frozen or Velium weapons coming out of<br/>
&gt; Velious.  I&#39;ve seen them for as little as 10 PP, and sometimes people<br/>
&gt; just give them away!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any Avatar I&#39;ve started in GF or BB has always done the CB belt quest<br/>
&gt; as many times as possible.  You have to load up and go see the<br/>
&gt; Dwarves, then sell any armor and weapons you don&#39;t want.  Also,<br/>
&gt; people do buy them, and if you can sneak into Crushbone you can clean<br/>
&gt; up.  Some people can&#39;t be bothered with them and will just leave them<br/>
&gt; around.  Make sure to ask unless there&#39;s nobody nearby.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And, since I assume you are one of those cute little Wood Elf Druids<br/>
&gt; just flirt a little and all those big Warriors will fall all over<br/>
&gt; themselves to help you out! I know I would!  LOL<br/>
