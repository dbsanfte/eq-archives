<b>Subject:</b> RE: [EverQuest] First time player <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391886678">OK OK,  I was playing &quot;casually&quot; for a bulk of the time.  New<br/>
business..personal BS...blah blah blah.  But generally I was working on<br/>
Fletching and exploring as many places as I could.  But consider this.<br/>
After all of that time exploring  and learning about the game I became able<br/>
to start a new character and level him to 26 in about two weeks of playing.<br/>
Not bad me thinks.  Playing casually makes it hard to gain levels.  Spend<br/>
too much time travelling and looking for groups etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Playing full time now though! YAY!<br/>
