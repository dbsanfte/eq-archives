<div id="ygrps-yiv-132385894">Should be a huge difference. The Ti is only bettered by the new <br/>
Radion. The Mx is just a hotrod Gforce2. I have the Mx only because I <br/>
don&#39;t have an agp slot on my Emachine. Had to get the best pci I <br/>
could, which was the Mx.<br/>

Probably the greatest difference you will see is in lag. Line lag it <br/>
can&#39;t help, but lag internal to your system is. With the 64mb memory <br/>
you won&#39;t get the same performance as the 128, as more memory is the <br/>
key to better eq. Still, you should see an improvement.<br/>

&gt;     I have a question for you all.  I am picking up a GeForce4 TI <br/>
4200 64 mb video card and I was wondering how much of a difference <br/>
that was from a GeForce4 MX440 04 mb video card.  Will I see much of <br/>
a difference?  I was just wondering about that because I remember a <br/>
while back a discussion about the cards on this board before.  Well I <br/>
would apperciate any comments on this topic.  according to the <br/>
manufacturer did say theis card did better than thier 128 mb version <br/>
of the same card due to the clock speed of the ram.  Just what i have <br/>
heard. </span></blockquote></div>
