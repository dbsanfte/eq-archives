<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388114495">Ok some pointers to this class discussion.<br/>
<br/>
On all large encounters you are required to have multiple clerics, almost<br/>
certain multiple warriors, one bard, one shaman, one enchanter and then<br/>
classes with damage output. If you have a lower amount of clerics, add x<br/>
number of mages for modrods or necros for manafeeds.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, a mix of most classes is needed in the raiding world, but some classes<br/>
you cant do without or need multiple. There isnt a single highend guild that<br/>
doesnt have more then 5 clerics online for a big encounter and also several<br/>
warriors. But the way the high end game is you need a warrior with defensive<br/>
tanking big mobs. trying to use anything other as tank in the long run is<br/>
futile. <br/>
<br/>
Ill give you a math example. The avatar of War hits for 1350 max. He quads.<br/>
He kicks for 250. He flurrys. That gives a maximum of 10650hps in one<br/>
round...... Not even the best equipped tank in eq has this amount of hps.<br/>
With defensive discipline cut 40% of that damage. Still a considerable<br/>
amount of damage taken each round. There are several other examples i could<br/>
bring up here, but i think you get the point. Nothing can replace the<br/>
tankability a warrior has. Some fights you are needed to handle multiple<br/>
incs and even though they dont have the output of aow its still a<br/>
considerable amount of damage that needs to be handled each round. <br/>
<br/>
Clerics and Warriors are needed in numbers on raids. Then some<br/>
buff/debuffers and then some mix of other damagedealing classes. Sometimes<br/>
casters are better , sometimes melees are better. <br/>
<br/>
And btw I play a bard. I do just about 4 things on raids. On inc, i do<br/>
occlusion of sound for debuffing. I do manasong, on certain mobs i do<br/>
damageshield, on some i do resists. This is what i do. And apply some damage<br/>
but in no way near the figures a damagedealing class can do. And yes, my<br/>
gear is ok. We normally use 2 bards on raids. one making clerics/casters<br/>
feeling comfy, one doing resists/ds. Thats as many as you need really. You<br/>
cant hit any mob at all in the range were fighting with 2 clerics... So<br/>
theres never a shortage of bards on raids while shortage of clerics and<br/>
warriors do happen for us. <br/>

&gt; Yeah the three classes that are &quot;tanks&quot; are Warriors, Paladins<br/>
&gt; and Shadowknights.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I guess it depends on if you want to play an important role in epic<br/>
&gt; encounters or be able to solo well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The classes that seem to be really important in epic encounters are<br/>
&gt;  the warrior(defensive), cleric(complete heal), enchanter(haste and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>clarity),<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; rogue(melee damage), wizard(magic damage) and bard(resistance buffs).<br/>
&gt; The other classes are better if you want to play mostly by yourself,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>explore,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; camp items, do quests, and just generally have fun.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is the kinda thing that gives people the wrong impression about<br/>
classes.  Shaman are extremely important to a raid, from slowing a mob to<br/>
giving melee some excellent stat buffs.  High level Rangers put out obscene<br/>
amounts of damage and are able to tank mobs that aggro on casters, while<br/>
being about to almost immedialely reduce aggro when needed.  Mages are<br/>
excellent for mana regen (mod rods) and CotH.  Druids are excellent<br/>
secondary healers on raid, throwing in heals between CHs.  Monks and SK&#39;s<br/>
are excellent indoor pullers (breaking Fear is terribly hard without a Monk<br/>
or SK to scout).<br/>
<br/>
There really isn&#39;t one single class that is not needed in a raid situation.<br/>
