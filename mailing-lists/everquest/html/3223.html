<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Looking for Xakra Bile & rockhopper blood <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459341589"><p>Ahhh,&nbsp;&nbsp; that is a problem I know well.&nbsp; you have to just keep killing them (the blood &amp; Bile are fairly rare drops).. to get the young rockhoppers to spawn,&nbsp; you have to kill either the scorpions or the whiptail scorpions,&nbsp;&nbsp;and I think you have to kill the&nbsp;rhinobeetle hatchlings&nbsp;to get the xakra larvae to spawn...&nbsp; it is truly a pain in the behind to get the Items needed for that quest.&nbsp; It would be MUCH easier if the Items were not no drop.&nbsp;
