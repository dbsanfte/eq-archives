<div>I had a yahoo site of an EQ based story I was writing but I deleted that cause I stopped after chapter 5.&nbsp; I still have the drafts at my desk and that one I would be pleased to type up and email out to the list if peeps are interested.</div>

 to be hybernating.&nbsp; All 8 slots<br>&gt; filled for my server.&nbsp; Alt mains (as I call them):<br>&gt; Yissia Hissnpounce - 27 Berserker<br>&gt; Starnova Daemonhart - 29 Wizard<br>&gt; Kairii Ragingfire - 25 monk<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Real self<br>&gt; My name is Celena but friends call me Lena.&nbsp; I live<br>&gt; in<br>&gt; Virginia Beach, VA and am a 21 year old female. <br>&gt; Still<br>&gt; in college slowly working to my associates for<br>&gt; Network<br>&gt; Engineering.<br>&gt; I have been into gaming since I was about 6 years<br>&gt; old.<br>&gt;&nbsp; My dad then bought me and my brother (then 3) a<br>&gt; Nintendo System.&nbsp; Whoo.. we were so happy but what<br>&gt; child probably wasn&#39;t to have one of those back<br>&gt; then. <br>&gt; I could never really pass a normal RPG game.&nbsp; Came<br>&gt; close to beating Mario 3 before but never succeeded.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I used to just give up on them.&nbsp; I have played games<br>&gt; from many systems including
 your table-top dice<br>&gt; games.<br>&gt;&nbsp; When my dad got me my computer at age 14 I became<br>&gt; more glued to PC games.&nbsp; Never had an online game<br>&gt; until after high school.&nbsp; I constantly saw EQ on the<br>&gt; shelf in many stores and one of my friends noticed<br>&gt; me<br>&gt; always looking at the game everytime we went to<br>&gt; stores.&nbsp; So xmas of 2001 I ended up with EQ trilogy<br>&gt; and Luclin.&nbsp; Been playing since May of 2002 (had to<br>&gt; upgrade system before I could play).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Now I am gonna stop blabbing and again say hello<br>&gt; again<br>&gt; to allof you out there.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Lena<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; =====<br>&gt; &quot;Yes, I am a ranger&quot;<br>&gt; &quot;Good.&nbsp; I have a task for you&quot; *whispers to the elf*<br>&gt; &quot;You want me to be WHAT!!!!&quot;<br>&gt; *The Dwarf nods*<br>&gt; &quot;Thats suicide!&quot;<br>&gt; &quot;No I will not be your bait to that dreadful dragon!<br>&gt;&nbsp; Find someone else.&nbsp; Like maybe a human
