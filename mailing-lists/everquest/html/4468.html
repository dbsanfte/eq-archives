<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Perhaps you people can help me.&nbsp; This is 
something I&#39;ve pondered for awhile.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">My rogue is level 32.&nbsp; I play him 
infrequently.&nbsp; At level 30 rogues get all the skills they are going to 
get.&nbsp; Rogues are non-casters so they don&#39;t have new spells to look forward 
to.&nbsp; The only things rogues have to look forward to are their disciplines 
at level 50.&nbsp; So how does one get from level 30 to level 50 in the shortest 
amount of time possible?&nbsp; Whenever I play, it seems like I always have a 
hard time finding a group.&nbsp; I&#39;m looking in places like Frontier Mountains, 
The Overthere, and Dawnshroud Peaks.&nbsp; I&#39;m not high enough level that I can 
easily solo any mobs in either of those zones. But nobody seems to want to 
group.&nbsp; So are there any zones where I can get quick xp by soloing?&nbsp; 
Or are there other zones I could try for groups?&nbsp; </font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I hate for my rogue to fall by the way side because 
he&#39;s become a bore to play.&nbsp; So any suggestions you have for playing rogue 
characters to help me out would be appreciated.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Thanks in advance.</font></div>
