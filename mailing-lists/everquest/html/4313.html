Giants in Rathe Mountains also drop good loot. XP kinda sucks there but the<br/>
money is good.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I agree... lets drop it. No need to fight, especially over a little<br/>
&gt; misunderstanding. I can, however, see how many of you would jump to your<br/>
&gt; defenses... I was not aware that there have been a few scammers in the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>group<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; in the past. Sorry for jumping to conclusions. Oh, and thanks for fixing<br/>
&gt; that little problem with the auto. messages, Su. It was getting annoying,<br/>
&gt; LOL. To whoever it was that is seeking platnum... although it&#39;s very hard,<br/>
&gt; you could kill giants in the Frontier Mountains. Some of them drop Forest<br/>
&gt; Loops that sell for 300 platnum. However, like I said, it&#39;s rare that they<br/>
&gt; drop them, but I have looted one from before. It just takes patience,<br/>
&gt; although the experience sucks... it did for me anyway.<br/>
