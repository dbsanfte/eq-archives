<div id="ygrps-yiv-432946303"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I was told they did away with this feature but I found<br/>
&gt;a workaround myself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you load the luclin images BUT use the old UI, you<br/>
&gt;can hit inventory and then hit the face button.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What&#39;s UI stand for? I tried what you suggested below and it actually <br/>
worked! I adjusted my face and waited forever for my character to save. Then <br/>
my face stayed the same through multiple zones! And it&#39;s finely correct on <br/>
the character selection screen! However, my inventory picture is still <br/>
black!? I guess I&#39;ll just go to tech support chat...<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Remove head gear/masks. Pick your desired features<br/>
&gt; &gt; using the /face command. Force a character save.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Zone into another area, still without head gear.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Check yourself, you should be &quot;yourself&quot;. If<br/>
&gt; &gt; not...start over and try again. If you are okay,<br/>
&gt; &gt; then you should be okay and can put back on head<br/>
&gt; &gt; gear/masks. Remember, this is if it&#39;s happening to<br/>
&gt; &gt; you only.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Let us know if this works.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If I&#39;m totally misunderstanding what you meant,<br/>
&gt; &gt; smack me upside the head and speak slowly. :p<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also a Rob :)<br/>
