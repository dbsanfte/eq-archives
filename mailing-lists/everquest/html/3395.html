The bazaar is a really kewl place ... as long as there&#39;s not too many<br/>
people there :-)<br/>
<br/>
Satchels cost a little under 2 plat and they hold 10 items.  You can buy<br/>
as many satchels as you like, but remember that folks can only see the<br/>
first 30 items you have for sale.  I&#39;ve got a bunch of satchels in the<br/>
bank for storage space.  You have to activate every item you want to<br/>
sell specifically, so you an use the satchels for anything.  They do<br/>
weigh a tonne (practically) so the bank is the only useful use for them<br/>
outside of the bazaar.<br/>
<br/>
Oh a side note .. there is no weight penalty to movement rate in the<br/>
bazaar.  So you can safely haul around 3 (or more) of those 25 WT<br/>
satchels!<br/>
<br/>
You get the satchels from the first merchant on the right in the big<br/>
building between the 2 banks.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>
<br/>
Oh .. and takeout is a wonderful thing :-)<br/>
