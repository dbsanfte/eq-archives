<b>Subject:</b> New guild forming up on Bertoxx <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938516810">A new &quot;evil&quot; guild is forming up this Saturday (August 14th 9:30PM EST - <br/>
Eastern) on Bertoxxulous, and founding members are still being recruited. <br/>
Ogres, trolls, dark elves, euridites, and humans (based upon class) are <br/>
being accepted. The guild highly encourages roleplaying, but is not <br/>
necessary. We are banding together as a tightknit and elite group, to enable <br/>
a diversified &quot;pool&quot; from which we can form hunting parties of trustworthy <br/>
individuals, for the purposes of advancing our guild objectives, and <br/>
ourselves (in level, stature, power, wealth, in character, out of character <br/>
etc.) If interested, please email inquiries to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:templarknights@...">templarknights@...</a></div>
