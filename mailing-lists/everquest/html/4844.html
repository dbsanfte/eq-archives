<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-595873875">Hehehe, I know what you are going thru, I went to visit a friend and I <br/>
couldn&#39;t play on my account for a month (hubby was playing all the <br/>
time).  I was so crazy for EQ I made characters on her account.  Read <br/>
forums if you can&#39;t get enough EQ from the books you have. <br/>
EQtraders.com has good tradeskills discussions if you are interested in <br/>
them, eqlive.station.sony.com has the &#39;official&#39; forums, <br/>
everquest.allakhazam.com has forums for EQ and many other games too, <br/>
eg.crgaming.com/forums is still working as of last night even though the <br/>
main Caster&#39;s Realm site has been down.<br/>
And there&#39;s also newsgroups, alt.games.everquest is the active one, if <br/>
you can&#39;t get newsgroups on your email client (I use netscape&#39;s client) <br/>
  try groups.google.com, you have to make an account to post but you can <br/>
read the postings without one.  I get alot of EQ info out of that group. <br/>
  If you use google, there will be alot of spam, just ignore it, DO NOT <br/>
reply to any of them, you won&#39;t make any friends in the group that way. <br/>
  Also basic newsgroup ettiquette:  the posting snobs (not me) will get <br/>
upset if you top-post; never ever use HTML to post, plain text only; <br/>
anything OT, plainly mark OT or the aforementioned snobs will get upset <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and get home safely<br/>

Hello me again lol.  Yeah I&#39;d love to go to all those forums and websites,<br/>
only problem is there is no internet on this ship.  I got lucky in Bahrain<br/>
when we had internet on the ship for a couple days and I was able to have<br/>
this ship email address registered in Yahoo.  Hopefully we&#39;ll  have internet<br/>
again sometime in our ports and I&#39;ll be able to check out some of those<br/>
forums and sites, until then I got my books to sustain me lol.  Well talk to<br/>
you later! <br/>
