<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819277262">The only thing that I can remember is that you can play a monster instead of your character. It said you can group with friends lower level than you by playing a monster that is in their level range while getting xp for your character.<br/>
I really wish they would focus on fixing the memory leaks and get rid of damage misreporting instead of making a new expansion.<br/>
