<div id="ygrps-yiv-162710538">I&#39;d play there as an alt server...something to do when my main server is<br/>
down or no one&#39;s on and I can&#39;t find anything appealing to do.<br/>
<br/>
As for main server? No way. I&#39;m not exactly uber and by no means spoiled,<br/>
but I clawed my way OUT of having cruddy gear and not having 2 CP to rub<br/>
together. I wouldn&#39;t choose to return to it as more than a way to kill time.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hey Kids...Been gone awhile...been busy..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, in talking to my old EQ chums and with what I read on the<br/>
&gt; websites, there is/has been some talk about SOE making a &quot;classic&quot;<br/>
&gt; server.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now the &quot;classic&quot; server would be EQ prior to PoP, no adds or toys,<br/>
&gt; with the exception of the stuff necessary. This would mean no PoK, no<br/>
&gt; Guild Lobby, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Knowing that many of you have been here since around Beta or just after<br/>
&gt; and that most of you can honestly say &quot; I remember when... or Back in<br/>
&gt; the Day we had to run from X t Y and it was 4 day run....&quot;; I am<br/>
&gt; curious to know if any of you kids would use such a server, or have you<br/>
&gt; all become stuck on how things are now that going back to the old way<br/>
&gt; would kill the game for you?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As always, but now just plainly nosey..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
