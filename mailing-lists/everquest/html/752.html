<div id="ygrps-yiv-219493184">Well, this is probably just being caused by random rolls, and even if it<br/>
isnt, his better spell-casting abilities you talked about would be better.<br/>
Don&#39;t worry about melee damage, after 25 or so I rarely used it, and if you<br/>
really wanted to you could give it up after 14 or so. Also you said you used<br/>
cracked staves, consider switching to 1hs and 2hb, then 1hb if you have<br/>
time. At higher levels 1hs is much better for druids then 1hb.<br/>
