<div id="ygrps-yiv-992259342">Maybe they&#39;re going thru a growth spurt.  Having too many people logging in<br/>
and whatnot.  I also noticed last night that when a server goes down, the<br/>
newbie count goes WAY up as people switch over to another server for a bit<br/>
just so they can keep playing.  On PVP, that means a LOT of resources taken<br/>
up for the corpse count at the newbie entrance.  At least outside of Qeynos<br/>
it was that way, must&#39;ve been over 30 bodies laying on the ground outside<br/>
of the entrance to Qeynos.<br/>

<br/>
My husband and I kept going LD last night and that&#39;s what it was doing when<br/>
we tried to sign back on.  Computer #1 is P2-350 256 meg ram, Windows ME,<br/>
40<br/>
gig HD, 8x burner.  Computer #2 is Celeron 533, 192 meg ram, 10 gig HD,<br/>
Windows ME.  Both are on cable modem using ICS.  We finally gave up because<br/>
of the lag and linkdead problems and then trying to get signed back into<br/>
game.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is it just me, or is it taking longer and longer to connect?  I couldn&#39;t<br/>
even get past the login screen for 5 or 10 minutes.  Kept saying that it<br/>
couldn&#39;t connect to login server.  Never had that happen unless it was down<br/>
for a patch (which it wasn&#39;t).  Also noticed that the times when I choose<br/>
my server, and going to the character screen, and the time from the<br/>
character screen to the game are much longer.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m running a Celeron 533 w/ 185 MB ram, windows ME a cable modem, and<br/>
about 2GB of drive space for windows to write to.  Any suggestions?<br/>
