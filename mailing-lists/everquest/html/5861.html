<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083514617">The one who I think can hold aggro better, unless the difference is huge.<br/>
200 HPs in BoT for example is completely trivial, so is 25 more ac...I&#39;m<br/>
going to make the call based on who&#39;s not going to bounce the mob around and<br/>

&gt; Hail all!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve got a question for you all..say your the group leader and you have 2<br/>
&gt; tanks.  You compare them to see who is going to be the Main Tank and one<br/>
&gt; tank has more hit points than the other, but the other has more AC.  Who<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; you choose to be the Main Tank, the guy with more hit points, or AC?<br/>
