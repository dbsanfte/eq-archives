<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-236461036"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Any higher level tailors out there? I am lvl 70 in tailoring, and<br/>
&gt; working toward making Halfling tailored and imbued armor. I am a<br/>
&gt; level 29 halfling druid, able so far to brew and smith the various<br/>
&gt; parts I have needed to make my reinforced leather armor. I am soon to<br/>
&gt; be off to Kunark to obtain my brute hides. Anyone been a brute<br/>
&gt; hunter, who can give me any advice?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. Make sure you have camo memmed. FM is very very nasty. The brutes con<br/>
blue to my lvl 35 cleric. And they hit fairly hard. The main problem with<br/>
hunting them is the possibility of ads. So you will need to harmony.<br/>
Snare would be helpful. kiting would be dangerous in FM bc of ads.<br/>
Especially the larger ones. I suggest that if you enter FM from LoIO you go<br/>
left rather than right to hunt. over to the right are goblin casters. I<br/>
didn&#39;t see goblins casters much over to the left.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; What minimum level shall I need to succeed in brute hunting? And what<br/>
&gt; sources for the high quality ore? I am not a good dungeon fighter,<br/>
&gt; especially solo. Runnyeye is a bit much without a good group, and so<br/>
&gt; far I have not found good groups for that fun place. Any suggestions<br/>
&gt; for the getting of the required ore? Any other places it drops?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>High quality ore drops off of pickclaw warriors and raiders in<br/>
Highpass/Highkeep (I can never keep it straight which is called which). You<br/>
would need a group at your level. Since you are a druid, people would really<br/>
want you in group there. Sow can be cast. And if you have regen and other<br/>
beneficial spells they will love you. Especially since you can heal. If you<br/>
have coin to spend, go to highkeep and auction to buy high quality ore.<br/>
There are usually some players who will part with it. I think the small<br/>
bricks go for around 5pp and the large bricks around 10pp.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Do the metal pieces used in the halfling armor have to also be made<br/>
&gt; of hq ore, or just the sewing kit? The sites I have visited are not<br/>
&gt; all that clear on that one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know on that one.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Good hunting, everyone!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You too!<br/>
luv,<br/>
