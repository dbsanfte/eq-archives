<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234856207"><p>It seems to me that several people on the board need to quit jumping to conclusions and give people a chance.&nbsp; I have seen many more flames &amp; rudness in recent weeks from many of you,&nbsp; and it is distressing that we seem to be nit picking at others because of their opionions. I thought the point of this group was to share our love of EQ with eachother, rather than flaming &amp; accusing because of personal opionions.&nbsp; We are all entitled to our own opionions, and I am just expressing mine.

<p>I confess, I was wrong to flat out go out and accuse you of such things. WHo knows, maybe you&#39;ll be able to proove the stereotype wrong, and stop the madness :) 
<p>BTW, as for TechTV in general, man I wish that I had that channel. ANy chance of it going&nbsp;into basic cable?&nbsp;
