<div id="ygrps-yiv-618559902">I visited EQ Traders Corner (www.eqtraders.com) yesterday, and there was a<br/>
message from the cartoonist saying that GU Comics had been discontinued as<br/>
of August 29. The archives were still available, though. I agree, it was a<br/>
great comic.<br/>

&gt; Hey, does anyone know what&#39;s up with the Everquest-based comic<br/>
&gt; GuComics.com? For a week or so now their page has been down and now<br/>
&gt; it looks like the name isn&#39;t registered anymore. That was my favorite<br/>
&gt; online comic next to Penny Arcade and I really want to know what<br/>
&gt; happened! Anyone?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
