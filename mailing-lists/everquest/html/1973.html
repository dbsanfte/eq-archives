<div id="ygrps-yiv-431526292">Hardware is fairly inexpensive these days.  If your into computers and games<br/>
in particular you will have to stay slightly ahead of the curve.  Currently<br/>
you can pick up memory pretty cheap..  I got mine from googlegear.com.. They<br/>
have 512megs of memory for as low as 60$  Keep in mind that only a few years<br/>
ago that could have cost you up to 1$ per meg.  Besides they released the<br/>
requirements for Luclin months ago, there was time to upgrade prior.  You<br/>
can still certainly play the previous Everquest as well as the prior<br/>
expansions without changing much if anything.. If it&#39;s the directx 8<br/>
problem, you can pick up compatiable cards (geforce2 MXs) for as low as 35$.<br/>

Old puters work just fine. The only problem you have is that your video card<br/>
*MUST* be dx8 certified. Other than that even going as low as 128 megs will<br/>
work. There is not the slightest chance in hell you can install luclin on<br/>
that machine tho, cause it will die while trying to render the new graphics.<br/>
<br/>
And you should really get more ram, it isnt that expensive. Ram and a nice<br/>
video card and everything works a lot smoother. CPU power isnt that<br/>
important.<br/>
<br/>
512mb for $100 isnt steep. And your machine needs to be nicely configured.<br/>
For example if you run WinXP old world eq and me would be like 256 megs to<br/>
run ok but on 98 128 works ok and 160 is fine.<br/>
<br/>
And dont be so negative, SoL is a whopping expansion worth the new specs.<br/>
Graphics are cool (some char models are a bit weird) but mobs/surrondings<br/>
are very nice. The mob features are a LOT improved adding more tactics to<br/>
fights. <br/>

I honestly don&#39;t know.<br/>
I am hoping (as do some of the GMs) that they will make it so that<br/>
non-Luclin users can still play without having to upgrade. But for the time<br/>
being, if your computer does not meet the minimum system requirements that<br/>
Verant listed, it will probably not work-- even people who&#39;s computers *do*<br/>
meet the minimum requirements are having problems right now. We&#39;ll just have<br/>
to wait and see. luv, -Su<br/>
