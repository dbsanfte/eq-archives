<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-547702530">I would encourage you to work on all your skills,<br/>
you&#39;ll not be sorry!  The epic is two 1hs weapons.  Of<br/>
all the skills for my 30 Warrior, I&#39;ve enjoyed the 1hs<br/>
the most due to the duel wield we get at 13, and then<br/>
double attack at 15 makes it even more fun! <br/>
<br/>
However, I&#39;ve come across some wonderful bargains for<br/>
2hb and 2hs weapons that had amazing stats and were<br/>
limited to warrior only or just a few other classes<br/>
and sellers kept discouting the prices due to having a<br/>
limited market.  I landed a really fun 2hb weapon with<br/>
super stats and some haste for a few hundred plat.  I<br/>
was forced to work on my 2hb then, but it&#39;s been worth<br/>
it!  <br/>
<br/>
I know a lot of melee classes that will switch out a<br/>
weapon they aren&#39;t as skilled in during groups,<br/>
especially when the situation is well under control<br/>
and there are more than one melee to help taunt.  This<br/>
provides an excellent opportunity to help work on<br/>
those skills!<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m currently leveling up a little warrior myself.<br/>
&gt; Even though it makes fighting at a young age tough,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m working on all her weapon skills. As a result,<br/>
&gt; they are all fairly low right now. But I feel that<br/>
&gt; later on it will be worth it. My RL boyfriend plays<br/>
&gt; a warrior as his main and at lvl 51, he&#39;s only good<br/>
&gt; at a couple of weapon skills. He&#39;s the one who told<br/>
&gt; me to train in all weapon skills since you find some<br/>
&gt; nice weapons later in the game.<br/>

&gt; would like your<br/>
&gt; opinion on the following:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I started wondering why I was not hitting that much<br/>
&gt; with him even though he has a good weapon. After<br/>
&gt; some<br/>
&gt; research, I found that the reason I am not hitting<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; much as others is because I have been switching<br/>
&gt; between 2HS and 1HS weapons to increase the skills<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; each attribute.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Example: My skill in both is 25, let&#39;s say and my<br/>
&gt; attack is at like 152.  If I were to just use 1HS<br/>
&gt; let&#39;s say, my ATK rating would be like close to 300.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have proved this because now that I am using the<br/>
&gt; 1HS<br/>
&gt; more, the skill is close to 30 and my ATK rating is<br/>
&gt; close to 200 where with a 2HS weapon, it is still at<br/>
&gt; 152.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Would you continue to alternate both weapon types or<br/>
&gt; would you just pick one and go with it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; THanks<br/>
