<b>Subject:</b> New server? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178874254">I&#39;ve heard rumors of a new server, and that it will be PK w/ a twist.<br/>
Would the twist be faction hits for whatever type of player you kill?  That<br/>
would be a really good feature, and cut down on all the PKing you see in<br/>
that players home town.  Well, until the guards got KOS to you.</div>
