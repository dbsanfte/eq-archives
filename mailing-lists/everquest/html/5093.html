&gt; Yes, certain areas give you a bonus.  It applies to all experience<br/>
&gt; gained in that zone.  They&#39;re mostly dungeon type zones.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi, everybody.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; This might be a stupid newbie question, but maybe someone might be<br/>
&gt; willing<br/>
&gt; &gt; to answer it for me: I noticed on EQAtlas.com that a few dungeon<br/>
&gt; zones are<br/>
&gt; &gt; listed as having an experience bonus (usually listed as 13% when it<br/>
&gt; &gt; applies). Can anyone tell me how this works? Or is it as I assume<br/>
&gt; and it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; an XP bonus for each kill made in that zone?<br/>
