  This cave is not completely undiscovered, I believe this is where you find the giant zweihander, I think it is off that necro, you need a group of high level 30&#39;s to pull it off too.. <br/>

    If you head north where the river comes to the mountain, take a look thru the ice and you will see the cave.  Sometimes you will see a goblin swimming at the mouth of the cave.  The cave itself is inside the mountain, so as you swim it will eventauly open up above the surface of the water. <br/>
<br/>
    I believe that the NPC Necro&#39;s con was aggressive and he was red at lvl 16.  Be careful when approaching him.  BTW there is very little light, and it is a maze ( oh what fun... hehe) <br/>
<br/>
    I never zoned so i dont believe its a new zone, just undiscovered..  the cave itself is quite large (or it seemed that way) but was relativly empty. This is what i saw: <br/>
<br/>
    1.. House with 4 icebone skeletons <br/>
    2.. Shrine ( zone point )structure protected by 2 icebones skeletons <br/>
    3.. Human NPC Necromancer with pet  - red at lvl 16 <br/>
    4.. Possible Giant.. (type unknown) - I never saw one myself <br/>
<br/>
    And, there could be more to the cave that went unexplored, because i had no way of passing the Necro at the time. I was informed of the cave by a fellow player.  She stated that she had seen a giant, but alass i have not. <br/>
<br/>
    Good Luck </span></blockquote></div>
