<div id="ygrps-yiv-594966682"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; The feature I dislike is Research.  It amounts to no more than going<br/>
&gt; to hundreds of vendors, over and over again to find a page, or words<br/>
&gt; or rune, buy it and then have it fail when you try to make the<br/>
&gt; spell.  The idea is to have you kill mobs for it.....but the mobs<br/>
&gt; are allways higher level, and rarely drop it when you want it.  By<br/>
&gt; the time you get the pages or runes you need for your 16th level<br/>
&gt; spell......you&#39;re 32nd level.  So you have to buy them, at inflated<br/>
&gt; prices, and thats IF you can find them.  Then after going thru all<br/>
&gt; that....poof...it fails, and you have to start all over again.  A<br/>
&gt; stupid idea.  Why not have the spells drop off certin mobs like a<br/>
&gt; quest, so then peeps will camp them, oh my, don&#39;t have a good<br/>
&gt; soultion, but current one is not fun.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree. I never did research with my wizard bc I started it and it was a<br/>
royal pain so I gave up. Maybe they could do it much like ethereal<br/>
parchments where you get a specific type of item and turn it in to an npc<br/>
for faction, xp, and either a spell or a particular page or something for<br/>
the research. Maybe you can say what page you need-- like when you tell the<br/>
guy near the muffin eating dwarf in Freeport that you want the wood bits or<br/>
something like that as part of the quest for the trueshot bow. Or maybe they<br/>
should have vendors that only buy things like pages and research items (like<br/>
the merchants in Morrowind that only buy certain types of items). What do<br/>
you think?<br/>
