<div id="ygrps-yiv-83282846"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Also, the 4 MX doesnt support DirectX 8.1. I agree, after all is said and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>done I was getting great &gt;frame rates off of the 4 MX with full clip plane<br/>
and 4x AA. I personally got the 4 Ti for 299.00 &gt;and I am hopeful this video<br/>
card will last me at least three years. My last card was a Geforce 2 &gt;MX<br/>
with only 32MB of ram so I was really in need of an upgrade.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve got an 2MX with 64mb. I run it with full clip plane. its working fine<br/>
for me. Better than the graphics cards I had before. Can&#39;t really say much<br/>
about my Voodoo3 since it was a defective card.<br/>
The waterfall in GD sounds really cool with my Acoustic Edge 5.1. I bought<br/>
it as soon as they had beta drivers for XP. It rocks.<br/>
