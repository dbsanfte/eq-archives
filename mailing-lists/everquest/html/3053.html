<div id="ygrps-yiv-980345905">My first character was a monk, got him to level 12, he was weak so I started<br/>
what is now my main. I have a level 20 Troll Sk. This guy is one bad mother<br/>
but he levels soooooo slow due to the xp penalties. I would recommend an SK<br/>
for a first character. My alt is a Level 11 Human Necro, this guy levels<br/>
about twice as fast as my SK, but I&#39;m STILL saving to get my lvl 8<br/>
spells.... Almost 5pp each.... I&#39;m gonna be lvl 12 before I buy any of my<br/>
lvl 8 spells (but I do believe my SK is gonna help in that area after he<br/>
buys his lvl 22 spells). Anyway, I&#39;m extremely happy with the SK and the<br/>
Necro, tho I believe you could get frustrated with the exp gain with the<br/>
race I chose for the SK.. The faction thing isn&#39;t too bad for the SK, your<br/>
home town likes you, I have banked in Ogguk (ogre city) and Neriak<br/>
(darkies), otherwise my base is usually in the auction house in EC. Just<br/>
have to remember if going to the guild in Neriak to cast invis against<br/>
undead or the ghouls will get ya... LOL! Plus, as a troll I pretty much have<br/>
to crawl through town, definitely in character cussing those little dark<br/>
SOB&#39;s that built their doorways too short and getting a few interesting<br/>
replies.<br/>

Another class that might be good is shadowknight. The drawbacks: Good races<br/>
won&#39;t want to sell to you and some may even want to kill you. If you play a<br/>
darkelf the newbie grounds completely and totally suck but you get pretty<br/>
cool armor when you can manage to find all the stuff you need for it. People<br/>
don&#39;t think of shadowknights when they think of tanks. They don&#39;t often<br/>
invite them to group. I don&#39;t think they get the spell &quot;gate&quot;.<br/>
The bonuses: You make a decent tank, you can summon a pet to tank for you<br/>
while you med, you can lifetap to heal yourself, and you get a spell that<br/>
snares and dots a mob at the same time. You can solo alot and are a good<br/>
asset to a group. Way later in the game you get to summon your own horse<br/>
called an Unholy Steed.<br/>
My brother started a shadowknight and got him to lvl 35 in 8 days.<br/>
<br/>
Paladins are welcome in all good cities. Don&#39;t usually have problems selling<br/>
to merchants. Get good damage, duel wield, disarm. Are thought of as tanks<br/>
and can get into group. Can also heal and buff. Can even resurrect. But they<br/>
cannot gate. They can solo pretty well with a good weapon and armor. There<br/>
are newbie paladin armor quests for humans and halfelves in freeport.<br/>
<br/>
Druids, not really great tanks but can snare/root and dot from afar. sucks<br/>
alot of mana. Sometimes they can charm an animal to attack a mob for them.<br/>
But then the animal turns and attacks them when charm wears off. They can<br/>
also track, port, and heal.<br/>
<br/>
If you like things to be more difficult, there&#39;s clerics. They can pretty<br/>
much get into any group because people always seem to want a healer. But<br/>
they can&#39;t really solo much and have alot of downtime from medding.<br/>
