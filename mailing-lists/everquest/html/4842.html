&gt; Subject: FW:  /shout Hello Everyone!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Hello everyone I&#39;m new to this club and my name is Ron and I&#39;m a EQ addict<br/>
&gt; lol.  I just thought I&#39;d introduce myself to everyone and give a little<br/>
&gt; background info about myself.  Well I&#39;ve been playing EQ for about 2 years<br/>
&gt; now and I love it.  I play on Ayonae Ro and my main is a 29 troll warrior<br/>
&gt; and I also have a 25 iksar necro, 12 human monk, and the rest of my<br/>
&gt; characters are just throw away ones, I wanted to experiment to see how the<br/>
&gt; different classes play like.  Well I&#39;m also in the navy out here in the gulf<br/>
&gt; and I&#39;m stationed in Everett, WA.  I haven&#39;t played EQ since March 2nd (we<br/>
&gt; left for westpac March 3rd) and I won&#39;t be able to play until we get back<br/>
&gt; sometime in middle November.  I have with me here on the ship just about<br/>
&gt; every EQ book/guide that came out lol from Kunark to Luclin to the EQ Atlas<br/>
&gt; and the EQ spellbook..I read them whenever I have EQ withdrawls (which is<br/>
&gt; everyday).  So yeah I just can&#39;t wait to come back to the states and play<br/>
&gt; again.  Well I guess I&#39;d better get going for now, take care everyone and<br/>
&gt; happy hunting!<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hehehe, I know what you are going thru, I went to visit a friend and I <br/>
couldn&#39;t play on my account for a month (hubby was playing all the <br/>
time).  I was so crazy for EQ I made characters on her account.  Read <br/>
forums if you can&#39;t get enough EQ from the books you have. <br/>
EQtraders.com has good tradeskills discussions if you are interested in <br/>
them, eqlive.station.sony.com has the &#39;official&#39; forums, <br/>
everquest.allakhazam.com has forums for EQ and many other games too, <br/>
eg.crgaming.com/forums is still working as of last night even though the <br/>
main Caster&#39;s Realm site has been down.<br/>
And there&#39;s also newsgroups, alt.games.everquest is the active one, if <br/>
you can&#39;t get newsgroups on your email client (I use netscape&#39;s client) <br/>
  try groups.google.com, you have to make an account to post but you can <br/>
read the postings without one.  I get alot of EQ info out of that group. <br/>
  If you use google, there will be alot of spam, just ignore it, DO NOT <br/>
reply to any of them, you won&#39;t make any friends in the group that way. <br/>
  Also basic newsgroup ettiquette:  the posting snobs (not me) will get <br/>
upset if you top-post; never ever use HTML to post, plain text only; <br/>
anything OT, plainly mark OT or the aforementioned snobs will get upset <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and get home safely</div>
