<div id="ygrps-yiv-987868057">IHey there!<br/>
    You know what, I think I saw you today (Queenscorpio) in PoK just <br/>
before I logged off for the day. LOL I do like the play on the astral <br/>
signs, thats pretty cool.<br/>
<br/>
    Hey, I&#39;m going to try and organize a small thing for this weekend <br/>
involving Nagafeen&#39;s Lair. Four of our Rangers (One is a little young <br/>
yet) need an item (a burnt sash) from there to get one of their lvl 50 <br/>
spells. It&#39;s not of a &quot;raid&quot; status but I tried it yesterday with a good <br/>
friend from Jaggedpine Defenders and we were just getting smoked in <br/>
there. What sucked most of all was that everything was light blue and <br/>
green at the beginning but they hit hard and fast and they respawned <br/>
fast too. So we just decided to get a group together hopefully this <br/>
weekend and try it. He had a monk as well and was there trying to get a <br/>
piece for his epic but we didn&#39;t have much luck.<br/>
<br/>
    So if you would like to join us this next weekend and maybe pick up <br/>
your item as well for your monk (If you don&#39;t already have it) you are <br/>
more than welcome to join us. It&#39;s still in the &quot;seeing who all is <br/>
available&quot; stage so I can&#39;t guarantee it will happen. If we can get <br/>
everyone there it looks like we will have the following 3 Rangers (2 for <br/>
sure), 2 Monks (including you if you want to join) and either a cleric <br/>
or mage.<br/>
<br/>
    Let me know if you would like to join in.<br/>
<br/>
Blessed be!<br/>
