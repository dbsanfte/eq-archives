Internet Connection sharing on any of your computers?&nbsp; Particularly 
whichever one you use to run EQ.&nbsp; Just form personal experience when I was 
using a hub and ICS for my 4 PCs to access the internet, I know that I could not 
log on to EQ without some problems.&nbsp; Once I disabled ICS though EQ started 
working fine.</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>I don&#39;t have a router. My modem would not work with a 
  router at all so we had to use a hub instead. It was working fine for months 
  but all of a sudden we started having problems with connection. We didn&#39;t 
  change any of the settings or anythings. It mostly was a problem with loading 
  webpages. I think it has something to do with the web accelerator software my 
  ISP uses. The modem itself has software on it that the ISP sends to it but the 
  accelerator stuff has always been a bit wonky, but it didn&#39;t seem to interfere 
  with EQ before.<br>I really don&#39;t know what the problem is.<br>I have a 
  Direcway 6000 2-way external modem hooked to an 8 port hub. Even when none of 
  the other computers are accessing the internet, I still have problems with 
  connection now. I can&#39;t get cable or even dialup out here so it&#39;s very 
  frustrating.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br>======= At 2005-08-07, 13:38:00 you wrote:

  are mapped, and if<br>&gt;you have a firewall now that you didn&#39;t have before, 
  that it&#39;s set to allow<br>&gt;what EQ requests.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;We had a 
  problem with being able to connect after our ISP finally realized<br>&gt;we 
  were using an outdated &quot;DSL manager&quot; program they&#39;d supplied 
  several<br>&gt;years ago and for an older, identical appearing modem and when 
  we replaced<br>&gt;it last year after it went tits up unexpectedly, we 
  continued with the same<br>&gt;until out of the blue, it stopped working. A 
  few very puzzled calls later,<br>&gt;we had it changed to treating the modem 
  as if it were any normal router, but<br>&gt;still not working right with EQ. 
  Spent some more time with tech support and<br>&gt;we find out not only is our 
  little modem a router in disguise, it&#39;s a<br>&gt;hardware firewall also...and 
  that aspect of it was turned on with the same<br>&gt;changes we had to make to 
  connect. We had to turn the firewall feature off<br>&gt;to be able to connect 
  to EQ, most IRC servers, and pretty much anything<br>&gt;beyond basic email 
  and web browsing. If you&#39;ve made any recent changes to<br>&gt;your 
  configuration, even just a router firmware update, please look 
  into<br>&gt;that as a possible cause.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Also, if you do find it&#39;s 
  something like that, make sure you have a good<br>&gt;software firewall to 
  take up the slack. I like Tiny Personal<br>&gt;Firewall....very easy to 
  configure and lives up to its name on resources.<br>&gt;Sygate Firewall did 
  it&#39;s basic job extremely well before that, and was also<br>&gt;extremely easy 
  to configure, but over time got to be wickedly unstable and<br>&gt;then 
  finally refused to play nicely with the second NIC, so it had to 
  go.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>-- <br>No virus found in this outgoing
