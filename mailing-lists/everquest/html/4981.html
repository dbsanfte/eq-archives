<div>Speaking of... what do you guys think of camping two camps at once? I ran into a guy doing this the other night... he would kill everything in one camp then run to the other and kill everything then run back again... and yet was claiming both as camped... As far as I&#39;m concerned once you leave your camp, it&#39;s fair game... But he was being a jerk about it and I didn&#39;t feel like dealing with it so I just logged for the night.</div>
