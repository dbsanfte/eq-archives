We got revenge....some of our guildies joined us and we hunted him..got a<br/>
piece for one of the guildmates for her epic. Then went on into Mistmoore<br/>
and got the Black Wolf Skin for my epic(what we were after in the first<br/>
place)<br/>
Revenge is sweet...hehehe<br/>

  I hate brownies..<br/>
  When I first started playing EverQuest and decided to venture out without<br/>
my<br/>
  sister&#39;s help, I went over to the spires in Gfay. I saw this cute tiny<br/>
  person standing there. It said brownie scout over it&#39;s head. I was like<br/>
&quot;How<br/>
  cute! Hello little guy&quot; and walked over to greet it. It started casting a<br/>
  spell but I was so new I didn&#39;t know what it was doing. Next thing I know<br/>
I<br/>
  see LOADING PLEASE WAIT.<br/>
  That was the first time I died in the game.<br/>
  One day, I will have my revenge.<br/>
  luv,<br/>

  At level 48 the corrupted Brownie killed me and my wife(level 49 warrior).<br/>
  LFay is a tricky dangerous place.<br/>
