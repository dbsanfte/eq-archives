<div id="ygrps-yiv-941876196">I don&#39;t play all that often either. I&#39;ve been playing the game for over a<br/>
year and my highest character is only 35.<br/>
On the bright side, my corpse was still there after the patch with all my<br/>
stuff. My sister found my corpse and got a cleric to rez me. :-)<br/>
So all is good in the game world.<br/>
luv,<br/>
