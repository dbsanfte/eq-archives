<b>Subject:</b> Possible new Ranger quest? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-961977362">Hi everyone,<br/>
	I just discovered this quest tonight for any ranger. I&#39;ve got<br/>
the first two done and am working on the third. <br/>
<br/>
SERVER: Solsek Ro<br/>
Class: Ranger<br/>
Min lvl: Unknown, mostly newbies I guess<br/>
Location(s): So far Greater Feydark and Steamfront Mountains<br/>
Starting Point: Faydark&#39;s Champions<br/>
Contact: Samatansyn Flamecatcher<br/>
<br/>
This quest involves getting official Feydark Champs armor. (Coif,<br/>
Bracers, Breast plate, leggings, ect.)<br/>
<br/>
Your replies to Samatansyn Flamecatcher&#39;s questions in order are...<br/>
<br/>
&#39;what training exercises&#39;<br/>
<br/>
&#39;I am a ranger of Tunare&#39;<br/>
<br/>
&#39;I want to craft (name your item)<br/>
<br/>
You will be given a box and a pattern for the item, once you gather all<br/>
your ingredients, combine them in the box you were given, (without the<br/>
paper looking thing he gives you, keep that separate.) You will have a<br/>
nice little square now. <br/>
<br/>
Take this and the paper looking thing, (That&#39;s your mold BTW), to a<br/>
forge and place the material, (your square), and the mold, (the paper<br/>
looking thing), in there and combine them. You will get a new piece of<br/>
armor! <br/>
<br/>
Tonight I got the coif and the bracers and now I&#39;m working on the<br/>
sleeves. Here are the ingredients you need for the first two.<br/>
<br/>
Blocks of crude bronze can be found in Steamfront Mountains off Kobold<br/>
Scouts or at the Grikbar camp, they drop pretty plentiful so grab as<br/>
many as you can carry because I feel you will need them. <br/>
<br/>
The Skeleton Tibia can be acquired off a Decaying Elf Skeleton<br/>
<br/>
The ration is just that, so don&#39;t get the Iron ration. <br/>
<br/>
Pretty much most of these items can be bought throughout the city, I&#39;ll<br/>
be on a bronze hunt in a few days so if you need some and can&#39;t get any<br/>
let me know, I&#39;ll be Durgaa. <br/>
<br/>
COIF<br/>
2 blocks of crude bronze <br/>
1 Royal Jelly<br/>
1 Spiderling Eye<br/>
1 Ration (Not Iron Ration)<br/>
<br/>
The last 3 are easy to get, you can actually buy them.<br/>
<br/>
BRACERS (Pattern only makes one! So grab enough for two items!)<br/>
1 block of crude bronze<br/>
1 skeleton tibia<br/>
1 pixie wing<br/>
1 Gypsy wine<br/>
<br/>
SLEEVES (Pattern only makes one! So grab enough for two items!)<br/>
2 blocks of crude bronze<br/>
2 giant wasp venom sacs<br/>
1 large widow abdomen<br/>
1 white wine<br/>
<br/>
