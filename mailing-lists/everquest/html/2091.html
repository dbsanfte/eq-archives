&gt; Thanks, Solid advice to me.<br/>
&gt; So, it sounds like when I die, I would lose mets say<br/>
&gt; a shield and sword<br/>
&gt; then?<br/>
&gt; If so, then I get it now.<br/>

&gt; question, please help<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt;   &gt;Forgive my ignorance but I am a newbie had a 4th<br/>
&gt; level Druid in the city<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt;   Elves and while out at the Orc &gt;Camp, with others,<br/>
&gt; I got killed by an Orc<br/>
&gt;   Centurian and when I returned to get my corpse,<br/>
&gt; nothing was &gt;there.  It<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt;   not more than 4 minutes when I returned.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   No problem. All of us were newbies once.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;Question: Is it possible for someone to Steal or<br/>
&gt; Loot my corpse? The book<br/>
&gt;   says no but I beg to differ.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;Is it possible that I had two corpses out there?<br/>
&gt; Meaning, When I went<br/>
&gt; back<br/>
&gt;   with a dead body I died again?  &gt;Which meant I<br/>
&gt; found the wrong corpse?<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   You must have found the second corpse. It can be<br/>
&gt; tough sometimes getting<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt;   right corpse if you die more than once. And<br/>
&gt; sometimes if you don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; any<br/>
&gt;   items other than foraged food, you lose the<br/>
&gt; foraged stuff anyways and just<br/>
&gt;   get back the food you started with. Up to level 5<br/>
&gt; I think you get your<br/>
&gt;   food/drink and tome of discord back. I think your<br/>
&gt; starting weapon too.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;And to add one last question, &quot;what do I do now?<br/>
&gt; seeing as I have no<br/>
&gt; food,<br/>
&gt;   no money, no nothing?&quot;  Do I &gt;beg or do I start<br/>
&gt; another char?<br/>
&gt;   &gt;This game is totally fun but with the fact of<br/>
&gt; trying to learn which way<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt;   go all the time and dying, it is starting &gt;to get<br/>
&gt; to me,<br/>
&gt;   &gt;I don&#39;t want to give up just yet and I turned to<br/>
&gt; this board since the<br/>
&gt; Chat<br/>
&gt;   from the game options was &gt;USELESS.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   Well, if it bugs you that much, you can start over<br/>
&gt; again. But even if you<br/>
&gt;   lose everything, at that low level you can just<br/>
&gt; keep the character and<br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt;   build your items and such back up again. I<br/>
&gt; recommend that you not carry<br/>
&gt;   anything you really don&#39;t want to lose until you<br/>
&gt; get level 6. Keep<br/>
&gt;   everything else in the bank. Especially your<br/>
&gt; money. Oh, and practice<br/>
&gt;   foraging alot. It will help you later on in the<br/>
&gt; game. Trust me. Begging is<br/>
&gt;   not a good idea. Begging tend to piss people off.<br/>
&gt; And you might want to<br/>
&gt;   avoid orc camps at that level. at least stay close<br/>
&gt; to the lift with a good<br/>
&gt;   group and have someone to pull wandering orc<br/>
&gt; cents. I think even some orc<br/>
&gt;   pawns might give you xp at that level.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;Please help and Thanks in advance<br/>

&gt;   You&#39;re welcome.<br/>
