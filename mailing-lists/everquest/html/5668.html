 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately I have NO choice, since I stay in a house that is like <br/>
30-50 meters from the road/nearest phone box.. so, even a phone line <br/>
connection is out for me.. but this CDMA wireless phone connection <br/>
is supposedly TWICE as fast as normal dial up (proven by myself many <br/>
times, downloading various files with unbelieveable speed)..<br/>
<br/>
Its just that this default eq patcher is not friendly to low-speed <br/>
users.. and when I finish patching, it will be a zip to play.. as in <br/>
1 seconds I usually download 1kbps shown in the little pc box that <br/>
came up when u click the right side corner of your windows.. and eq <br/>
really send only little bits of data every few seconds, and thats <br/>
why dial up users can still play decently..<br/>
<br/>
Joining plane and drags raids gave me no problems last time (when I <br/>
was staying at diff place 3 years ago, where dial up is the norm).. <br/>
and since I already upgrade my connection to twice the former speed, <br/>
guess I will be able to play smoothly (aye, understood that I need <br/>
to switch off many pics and chat options)..<br/>
<br/>
Sigh.. imagine that a pc with p4 3gig hyper threading, dual slot <br/>
1024gig memory and geforce fx 5600.. all im left out of is.. lousy <br/>
connection! (this coming from a player that camped 3days and manage <br/>
to beat 3k+ players to place a large tower on trammel pacific UO, <br/>
using a dial up, imagine the uber speed =)</div>
