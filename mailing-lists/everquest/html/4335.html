 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t wait either. In my state we EAT frogs. Well? Actually we eat <br/>
the legs. If you pass some Frogloc amputees in the game in a month or <br/>
two, look for my camp fire. ;) Seriously, the meat doesn&#39;t taste like <br/>
chicken. It&#39;s sort of rubbery like allegator tail and they are like <br/>
french fries. Frog legs taste good fresh fried but they are no good <br/>
after that get cold. Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if the game would let us <br/>
sell Frogloc meat after a kill? I&#39;m sure that the Vah Shir would love <br/>
it. G.<br/>
