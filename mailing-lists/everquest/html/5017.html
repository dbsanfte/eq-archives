stacked when handing in to the quest npc.<br/>
<br/>
So if the quest involves handing in 4 Batwings, then make sure that the<br/>
trade window with the npc has 1 batwing in each slot.<br/>
<br/>
Use ctrl when clicking on a stack to select a single item from it.<br/>
<br/>
Hand in the first item by clicking on the NPC while holding the item on<br/>
the cursor, but hand all the subsequent items in by clicking them into<br/>
empty boxes in the trade window.<br/>
<br/>
If you click them all on to the NPC directly then stackable items will<br/>
end up stacked in the trade window and only count as 1 item handed in.<br/>
