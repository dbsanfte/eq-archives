<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-417894724">to be honest with you go to the tunnel in EC and see<br/>
if anyone has anything for a mage to wear<br/>
<br/>
I had a great tunic given to me which is a robe and<br/>
adds mana and other stuff too<br/>
<br/>
this is all you should worry about imho.<br/>
Like it has been said, you are better getting rusty<br/>
weaps for pets and other weaps, or summone one when<br/>
you get high enough.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Get magic items to increase mana and things to raise<br/>
mana after spent<br/>
<br/>
My mage shields himself, buffs pet, and then cast a DD<br/>
spell to get thigns going.  Then pet attacks, me<br/>
watching health, and when pet drops to 50%, I step in<br/>
and hit with my Staff to take aggro off pet while<br/>
casting or trying to cast a few DD spells<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Forget the AC as mage, it wont do you any good. Get<br/>
&gt; more +int and +mana<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; your items, it will help you way more in the long<br/>
&gt; run. And get your<br/>
&gt; focus<br/>
&gt; items.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; [Steven R. Hulse] I guess AC was a bad term to use,<br/>
&gt; Mostly I was wanting<br/>
&gt; to know about clothing other than the cheap crap,<br/>
&gt; cloth stuff. I was<br/>
&gt; wondering mostly about leather goods. For example, I<br/>
&gt; found soft wicker<br/>
&gt; legging in Ak&#39;anon but I&#39;m afraid to buy them<br/>
&gt; because I&#39;ll just waste<br/>
&gt; money I can use on other things like spells. I was<br/>
&gt; just hoping for a<br/>
&gt; little better protection other than cloth. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks though! ;-)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; There a lot of newbie armor quests out there now.  I<br/>
&gt; heard the <br/>
&gt; Gnomes armor were going to be in the next patch. <br/>
&gt; You might check the <br/>
&gt; Arcane Order Armor quests in Qeynos, or the similar<br/>
&gt; ones in <br/>
&gt; Freeport.  These all have minor stats on them, but<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re better <br/>
&gt; than cloth and sometimes even raw silk.  You are<br/>
&gt; well above the level <br/>
&gt; range for them so they should be easy to get.<br/>

&gt; Hopefully so! I don&#39;t care if my Mage can go to full<br/>
&gt; armor, just<br/>
&gt; something to offer a little more protection than<br/>
&gt; cloth. I found the Orcs<br/>
&gt; love to pick on the little guys! Yesterday I was<br/>
&gt; playing my new warrior<br/>
&gt; Gnome and went to Orc hill and man I was even there<br/>
&gt; yet and already had<br/>
&gt; 3 of them on my butt! I got creamed but it was fun<br/>
&gt; though!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; /help pet will bring up all the pet commands.  I<br/>
&gt; would suggest you <br/>
&gt; hotkey several of them, at least /pet attack and<br/>
&gt; /pet back off.  It <br/>
&gt; helps not having to type all that stuff out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; [Steven R. Hulse] <br/>
&gt; Cool thanks, I did get some in the other night. I<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t figure out<br/>
&gt; how to get my pet to guard and attack other than be<br/>
&gt; attacked myself. <br/>
