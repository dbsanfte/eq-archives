<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1861666858">Depends a bit on your playing style and goals, as well. As a druid, I <br/>
initiated most of my trade skills in my teens. I make some items I <br/>
need, make some for alts and an occasional customer. Other than a few <br/>
special items, the trade items are not so profitable as I think they <br/>
were intended to be. Some of the ethnic items are very nice, and <br/>
potentially profitable. Unfortunately, they are very high level and <br/>
will require lots of travel into dangerous places.<br/>
<br/>
As a caster I must earmark much of my money for spells. Once I know I <br/>
have enough for my new set of spells, I begin dumping some money into <br/>
trade skills. I do shop for items now and then, but the good stuff <br/>
cost a lot. I prefer to dump that money into trade skills, and plan <br/>
on making some nice stuff over the course of my career.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Is it going to kill my bank account or what?  I also want to make <br/>
&gt; &gt; arrowheads for my Fletching skill.  I think it would be cheaper.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; What do u all think?  I&#39;ve been to eqtraders.com.  I&#39;d just like <br/>
&gt; your <br/>
&gt; &gt; opinions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When they first came out I also thought about making my own <br/>
&gt; arrowheads.  Arrowheads go trivial at 41.  They might be good to <br/>
&gt; raise your skill to that point but are cheaper to buy.  And there&#39;s <br/>
&gt; no failures when you buy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But the new Condensed substance arrowheads are a reason to build <br/>
your <br/>
&gt; smithing skill, as are the acrylia shafts.  The problem is all that <br/>
&gt; stuff is on the moon and it is in high level zones, except the <br/>
&gt; acrylia which is on mid-level mobs.  And they are all highly prized <br/>
&gt; thus hard to find.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for money, until the recent patch you could master blacksmithing <br/>
&gt; for under 100 plat if you had decent int.  Now most of the skill <br/>
&gt; building stuff, like skewers, top out in the 50&#39;s.  So you&#39;re stuck <br/>
&gt; having to make armor, and that&#39;s an expensive way to go.  And since <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t seen anyone looking for a smith in months it&#39;s probably <br/>
&gt; unprofitable.  I can&#39;t remember the last time I saw someone in <br/>
banded <br/>
&gt; or even plate.  Everyone is in drop armor, or now their newbie <br/>
armor.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Luckily my guys mastered smithing a while ago.  It looks like <br/>
&gt; smithing will be expensive now, unless you find a lot of dropped <br/>
&gt; stuff to work with.  Good luck<br/>
