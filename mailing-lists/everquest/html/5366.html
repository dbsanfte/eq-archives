<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Congrats!<br/>
&gt; If you have Luclin I suggest you get some friends (especially ones with vs<br/>
&gt; undead spells) and head to Umbral Planes to hunt for Elysian Armor. I<br/>
&gt; brought my mother&#39;s lvl 41 druid to sit invis on the sidelines while my 56<br/>
&gt; cleric and a 52 druid soloed the elysian mobs. She snared and dotted them<br/>
&gt; and kited them until I rooted them and used my undead dots. I was doing<br/>
&gt; 190dmg every 6 seconds with my dots. They do have alot of HP though. and<br/>
&gt; they hit pretty hard. The arms dropped twice and so did the tunic. So both<br/>
&gt; druids got arms and tunic. It was fun!<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>
