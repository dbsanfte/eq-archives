<div id="ygrps-yiv-256984964">There are some really nice people I&#39;ve encountered. i started a Rogue a few<br/>
days ago. i was determined to not have her twinked. I&#39;m running around with<br/>
no armor and just the weapon I started with... I got to lvl 2 just turning<br/>
in bardic mail without having to kill anything. Then some guy walks up and<br/>
hands me 2pp. I reluctantly took it. Then another guy came up and gave me a<br/>
Shiny Brass Shield. At first I tried to refuse but then figured I could give<br/>
it to one of my mom&#39;s alts. Then some guy started offering me splitpaw<br/>
armor. I tried to pay him for it but he wouldn&#39;t let me. So I ended up with<br/>
all this stuff by lvl 3... The gnoll hide lariat rules though. I can&#39;t<br/>
complain.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Recently in some of the groups I&#39;ve been in, we&#39;ve had a few problems<br/>

&gt; &gt; &quot;ninja-looting&quot;. They loot everything really fast so nobody else gets a<br/>
&gt; &gt; chance. And even when we establish a regular loot order some people will<br/>
&gt; &gt; still loot out of turn.<br/>
&gt; &gt; And then we have times when people say we roll for certain types of<br/>

&gt; &gt; picked up an FS morning star and wanted to roll for it (bc it&#39;s an<br/>
&gt; expensive<br/>

 </span></blockquote>a<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; for bronze armor&quot;...<br/>
&gt; &gt; Has anyone else had this problem?<br/>
&gt; &gt; What do you think is the best and fairest loot order?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just wondering.<br/>
&gt; &gt; luv,<br/>
&gt; &gt; -Su<br/>
&gt; &gt; ps. alpha loot with 3 loots per turn (per person) works pretty well when<br/>
&gt; &gt; people cooperate.<br/>
