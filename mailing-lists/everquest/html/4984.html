<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] What game features would you like to see added? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-158203323">It would be nice to have a spell that could gate your corpse to <br/>
you. Then, I have heard people talking about some games where a player <br/>
could buy corpse insurance: if you die then you get back everything that <br/>
you were carrying. I don&#39;t like corpse runs either. It takes away from the <br/>
fun in the game. It might be more fun if you had a chance of coming back as <br/>
a random race/creature each time that you died and had to stay that way for <br/>
a number of game days before you returned to normal. That could work for or <br/>
against you. It would force players to temporarily use characters of other <br/>
races and learn more about them.<br/>
         I would not eliminate rezzes. What would be the point of investing <br/>
time into building up a character only to lose everything in a single <br/>
fight? I&#39;d stop playing the game. I wouldn&#39;t even have to think about it. <br/>
The fun of playing the game wouldn&#39;t be worth the time spent and lost, <br/>
spent and lost yet again developing a temporary character. For me, the fun <br/>
of the game is watching my character grow. Without that, the battles and <br/>
treasure are pointless to me and so is the game.<br/>

&gt;it&#39;s a royal pain.<br/>
&gt;Would you have it so you have all your gear but can still be rezzed? or<br/>
&gt;would you just eliminate rezzes?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Or, if you could go back in time and change something about Everquest<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; during<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it&#39;s creation to have certain features, what would you have done<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; differently?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Definitely I would get rid of the corpse-hunting. I understand losing exp<br/>
&gt; &gt; when you die, I think that&#39;s a good thing (well not GOOD but it makes<br/>
&gt;sense) but<br/>
&gt; &gt; going back to find your body to get all your stuff back just sucks.<br/>
&gt;Especially<br/>
&gt; &gt; when you die somewhere you can&#39;t get back to. WHY can&#39;t you ever find a<br/>
&gt;necro<br/>
&gt; &gt; when you need one?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Sail to your heart&#39;s desires, and know when to drop anchor.&quot;<br/>
