<div id="ygrps-yiv-20080175">Hi,<br/>
   How is everyone doing tonight? I am having troble with playing <br/>
EverQuest. I was a stupid A*&, I bought the game and I did not look <br/>
at the requirements. And, my computer is not up to the task. I am <br/>
going to have to up grade it to play it hardcore. I am loooking <br/>
forward to playing on a normal bases. I am hoping reading all of the <br/>
posting that all of you make with pay off. I am a human paladin. Any <br/>
help or hints will be greatly appreciated! I am looking forward to <br/>
meet people on there and make friends and alliances.<br/>
David</div>
