<div id="ygrps-yiv-591444638">Go to Frontier Mountains, in Kunark, and get into a Giant Fort group. Great<br/>
exp, nice loot. Druids are always in demand -- &quot;sow please.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Gatorscale leggings are nice Druid legs. 7AC, +4 wisdom, +15 hit points. You<br/>
get them off the Ancient Crocodile (level 30-ish), way back in the back of<br/>
Upper Guk, or you can buy them at auction for maybe 300-400pp, at least on<br/>
Tarew Marr. The Ancient Croc has been heavily camped in the past, but I<br/>
don&#39;t know now.<br/>
<br/>
The Mammoth Hide cloak is a nice druid piece for the back. AC 7, +4 wisdom,<br/>
sv cold +5. It drops off the ice goblin alchemist in Permafrost (level upper<br/>
20s). It sells for about 400 pp or so on Tarew Marr, I think.<br/>
<br/>
For the arms, adamantite armbands. AC 3, strength +3, wisdom +3. You can get<br/>
them for under 200pp if you are lucky. They drop in Howling Stones, I doubt<br/>
you want to go there to fight at your level.<br/>
<br/>
Froondor, 41 Wood Elf Druid of Tarew Marr<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] Couple of questions<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I just hit level 30 last night, and being the Druid that I am, I had a<br/>
&gt; couple of questions.<br/>
<br/>
[snip]<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Second, Could someone suggest an item for my arm, back, of legs that gives<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; decent (around +3) Wisdom modifer that I could try to track down for<br/>
myself<br/>
&gt; either through a quest or through hunting loot?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Damasciss<br/>
&gt; 30 Druid<br/>
&gt; E&#39;ci </span></blockquote></div>
