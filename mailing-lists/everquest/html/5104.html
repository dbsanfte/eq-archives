Is there a website where you can see what equipment you mix with what <br/>
aug stone to get certain enhancements? I have some sort of cloudy <br/>
ruby that I got from my first adventure. I hear that I take it to a <br/>
birdfeeder looking think in the camp but I have no idea which pieces <br/>
of my equipment I can augment and what the augmentation does.<br/>

of<br/>
&gt; running out of time.<br/>
&gt; The first dungeon crawl I did we made over 100pp each. Second one I <br/>
got a<br/>

had fun.<br/>
&gt; I hope that I can get grouped with some guildies sometime though.<br/>
