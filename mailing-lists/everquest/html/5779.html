<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939367017">When not wandering Norrath I race 1/10th scale radio controlled cars. In<br/>
case you are not familiar with them, these are not the ones you buy at Radio<br/>
Shack. They are specifically designed for racing and my radio alone cost<br/>
more then the most expensive car at Radio Shack.  If you are familiar, I run<br/>
in the Stock Truck class with an Associated T3.<br/>
<br/>
The bodies of the vehicles are made of clear Lexan and are painted on the<br/>
inside to keep the paint from coming off during collisions. There is a glue<br/>
available that will let you glue pictures from magazines to the inside of<br/>
your vehicle before you paint it. The paper you use in your printer is to<br/>
thick and tends to peel off, it needs to be the thinner paper used in<br/>
magazines.<br/>
<br/>
I want to make an EQ body for the on-road car I will be getting soon.<br/>
Imagine if Sony sponsored a NASCAR car for EverQuest.  If anybody has any<br/>
computer or video game magazines with EQ related ads or other color pictures<br/>
I would very much like to get some. They can be for EQ, EQII, EQ Adventures,<br/>
Champions of Norrath or any of the EQ games. I will cut out the pics I need<br/>
so most anything has potential. I will take pages ripped out or entire<br/>
magazines. I will pay shipping and reimburse for the magazine. They will<br/>
need to be kept FLAT, if they have creases they will not be any good for my<br/>
purposes. I am located in the US if that helps.<br/>
<br/>
I have the maps that came with EQ Evolution and may use some of them. The<br/>
manual is B&W so not much use.<br/>
<br/>
If I get enough pictures to do up the body I will gladly post pics of it<br/>
when done.<br/>

&quot;I brake for loot!&quot;</div>
