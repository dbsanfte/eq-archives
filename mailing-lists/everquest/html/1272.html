<div id="ygrps-yiv-901201221">Well, can only speak for my self and our guild. We hardly ever random for<br/>
anything. When i or GM leads an event we just collect the loot, or someone<br/>
that we called out collects the loot. Later we divide the loot to people we<br/>
feel are worth the loot. We do random a few not so good stuff when they drop<br/>
tho, but when it&#39;s godly/uber stuff that drops it may even go to someone<br/>
that isn&#39;t attending that perticular event.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard for me to give another point of view but basicly i wouldnt join a<br/>
group unless we divide the loot so that everyone got a chance to get<br/>
something, be it a gem or an item, but all should get one thing to bring<br/>
home when the group breakes up. Guess i&#39;m saying, random or not, if you won<br/>
last random you wount random again till the whole group got something to be<br/>
happy over. If it&#39;s a class item (read: FBSS to meleer and so on) only the<br/>
class that can use it randoms.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Since there&#39;s been a lot of talk on loot order, I thoguht I&#39;d ask what<br/>
&gt; everyone<br/>
&gt; uses as a fair assesment for Rolling for loot or how one determines who<br/>
&gt; gets a<br/>
&gt; particular item.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   What I found that seemed to be working well is Blackjack Rolls.  Someone<br/>
&gt; a long<br/>
&gt; while back showed this to me.  Basically you roll from 1 to 30.  The<br/>
&gt; person closest<br/>
&gt; to 21 without going over wins.   This seems to even out those who<br/>
&gt; consistantly average<br/>
&gt; low rolls in the 1-100 randoms.  In over 2 years of playing and using the<br/>
&gt; random 1-100<br/>
&gt; i&#39;ve never won or came close to an upper limit.   With blackjack random or<br/>
&gt; even a<br/>
&gt; raondom 1-100 and the closest to 50 is the winner, seems to average things<br/>
&gt; out.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   The problem with this is that most people (especially those that<br/>
&gt; seemingly roll high)<br/>
&gt; love the 1-100 random.  When I suggest the mid range win or blackjack<br/>
&gt; roll, the first <br/>
&gt; time they lose to it, they want to go back to the 1-100 again.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   What do you all use as a random or what &#39;rules&#39; do you use for<br/>
&gt; distributing the good<br/>
&gt; loot or when using Random?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ciao,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  -Knight   - I still like BlackJack rolls.  I can&#39;re remember the guys<br/>
&gt; name that first<br/>
&gt;             showed it to me though.  :(<br/>
