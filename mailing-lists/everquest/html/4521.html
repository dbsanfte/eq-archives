&gt; they found out I have a laptop, then they said they<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t help me :<br/>
&gt; ( I posted the error on the Allakhazam site (with<br/>
&gt; all the info on my <br/>
&gt; eqclient.ini and dxdialog files) and they didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; help. Someone on the <br/>
&gt; Everquest chat channel told me to delete my<br/>
&gt; eqclient.ini file, which <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t help either. I ended up using my system<br/>
&gt; restore, and restored <br/>
&gt; the system to the day before I started getting the<br/>
&gt; eqgame.exe error <br/>
&gt; and it has been working fine ever since. Good luck<br/>
&gt; to you, hope you <br/>
&gt; get it going soon.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does anyone have an idea as to why Sony won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; support me because I <br/>
&gt; use a laptop?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Anyone else having this problem and do you know<br/>

&gt; &gt; can someone assist me please?<br/>
