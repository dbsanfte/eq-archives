&gt; however if you go with Luclin you may find you need to donate money to wizzies or druids to get you to a location that has a wizzy spire that can take you to Luclin or elsewhere...   there is one right in Gfay though.  I&#39;d still say go with Planes of Power becasue that takes you to every major city which is where you&#39;d go to buy your spells.  The Luclin spires won&#39;t do that.  Either way, I&#39;d suggest having a high end system since both have some hefty graphics which can slow your system down to a crawl.<br/>

&gt; I personally have all the expansion packs and all the strategy guides... but I&#39;m a geek EQ addict so what do I know?<br/>

&gt;   I&#39;d personally recommend buying Shadows of Luclin.<br/>
&gt;   It&#39;s got the spires which help you travel around a fair amount as well as some very good exp spots for your level and upwards.<br/>
&gt;   Planes of Power is good for travelling but it won&#39;t add anywhere very interesting for you to explore at your level.<br/>
&gt;   Ruins of Kunark isn&#39;t bad either but more leaning towards the dark races with faction issues etc.<br/>
&gt;   Scars of Velious would be better to buy once you&#39;re a bit higher in level (I didn&#39;t purchase it until level 40)<br/>

&gt;     Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I only have enough $$$$ to buy one expansion pack for EQ. at the moment.<br/>
&gt;     Currently I only have the base game with no exp. packs.<br/>
&gt;     Which exp. pack would you recommend me to buy first?<br/>
&gt;     I&#39;m a lvl 16 bard in Gtr Faydark at the moment and would like a pack that allows me to travel around a bit quicker to other places so that I can buy my songs that are unavail. in my guild hall.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Pls advise.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Many thanks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Thomas.<br/>
