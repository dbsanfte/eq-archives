Greetings Fellow Adventurers in the Everquest Universe,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Findar and I am a 17th Level Wizard on the Bertoxxulicus<br/>
Server.  At 16th Level, I acquired the research skill and have acquired<br/>
the Lexicon, the Wizard&#39;s Canon, the Wizard&#39;s Dictionary (maybe<br/>
incorrect name, but it is something like that), and other assorted items<br/>
(pen and parchment).  I have picked up a number of rune stones, pieces<br/>
of the grimmoire, and words.  I understand that you combine these in<br/>
some specific combination in the lexicon to make spells or something.<br/>
The issue I bring before you is that when I made 17th level, I could not<br/>
practice my research, which indicated that the only way to raise my<br/>
research was by trail and error using the lexicon to combine items to<br/>
try to make something.  At this time, I can only make out a few words on<br/>
the pages in the Wizard&#39;s Canon and the Wizard&#39;s Dictionary.  Since some<br/>
of the components I have acquired are worth as much as 2 plat, which is<br/>
still a good bit of money to me for me, I am reluctant to just put them<br/>
randomly into the lexicon to try to combine them.<br/>
<br/>
My question to this great group of veteran adventurers is three fold.<br/>
One, is there any other way of raising one&#39;s research outside of<br/>
combining items within the lexicon?  Two, is the reading of the words in<br/>
the Wizard&#39;s Canon and Dictionary based on the research skill, your<br/>
language skill, your level, something else entirely, or some combination<br/>
of skills?  Are there any web sites that give additional information on<br/>
research and the combination of components to make spells or such?<br/>
<br/>
I would greatly appreciate you words of wisdom and advice on this<br/>
matter.<br/>
<br/>
