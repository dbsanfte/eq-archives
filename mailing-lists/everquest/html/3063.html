<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Honestly, for the most part, money does not really 
start to get easier until you hit the low to mid 20&#39;s, as at that point, 
depending upon where you hunt, mobs start to drop fine steel and bronze weapons, 
not to mention chainmail and bronze armor.&nbsp; There are certain areas, and 
mobs you can camp at most levels, from about 6 on, that drops a bit better gear 
than others.&nbsp; The only other way to gain much in the way of pp at the lower 
levels is to drop every cp earned into a tradeskill such as smithing, or 
tailoring, to get it up to over 100, where you can sell stuff to other players, 
such as player made backpacks, and banded armor.&nbsp; All it takes to find the 
right mobs is experimentation, and research, eventually you will find what you 
are looking for.</font></div>

  <p>I&nbsp;to thought that there were quick fix ways of getting money, but all 
  it comes down to is killing the right mobs, i.e farming giants etc, selling 
  your wares from tradeskills and farming items such as centi weapons etc. a lot 
  of ppl tend to use a high lvl char to fund thier twinks, which is most likely 
  the reason for the excessive amounts of money players buy/sell things for - 
  sometimes it feels like im trading in russian rouble&#39;s as in pp being near 
  worthless :(</p>
  <p>i have seen some of these guides but havn&#39;t bought one yet so i have no 
  idea as to there real value or content.Most likely they are like other 
  official Game Guides for other games i.e a waste of time and money, anything 
  in the guides you can probably find out just by asking the right questions or 
  checking out sites such as alakazam and casters realm, i would ask around see 
  if anyone has bought one before paying for information.</p>

  <div></div>&gt;Does anyone know a good way to make money in Everquest. You 
  find 
  <div></div>&gt;these websites with these huge secrets to making plat. but who 
  <div></div>&gt;knows. I just started, and didn&#39;t know this game could be so 
  <div></div>&gt;addictive. I am a wood elf ranger. I boosted all my bonus 
  points 
  <div></div>&gt;to str at 90. So its not so bad. Im only level 3 though.
