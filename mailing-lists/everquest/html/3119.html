&gt; And about reverse engineering. Anyone know much about this? For <br/>
&gt; example, I looted a chainmail tunic in Permafrost, but it was too <br/>
&gt; large for my alts to use. However, if I could break it down into <br/>
&gt; parts and remake it with the correct pattern for a small character, I <br/>

    - Tarnished and Fine Steel Weapons may now be recycled into ore<br/>
      by placing them into a forge with a water flask.<br/>
<br/>
they didn&#39;t say &quot;armor&quot;, only weapons ... but maybe just give it a try.<br/>
i didn&#39;t check with eqtraders, yet, but maybe you should have a look<br/>
there as well ... and if you tried it yourself, maybe you should post<br/>
your results there.<br/>
