<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327206304">I&#39;m assuming Everquest can play from third person or first person, <br/>
because I&#39;ve seen screens of both (Or so I think. I may be mistaken). <br/>
And I just want to check, I bought the &quot;Everquest Evolutions&quot; <br/>
package. I heard that it has a $9.99 monthly fee, is this correct? <br/>
Thanks for the help, and when I get my P.C. in about 4 days, I expect <br/>
to see some of you on EQ! ;)<br/>
