Familiar is a wizard&#39;s pet. It can&#39;t fight, it&#39;s more like a visible<br/>
buff. You have to resummon it each time you die, but it zones with you.<br/>
<br/>
[Steven R. Hulse] Well that kind of sucks! I mean thanks for the info<br/>
but if they can&#39;t fight then what good are they? I guess it&#39;s cool to<br/>
have it follow you around and stuff. Oh well, I didn&#39;t design the game.<br/>
;-) <br/>

It&#39;s also the first spell of that type a wizard gets so it fizzles a<br/>
LOT. My<br/>
wizard spent a good 3 hours medding and fizzling just trying to get her<br/>
familiar back. I&#39;ve never noticed any change in my fizzles or anything<br/>
after<br/>
a successful summoning. And sometimes it runs off and I can&#39;t find it.<br/>
But<br/>
it&#39;s fun to have it just following around and flapping it&#39;s little<br/>
wings.<br/>
When I&#39;m bored I just talk to my familiar and emote I&#39;m feeding it<br/>
cookies.<br/>
Too bad you can&#39;t name your familiars. I call mine Flappy.<br/>

[Steven R. Hulse] Is this a new thing? I used to have a wiz at one point<br/>
but it never had this spell until like a higher level. Hmm, cool. You<br/>
know, I think I may have met you the other night, Someone, (I can&#39;t<br/>
remember their name now), was talking with their pet, It was kind of<br/>
funny at first I didn&#39;t realize it was their pet and thought it was<br/>
another person! ;-) It was at the Orc lift in Felwith.</div>
