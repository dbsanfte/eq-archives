2 new tabs to the Inventory window.&nbsp; One says Evolving Weapons, and the 
other one says Monster Alts.&nbsp; The latest patch message I saw said that the 
monster alts was not working yet.&nbsp; And some NPCs whose character models are 
not in zone yet are replaced by the standard human model.&nbsp; They call this 
model &quot;Doug&quot;.</font></div>

  the beta was now open.&nbsp; the registration for it only<br>&gt; lasted for 
  about 15 minutes though so you had to<br>&gt; register in that time.&nbsp; I 
  imagine they will announce<br>&gt; open testing registration periodically as 
  the time<br>&gt; draws near for its live release.&nbsp; I did get<br>&gt; 
  registered and spent a pretty good hour plus<br>&gt; downloading the beta 
  files.&nbsp; I have yet to play it,<br>&gt; but I copied the email I received 
  so people can see<br>&gt; what it says.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; 
  Wulfric<br>&gt; <br>&gt; PS&nbsp; Dont ask me for the FTP site address.&nbsp; 
  I wont<br>&gt; give it to you.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; 
  Welcome to the EverQuest(R) Depths of Darkhollow(TM)<br>&gt; (DoD) beta!&nbsp; 
  Please read this entire email<br>&gt; carefully. It contains all the 
  information you will<br>&gt; need to hit the ground running and make the most 
  of<br>&gt; your time in beta. Remember, you accepted the<br>&gt; EverQuest 
  Terms of Use, License and Non-Disclosure<br>&gt; Agreement as a condition for 
  acceptance into the<br>&gt; beta program, and everything included here as 
  well<br>&gt; as what you see on the beta server, in beta-related<br>&gt; 
  communications and beta forums and message boards<br>&gt; are covered by that 
  agreement. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; HOW DO I GET ON THE BETA SERVER?<br>&gt; 
  <br>&gt; In order to access the Depths of Darkhollow beta<br>&gt; server, you 
  will need to download the Beta patcher.<br>&gt; The FTP site for downloading 
  the patcher is listed<br>&gt; below. There may be a lot of data to download, 
  so<br>&gt; please be patient.&nbsp; You should run this patcher<br>&gt; before 
  you log in, every time.&nbsp; Failing to do so may<br>&gt; cause you to 
  experience crashes or gameplay issues<br>&gt; that could be fixed just by 
  patching.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; You may download the Depths of Darkhollow 
  beta<br>&gt; patcher at the following FTP site<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; FTP 
  Site omitted due to NDA.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; To get to the ftp 
  site:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Enter the ftp address into your Internet 
  Explorer<br>&gt; web browser.&nbsp; It will bring you to the ftp site. 
  The<br>&gt; file you need is called EQBetaPatcher.zip.&nbsp; Just<br>&gt; 
  right click on the file and copy it to your desktop.<br>&gt;&nbsp; Unzip the 
  file and copy betaeverquest.exe into your<br>&gt; root EverQuest directory 
  (Should be in C:&#92;Program<br>&gt; Files&#92;Sony&#92;EverQuest unless you changed your 
  default<br>&gt; installation.)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Run this every time prior to 
  logging in to the beta<br>&gt; server. You will see the Beta Server on the 
  server<br>&gt; list, choose that server and log in.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; 
  HOW LONG IS BETA?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The beta test is scheduled to begin on July 
  20th,<br>&gt; 2005 and is scheduled to end on September 13th,<br>&gt; 2005, 
  unless we decide to change these dates.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; HOW DO I GET 
  TO THE DoD ZONES?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; When you get onto the beta server, create 
  your<br>&gt; character and head to the Plane of Knowledge. Find<br>&gt; Old 
  Man Thorren and he can teleport you to Corathus<br>&gt; Creep.<br>&gt; 
  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; HOW DO I COPY MY CHARACTER ONTO BETA?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; For 
  us to copy your favorite EverQuest character to<br>&gt; the beta server, 
  please indicate which character you<br>&gt; want us to copy by logging into 
  your play server as<br>&gt; your favorite character. You indicate that you 
  want<br>&gt; us to copy an individual character by typing the<br>&gt; command 
  /beta in your chat window. Periodically we<br>&gt; will run scripts that will 
  copy characters to the<br>&gt; beta server. Keep in mind that we will be 
  running<br>&gt; the character copies on an as-needed basis - not<br>&gt; 
  necessarily at regular intervals. It may take<br>&gt; several days for us to 
  copy your character.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; THE /betabuff COMMAND<br>&gt; 
  <br>&gt; The level range needed to test all of the variations<br>&gt; of 
  dungeons for&nbsp; DoD is huge.&nbsp; In order to give you<br>&gt; that 
  ability to test as much of the expansion as<br>&gt; possible, we have created 
  a /betabuff command. <br>&gt; Here&#39;s how you use it.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1. 
  Create a first level character on the beta server<br>&gt; and log in with that 
  character (this command will<br>&gt; only work on 1st level 
  characters).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 2. Type /betabuff CLASS LEVEL - where CLASS is 
  the<br>&gt; class of the character you would like to create, and<br>&gt; LEVEL 
  is the level that you want that character to<br>&gt; be.&nbsp; LEVEL can only 
  be numbers divisible by 5,<br>&gt; starting at 20.&nbsp; So 20, 25, 30, 
  etc.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; That&#39;s it.&nbsp; The character you created will 
  be<br>&gt; transformed into a character of the level and class<br>&gt; you 
  have chosen.&nbsp; Your race and even gender may<br>&gt; change as 
  well.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; BETA FEEDBACK<br>&gt; <br>&gt; There are two 
  methods for passing information to us<br>&gt; about what you experience during 
  the beta.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; /bug should be used to report bugs.&nbsp; Bugs 
  are<br>&gt; gameplay features that do not work, spelling errors,<br>&gt; and 
  anything that just does not work as intended. <br>&gt; Please give us as much 
  detail about the bug as you<br>&gt; can think of when reporting it.<br>&gt; 
  <br>&gt; /feedback should be used to send in comments about<br>&gt; parts of 
  the expansion that work properly, but that<br>&gt; you would like to see 
  changed.&nbsp; If you discover an<br>&gt; item that you think should have less 
  Wis and more<br>&gt; Int, then use /feedback.&nbsp; If you think a 
  certain<br>&gt; encounter is too easy or too hard, use /feedback to<br>&gt; 
  report it.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; It is important that you distinguish between 
  these<br>&gt; two options, as one is read primarily by our testing<br>&gt; 
  team and the other is read mostly by our game<br>&gt; designers.&nbsp; Sending 
  a bug through /feedback can<br>&gt; delay our ability to fix it, since we&#39;ll 
  have to<br>&gt; route that to our testers for verification.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 
  Please use this command to explore as many of the<br>&gt; adventures as you 
  can and report your findings to<br>&gt; us.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If you find 
  yourself in dire need of assistance, you<br>&gt; can use /petition to contact 
  us for help.&nbsp; Please<br>&gt; only petition if the situation is one that 
  you can&#39;t<br>&gt; correct yourself.&nbsp; For example, if you used<br>&gt; 
  /betabuff to create a character and you have lost<br>&gt; the corpse, there is 
  no need to /petition.&nbsp; You can<br>&gt; just log out, create a new 
  character and use the<br>&gt; /betabuff command again.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Please 
  remember that your participation in the beta<br>&gt; program is subject to the 
  Terms of Use, License and<br>&gt; Non-Disclosure Agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) which 
  you<br>&gt; have already agreed to. Your access in and to the<br>&gt; beta 
  program, including the patcher, is for your<br>&gt; personal, non-commercial 
  use only, in accordance<br>&gt; with the Agreement, and any feedback you 
  provide is<br>&gt; confidential.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thank you for your time and 
  effort; we appreciate<br>&gt; your help testing this expansion.<br>&gt; 
  <br>&gt; Sincerely,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The EverQuest Depths of 
  Darkhollow Development Team<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;
