 </span></blockquote>i thought about getting a horse for myself (even with having jboots).<br/>
<br/>
the 1st time i checked prices, i thought there must be a mistake:<br/>
                                      129Kpp<br/>
<br/>
well, i don&#39;t have much CHA. some time ago people started to sell<br/>
&quot;Opal Encrusted Steins&quot;: slot PRI/SEC, CHA+25, MANA+10. you<br/>
can buy them starting at 25pp up to 45pp each in bazaar (TM prices).<br/>
<br/>
with this my CHA get over 100, and my standing with SH isn&#39;t too bad.<br/>
now the 129Kpp horse sells for a bit over 100Kpp.<br/>
<br/>
i equip all my chars with those &quot;Steins&quot; and do some of the SH<br/>
faction quests. faction and CHA does have a big impact on prices.<br/>
<br/>
and this is not only true for buying stuff from merchants, but also<br/>
selling gets better results.<br/>
