<b>Subject:</b> Another question...somebody STOP me :-) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-782633679">Ok..i have decided my new character will probably be a<br/>
Wood Elf Druid, i think i have her name picked out<br/>
(even a last name should i EVER get that far..lol) Not<br/>
sure what server i will play on yet but....my question<br/>
is, is there anywhere i can read about what i should<br/>
do first as a new character and yadda, yadda,<br/>
yadda....See the problem with my boyfriend being<br/>
experienced in the game is that he did it ALL for me,<br/>
or led me around by the collar doing it all for me<br/>
:-P...i want to do this on my own and have no idea<br/>
where to start...Do i just jump out there and start<br/>
killing critters or run around and hope i can find my<br/>
way back from wherever i leave??  i know i sound<br/>
foolish but it is really important to do this on my<br/>
own..how else can one really learn??  Help is great<br/>
and i really do appreciate it but i also want to feel<br/>
like i have accomplished something personally...Does<br/>
that make sense...<br/>
