<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780476301"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I got tired of camping Brutes in Warsliks Woods, so finally made my<br/>
&gt; journey to Velious. I took the boat, just to have done it once. Found<br/>
&gt; my way to Eastern Wastes. Started foraging the tufts of dire wolf fur<br/>
&gt; I need for advancing my tailoring.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have not been fortunate in hunting. Level 34 puts me low on the<br/>
&gt; food chain in EW. I have tried my standard hunting routine from the<br/>
&gt; foot of the bridge, but have been beaten back to the zone repeatedly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This last time, I crossed the zone to get away from a mob, and was<br/>
&gt; instantly killed by some kind of tracking wolf pack. They took me<br/>
&gt; down twice more in the next fifteen minutes. Found someone else<br/>
&gt; contending with them when I resurrected. He being a higher level<br/>
&gt; offered to train them away, and did so. I got my corpse and got my<br/>
&gt; stuff back, but am now a high 33 again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I may have to rethink my Velious career. Solo at 34 in EW seems a bit<br/>
&gt; tough, even if I need the tufts.<br/>

I keep seeing them dropped on the ground near the bank. If they can be<br/>
foraged I think you can forage them in GD and Thurgadin. GD seems to have<br/>
less mobs. There are some spots that are safer to hunt. There&#39;s a spot where<br/>
you can just get the wolves and if you get into trouble you can run to the<br/>
coldain wolves and guards for help.<br/>
