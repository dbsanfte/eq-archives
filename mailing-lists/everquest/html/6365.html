I really wish they could do what Warcraft does and make it not take so long when you die. I really do like the spawning at a graveyard nearby in ghost thing in warcraft. Although sometimes it can be annoying. It beats having to wait all that time to zone and then trying to get back to your corpse with no gear.<br/>
Thanks for the info!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I did the digital download and the bonus was a free spirit shroud (a golem)..  I&#39;ve used it once, but the mechanical mount looks like the war piggies in Plane of Tactics.  They had a big problem with people doing the monser missions.  They were too easy and people were soloing them for AA xp.  They&#39;ve nerfed them a bit now.  And now it&#39;s like watching paint dry.  they don&#39;t mvoe very quickly, and I&#39;m wondering if the amount of xp is worth the effort.  Still, some of the drops are really decent.  Frankly, I think Dragons of Norrath was a better expansion pack.  They have overhauled the UI somewhat.  Now you&#39;ve got 4 hotkey bars: 2 horizontal, and 2 vertical.  You can customize all 4 of them in the Options window.  A lot of people say it looks a lot like EQ2 now, but I dont think so.  It basically looks similar to what it was, just more colors to contrast some of the data.  Yadda Yadda.<br/>
