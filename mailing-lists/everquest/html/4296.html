<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I would also like to say that I know this game has been out for ages,<br/>
&gt; but I have only been playing for a couple of weeks now. I am new to<br/>
&gt; the online gaming world.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know that a lot of questions have been answered in the past, but<br/>
&gt; who honestly has time to go back and read all of that stuff?<br/>
&gt; Especially when we spend all of our free time on EQ! LOL.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please be patient with me.<br/>

&gt; Thanks,<br/>
