<div id="ygrps-yiv-327574565">I have a quick question that is out og game but naturally related to <br/>
the game. I am sure many of you use, have seen, or know how or where to <br/>
answer my question.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen many an avatar/singnature &quot;picture&quot; used by many up and <br/>
down the forums, and I decided I want one, or two. Can someone tell me <br/>
how they are made ( programs used -low budget best-downloaded or <br/>
borrowed), link me tyo website that has them and/or shows this info, <br/>
and lastly how to use the thing once made.<br/>
<br/>
Thankyou<br/>
<br/>
As always <br/>
<br/>
Greg</div>
