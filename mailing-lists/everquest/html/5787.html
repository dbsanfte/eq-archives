<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I&#39;m just wondering if anyone else has been 
experiencing an inordinate amount of lag lately?&nbsp; I mean more than you 
usually get, even in zones that are unpopulated.&nbsp; For example, whenever I 
port to the Feerrott, I start lagging immediately, and then if I port out, the 
lag gets even worse, as if I&#39;m carrying it with me.&nbsp; But I had absolutely 
no lag before I zoned itno Feerrott.&nbsp; So I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s something 
about that zone?</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">And before you say it&#39;s my computer system, I am 
running a Pentium 4 1.8Ghz with 1 GB of RAM, and a 128MB ATI Radeon 9200 video 
card.&nbsp; I also have a cable modem connection.&nbsp; And as I said, there&#39;s 
no lag until I zone into Feerrott.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Before you ask if I have anything running in the 
background, I use this system for nothing but Everquest, so I have already gone 
ahead and shut down all the background programs.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Before you ask if I have checked EQ&#39;s 
knowledgebase, I&#39;ve already done everythign they&#39;ve reccomended and it hasn&#39;t 
solved the problem.&nbsp; One thing I did find out was that certain zones will 
lag becasue on ATI cards there&#39;s an option for Wait For Vertical Sync, and they 
reccomend setting it to Off.&nbsp; So I did this, but now I&#39;m getting lag in 
EVERY zone so I really don&#39;t think that&#39;s it.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">And before you ask if I have updated to the latest 
video drivers, I did that when I found out about the Vertical Sync issue.&nbsp; 
</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">As you can probably tell, I&#39;m not without some 
troubleshooting knowledge, but I&#39;ve done everything I can think of, and the 
problem is still persisting.&nbsp; The one clue I have is that the problem 
didn&#39;t start happening until after last patch.&nbsp; So I don&#39;t know if that has 
anything to do with it.&nbsp; I thought I would check and see if anyone else is 
having this problem.&nbsp; </font></div>

any character.</font></div>

reports.</font></div></html></div>
