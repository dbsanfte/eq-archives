<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245750762">Yes I am running with Luclin, with about 14 of the new models, and the new UI. Right now I only have 256mb (Samsung DDR333 PC2700) of memory, but I plan to increase that in the next few weeks. It came stock with a Chaintech GF2 MX400 64MB agp card which runs quite well. Surprised me a bit because my older system also has a GF2 MX400 in it, but runs soooo much slower, possibly because it&#39;s a pci card I suppose. Bus speed is still at the norm 100..possibly 133 but I don&#39;t think so. It&#39;s an Asus P4S533 Mobo with the SiS 645dx chipset that has gotten quite good reviews. <br/>
<br/>
I have noticed spell effects drag down my fps quite a bit, but still quite playable. In a raid situation I would probably turn them off. The bazaar is a little laggy if I don&#39;t have the clip plane down, altho if I only have the old character models enabled I can set the clip plane to about 50% before I get bad lag. All this, I&#39;m assuming, is because of the video card limitations. Quite probably it is your problem (mostly) as well. <br/>
<br/>
Scanning through Pricewatch.com I noticed some pretty good prices on the GF3 ti200 and ti500. So I will likely be going with that....but then again the GF5s should be coming out within the next few weeks (according to a magazine article I read) I think, and the prices should fall even further...<br/>

&gt;hey can I ask if you have Luclin and use the new ui?<br/>
&gt;If so, can you tell me the Amount of Ram in the<br/>
&gt;system, the video ram, and the bus speed if you happen<br/>
&gt;to know it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;the reason I ask is I bought a new machine Intel<br/>
&gt;Celeron 1.2Ghz processor with over 300 MB ram and<br/>
&gt;Nvidia 32MB ram card. The game runs ok but I can&#39;t use<br/>
&gt;the new UI else I get Mouse lag or hesitation like<br/>
&gt;MAD.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And when spells are cast, the mouse is VERY slow.<br/>
&gt;the graphics are fine though and actually run smooth.<br/>
&gt;I have about 15 Luclin graphic images turned on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Let me know<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
