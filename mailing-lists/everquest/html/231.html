<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-628318084">I have played over T1 ( Old slow Tech) and my zone<br/>
time was 8-10 seconds. About the same for my cable<br/>
modem. I agree it is the line speed that affects the<br/>
zoneing time. My machine is a AMD 333 64MB with 8MB<br/>
Video I also have a Ultra SCSI drive which probable<br/>
has some affect when loading the zone graphics over<br/>
slower IDE drives. I played over a DS3 connection as<br/>
well and it was not much different as far a zone times<br/>
go. Ofcourse there is also the 2500 other people in<br/>
the building that have nothing better to do but surf<br/>
the web. Clogs up the line. Thats your tax dollars<br/>
hard at work on the TY site. I just changed jobs<br/>
however and now my work machine is serviced by a proxy<br/>
that wont pass EQ data. :(<br/>

&gt; Hiya<br/>
&gt;   i have a amd 400mhz 64mb of ps100 ram   16mb video<br/>
&gt; card-banshee<br/>
&gt; and an awesome creative 128bit sound card. however i<br/>
&gt; have NEVER zoned in   <br/>
&gt; less than a minute, usually more, i know a lot of it<br/>
&gt; is processor<br/>
&gt; i have hit zones withgroups and i am the last one to<br/>
&gt; wake up so to speak<br/>
&gt; the others had p2 350mhz etc  i do have a 33.6 modem<br/>
&gt; so i think it is<br/>
&gt; the modem connection that makes the biggest<br/>
&gt; difference, i wish my work<br/>
&gt; computer had a cd rom drive installed, its just a<br/>
&gt; p266 with 80mb but the<br/>
&gt; 45kps T1 connection would surely be nice as opposed<br/>
&gt; to my<br/>
&gt; 3.5 to about 4.0kps i get with my 33.6 modem. does<br/>
&gt; anyone out there<br/>
&gt; play on a recommended p200 or above system req and<br/>
&gt; use a T1?<br/>
&gt; i wold love to know the zone times ya get:)<br/>
