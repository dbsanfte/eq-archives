<div id="ygrps-yiv-260620927"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Gotta ask. What is SWG?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Star Wars Galaxies. And I have to say, this is the first place I have even<br/>
heard people happy about it.... myself, I&#39;m glad I got to beta it, because I<br/>
would have sure been ticked off if I had paid all that money for it! And I<br/>
waited for that game for years. What a disappointment. When I went to get my<br/>
pre-order deposit back, the manager said that they had been giving a<br/>
whooooole lot of deposits back...<br/>
<br/>
Guess I&#39;ll just wait for EQII.  :-)<br/>
