<b>Subject:</b> Well, asked Santa for a Gamecube <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-192879872">Our most current game platform is the N64, but that is my son&#39;s <br/>
exclusive property and resides in his room.<br/>
<br/>
The computer is shared, and getting another one, and another line (or <br/>
DSL on a network) is a bit costly for the family right now. So, a <br/>
game platform for the TV is just the ticket for when someone else is <br/>
playing EQ, or satisfying their email and surfing habit.<br/>
<br/>
Why Gamecube? Metroid Prime. Love the Metroid franchise. Don&#39;t mind <br/>
some of the cute (Mario, StarFox) games, either. Some are quite <br/>
playable, and often very good as far as gaming.<br/>
<br/>
I just wonder how much more money I can scrape together for endless <br/>
computer upgrades. Bottom line comes to at least $1700 to get current <br/>
with the specs for EQ, and a little bit ahead as well. I just don&#39;t <br/>
know where I can get that money right now.<br/>
<br/>
So, a cheaper alternative is the platform system. All things <br/>
considered, upgrades for that every few years will still be cheaper <br/>
than the big bucks I need for the computer.<br/>
<br/>
But the games, while good, are not the same.<br/>
<br/>
The up side is that there is much in the EQ world I can continue to <br/>
explore and enjoy even without the upgrades. I find the lag in Luclin <br/>
and POP to be a bit anoying, but acceptable for all but heavy combat. <br/>
My son will do battle even with the lag, but I avoid it. I find the <br/>
lag to be too distracting.<br/>
<br/>
I can quest there, use the bazaar, and transport system for my non-<br/>
druid alts. Plus, I have only just begun in Velious. Still lots to do.<br/>
<br/>
May just get lucky with a lottery ticket one day. Then a nice botique <br/>
machine would be mine.<br/>
<br/>
In case I don&#39;t get back on before the big day, Merry Christmas and <br/>
Happy Holidays to all. I really appreciate the EQ community, and this <br/>
group in particular. <br/>
