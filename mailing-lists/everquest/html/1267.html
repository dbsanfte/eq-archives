<div id="ygrps-yiv-305884532">Hi I am very new to EQ I have been playing for only one month. My <br/>
ranger is of the 7th season. He has almost a set of leather armor and <br/>
his skills are in the high 30s.  Am I were I should be or behind the <br/>
average ranger. I am currently looking to get in a group and explore. <br/>
<br/>
I know most people have been around so please understand I am still <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
