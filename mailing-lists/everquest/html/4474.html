<div><font face="Arial" size="2">So I made some serious headway tonight with my 
rogue.&nbsp; A few of my friends said that they&#39;d group in Dawnshroud at the 
Grieg&#39;s End zone.&nbsp; from 1:30-2:30 I made my way from Frontier Mountains to 
Dawnshroud Peaks.&nbsp; It took that long in rogue sneak/hide to avoid 
aggro.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t have a sow.&nbsp; </font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">We met up at Maidens eye zone.&nbsp; Myself, a 
ranger, a mage, another rogue,&nbsp;and a monk.&nbsp; I said &quot;Now if we only 
have a cleric&quot; and miraculously I see &quot;You guys need a cleric?&quot; appear on my 
screen.&nbsp; So the 6 of us made our way to Grieg&#39;s End zone line and set up 
base.&nbsp; For the next 6 hours we then proceeded to murder, slaughter, and 
bring the wrath upon tribals and anything else that dared cross our paths.&nbsp; 
In the ntire 6 hours we had only 3 deaths.&nbsp; The monk had a higher level 
cleric alt with a 75% rez so we were golden.&nbsp; Everyone in the group dinged 
at least once.&nbsp; Our group&#39;s cleric dinged 29 and got his new rez spell for 
which he was happy.&nbsp; It was a good time.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">After the group broke up, I hung around DSP to find 
another group.&nbsp; I was able to do so and we had a froglok warrior who was 
busting out the chain pulls.&nbsp; In the new group I managed to ding a second 
time.&nbsp; By midnight, a mere 9 hours into it, I went from one 6 blues to 33 
to 2 yellows into 34, which is equal to about a level and a half.&nbsp; Needless 
to say I was pretty pleased with myself, and I realized sometimes it&#39;s not about 
what you get to look forward to, but just the fun you have playing the 
character.&nbsp; So I&#39;m trying to finish off 34 this weekend and hopefully make 
some good headway into 35 - maybe even 36.</font></div>
