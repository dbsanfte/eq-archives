<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159855014">As a lvl 60 druid with a horse I&#39;ve got to say I never knew how much I needed my horse until I had him. For the aggro management alone it&#39;s worth the 8k.<br/>
I notice the difference drastically when I&quot;m grouped in outdoor zones opposed to inside zones. For example, had a group in Plane of Storms (outside zone) stayed on my horse and never got aggro once. Next night was in North Temple of Veeshan, tried to sit between fights and picked up aggro everytime something popped. From a casters point of view and the damage the mobs do with one hit at higher levels. One hit can sometimes be deadly. Wouldn&#39;t use the horse for solo&#39;ing because of the slow start stop time, but in groups it&#39;s the greatest.<br/>
<br/>
I love my horse, the only thing that I hate is the visual of the horses head and ears that get in the way of your targeting. The new LoY lizards supposedly do not have that problem so even if it&#39;s a 1.5k plat hit for a trade in. I might make the change. Although it will all depend on if I can find a lizard to match my new dyed blue outfit :-)<br/>

My pet killed a decaying skeleton and I looted some Decaying Foot <br/>
Bones. Any idea if there&#39;s a quest for them?<br/>

LOL, don&#39;t worry about not being able to find your body! I use to be scared <br/>
of the same thing, but trust me, you always find it. Besides, it stays there <br/>
for days, so you have a long, long time to find it and get your stuff back. <br/>
Just remember what zone you died in, and you will be fine. And if you can&#39;t <br/>
find it for some odd reason, call for a Necromancer... they have locate <br/>
corpse and can help you find it in no time! The only thing I worry about <br/>
when dying is losing experience because as you get bigger, it gets harder <br/>
and harder to gain any!<br/>

I know what you mean exactly! I don&#39;t understand at all why horses are so <br/>
expensive... it&#39;s not like they do that much. Being a druid, I don&#39;t need <br/>
one for fast transportation. It should be easier to get one. A lot of people <br/>
only buy them because they think others will praise their characters. I get <br/>
so annoyed with it, I turn horse graphics off a lot! That way NO ONE has <br/>
one, LOL.<br/>

&quot;...it isn&#39;t cheap...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I would do it for free with my Necromancer, Nevfalath, LOL. But don&#39;t worry, <br/>
it&#39;s not like you will go bankrupt. If they want a donation for locating <br/>
your corpse, just give what you can... it does not have to be expensive. I <br/>
usually donate 5 plat. when I make donations, and I never expect donations <br/>
when I buff, SOW, transport, ect. with my Druid. Some people might want <br/>
donations, some won&#39;t. Either way, it&#39;s nothing to worry about.<br/>

&quot;I&#39;ve been told you can med without hitting the sit key...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Even though that would be nice, is it really worth paying a TON of money <br/>
for? LOL. It&#39;s not hard enough for me to hit the sit key yet, LOL. I too <br/>
would like to know the benefits of a horse.<br/>

Ummm ok. Hint inc.....<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever noticed that you draw a lot more aggro sitting than standing<br/>
or are you always soloing instead of grouping?<br/>
