<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593747963">It worries me now as well. I havent played EQ since May of last <br/>
year, and was hoping to return next month if all goes well. I am cer <br/>
worried about my two accounts..which havent been paid for in quite <br/>
awhile...I hope they are still all good and such. I put alot of <br/>
time, effort, sweat, and tears into them and wou;d hate to loose <br/>
them..<br/>
<br/>
Sigh..I guess time will tell...<br/>

&gt; Yeah. I&#39;m going to talk to them when their CS opens today. I had a <br/>
problem with my mother&#39;s account and them saying she didn&#39;t have the <br/>
new expansion registered. I had to email them and complain. They <br/>
took care of it fairly quickly. Considering they might lose 4 <br/>
accounts from me, they better do something when I contact them. <br/>

&gt; &gt;If they still owe you time or $$$ then contact them and sort it <br/>
out. Don&#39;t take a disabled acc. as an answer!<br/>

&gt; &gt;  I may be through with EQ now. I went to login to check my email <br/>
and apparently for no reason my account was shut off. I have no idea <br/>
why. Well, I have an idea and it might be the same fuck up as with <br/>
my brother&#39;s account previously. So, I have to decide whether or not <br/>
I want to bother renewing because they will probably charge me a <br/>
higher price. I had a 3 year subscription dammit. It just pisses me <br/>
off that they pulled this with me. I&#39;m thinking of writing them an <br/>
angry letter of complaint. I should wait til I&#39;m less angry though.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  ARG. Just ARG!!!<br/>
&gt; &gt;  luv,<br/>
