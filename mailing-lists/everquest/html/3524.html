<div id="ygrps-yiv-1043713602">The new &quot;old&quot; models are working fine for me, on both my comps. Have been since about the day after the patch. The female is a bit skinny, but the male is good. Personally I like the more slender look. The vah shir were just too buff looking before. Plus, my video card likes the less polygons.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This was on EQ castersrealm on July 24......  seems like the &quot;old world&quot; vah shir models are not working yet.  I have not seen anything on any of the sites that says this has been taken care of...<br/>
&gt;This extra message was added by Absor to the Patch Message on the Developers Corner: We forgot to include a comment in the patch message about the removal of the 10% healing penalty for non-clerics. The penalty was indeed removed with this patch.<br/>
&gt;Also, while weve included the new old-world Vah Shir models in the patch, you wont be able to turn them on yet. Well have to patch another file to allow you to choose to turn them off in the interface. That should happen soon.<br/>
