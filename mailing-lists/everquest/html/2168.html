<div id="ygrps-yiv-437558862">I leveled in Highpass from 19 to 35. It is sometimes hard to get on the list<br/>
but if you are playing a desirable class (one that they would want in group)<br/>
then it&#39;s easier. If you&#39;re above 25 you can go with a group into the<br/>
Warrior room in Highpass.<br/>
As for 29.. I think the Sarnak Fort in Lake of Ill Omens is ok. Best to have<br/>
a group. Just be prepared to get a LOT of requests for sow. People are<br/>
always shouting for sow. Shamans and druids are very sought after. As are<br/>
the elusive clerics. (there never seem to be clerics around when people want<br/>
them).  Groups looking for a healer will sometimes settle for a druid<br/>
instead of a cleric.<br/>
The only zones I hunted in were Lake of Ill Omens, Frontier Mts, and The<br/>
Overthere. I didn&#39;t spend much time in OT. I spent most of the time in LoIO.<br/>
So I recommend there as a good starting place. Even at 35 there are some<br/>
mobs that still yield xp.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Thanks for the info. I will run by Highpass and purchase a bit of ore<br/>
&gt; to try out. See just how hard hunting my own will be. I might be wise<br/>
&gt; to postpone the visit to Kunark for a few more levels, from what I<br/>
&gt; have read here. I am sure I can find something useful to do for a few<br/>
&gt; levels. Any suggestions for possible good zones in Kunark to work<br/>
&gt; through those levels? Might be good to do my leveling there after<br/>
&gt; all. Once I have a Kunark bind point I can move back and forth<br/>
&gt; quickly enough.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Any higher level tailors out there? I am lvl 70 in tailoring, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; working toward making Halfling tailored and imbued armor. I am a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; level 29 halfling druid, able so far to brew and smith the various<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; parts I have needed to make my reinforced leather armor. I am<br/>
&gt; soon to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; be off to Kunark to obtain my brute hides. Anyone been a brute<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hunter, who can give me any advice?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; High quality ore drops off of pickclaw warriors and raiders in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Highpass/Highkeep (I can never keep it straight which is called<br/>
&gt; which). You<br/>
&gt; &gt; would need a group at your level. Since you are a druid, people<br/>
&gt; would really<br/>
&gt; &gt; want you in group there. Sow can be cast. And if you have regen and<br/>
&gt; other<br/>
&gt; &gt; beneficial spells they will love you. Especially since you can<br/>
&gt; heal. If you<br/>
&gt; &gt; have coin to spend, go to highkeep and auction to buy high quality<br/>
&gt; ore.<br/>
&gt; &gt; There are usually some players who will part with it. I think the<br/>
&gt; small<br/>
&gt; &gt; bricks go for around 5pp and the large bricks around 10pp.<br/>
&gt; &gt; You too!<br/>
