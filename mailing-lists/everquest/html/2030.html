<div id="ygrps-yiv-1625812948">I&#39;m sure they did su..  Can&#39;t compare EQ to Sims..  That&#39;s apples to<br/>

the point though, the 3D-gaming industry is going through many changes atm.<br/>
Not to mention a phase out of an operating system.  They will all feel the<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not saying they shouldn&#39;t change at all, but I think they should try to<br/>
consider their current customer base and what systems they have before<br/>
making drastic changes. Look at Sims. They make expansion packs but they<br/>
don&#39;t require you to change your system everytime a new expansion comes out.<br/>
Considering how addictive EQ is, even without the new graphics engines<br/>
people would still be playing. They could still add to the game by making<br/>
new zones and such without requiring a change in directx programs. They<br/>
could find other ways to make the game better without changing the system<br/>
requirements so drastically. What if they expanded the game one day and<br/>
changed the system requirements to the point that you could not afford to<br/>
upgrade? What then? Would you be a happy camper? While verant may be getting<br/>
a few more customers who can handle the higher end requirements, they are<br/>
alienating older customers with lower end systems. In the long run, that<br/>
kind of attitude toward customers is bad for business. If Verant doesn&#39;t<br/>
give a fuck about their current customers then they will start to lose<br/>
business. If I were the VP I would find some way so that there would be some<br/>
servers set aside so that the lower end systems could still play on them--<br/>
which is what the GMs have been suggesting. And I certainly wouldn&#39;t release<br/>
a game full of bugs before it had been fully tested. I would also have<br/>
research done and surveys to find out just how many people would no longer<br/>
be able to play with their current systems and factor that into my decision<br/>
on what types of changes could be made without alienating a large customer<br/>
base. Change is important in some regard, but so is reliability and<br/>
integrity. So far, Verant seems to be lacking the latter two. -Su<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I understand you feel strongly about this, but you don&#39;t need to <br/>
&gt; resort to insulting people.<br/>
&gt; EQ could easily survive if they didn&#39;t constantly change the<br/>
&gt; graphics and<br/>
&gt; such on the game bc the game is so dynamic with so many places to<br/>
&gt; explore<br/>
&gt; and things to do that they could leave it the same way for 3 years<br/>
&gt; and many<br/>
&gt; people would be happy.<br/>
&gt; Developing things for old tech, so long as it will work with new<br/>
&gt; tech is<br/>
&gt; smart. It gives them a broader customer base. Have you ever taken<br/>
&gt; any<br/>
&gt; business classes?<br/>
&gt; -Su<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry Su, but here&#39;s your tissue.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Gawd damn you whine alot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some facts:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;are you saying that people with more money are more important?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, a customer with money is alot more important to a company that is<br/>
&gt; trying to make a good earning than a customer without money. A<br/>
&gt; customer with<br/>
&gt; money adds a flavor of long lasting customer relation ships. You<br/>
&gt; however,<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t meet these standards (you self who said it). So, you think<br/>
&gt; Verant<br/>
&gt; should keep the old game just cause some of the old customers, who<br/>
&gt; btw<br/>
&gt; bought this game which clearly stated on the bottom of the box that<br/>
&gt; OS and<br/>
&gt; hardware requirments could/will change, can&#39;t pay for the new produc<br/>
&gt; that.<br/>
&gt; You know the product that will keep EQ alive and not let it die<br/>
&gt; before the<br/>
&gt; end of the year.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Get real Su, if they wouldn&#39;t have updated EQ they wouldnt survive a <br/>
&gt; month. A company that chose to develop shit for a old tech ain&#39;t a <br/>
&gt; company with a<br/>
&gt; long lasting future.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have seen my friend&#39;s computer run. Trust me, it can&#39;t handle<br/>
&gt; Luclin. It<br/>
&gt; probably can&#39;t handle velious come to think of it. But now that I<br/>
&gt; think<br/>
&gt; about it, his system is probably considered obsolete to most<br/>
&gt; &quot;serious<br/>
&gt; gamers&quot;.<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t mind me. I&#39;m stressed out bc my neighbor stole stuff from me<br/>
&gt; and had<br/>
&gt; the gall to cuss at my mother when she asked where the stuff was<br/>
&gt; when he was<br/>
&gt; the only one who could&#39;ve taken it. (and so I don&#39;t sound like I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; jumping to conclusions, he was a tenant in our house for awhile and<br/>
&gt; alot of<br/>
&gt; the stuff we left in his care is gone).<br/>
&gt; *sigh*<br/>
&gt; going through unpacking hell right now. moving sucks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sorry but if its brand new... It will run, if not theres something<br/>
&gt; wrong<br/>
&gt; &gt; with your pc.  How do you know your friend&#39;s system cant handle<br/>
&gt; it?  If ya<br/>
&gt; &gt; want to post things like this please include your hardware so that<br/>
&gt; we can<br/>
&gt; &gt; get to the bottom of this issue.  Basically the only new<br/>
&gt; requirements to<br/>
&gt; run<br/>
&gt; &gt; EQ without Luclin are as follows:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; DirectX 8.1    That&#39;s it...  Nothing more :) Enough already.<br/>

&gt; &gt; My sister had a brand new computer-- not a doorstop but even it<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; handle the new changes. EQ does not still support low end. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; worried<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; they will someday upgrade beyond my range of being able to afford<br/>
&gt; new<br/>
&gt; &gt; hardware. My finances are about to take a hit. My dad is getting<br/>
&gt; me new<br/>
&gt; RAM.<br/>
&gt; &gt; He has the same computer. And I was gonna get a friend of mine to<br/>
&gt; start<br/>
&gt; &gt; playing EQ but now his system won&#39;t be able to handle it. I just<br/>
&gt; wish<br/>
&gt; things<br/>
&gt; &gt; weren&#39;t such a hassle. But it could be worse. luv, -Su<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Theres a difference between low end and a door stop.  EQ still<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; supports<br/>
&gt; &gt; low<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; end.  It&#39;s the obsolete systems that were still able to play<br/>
&gt; before<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that have been left in the cold.  Don&#39;t worry they will find a<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, and maybe $265 isn&#39;t that much for you. But to some other<br/>
&gt; people<br/>
&gt; &gt; that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a hell of a lot. I know people who had to get their comps on a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; rent-to-own basis and can barely afford EQ as it is. And yeah,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; easy to say they should quit, but they enjoy playing and it&#39;s an<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; escape for them. To<br/>
&gt; &gt; suddenly<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; not be able to play is a major burn. I just wish there was a way<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Verant could work it out to be friendlier with their lower end<br/>
&gt; not so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; financially stable customers. It would be the nice thing to do<br/>
&gt; if<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; nothing else. Btw, someone mentioned where to get good RAM for<br/>
&gt; cheap?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Where was that again? I just found out my comp can have up to<br/>
&gt; 1Ghz of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; RAM with it&#39;s motherboard<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; chipset. luv, -Su<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    I have to disagree about not being to upgrade.  It does not<br/>
&gt; cost<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that much.  I bought a new chip board case and fan that only<br/>
&gt; cost me<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; $265 after tax.  Most of the other stuff can form my old<br/>
&gt; system.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The chip is a AMD Athlon 950.<br/>
