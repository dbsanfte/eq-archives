&gt; &gt; Ok then you all want me to type with good grammer  ok I will do<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; grammar<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; so.......while i am typeing email&#39;s to you all at least. But my<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; typing<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; friends have probably gotten used to me typeing that way so i am<br/>
&gt; &gt; going to keep typeing on eq. But ok see .......am I typeing ok so<br/>
&gt; &gt; far?? any way, I just  think it is easier and faster so people dont<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; anyway<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; have to wait forever to hear a response when they want it and<br/>
&gt; &gt; especially while they are excited...am I correct? I am 14 years old<br/>
&gt; &gt; and going on 9th grade, k-6 is elementry for me and 7 and 8 are<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; elementary<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; middle school and 9-12 is high school..........so I have been going<br/>
&gt; &gt; to school around 10 or 11 years, my mom put me in school when I was 5<br/>
&gt; &gt; years old. Ok is everything all cleared up and all or does some one<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; someone<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; else have a problem or challenge for me?  c ya l8er......oops i mean<br/>
&gt; &gt; see you all later-----lori<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t bother pointing out the numerous errors in capitalisation and<br/>
&gt; punctuation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Actually, I&#39;m not a grammar-nazi, but if someone tries to maintain that<br/>
&gt; they can do something then make several errors in doing it I feel<br/>
&gt; obliged to point them out. We learn from our mistakes it is true, but<br/>
&gt; only once they are pointed out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope you and your friends enjoy EQ Lori, it is a great game, and if<br/>
&gt; they are fine with the way that you type then that&#39;s cool, but it is<br/>
&gt; worth learning the standards of the rest of society too so that when you<br/>
&gt; do need to communicate with people outside your peers you can do so with<br/>
&gt; ease.<br/>
