<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503993394">OK very simple question to think about, and I am at the moment if you must<br/>
ask......If a store or other business gave the customer service that VI<br/>
does, would you keep doing business there? VI has the CRAPPIEST cs I have<br/>
EVER seen in a businness, at least one that is still in operation. They net<br/>
WELL over $3 million dollars a month, just from OUR monthly payments, they<br/>
can sure as heck afford to instigate some decent cs.</div>
