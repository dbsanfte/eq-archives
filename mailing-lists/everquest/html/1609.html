says it&#39;s YOUR responsibility to keep your account secure.. Well, there&#39;s not a 
damn thing in hell you can do if your dorm mate decides to run a sniffer and 
there he&#39;ll be able to read your login name and password in plaintext.. But 
Verant still thinks that it&#39;s the players responsibility.. *sigh* braindead 
fools...</font></span></div>

  account &quot;hacked&quot; into. &nbsp;I would have <br>thought that as long as I didn&#39;t 
  give out my information that I would be <br>safe. &nbsp;I have friends who are 
  aware of the name yes but have no clue about <br>the password. &nbsp;And as 
  their accounts are worth far more than mine I don&#39;t see <br>that they would 
  try to figure out the password, plus, I don&#39;t see them as the <br>kind who 
  could figure out how to hack into my computer. &nbsp;But if for some 
  <br>reason we were hacked into....and I lost all my stuff and character...I 
  would <br>cancel my subscription and sell my game. &nbsp;No way would I 
  tolerate losing that <br>and keep paying. &nbsp;But I&#39;m guessing this isn&#39;t a 
  every day thing right? &nbsp;I <br>mean it makes me think of AOL and how they 
  are constantly saying don&#39;t give <br>out your password. &nbsp;
