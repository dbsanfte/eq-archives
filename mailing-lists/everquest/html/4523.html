<b>Subject:</b> Slow load and zoning <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166958188">Hello - just joined this group.<br/>
<br/>
My son is very a very enthusiastic EQ player, but is constantly <br/>
frustrated by the initial loading times (about 10 minutes) and in <br/>
particular time to go from one zone to the next - about five minutes <br/>
on average. Very often it crashes back to the server screen after a <br/>
long wait.<br/>
<br/>
The PC is a PII 450 with 384Mb RAM and a 60GB hard disk, 90% of which <br/>
is free. The graphics card is a 16MB nVidia Riva TNT. Internet <br/>
connection is a fast 512Kbs ADSL.<br/>
<br/>
Is this normal with EQ, and if not, how long should it take to load <br/>
and zone? What can be done to really speed things up?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Regards.</div>
