<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255468472">I&#39;ve got armor that looks good *and* kicks ass. I got a Burynai Legion Gi<br/>
for my cleric. He looked rather silly with the magic silk pants (which<br/>
didn&#39;t show up so it looked like he was pantsless) and a dwarven ringmail<br/>
tunic. But now he looks really cool.<br/>

&gt; field then in a fashion show :&gt; (sorry my TRY at wit)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;On a side note the Kobolds near the king, maybe other places too I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; &gt; sure, drop some of THE BEST looking weapons in the game.  Stats not too<br/>
&gt; &gt; good about like FS but the looks are great.<br/>
