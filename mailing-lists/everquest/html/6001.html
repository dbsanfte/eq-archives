<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757953623">Well, it depends on the purpose of the character. If the character is going to hunt, then they definetly need to build their skills.<br/>
I do have some characters that I don&#39;t plan to hunt with, I just plan to use them for tradeskilling. As soon as I get my gnome enchanter to 16 I&#39;m going to start working on tinkering. Although I may have to get to 20 just to get to abysmal sea. Not sure.<br/>
<br/>
If you can get a cleric to cast Temperance on you and an enchanter to cast brilliance and gift of magic on you it should help some. You will still have to fight but it can help you. The only thing you need to be careful of is to realize that when you do not have the buffs things will be alot tougher.<br/>
<br/>
The way I PL with a druid is to cast HP buffs, regen, and a damage shield on the character and their pet (if they have a pet). I snare the mobs and heal the player when they need it.<br/>
<br/>
With my cleric I can cast Temperance on the player, Mark of Retribution (which makes the mobs take damage whenever they hit something) and Mark of Kings (which heals the player whenever the player hits the mob) on the mob. I then heal whenever the player needs it and sometimes stun the mobs when they try to run.<br/>
<br/>
IF you are going to get powerleveled you really really need to practice your spells. Cast see invis over and over and over until it skills up as much as possible.  Also, keep in mind that the person PLing might not always be able to see your health and may have trouble targetting at times. <br/>
<br/>
I always made sure to practice swimming and senseheading and spellcasting with my characters to make sure their skills were high even if they were riding xp (although none of them really were PLed).<br/>
<br/>
I actually found a way to PL a higher level ranger with my level 12 bard. The ranger was high enough level that I couldn&#39;t get xp with her and the mob was red to me, but I played my selos so she could run and would run up and melee the mob when it tried to hit her. I was fast enough I could outrun him when he tried to hit me back. Not sure if I had snare song then... The ranger (played by my mother) didn&#39;t know how to get range attack to work and didn&#39;t find out until she was level 34...<br/>

Hey, I wouldn&#39;t Power lvl a caster. In my opnion, you need to be working on your spell skills and power lvling will get you past your skill and your spells will fizzle alot. Just what I learned the hard way. Hope it helps.<br/>
