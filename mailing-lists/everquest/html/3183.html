<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233688280">I was hunting in SK, and trying to buy fs weapons. Very few hunting <br/>
there, so lots of wandering Gnolls to pick off. That happens when the <br/>
Gnoll hunters are not many at the spires, some gnolls wander off.<br/>
If the spire camps are busy, but the groups are not large enough to <br/>
take every gnoll that pops, a tracker can locate wanderers and pick <br/>
up a gnoll or two.<br/>
<br/>
And so, learning that none had fs for sale, I went to the area near <br/>
the hermit. Sure enough, I picked up a wandering gnoll right away. He <br/>
dropped a fs warhammer, which I took home to Rivervale. I broke it <br/>
into ore, and made my hq metal bits. Grabbed the parts, went to the <br/>
Vale forge, and gave it a shot.<br/>
<br/>
I now have my Vale Sewing Kit. Pretty exciting. I will have to head <br/>
out for Velious soon to start gathering the pieces for the Halfling <br/>
100% weight reduction bags. Should be some big coin in those.<br/>
