<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372740385">What is the brand of your card? A gforce 3 or gforce 4ti will <br/>
probably be your best improvement. Then more memory. At the present <br/>
prices you could probably get a gforce 3 plus up your memory to 512 <br/>
for around $200. It would be a good move. I have even seen gforce 4ti <br/>
for around $175. Hopefully you have agp slots. I have only pci, so I <br/>
cannot do as I have recommended for you. sigh.<br/>

&gt; I just bought a new machine and have a question.  I<br/>
&gt; had some Mouse issues but I solved those but now I get<br/>
&gt; a little skip in the movement when I run or walk.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is like frame by frame.  The machine is a 1.2 GHZ<br/>
&gt; machine with 384 Ram and 32 MB video card.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now, my question is, &quot;Does the video card with EQ make<br/>
&gt; the difference or is it RAM?&quot;  The reason I ask is<br/>
&gt; because when you choose the Luclin images it tells you<br/>
&gt; how many to pick based on Ram and not Video memory.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So does EQ use RAM more so than Video ram or not?<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t mind getting a 64 MB video card but I want it<br/>
&gt; to work.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My friend also sees the same issues but only has 256<br/>
&gt; mb ram<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
