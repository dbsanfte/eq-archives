<div id="ygrps-yiv-5887039"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">I thought it asked you that also, but I noticed the last couple times I was 
<br>fighing and encumbered in SK and went to drop the copper I had that it didn&#39;t 
<br>ask me if I wanted to so maybe they changed it. &nbsp;My new favorite illusion. &nbsp;
<br>The skeleton illusion. &nbsp;I have put that illusion on and walked around the FP 
<br>end of EC near the newbies...OMG it was funny. &nbsp;My husband and I had the best 
<br>laughs watching this one dude RUN from me. &nbsp;When he finally stopped after 
<br>like 2 minutes of me chasing him, I asked if I scared him and he realized I 
<br>wasn&#39;t a real skeleton and he said yes I conned red to him and he thought I 
<br>was going to kill him. &nbsp;I told him I only wanted to give him haste and then I 
<br>buffed him and left. &nbsp;LOL. &nbsp;It&#39;s also funny when people send their pets to 
<br>fight me and then the pets say that&#39;s not a legal target master and the 
<br>person is trying to figure out why. &nbsp;Or when I&#39;m medding in skellie form and 
<br>they try to loot my bones...LOL. &nbsp;This is why I love my enchanter.

<br>That reminds me, isn&#39;t the game supposed to ask you if you want to drop your
<br>money when you are clicking it over something? Bc I tried to trade money
<br>with someone once and it didn&#39;t trade but the money was gone. The person
<br>informed me that I had dropped it on the ground. I had not meant to drop it
<br>and it didn&#39;t ask me if I wanted to.. Was that a glitch?
