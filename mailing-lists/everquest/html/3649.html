<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155645072">You really don&#39;t need armor, your pets will defend you.  But why not <br/>
do the newbie armor quests?  They provide armor better than a lowbie <br/>
can afford, with stats.  They provide extra mana, HP&#39;s and Int as <br/>
just a few of the benefits.  If you&#39;re determined not to get it then <br/>
raw silk is the next choice. <br/>

Got a<br/>

cloth<br/>

hehe) </span></blockquote></div>
