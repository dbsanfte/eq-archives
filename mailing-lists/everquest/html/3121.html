<div id="ygrps-yiv-1152764392">Heres one idea: You have the natural ability to forage. Use it. Forage<br/>
cinammon sticks and you can sell them to other players. I had a player pay<br/>
me 20pp per stick! So for 2 stacks I had 800pp.<br/>
Also, you can go specific places to forage specific things. Kithkoor has the<br/>
hard to find oak bark. If you fee like it sometime, sit just inside the zone<br/>
to kith (in case you need to run if undead come) and forage til you get<br/>
some. It may be time consuming but the payoff is worth it when you can sell<br/>
it. Morning dew is also in high demand. You can also sell foraged vegetables<br/>
to non-foraging races for baking. Baking may be worth your while. You can<br/>
also work on brewery using vegetables. Once you are good at it you can make<br/>
heady kiola to sell to tailors for raw silk. You can also offer to track<br/>
things for a fee.<br/>
At your level foraging in gfay is your best bet.<br/>
Also kill as many pixie tricksters as you can. their wings sell to venders<br/>
for a decent price.<br/>
Oh, and I played on test server the other day and they have all sorts of new<br/>
creatures in gfay. drakelings, evil treants, etc. If and when they become<br/>
part of regular servers you may be asked to track specific mobs like<br/>
decaying skeletons (which were in short supply).<br/>
Most importantly, be friendly. I have found that being nice to people has<br/>
been profitable. People gave me money just for showing them where places<br/>
were.<br/>

&gt; these websites with these huge secrets to making plat. but who<br/>
&gt; knows.  I just started, and didn&#39;t know this game could be so<br/>
&gt; addictive.  I am a wood elf ranger.  I boosted all my bonus points<br/>
&gt; to str at 90.  So its not so bad.  Im only level 3 though.<br/>
