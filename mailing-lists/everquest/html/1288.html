  About loot order<br><br></font></div><font face="arial,helvetica"><font size="2">I 
  love when I am grouped with a good effective group and they loot fairly. 
  &nbsp; <br>But that like you said isn&#39;t always the case. &nbsp;Ok first a 
  totally off the <br>subject complaint with grouping...as an enchanter who can 
  mez...don&#39;t hit the <br>mezzed mob! &nbsp;Ok, had to get that off my chest. 
  &nbsp;I hate when they do that. &nbsp; <br>And I tell them not to and they 
  still do it. &nbsp;Ok, with the looting. &nbsp; <br>Yesterday it was FFA and I 
  was trying to keep haste on tanks and everyone&#39;s <br>breeze going and tashan 
  and languid pace on mob and so there was a lot of <br>medding going on and I 
  wasn&#39;t getting loot. &nbsp;When I did loot I never got but <br>a few silver or 
  gold. &nbsp;The others were looting gems (which I could use ) and <br>tasarin 
  pages (which I really need) and was offering to buy. &nbsp;Well I meant to 
  <br>do a guild tell saying The bad thing about having to med in a group is I 
  miss <br>out on all the loot. &nbsp;Well guess what...I did a group tell. 
  &nbsp;Well then the <br>main tank started telling me to loot. &nbsp;She said 
  looting isn&#39;t going to take <br>away that much med time. &nbsp;And I also 
  started saying hey can I have that <br>Tasarins because no one else could use 
  them in the group but me. &nbsp;I like the <br>alpha loot 2 times no split. 
  &nbsp;I think it works good if people follow it. &nbsp;I <br>hate FFA!

 TYPE="CITE">Recently in some of the groups I&#39;ve been in, we&#39;ve had a few 
    problems with <br>loot order. Often, the tanks will insist on FFA. But since 
    I play the main <br>healer and am expected to sit and med (only getting up 
    to heal) I get <br>totally screwed. I never get loot. But then when we try 
    to establish alpha <br>loot some people complain. They don&#39;t care about the 
    casters. All they care <br>about is getting loot for themselves. These 
    people partake in <br>&quot;ninja-looting&quot;. They loot everything really fast so 
    nobody else gets a <br>chance. And even when we establish a regular loot 
    order some people will <br>still loot out of turn. <br>And then we have 
    times when people say we roll for certain types of loot. <br>When I first 
    joined a group, this one guy told me it was ffa (and he was a 
    <br>ninja-looter) but that &quot;bronze&quot; and ore were rolled for. I saw that he 
    <br>picked up an FS morning star and wanted to roll for it (bc it&#39;s an 
    expensive <br>item). He said no, it was only for bronze, not FS. So later he 
    picked up a <br>bronze weapon. I said, &quot;ok, let&#39;s roll for it&quot;. He said, 
    &quot;no, that&#39;s only <br>for bronze armor&quot;... <br>Has anyone else had this 
    problem? <br>What do you think is the best and fairest loot order? <br>Just 
    wondering. <br>luv, <br>-Su <br>ps. alpha loot with 3 loots per turn (per 
    person) works pretty well when <br>people cooperate.</blockquote></font><font
