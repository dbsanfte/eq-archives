<div id="ygrps-yiv-16042132">I have been playing EQ for about 2 months now and have been telling <br/>
my sister all about the game. She has recently got a computer and <br/>
bought EQ. So now we have started playing together. This is the first <br/>
thing we have had in common in 20 years. A little weird to be killing <br/>
orcs with your sister but cool. Respond if you like not looking for <br/>
any though.</div>
