potions with her shammie. :-)<br/>
Not to mention Bear form is adorable.<br/>

&gt;  FINALLY someone Mentioned the shaman. =D I started playing EQ in January.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I now have a level 40 Vah Shir shaman that rocks. I have damage over time<br/>
spells that can do around 2000 pts in damage in just under 2 minutes,  Plus<br/>
a pet who can do the rest of the damage while the dot&#39;s are doing their<br/>
work.  Like Orion said,  I have SOW, plus buffs that enhance all melee<br/>
stats.  With the click of a button, I can give my whole group SOW with an<br/>
attack bonus on it. I also have a spell that does the same with Strength.  I<br/>
can increase your Agility, Dex, Stamina all by 30.  by the time I get to 60<br/>
I will have a spell that increases those stats by 120 AND your attack by<br/>
120.  I have buffs that increase your HP and AC although they are not as<br/>
powerful as a clerics, combined with the stat buffs they more than make up.<br/>
I also have stat debuffing spells that can slow a mob,  decrease strength,<br/>
and decrease their resists so that a wizard or any other spellcasting class<br/>
can nuke the mob.  There are also a few nukes a shaman can get although not<br/>
as powerful as a wizard.  We can also act as back up healers if the cleric<br/>
is OOM or getting hit.  Overall,  I think that the shaman is one of the best<br/>
balanced classes and a great class to start with.   Although the mid range<br/>
armor (totemic) IS a might difficult to get =D  (finally just got my totemic<br/>
BP)  I would suggest starting either a vah shir,  or barbarian as they can<br/>
go more places without being killed everywhere they go.  As a vah shir,  I<br/>
am KOS to very few places =D  Sorry about the soapbox,  but I love my<br/>
Shaman.  I also forgot to add that at 25 (you&#39;re better off starting at 30)<br/>
you get alchemy..  you can make potions that you can sell to other players<br/>
like SOW, & invis vs undead which can be quite handy...  Oh,  Shamans also<br/>
have the ability to gate.<br/>
