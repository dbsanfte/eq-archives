<div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am new to the bard 
class.&nbsp; I jsut made level 5 and was wondering does a bard ever get to use a 
weapon and an insterment?&nbsp; I noticed both the level 1 and the level 5 song 
both do better with a drum but when i have it equiped i can&#39;t use a wepoan in my 
primary hand.&nbsp; This makes it difficult to fight unless i use hand to 
hand.&nbsp; Please let me know if they ever get to use insterments and weapons 
at the same time thanks.</font></div></html></div>
