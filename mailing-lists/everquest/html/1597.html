<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062087298">It&#39;s not a question about &quot;trying&quot; to support so and so many. It&#39;s a<br/>
question about keeping a quality level of a product you try to sell to the<br/>
world. It&#39;s THEIR product, and face it, they can&#39;t take care of their own<br/>
customers. However, they know how a successfull buissniss work and it sounds<br/>
to me they are only trying to keep up the competition till SW are shipping.<br/>
EQ don&#39;t have very much against the massive amount of new MMORGs that are on<br/>
the way.<br/>
<br/>
And 24h/7, not a chance. I live in Sweden and there&#39;s hardly ever any CS<br/>
staff online at our hours and i can&#39;t even call them untill it&#39;s late here<br/>
just to be placed in line for a hour or two, wich costs me about $1 /<br/>
minute.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers.<br/>

&quot;To me it&#39;s amazing at all someone gets a petition<br/>
answered.   How many other games out there even<br/>
attempt to support 200k+ users with direct online<br/>
face-to-face access to a support staff on a 24hour<br/>
basis.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
None.<br/>
<br/>
How many other games make $3 million + a month not including sales of new<br/>
games?<br/>
<br/>
None.<br/>

<br/>
If you look at the matter seriously you&#39;ll find 100k+<br/>
players on a day with only 10 average support staff<br/>
per server (includes guides, senior guides and GMs)<br/>
they do become overwhelmed at times.  Behind the<br/>
scenes they do a great job supporting the EQ community<br/>
as a whole.  The turn over rate for guides, the<br/>
mainstay of Verant&#39;s CS staff is rather high.  This<br/>
makes it difficult to have a smooth flowing CS<br/>
operation staff on a regular basis.  The rate is high<br/>
due to a few reasons:  <br/>
<br/>
1. It&#39;s difficult for most to play and be a guide.<br/>
2. Some can&#39;t handle the workload average 100-200<br/>
petitions a shift (depending on shift hours, time of<br/>
day,  etc.).<br/>
3. Burn out<br/>
4. Some just get tired of irate players =)<br/>
<br/>
They are constantly retraining new support staff and<br/>
attempt to provide the best possible assistance.   To<br/>
me it&#39;s amazing at all someone gets a petition<br/>
answered.   How many other games out there even<br/>
attempt to support 200k+ users with direct online<br/>
face-to-face access to a support staff on a 24hour<br/>
basis.   Hehe... Hey if you feel the system has a<br/>
problem join the CS staff and try and change the<br/>
system for the better.   I dare ya...<br/>
<br/>
Just FYI - To process a surname request:  <br/>
<br/>
1. Apprentice/Guide answers a petition and takes down<br/>
your information...<br/>
2. Boots up your petition to a higher level and waits<br/>
in the queue till a Senior/GM can make the change. <br/>
GMs work on a 5 day on 2 day off schedule.  Senior<br/>
Guides are not always available.   They do have SWAT<br/>
GMs however a surname change would not fall under<br/>
emergency support.<br/>
3. Your request also gets posted to a bulletin board<br/>
after the Guides shift to be handled as soon as<br/>
possible.<br/>
4. Either a Senior Guide fulfilled a request from the<br/>
Board or you were lucky enough to have one online the<br/>
second time you petitioned.<br/>
<br/>
BTW... Problems like name changes... guides don&#39;t have the<br/>
ability to make the change, so its normal to not have<br/>
it acted upon immediately.<br/>
