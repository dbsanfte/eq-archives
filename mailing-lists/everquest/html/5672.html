<div><font face="Arial" size="2">This may or may not be here nor there, but it 
appears to me that the lag problem and DX9 patches they&#39;ve had only affect 
certain video cards.&nbsp; As I said, I run a P4 1.8 Ghz with a gig of RAM and a 
128MB ATI Radeon 9200 video card.&nbsp; I very rarely have game stopping 
lag.&nbsp; It lags mostly in POK and bazaar when there are high concentrations 
of people, but I drop my clipping distance to 0 and its smooth as butter.&nbsp; 
My system&#39;s not even as powerful as some others I&#39;ve seen/heard who still have 
lag issues so I&#39;m thinking it must be video card related.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any 
thoughts?</font></div>
