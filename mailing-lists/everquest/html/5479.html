<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718708139">Hi Peg,<br/>
My sister and I read your post and it brought back memories LOL. I <br/>
just found about about 6 months ago that you could find out <br/>
information about items that vendors sell by right-clicking on them. <br/>
Duhhhh. When I first started playing, I bought so many items, only to <br/>
find that I couldn&#39;t equip them - waste of money! But some nice <br/>
higher-level person told me how to do the &quot;right-click&quot; thing and <br/>
saved me a TON of time and money.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I found out the hard way was that you can&#39;t travel to <br/>
all places without getting killed. I traveled with my Erudite <br/>
Enchanter to Neriak to buy one of the Enchantment spells and a guard <br/>
hit me before I even zoned off the book good. Hang in there, you&#39;ll <br/>
get the hang of it all. Just takes some trial and error.<br/>
