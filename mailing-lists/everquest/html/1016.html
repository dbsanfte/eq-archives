<div id="ygrps-yiv-605639408"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">I&#39;m a newbie. &nbsp;I&#39;m up to level 9 with my enchanter. &nbsp;I have a little 
<br>list...yes I actuallly write down the names LOL...of the people who have 
<br>really helped me and when I&#39;m at a high level and am able, I will repay all 
<br>those nice favors. &nbsp;And when I can, I help the newer than me newbies. &nbsp;Oh and 
<br>I also have a don&#39;t help list...there&#39;s 2 names on there....

<br>Anyway....It&#39;s a good thing to help newbie&#39;s when you see one. &nbsp;Helped a
<br>newbie by explaining the /loc command and showing him around Kelethin.
<br>turns out that that made his level 40 brother very happy...now he wants to
<br>make me happy (hopefully NOT in that way)
<br>
<br>so...the moral of the story is:
<br>
<br>Help newbies....you just might be helping them help you in the long run.
