<b>Subject:</b> OT: Heads up, prevent some yahoo spamming <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-889874641">Yahoo has added a &quot;marketing&quot; area to the account set up area of groups.<br/>
When you go into it you will see that they have set you to &quot;yes&quot; on<br/>
everything. I highly advise everyone to go in and change it.<br/>
When you&#39;re logged in at Yahoogroups, click on Account Info on the top right<br/>
corner of the screen. Enter your password when prompted, then below the<br/>
listing of your email addresses, you&#39;ll see a link for &quot;Edit Marketing<br/>
Preferences&quot;, click on that. You&#39;ll see it&#39;s set to Yes (please send me<br/>
spam) on every option. Set them all to No, don&#39;t forget the two towards the<br/>
bottom of the page about phone and snail mail spam and click the button to<br/>
save it.<br/>
Thanks to Laura Trout for passing this along.<br/>
luv,<br/>
-Su</div>
