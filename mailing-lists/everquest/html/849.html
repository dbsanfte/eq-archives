<div><font face="Arial" size="2">While the following is a spoiler - it describes 
travel to and from Kunark.<br>I &quot;wasted&quot; a good four hours of time so unless you 
consider waiting for and<br>on boats for long periods of time a vital part of 
the role-playing<br>experience - I would suggest you read on.<br><br>OBLIGATORY 
SPOILER 
SPACE<br>*<br>*<br>*<br>*<br>*<br>*<br>*<br>*<br>*<br>*<br>*<br>*<br>*<br>*<br>*<br>*<br><br>1) 
Oasis Route.&nbsp; There is a raft on the Oasis dock - it will take you to 
an<br>Ogre Village in Timorous.&nbsp; I believe these are the &quot;Broken Teeth&quot; 
Islands on<br>the cloth map.<br><br>You will be taken to an Ogre village.&nbsp; 
The Ogres I saw conned green to me -<br>but there are probably a goodly number 
of them. I wasn&#39;t KOS - but I guy I<br>eventually hooked up with was...&nbsp; If 
you are working your way back - the loc<br>is +7000 +3300<br><br>I ended up 
finding the wrong dock - there is an &quot;Evil Boat&#39; That will take<br>you to The 
Overthere.&nbsp; This is a nasty zone.&nbsp; It&#39;s an undead City.<br>Everything 
Conned red to me - and to a 48(?) Paladin I hooked up with.&nbsp; The<br>boat 
&quot;Looks&quot; Evil so you&#39;ll know it if you see it.&nbsp; We didn&#39;t get off 
the<br>boat (one of the con&#39;ed red things was literally ON the dock).<br><br>We 
zoned back to that dock.&nbsp; If I recall properly it was also an 
Ogre<br>Village.&nbsp; If my notes are correct the loc for this dock is neg 5000 
neg 3700<br><br>Through shouts we got the loc of the High-Elf village with the 
correct dock<br>to Fironia Vie.&nbsp; IF my notes are correct - (they are pretty 
cryptic at this<br>point) the loc is neg 200 pos 3600. You shouldn&#39;t have probs 
getting exact<br>loc from people who are making the return route as the boat 
stops there.<br><br>We had to swim a lot to get there - but I&#39;m not sure whether 
this is true if<br>you know where you&#39;re going from the Oasis Raft Dock.&nbsp; I 
thought I heard<br>someone say &quot;Go to South End of the Island&quot; which would imply 
no swimming -<br>but perhaps it was &quot;Go to the South Island&quot;<br><br>Regardless - 
for me -&nbsp; I explored the boat (IT&#39;S HUGE with spots yet<br>unfilled for 
NPC&#39;s) I didn&#39;t realize that I ended up on the wrong side of<br>the boat and had 
to make the circuit twice.<br><br>REMEMBER - DOCKS ON LEFT SIDE OF BOAT - so for 
this route - you stay on the<br>left side of the boat from the dock you got on 
at the High Elf Village to<br>get off at Fironia Vie.<br><br>From when I left 
Oasis to when I actually got to Fironia Vie - 3 hours.<br><br>I got bound - and 
then went the short way from the city to the tunnel that<br>takes you to 
Dreadlands and hooked up with a pickup group.&nbsp; There was a lot<br>of 
confusion and problems with a Ranger who eventually got booted.&nbsp; 
There<br>was an excellent Bard - Ripkey (I don&#39;t think he was on the list) in 
the<br>group however.&nbsp; Among other annoying things - the Ranger kept 
telling us to<br>&quot;Sing Heal During Combat&quot;<br><br>But shortly there after - 
Several guildmates (led by Guild Leader 43 Level<br>Druid who tp&#39;d to the 
Dreadlands) got on - and I wanted to hook up with<br>them...<br><br>2) Wizards 
and Druids can TP to the Dreadlands.&nbsp; This is a huge zone - I<br>believe 
larger than anything pre-expansion.&nbsp; Plenty of hunting grounds.<br><br>We 
spent an hour or so (including several dumps) trying to figure out how 
my<br>Guild&#39;s group could get to me without luck.&nbsp; Arkin died once...&nbsp; 
Then we<br>decided the only way to hook up would be for me to travel back 
to<br>Butcherblock and get a TP from Druid Circle.<br><br>The negative - on 
release day at least - no one had found the way from the<br>TP spot to the zone 
Fironia Vie (the High-Elf City) - hopefully that will<br>change soon.&nbsp; The 
Guild group and I couldn&#39;t hook up until I did the<br>painfully long boat trip 
to BB for pickup.<br><br>3) Butcherblock route.&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the OTHER dock 
in Butcherblock from the<br>Freeport boat.&nbsp; There will be little shuttles - 
this will zone to Timorous<br>Deep and connect to the Boat.&nbsp; The boat is 
very large.<br><br>BUG REPORT - I went the opposite direction - so can&#39;t confirm 
it - But an EQ<br>Vault they reported probs with Shuttle. Take the 1st on one 
route.&nbsp; If your<br>shuttle doesn&#39;t hook up with the loading dock on the 
side of the boat - jump<br>off and climb up the rudder.<br><br>The shuttles 
connect with the right side of the boat.&nbsp; Move to the left<br>side.&nbsp; 
There are a couple of stops in Timorous - this zone is the equiv. 
of<br>OOT.&nbsp; Don&#39;t get off here if you&#39;re going to Fironia Vie.&nbsp; 
Eventually it will<br>zone there and the dock on the left side.<br><br>I did the 
return route - had just missed the boat in Firnonia.&nbsp; Took about<br>an hour 
(I&#39;m not kidding)<br><br>So far I&#39;ve only seen 2 zones - and the Dreadlands at 
least are so big I<br>doubt that crowding will be an 
issue.<br><br>Slyde<br></font></div></html></div>
