<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757465799"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Hi all i am 56 mage and as far as the the adventures go i love<br/>
&gt; them...they are great aa exp even better when a 56 mage id group with<br/>
&gt; all higher lvls i got about a yellow of aa each time and took home<br/>
&gt; about 200p. Being a poor mage always soloing i forgot what team work<br/>
&gt; is like, but you really need it in LDoN. I have won about 11 lost<br/>
&gt; about 5..and those losses resulted in fools for being in the<br/>
&gt; group..so one word of advice for people never been in lost dungen..<br/>
&gt; bring your best friends and you will have a blast.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Despite the fact that my groups have all failed at the adventures so far, I<br/>
actually had alot of fun with my pick-up groups. I met some cool people and<br/>
we got along really well. We may not have succeeded but we all had fun and<br/>
got some decent loot.<br/>
But bringing close friends is ideal. I plan to get together with some of my<br/>
guildies next time I group.<br/>
luv,<br/>
