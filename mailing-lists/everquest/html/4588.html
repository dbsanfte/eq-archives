<b>Subject:</b> Greetings fellow Questers <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123291954">I have mostly played Shamans and have had a blast. Thanks to the <br/>
others here I have been able to advance my Shaman into the high 20s.<br/>
 <br/>
I now have a problem and again ask for some help...I am trying a Bar. <br/>
Beastlord. <br/>
<br/>
I now need to find a place to move on to and advance in levels, with <br/>
my shaman I found I &quot;ran in to a wall&quot; at 15th level and it was like <br/>
pulling teeth to make 16th , 17 and 18th levels. I want of avoid this <br/>
with my BL.<br/>
<br/>
 I have made it to 15th level (thanks to Mammoth calfs and wrath orc <br/>
wristbands) I have all my spells for 15th level, most of my armor is <br/>
magic or BL newbee Quest armor. I have the Newbee Claw,and a harpoon <br/>
I could use a better hth weapon but by all acounts I am doing good.<br/>
<br/>
Where does a 15th level Bar. Beastlord hunt to make levels in good <br/>
time?<br/>
<br/>
I thank you and will keep you all informed on how I do.<br/>
<br/>
