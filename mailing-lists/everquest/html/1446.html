<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533426660">1.) You might be able to sneak across thier line of sight depending how far<br/>
away you are.  Its allways best to sneak behind.  Once you have the hide<br/>
skill you will hide first (make sure you get the msg that you have hid<br/>
succesfully) then sneak (again make sure you get the right msg) at this<br/>
point you will be invisible to almost every mob in the game (there are some<br/>
that will see you, but most will not, con them to see).<br/>
<br/>
2.) Without going into a long reason as to why, yes it is allways better to<br/>
attack mobs from behind, even if you are not a rogue (unless your main tank<br/>
then sure you dont want to be attacking from behind much that means he is<br/>
hitting someone else).  Plus its good practice for you to attack from<br/>
behind.  You are a Rogue.<br/>
<br/>
3.) Sense traps tells you where the traps are.  Disarm, well, disarms them.<br/>
And yes there are many traps in Velious (Velks Labryinth, Dragon Necropolis,<br/>
Plane of Mischief, Skyshrine maybe more).  <br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] Hi, I am new & stupid :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have a brand spankin&#39; new rogue and I have some questions.  I would<br/>
greatly appreciate any feedback.<br/>
<br/>
1)  How does &quot;sneak&quot; work exactly?  Can I sneak across someone&#39;s line of<br/>
sight?  What is the difference between &quot;Sneak&quot; and &quot;Hide&quot; that comes later?<br/>
<br/>
2)  I do not yet have the &quot;Backstab&quot; ability.  Does it do me any good to<br/>
attack monsters from behind without the ability yet?  I have been making an<br/>
effort to do just that, but should I not even bother?<br/>
<br/>
3)  I noticed that &quot;Disarm Traps&quot; is a later ability, but I cannot recall<br/>
having ever seen or heard of a trap in EQ.  Can anyone give an example of<br/>
where and when this ability would come in handy?  And how do I know that<br/>
there is a trap around to disarm in the first place?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for being so naive, but thanks for any help.<br/>
<br/>
