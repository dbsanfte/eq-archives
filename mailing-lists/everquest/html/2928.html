 </span></blockquote>Allakhazam has been getting the requirements for all the newbie armor <br/>
quests in all the time.  It&#39;s not only Freeport but Neriak too.  My <br/>
Necro Alt has an almost full set of Unholy Silk armor.  There is <br/>
usually someone new in the Guild to ask about these.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a good deal for newbies, or lowbies in our case.  They are all <br/>
similar to the stuff introduced in SoL for beastmasters, with some <br/>
minor stat improvements, mana, hp&#39;s, etc.<br/>
