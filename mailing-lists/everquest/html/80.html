<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1595835568">I am a jewelry maker by trade but I&#39;m looking for info on all craft skills.  <br/>
The things I&#39;m looking for the most is what you can make at certain ranks and <br/>
how much they sell for. Any kind of info, be it websites or things you&#39;ve <br/>
found out on your own or things you&#39;ve heard from friends etc, would be much <br/>
appreciated. I&#39;m also looking into forming a traders guild or something like <br/>
it on the Rathe server. If your interested in helping e-mail me. Please put <br/>
Trade Skills or Trader Guild in the subject so I don&#39;t accidentally delete it.<br/>
<br/>
Thankee Much,<br/>
