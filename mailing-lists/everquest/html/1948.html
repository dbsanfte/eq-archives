I only tried to play for 30 minutes or so after I got my upgrade.  The <br/>
graphics look really great but there&#39;s now such a terrible lag and since <br/>
most of my requirements meet the &quot;recommended&quot; except the memory (mine&#39;s at <br/>
256M) which meets the minimum, I&#39;m terribly disappointed.  I couldn&#39;t even <br/>
play with the new race at all, which was one of the convincing points for <br/>
coming back to play in EQ.<br/>
