<div id="ygrps-yiv-226317591">I agree with Su on giving and such but I think Alex<br/>
was just stating managing monies and such.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a good thread would be<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Ideas on managing Guild Money!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Verant should actually consider this topic in new<br/>
releases since it encourages grouping and Guild are<br/>
the best facilitator for that trait.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Its around the account is personal and cant be<br/>

&gt; &gt; bla. I do agree very much that you shall keep your<br/>
&gt; account safe and all<br/>
&gt; &gt; this, but in a large scale operations guild its<br/>
&gt; IMPOSSIBLE to not share<br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; &gt; account with a few people that you trust. This is<br/>
&gt; essential to day to day<br/>
&gt; &gt; operations. You choose a couple of people who you<br/>
&gt; trust and hand them your<br/>
&gt; &gt; info.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; Actually it is not impossible. Sharing account info<br/>
&gt; is a way to get your<br/>
&gt; guild banned from the game.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1 example. Guild property and funding. A single<br/>
&gt; person cannot manage the<br/>
&gt; &gt; trades/funds/hand out of items for the guild. This<br/>
&gt; would be a full time<br/>
&gt; job<br/>
&gt; &gt; for 1 person in my guild. Our solution is a<br/>
&gt; separate account shared among<br/>
&gt; &gt; the officers with mules for cash / gems / spells /<br/>
&gt; items. On our<br/>
&gt; &gt; messageboard transactions take place and a member<br/>
&gt; can ask any officer to<br/>
&gt; &gt; complete a transaction once its validated on<br/>
&gt; board. This is clearly<br/>
&gt; against<br/>
&gt; &gt; the EULA but since there are no support for these<br/>
&gt; types of operations with<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; central store for a guild we have not found a<br/>
&gt; better way to handle work<br/>
&gt; like<br/>
&gt; &gt; this. How do others solve these types of problems?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; See, we don&#39;t keep an armory in my guild. We used to<br/>
&gt; have one but the person<br/>
&gt; who had all the stuff either stopped playing or<br/>
&gt; switched to a different<br/>
&gt; server so nobody could get the stuff.<br/>
&gt; Rather than having an armory, we help other members<br/>
&gt; obtain items if we can.<br/>
&gt; We believe that people should earn the items they<br/>
&gt; get and they can either<br/>
&gt; buy them off of another member or we help them to<br/>
&gt; obtain it. In some cases<br/>
&gt; items are given to members but it all depends on the<br/>
&gt; individual players and<br/>
&gt; what they like to do. We don&#39;t like begging and<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want to encourage it<br/>
&gt; in our guild.<br/>
