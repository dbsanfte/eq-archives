&gt; Hiya Lisa, <br/>
&gt; As a former SK owner and powerleveler to some insanely twinked <br/>
toons, I can hopefully give you some advice on your shadowknight.  <br/>
You&#39;re probably still around level 17 to mid 20&#39;s so if you have some <br/>
plat to spend, you can get some descent to good gear in the bazaar <br/>
for pretty cheap.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; First things first, HP and AC are Gods to an SK.  All other stats <br/>
can take a flying leap backwards if it means sacrificing either of <br/>
these all important stats.  But if you wish to look for gear with <br/>
a &quot;tanking&quot; SK in mind, look for AGI, STA, STR, DEX items in that <br/>
order.  Here&#39;s why<br/>
&gt; Agility = Raises Armor class and the ability to dodge incoming <br/>
attacks all together.  30 AGI may allow you to avoid a 90hp attack <br/>
all together so this helps emensely.<br/>
&gt; Stamina = Increases hitpoints and the ability to mitigate damage.  <br/>
It won&#39;t do either well until higher levels but 4hp for every 1 sta <br/>
does add up and getting hit for 89hp instead of 92 does add up after <br/>
a while.<br/>
&gt; Strength = Raises attack power and the cap to hit.  instead of <br/>
hitting for 54, a higher strength will allow you to hit for 57. its <br/>
not much but every little bit counts.<br/>
&gt; Dexterity = At low levels, increasing this stat means you will <br/>
learn Weapon skills faster (2HB, 1HS etc) so getting some gear that <br/>
has some high Dex wouldn&#39;t hurt in the least.  This skill should be <br/>
the least of your worries but that doesn&#39;t mean ignore it<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; As for Weapons,<br/>
&gt; Let me first stress to you the UBER importance of practicing on all <br/>
of your weapon skills.  <br/>
&gt; 1HS, 1HB, 2HS, 2HB and Piercing<br/>
&gt; There are good weapons for each of these types for SK&#39;s so it would <br/>
be a shame if you won the Plane of Time SK 1HB weapon only to find <br/>
you have 13 skill in it.  Since you&#39;re still at a low level (which is <br/>
a good thing btw), you can still correct any mistakes you&#39;ve made in <br/>
gear/weapons/quests/faction.  If you are still in your high teens and <br/>
low/mid 20&#39;s in terms of levels, look for weapons in the bazaar that <br/>
have mediocre damage but high delay.  I&#39;ll explain why.  Getting a 50 <br/>
damage 40 delay weapon is going to do crap for you since you&#39;re <br/>
weapons cap in damage output until you reach certain levels.  Did you <br/>
notice that the sporiali defender suddenly hit(s) harder at level 20 <br/>
than it did at level 18 and 19?  Thats because you &quot;dinged&quot; into your <br/>
new level cap which I believe is around 100-110hp.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; If you are confused, just look at it this way.  Look for all types <br/>
of weapons with VERY fast delay (between 20-30) and damage of no more <br/>
than about 25-35.  These weapons are only temporary as once <br/>
you &quot;ding&quot; into your next damage cap at around level 28 or so, you&#39;ll <br/>
want to upgrade your weapons again to slightly higher damage output.  <br/>
Whats the point of having a 50 damage weapon if the damage cap makes <br/>
it only a 25 damage weapon.  Makes sense?<br/>
&gt; You&#39;ll have 5 or so Damage caps (lvl 10, 20, 28, 35ish, and 45) <br/>
until you reach level 51 when you&#39;re damage cap is removed and you <br/>
can hit for full damage.  This is far down the road but something to <br/>
look forward too.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; BTW, if you can afford it, there is a very nice 1HS sword that <br/>
drops in Walls of Slaughter that if you can afford it (12K on my <br/>
server last I checked back in August), it would serve you VERY well <br/>
even at lower levels.  The damage/delay ratios even when level capped <br/>
make it a surprizingly excellent weapon at all levels of play.  <br/>
Sorry, don&#39;t know the name of it off hand.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Good luck to you Lisa, <br/>
&gt; SK&#39;s are a fun class to be.  I LOVED my Iksar SK until I recently <br/>
retired.<br/>

&gt; Thanks for the info :)  Will look into that--My SK is only Level 17 <br/>
&gt; atm so not even sure if she has the &quot;casting darkness&quot; spell yet.  <br/>
&gt; Right now I have &quot;clinging darkness&quot; but alot of the higher level <br/>
&gt; mobs are resisting my spells and its really frustrating.  <br/>
&gt; The weapon we have now is a Sporielli Defenders Blade???  it does <br/>
28 <br/>
&gt; damage with +5 DEX but that is all---so I should go with a better <br/>
&gt; stat weapon?? with more HP/AC  ???  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks !!!<br/>
