it did make me a much better player in the long run. That was before <br/>
breeze came out too, so it was ultra hard. I have had my current <br/>
character for quite some time. I kind of twinked him with some basic <br/>
stuff like banded armor and a mino axe but nothing extravagant. I got <br/>
him from level 23 to 30 in about a week though when I started playing <br/>
him again. Of course, Xegony was one of the first servers and <br/>
everyone is totally twinked and power-leveled on that server. There <br/>
are some aspects of the game I know a lot about, like the classes and <br/>
their roles in a group. I know a lot about the enchanter and wizard <br/>
classes as I have a level 40 enchanter and wizard. That is good that <br/>
you are trying out different classes but eventually you will have to <br/>
figure out which one to concentrate on. What classes are you playing?<br/>
<br/>
First off, get some friends!  Since you&#39;re good in groups remember <br/>
who you were with.  It&#39;s a big help getting into guild if you know <br/>
someone.  When you see them around just say hey, soon they&#39;ll start <br/>
looking for you.  That&#39;s the best part!<br/>
<br/>
Group skills are probably the most important thing you can have in <br/>
the game.  As a Ranger you are sometimes asked to pull, and you need <br/>
to know how to do that.  Otherwise you&#39;re a backup to the tank.  The <br/>
roles change several times during the game as you progress in <br/>
levels.  Now I feel how poorly Rangers tank when the Mob puts the <br/>
smack down on me!  Maybe I should change my name to Manasponge! LOL<br/>
