<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; ok you guys i need some help. I started a Dark Elf Shadow Knight<br/>
&gt; yesterday. Everyone says i picked a bad combination and they are<br/>
&gt; extremely hard to play with, but thats why i picked it. Anyways I<br/>
&gt; need me some armor and a good weapon. Can one of you ppl that know<br/>
&gt; alot about the game, suggest me a good weapon and a good fix on armor<br/>
&gt; within the range of 100pp for the weapon and 100pp for the armor? I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; really appreciate it. Right now I have Kodiak claws that hit for 9<br/>
&gt; dmg. They are pretty quick too, and only weight 1.0. So please if you<br/>
&gt; are gonna suggest a weapon plz suggest one better than that. My body<br/>
&gt; armor is 15ac too, so don&#39;t really have to suggest body armor....<br/>
&gt; Well, thank ya lots, peace.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ohh by the way, I forgot to mention in my last post, I play on<br/>
&gt; Bristlebane.... Jaspher...<br/>
