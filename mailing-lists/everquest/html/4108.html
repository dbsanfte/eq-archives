<div id="ygrps-yiv-173318875">Hey thanks for the feedback. I look forward to signing on!What is <br/>
the story behind this game? (I know some might say &quot;Read the box&quot; <br/>
but actually, I got the first CD in for 10.99 in a bargain bin at a <br/>
Game Stop) Are there enemies? Or other players enemies? What is the <br/>
benefit to joining a guild?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
ps: this is definitely a stupid question, but are there like city <br/>
locales in which maybe a thief might try to pickpocket etc? That&#39;s <br/>
one thing I used to love to do in the Baldur Gate series in the <br/>
larger cities.</div>
