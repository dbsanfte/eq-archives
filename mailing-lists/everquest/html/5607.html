<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335645011">It seems crazy to me that Sony should be willing to sacrifice many of <br/>
their loyal users for the sake of a minor upgrade, especially when <br/>
everything worked well before.<br/>
<br/>
Our PC is about 5 years old, it is a PII 450, but which was very <br/>
recently upgraded to a new NVidia GEForce, the max 384Mb RAM and a <br/>
60GB hard disk, all of which was done at the time for EQ.<br/>
<br/>
I am sure they will have to do something about this, if this group is <br/>
anything to go by, there wiill be tens of thousands of people affeted <br/>
by this &quot;upgrade&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Regards. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We have DirectX 9 with all the latest graphics card drivers. Today <br/>
&gt; Everquest auto downloaded the DX9 patch, and that has slowed EQ <br/>
 </span></blockquote>down <br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; to the point where it is virtually unusable.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Has anyone else seen this, and is there anything that can be done <br/>
&gt; about it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you very much. </span></blockquote></div>
