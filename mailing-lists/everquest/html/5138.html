<div id="ygrps-yiv-339147683">Cool! I&#39;ve found that the easiest missions to do are outright slaughter<br/>
missions. You have to kill x number of mobs. Usually we churn through them<br/>
pretty fast. It&#39;s pretty fun.<br/>
You generally need someone for crowd control. I was grouped with an<br/>
excellent bard who handled crowd control, haste, cure disease/poison, mana<br/>
regen, tracking,  and being main looter. We finished with about 20 minutes<br/>
to spare and went on to kill the named. Got 22 points for that one<br/>
adventure.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; The suggestion worked well.  I was playing my 29 alt<br/>
&gt; barbarian warrior and was the lowest of the party (35<br/>
&gt; Human Ranger, 34 Dwarf Paladin, 33 Froglok Cleric, 35<br/>
&gt; Woodelf Druid, 32 Iskar Monk).  I got the mission and<br/>
&gt; we churned thru it, got to the target and killed him<br/>
&gt; with very few problems.<br/>
