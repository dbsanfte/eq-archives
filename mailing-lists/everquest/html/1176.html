<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-822616073">Is it just me, or is it taking longer and longer to connect?  I couldn&#39;t<br/>
even get past the login screen for 5 or 10 minutes.  Kept saying that it<br/>
couldn&#39;t connect to login server.  Never had that happen unless it was down<br/>
for a patch (which it wasn&#39;t).  Also noticed that the times when I choose<br/>
my server, and going to the character screen, and the time from the<br/>
character screen to the game are much longer.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m running a Celeron 533 w/ 185 MB ram, windows ME a cable modem, and<br/>
about 2GB of drive space for windows to write to.  Any suggestions?</div>
