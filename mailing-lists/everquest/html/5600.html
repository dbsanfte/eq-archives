<div id="ygrps-yiv-430299007">I have a friend that ran a Rogue and was no worse that dubious in <br/>
ever city but Cabalis.  He also has a Troll that can go in most light <br/>
cities.  It&#39;s a long and hard road to follow, and as has been said <br/>
PoK makes it a moot point.  <br/>

&gt; if you are wanting to do this just for fun be advised it will take <br/>
&gt; along time.. I have a 45 iksar beast and have not raised any <br/>
&gt; factions and with POP  it doesnt matter anymore..  Being KOS is not <br/>
&gt; the problem it use to be.. Also your religion can keep you KOS no <br/>
&gt; matter how many things you kill..  If you are doing this for fun <br/>
&gt; good luck. but its not needed .<br/>
