<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469603610">The only task I could get was the dreadlands as well.  It sent me to scout <br/>
out a lava flow in skyfire.  To get the ok message I had to get in the lava <br/>
and aggroed several mobs.  Thank goodness for sow, I out ran them then <br/>
ported out.  The next task was to explore the first bridge in Veeshan&#39;s <br/>
peak.  It is locked and requires a key that is no small quest.  This is not <br/>
soloable.  Oh well, back to grinding.  This is typical, SOE&#39;s idea of solo <br/>
only requires a group of 5 or 6.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve now got a couple of my characters working on tasks. My 49 ranger was<br/>
&gt; advised by the task masters to go to Rathe Mountains for a task. I did, <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; everything was pointing me to Lower Guk. I&#39;ve never really been through<br/>
&gt; Upper and Lower Guk, and going that far underground with a ranger just <br/>
&gt; makes<br/>
&gt; me concerned.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I abandoned the task. The next thing I tried was getting a task from a <br/>
&gt; task<br/>
&gt; master in Overthere. It sent me into Burning Woods, where one of the <br/>
&gt; things<br/>
&gt; I had to do was enter the giant fort and scout it out. To accomplish that, <br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; discovered I had to run into the middle of the fort. I was invisible, but <br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; soon as I got within agrro range, I started wailed on by a giant.<br/>
&gt; Thankfully, a group was pulling giants from the fort, so it was somewhat<br/>
&gt; abandoned. I trained a giant or two out and ran for the zone line. The <br/>
&gt; next<br/>
&gt; step is to kill 10 skeletons (can&#39;t remember exactly what type, but I know<br/>
&gt; they con dark blue -- not sure how well bow-kiting will work in such a <br/>
&gt; busy<br/>
&gt; zone).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Frustrated with such difficult and dangerous tasks for my 49 ranger, I <br/>
&gt; tried<br/>
&gt; a task with 10 cleric. I was sent into Innothule Swamp from a PoK task<br/>
&gt; master and told to kill 10 bull alligators (most con white, some a healthy<br/>
&gt; dark blue). I had to run for my life and died about 10 feet from the PoK<br/>
&gt; book. I didn&#39;t realize bull alligators helped each other out. I got <br/>
&gt; trounced<br/>
&gt; by two of them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m becoming increasingly convinced that tasks are not soloable. :(<br/>

&gt; The only place that would give me a task was in the<br/>
&gt; Dreadlands, and it sent me ( a 52 Druid) into Chardok<br/>
&gt; for a recon mission.  Thought it couldn&#39;t be that bad,<br/>
&gt; but I had never been to Chardok before.  The mission<br/>
&gt; was to enter the fort inside Chardok and explore the<br/>
&gt; area around the first bridge.  Went in and found the<br/>
&gt; fort (was invised) opened the door, it squeaks and<br/>
&gt; every mob in Chardok seems to have heard it, and what<br/>
&gt; resulted can only be described as Woodelf paste.<br/>
