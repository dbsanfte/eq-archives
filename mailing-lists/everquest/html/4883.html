<div><font face="Arial" size="2">So this is just a question to find out what kind of 
hardware you use to run EverQuest.&nbsp; I suppose a Ps/2 counts as well since 
you can technically run a version of EQ on it, but I was more curious as to 
everyone&#39;s computers.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Me, personally, I have two accounts.&nbsp; I have 
two PCs I run EQ on.&nbsp; One PC is a PIII 1.2Ghz with 1GB of PC133 SDRAM, a 
128MB ATI Radeon 4X AGP card, a SB Live! Gamer audio card with digital audio 
out, a set of Creative&nbsp; FPS2000 4 point surround sound speakers, and a 19&quot; 
flat screen Samsung monitor.&nbsp; Great sound and great graphics, but lags a 
little on Luclin and the newer zones. </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">the second system is a P4 1.6Ghz with 640MB of 
PC133 SDRAM, a 64MB ATI Radeon 4X AGP card, and using the onboard AC97 sound for 
the time being.&nbsp; It does do digital audio out, but I only have a set of old 
Labtec speakers.&nbsp; Also, the monitor is a 17&quot; Gateway E200 monitor.&nbsp; 
</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I use Roadrunner cable to connect so it all works 
pretty well.&nbsp; I don&#39;t plan on upgrading the PIII any more, but I will make 
more changes to the P4.&nbsp; I plan on putting it up to a full gig and a half 
of RAM and upgrading to a 128MB video card and a SoundBlaster Audigy card.&nbsp; 
So when I get the money as they say...&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Hopefully next 
month!</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Anyway, that&#39;s what I use.</font></div>
