minutes or so before I got back to where I was.<br/>
<br/>

char.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; corpse, with all your equipment, will poof after<br/>
&gt; half an hour of game time or 24 hours of real time<br/>
&gt; if you are not logged on. I think that is intended<br/>
&gt; to discourage low level characters from wandering<br/>
&gt; too far from home.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you got killed a second time going after your<br/>
&gt; first corpse and you had nothing on the second<br/>
&gt; corpse, that corpse might poof within a few minutes<br/>
&gt; (not sure), but your first corpse with your gear on<br/>
&gt; it would stick around for the allotted half hour.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Thanks, Solid advice to me.<br/>
&gt;   So, it sounds like when I die, I would lose mets<br/>
&gt; say a shield and sword then?<br/>
&gt;   If so, then I get it now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Thanks<br/>

&gt; question, please help<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     &gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt;     &gt;Forgive my ignorance but I am a newbie had a<br/>
&gt; 4th level Druid in the city of<br/>
&gt;     Elves and while out at the Orc &gt;Camp, with<br/>
&gt; others, I got killed by an Orc<br/>
&gt;     Centurian and when I returned to get my corpse,<br/>
&gt; nothing was &gt;there.  It was<br/>
&gt;     not more than 4 minutes when I returned.<br/>
&gt;     &gt;<br/>
&gt;     No problem. All of us were newbies once.<br/>
&gt;     &gt;<br/>
&gt;     &gt;Question: Is it possible for someone to Steal<br/>
&gt; or Loot my corpse? The book<br/>
&gt;     says no but I beg to differ.<br/>
&gt;     &gt;Is it possible that I had two corpses out<br/>
&gt; there? Meaning, When I went back<br/>
&gt;     with a dead body I died again?  &gt;Which meant I<br/>
&gt; found the wrong corpse?<br/>
&gt;     &gt;<br/>
&gt;     You must have found the second corpse. It can be<br/>
&gt; tough sometimes getting the<br/>
&gt;     right corpse if you die more than once. And<br/>
&gt; sometimes if you don&#39;t have any<br/>
&gt;     items other than foraged food, you lose the<br/>
&gt; foraged stuff anyways and just<br/>
&gt;     get back the food you started with. Up to level<br/>
&gt; 5 I think you get your<br/>
&gt;     food/drink and tome of discord back. I think<br/>
&gt; your starting weapon too.<br/>
&gt;     &gt;<br/>
&gt;     &gt;And to add one last question, &quot;what do I do<br/>
&gt; now? seeing as I have no food,<br/>
&gt;     no money, no nothing?&quot;  Do I &gt;beg or do I start<br/>
&gt; another char?<br/>
&gt;     &gt;This game is totally fun but with the fact of<br/>
&gt; trying to learn which way to<br/>
&gt;     go all the time and dying, it is starting &gt;to<br/>
&gt; get to me,<br/>
&gt;     &gt;I don&#39;t want to give up just yet and I turned<br/>
&gt; to this board since the Chat<br/>
&gt;     from the game options was &gt;USELESS.<br/>
&gt;     &gt;<br/>
&gt;     Well, if it bugs you that much, you can start<br/>
&gt; over again. But even if you<br/>
&gt;     lose everything, at that low level you can just<br/>
&gt; keep the character and just<br/>
&gt;     build your items and such back up again. I<br/>
&gt; recommend that you not carry<br/>
&gt;     anything you really don&#39;t want to lose until you<br/>
&gt; get level 6. Keep<br/>
&gt;     everything else in the bank. Especially your<br/>
&gt; money. Oh, and practice<br/>
&gt;     foraging alot. It will help you later on in the<br/>
&gt; game. Trust me. Begging is<br/>
&gt;     not a good idea. Begging tend to piss people<br/>
&gt; off. And you might want to<br/>
&gt;     avoid orc camps at that level. at least stay<br/>
&gt; close to the lift with a good<br/>
&gt;     group and have someone to pull wandering orc<br/>
&gt; cents. I think even some orc<br/>
&gt;     pawns might give you xp at that level.<br/>
&gt;     &gt;<br/>
&gt;     &gt;Please help and Thanks in advance<br/>
