Subject: [EverQuest] AllaKhazam and recommeded levels<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I was looking something up on AllaKhazam when I took a peek at some<br/>
&gt; of the new item reviews. One in particular looked good for my druid.<br/>
&gt; A nice drop in Luclin. I investigated the journey and the target<br/>
&gt; creature, and it looked quite do-able for my character. However, I<br/>
&gt; was confused by the review on AllaKhazam stating that the recommended<br/>
&gt; level to attain was 50. I am lvl 30, and the npc doing the drop is 25-<br/>
&gt; 25. The journey, though long, is not particularly difficult, at least<br/>
&gt; from what the maps and bestiary information indicate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Am I missing something about these recommended levels on the<br/>
&gt; AllaKhazam reviews?<br/>

Having been to Luclin the reasoning is that alot of the creatures undercon.<br/>
I was reading about a single mob that was about lvl 35 that was killing<br/>
GROUPS of lvl 50+<br/>
I found that the green cons were resisting my spells and hitting alot harder<br/>
and faster than they should have. also, in some places (particularly echo<br/>
caverns) there are plants that are not npcs. They are more like traps. they<br/>
can root you and kill you but you cannot attack them.<br/>
I think they really need to work on the lvl info on the mobs in luclin.<br/>
