<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563266742">If i got a clerc that would tell the group they will bail as soon as things<br/>
starts to look bad i would just stick around and wait for a real clerc. The<br/>
game is dull when played safe, the game is actually fun when played towards<br/>
the limits of what can be done.<br/>

Ämne: Re: [EverQuest] Gaming Death<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I absolutely hate game death and try to avoid it whenever possible. I let<br/>
people know right off that if I think I am going to get killed I will flee.<br/>
A dead cleric isn&#39;t very helpful. Especially since I only have a 21.6k<br/>
connection and we&#39;re talking about waiting 5 or more minutes to reload from<br/>
death. When my mother is playing also, my zoning like that can cause her to<br/>
lag very badly. If she has to zone or gets killed then one or both of us get<br/>
booted offline. And I lose alot of xp. So that isn&#39;t fun.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My locution in the previous message expressed my feelings toward game<br/>
&gt; death, and raised my curiosity. What are other player&#39;s attitudes<br/>
&gt; toward game death?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I play solo most of the time, and haven&#39;t had a guild to depend on<br/>
&gt; since Wave of Change faded away. So, death, especially death in<br/>
&gt; awkward circumstances, is more serious to my character. I can&#39;t just<br/>
&gt; call on my guild reserector to pull my butt out of the grave, nor do<br/>
&gt; have high level guildies to drag my corpse out from under some big<br/>
&gt; nasty.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My son-in-law plays with abandon. He leaves corpses all over the<br/>
&gt; place, joins groups readily, and seems to have great fun doing all<br/>
&gt; that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My son, on the other hand, is in a powerful guild on our server. He<br/>
&gt; is less cautious than me, but still uses sound strategy and tactics<br/>
&gt; and utilized his guild to advance on his goals. His guild is the<br/>
&gt; Guardian Alliance on Zeb.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I figure I will have to do the guild and group thing soon, but enjoy<br/>
&gt; my independence enough that I want to do so as late in my career as<br/>
&gt; possible.<br/>
