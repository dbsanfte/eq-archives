<br/>
A lot of the older, seasoned players are re-starting new characters from<br/>
scratch. They have done the level 50+ thing, started new characters and<br/>
twinked them to the hilt, and now, since that isn&#39;t much of a challenge,<br/>
they (myself included) are starting new characters from scratch, without<br/>
twinking. Most races and classes now have fairly simple &quot;newbie armor&quot;<br/>
quests where you can earn a complete set (8 pieces, if you do the bracers<br/>
twice) of not too shabby armor by level 10, including a magical weapon, and<br/>
it&#39;s fun, at least it is to me. I know a level 40 cleric that is still<br/>
wearing quite a bit of his newbie armor.<br/>
<br/>
You will still see &quot;lvl 7 Wiz LFG&quot; being shouted in the newbie zones -- in<br/>
other words, it&#39;s still not difficult finding a group at lower levels.<br/>
<br/>
A number of people that I know have left EQ for DAOC and other games, only<br/>
to come back, because those games were somehow &quot;lacking&quot; compared to EQ.<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] Need some opinions<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hey everyone,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I need some help on my next MPORPG purchase. I played EQ since Beta<br/>
&gt; and quit about 2 and half years ago (college took priority heh) and<br/>
&gt; now that I have secured a somewhat stable career, I&#39;m planning to hit<br/>
&gt; online RPGing again. Question is, being that EQ has been out for 5<br/>
&gt; years, is it too late to come back and start anew? Meaning am I going<br/>
&gt; to look ridiculous (prolly will regardless) being the only lvl 6 guy<br/>
&gt; on the server in cloth and using fine steel? Or should I look for<br/>
&gt; another MRORPG game? How is Camelot? Or Neverwinter Nights?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Regards,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yager<br/>
