Dear Moderators: <br/>
<br/>
In the ONElist spirit of community, we are pleased to announce ONEreach.<br/>
ONEreach is an initiative by ONElist to periodically sponsor fun<br/>
and interactive programs that encourage the growth of your communities<br/>
while simultaneously contributing to them. It is our hope that the<br/>
ONEreach initiative will foster even stronger communities around the <br/>
common interests and causes that have brought your communities together<br/>
in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
We are kicking off ONEreach today with the &quot;Grow to Give&quot; Program. <br/>
<br/>
Through the &quot;Grow to Give&quot; Program, ONElist will donate $5,000 to each <br/>
of two charities chosen by the two communities that grow their<br/>
membership the most within the next two months. The community that grows <br/>
the most in actual new ONElist subscribers and the community that grows <br/>
the most as a percentage basis of new ONElist subscribers will each choose <br/>
a recipient charity. ONElist will then donate $5,000 to that charity in <br/>
the name of the community.<br/>
<br/>
All ONElist communities as of April 19, 1999 at 12:01 a.m. PDT are <br/>
automatically participants in the &quot;Grow to Give&quot; Program. The program<br/>
will run from April 19, 1999 through June 19, 1999 at 11:59 p.m. PDT. <br/>
<br/>
As moderators, we encourage you to inform your communities about the <br/>
&quot;Grow to Give&quot; Program and our overall ONEreach initiative. The Program <br/>
Overview is posted on our website at: <br/>

Good luck to you and your community on becoming a &quot;Grow to Give&quot; Community!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

The ONElist Team<br/>
