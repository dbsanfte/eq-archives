<div id="ygrps-yiv-778735080">The first few levels, 1 - 8+ everyone is basically a warrior. Everyone can<br/>
malee the kill to get experience. EverQuest is a grouping oriented game, but<br/>
at the beginning levels, it is just not worth it to group. Every class can<br/>
solo the first levels. Once it becomes harder to kill the blue mobs you are<br/>
fighting, then you can start looking for other PC to group with. But once<br/>
your druid gets a bit higher, you will not malee the mob, you&#39;ll be<br/>
meditating to bomb or heal. You will still malee at higher levels to kill<br/>
the mobs once they get to the point where they are fleeing. <br/>
<br/>
At level 3, you really don&#39;t need a decent weapon, stick with your club<br/>
until you get level 6. Pocket all the coppers and sellable items from your<br/>
kill. Once it gets too hard to kill these blues solo, your spells will have<br/>
a better effect to kill. Druids can solo from level 1 to 60 without ever<br/>
grouping one time. Do not fall behind on your spells. Buy them and use them.<br/>
<br/>
At your level you really do not need to venture out too far from the guards,<br/>
unless there are other newbies there and you are having a hard time finding<br/>
blue mobs.<br/>

<br/>
	Hi,<br/>
<br/>
	I have just bought the Everquest trilogy box and have played a few <br/>
	times.  I have found a few helpful people out there but it seems<br/>
most <br/>
	are playing solo. Is this normal?  They suggest grouping so that is <br/>
	my first question.<br/>
<br/>
	Next, I am having trouble getting money to get decent weapons.<br/>
	I am a level 3 Druid and only have a club.  One guy gave me some <br/>
	money but it wasn&#39;t much.  He suggested buying more spells, but I <br/>
	really would like a good weapon.  Dealing 1-3 points of damage just <br/>
	isn&#39;t cutting it.<br/>
<br/>
	Lastly for now, should I be starting with a fighter type until I <br/>
	really get use the the game and interface.  I really love wizards<br/>
and <br/>
	those type of characters but understand if playing a warrior makes<br/>
it <br/>
	easier.<br/>
<br/>
	I always get confused on where I am going. I think I venture too far<br/>
<br/>
	out of the city area.<br/>
<br/>
	Thank you for letting the newbie post?  ;)<br/>
<br/>
