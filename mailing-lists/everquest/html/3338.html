<div id="ygrps-yiv-448730245"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; See that&#39;s cool, I can see where he would be some fun. I was thinking<br/>
&gt; originally that there was some function like a pet. I&#39;ve seen some of<br/>
&gt; the familiars that wiz&#39;s have and they are really cool. By &quot;Flappy&quot; I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; guessing that you have one of those little winged demon looking things?<br/>
&gt; Those are just so cool!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe they are imps. Because it looks like my sister&#39;s Imp form. My<br/>
sister went afk for a min and my brother sat at her comp and wandered around<br/>
in imp form yelling &quot;IMPudence&quot; and stuff like that. He really loves imp<br/>
form. :-)<br/>
I think the mini-dragon or I guess drake form familiars are neat. I still<br/>
think it would be cool if there is a Planes of Power familiar spell that<br/>
lets you have a crystalline gargoyle familiar.<br/>
