<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272023669">Made my way to Kunark, and decided to try Warsliks Woods for brutes <br/>
to begin my adventure. As a Halfling tailor, brute hides are a <br/>
valuable next step in tailoring. My son recalled finding brutes in <br/>
the tunnel to Dalnir, so I went there. Once I do an initial harmony <br/>
to draw only one, I am able to root, dot, dot, root, nuke with <br/>
surprising ease. With a respawn of about 15 minutes I can keep <br/>
farming these for quite a while as I build my tailoring skills making <br/>
Halfling Vale leather armor.<br/>
<br/>
Experience is not great, but since I will be working on trade skills <br/>
as I farm, the time making lvl 34 will be well spent here.<br/>
<br/>
Once I have gotten tired of farming here I will try Frontier <br/>
Mountains. <br/>
