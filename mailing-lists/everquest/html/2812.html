<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] More women playing EQ lately? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-770883312">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
ROFLOL at Rob.  Yeah EC definitely!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m female and I play female characters.  The only way I&#39;d consider playing<br/>
a male character is if their stats were better.  But, since EQ is an equal<br/>
opportunity creator, meaning men and women share the same stats, it&#39;s not an<br/>
issue.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I do notice that when I&#39;m playing with my 22 year old son and his male<br/>
character I get a few more buffs than him but not often.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe men play female characters because they think it will help them<br/>
understand women better.  LOL  just joking!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I love the game and I don&#39;t care whether your male or female just as<br/>
long as you enjoy the game!<br/>
