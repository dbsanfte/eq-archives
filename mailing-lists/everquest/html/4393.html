<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079437655">LOL, don&#39;t worry about not being able to find your body! I use to be scared <br/>
of the same thing, but trust me, you always find it. Besides, it stays there <br/>
for days, so you have a long, long time to find it and get your stuff back. <br/>
Just remember what zone you died in, and you will be fine. And if you can&#39;t <br/>
find it for some odd reason, call for a Necromancer... they have locate <br/>
corpse and can help you find it in no time! The only thing I worry about <br/>
when dying is losing experience because as you get bigger, it gets harder <br/>
and harder to gain any!<br/>
