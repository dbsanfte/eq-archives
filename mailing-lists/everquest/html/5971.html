Eq2 FYI was to be released over a year ago at first<br/>
date release.  For the game it is, and seeing that we<br/>
are like 3 weeks into it, <br/>
<br/>
HATS OFF to SONY on a Great Job.<br/>
<br/>
Server stability vs Star Wars is second to none.  And<br/>
Wulf is 100% right.  There is marketing competition to<br/>
contend with not just the bottom line and a holiday<br/>
season.  <br/>
<br/>
They took their time and if you all think that the<br/>
BETA was really a BETA, you should think again.  It<br/>
was a pre release now way a beta.   <br/>
<br/>
They had the product 98% there if Microsoft had a beta<br/>
as good there wouldn&#39;t exists UNIX  <br/>
<br/>
ROFL<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy fellow gamers<br/>

&gt; against the game, then why are you even on this<br/>
&gt; list???<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t believe your argument that EQ2 was rushed<br/>
&gt; either.  Considering there was word of EQ2 in<br/>
&gt; development long before there was ever a release<br/>
&gt; date set, considering the game was in closed beta<br/>
&gt; for months before we ever got a peek at it,<br/>
&gt; considering it was in open beta for several months<br/>
&gt; BEFORE it went live, AND considering the release<br/>
&gt; date was even pushed back so tha tit came out later<br/>
&gt; than it was supposed to, I seriously have a hard<br/>
&gt; time believing it ws a rush job.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And apparently you don&#39;t know anything about<br/>
&gt; business.  It would seem to me that to be<br/>
&gt; competitive in the market place you have to take<br/>
&gt; into account things like the release of other games<br/>
&gt; and holidays and so on.  Let&#39;s face it, Sony Online<br/>
&gt; Entertainment is a profiteering company.  they want<br/>
&gt; to make money just like the rest of us.  If they<br/>
&gt; have to cut a few edges to get the product out in<br/>
&gt; manner to be more competitive with other companies,<br/>
&gt; then that&#39;s what they have to do.  Since the game is<br/>
&gt; an ongoing development, they can always add the<br/>
&gt; stuff after the fact.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As far as I&#39;m concerned they did a damn good job<br/>
&gt; with EQ2 and I think they will continue to do a damn<br/>
&gt; good job with it.  EQ2 had far more content to it<br/>
&gt; than Lineage II did when L2 was released.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Besides, SOE is only adding the stuff that people<br/>
&gt; are asking for anyway, so if we don&#39;t like it, we<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t complain cause we&#39;re the ones who asked for<br/>
&gt; it.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you really don&#39;t enjoy the game, then why are you<br/>
&gt; here?  This list is supposed to be for people that<br/>
&gt; like EverQuest and want to see it grow, not for<br/>
&gt; people who are going to argue every single little<br/>
&gt; nitpicky thing wrong with the game or SOE.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; time to move on....<br/>

&gt;   &gt; No, it actually makes it tougher. There&#39;s no<br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt;   &gt; single pulling, or FD splitting. If you get a<br/>
&gt; mob<br/>
&gt;   &gt; linked with 3 other mobs, they&#39;re all coming,<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt;   &gt; you&#39;d better be ready for them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   It&#39;s not tougher.  You know exactly how many are<br/>
&gt; coming and you can plan <br/>
&gt;   for it.  EQ had &quot;linked&quot; mobs too, but you didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know how many were <br/>
&gt;   coming.  WoW has linked mobs, but you really can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; tell which ones are <br/>
&gt;   coming.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   EQ2 was a rushed product that probably needs about<br/>
&gt; 6 more months of <br/>
&gt;   development time.  They rushed it out because of<br/>
&gt; WoW and Christmas.  Not <br/>
&gt;   much of a surprise since SoE drove EQ into the<br/>
&gt; ground as well.<br/>
