<div id="ygrps-yiv-16261027">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Where should I hunt wisps for greater lighstones? It seems I&#39;m only able to get one lighstone per night, at most, in greater faydark. Are there zones with more wisps? Are there zones where wisps hold more greater lightstones? Or are the greater lighstones very rare, even on wisps, or was I just way unlucky?<br/>
