<div id="ygrps-yiv-1645704630">I haven&#39;t had any issues in POJ recently in either of the zone out camps or<br/>
on the way to or in the captain room. Spent 2 or so hours there the other<br/>
night and all seemed fine but what&#39;s buggy for one might be ok for another.<br/>

&gt;    I had problems with falling through the walls and zoning in under the<br/>
world quite a bit. I fell through the wall and down to zonein from the<br/>
purple stairs camp in BoT. I was advised not to touch the walls in PoJ. A<br/>
few people fell through walls in Ssra and ended up in the deep depths<br/>
surrounded by mobs. Some of the problems are still occurring. Right now<br/>
there is a bug with the lifts. I have to jump up when the lift starts to<br/>
move to not have it pass through me. Or I have to be levitating. I think<br/>
because EQ upgraded it&#39;s graphics engine there are still bugs to work out. I<br/>
was once told how EQ did the player movement that it doesn&#39;t keep a constant<br/>
watch on where you are but that it checks back every x amount of time. So<br/>
sometimes the last time it checked on you, you were lower down and it then<br/>
checks to see again and thinks you are lower when you should be higher and<br/>
the lift is now above you so you fall through. They really need to fix that.<br/>
Some people couldn&#39;t get flagged bc t<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m hoping this will be fixed soon.<br/>

&gt;     after uprading my video driver to run everquest better i now see the<br/>
stars in the night sky over freeport but i didn&#39;t see the moon i saw a hazy<br/>
spot is that where the moon is supposed tyo be?  also my friend keeps faling<br/>
through  wall on the plane of justice is that due to the upgrade of the<br/>
game?  I do find the graphics are nicer looking after the patches.  I also<br/>
noticed some lag as well once the dx9 went into effect but not  as much as i<br/>
 ecpecxted reading all the posts.<br/>
