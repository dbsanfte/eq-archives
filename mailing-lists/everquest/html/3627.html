<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089276969">Woot! Glad it worked for you Deidre. Wow, mom was wrong, I actually AM good for something. Heh. <br/>
<br/>
The blank Inventory persona screen is indeed &quot;normal&quot; now. I too found it quite useful, altho it wasn&#39;t to look at my pretty face, I liked seeing what was happening behind me when I looted something. <br/>

&gt;I was told they did away with this feature but I found<br/>
&gt;a workaround myself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you load the luclin images BUT use the old UI, you<br/>
&gt;can hit inventory and then hit the face button.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;What&#39;s UI stand for? I tried what you suggested below and it actually<br/>
&gt;worked! I adjusted my face and waited forever for my character to save. &gt;Then my face stayed the same through multiple zones! And it&#39;s finely &gt;correct on the character selection screen! However, my inventory picture &gt;is still black!? I guess I&#39;ll just go to tech support chat...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; Remove head gear/masks. Pick your desired features<br/>
&gt; &gt; using the /face command. Force a character save.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Zone into another area, still without head gear.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Check yourself, you should be &quot;yourself&quot;. If<br/>
&gt; &gt; not...start over and try again. If you are okay,<br/>
&gt; &gt; then you should be okay and can put back on head<br/>
&gt; &gt; gear/masks. Remember, this is if it&#39;s happening to<br/>
&gt; &gt; you only.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
