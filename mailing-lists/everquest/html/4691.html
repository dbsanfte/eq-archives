<div id="ygrps-yiv-682158494">You have to remember this game is 4 years old so many of the guides are<br/>
outdated. Where to put what points and such can be really arguable. Your<br/>
decisions you make at the creation screen will have a big impact on your<br/>
early levels, but by the time you hit level 55 or so every class can<br/>
overcome any mistakes they might have made on creation ( like a warrior<br/>
putting 20 points into charisma and 5 each into wisdom and intelligence or a<br/>
cleric putting theirs into Dexterity and intelligence ). The player behind<br/>
the keyboard makes much more of a difference than a character that has a 2%<br/>
larger mana pool.<br/>
<br/>
If your new character is low and you feel you put your points in the wrong<br/>
area, re-roll your character. If you got a few levels and couple items your<br/>
proud of, stick with your character, it all equals out to who is behind the<br/>
keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, some of this information may have been written years ago. Read<br/>
what each stat does. One line I read I know is outdated is this &quot;Enchanters<br/>
should, unless they are role-playing, always choose to be agnostic&quot; . Now<br/>
this was true years ago, but with the boom of trade skills, agnostic is not<br/>
ALWAYS the way to go. <br/>

Introduction <br/>
The enchanter class is perhaps one of the most difficult to play in<br/>
Everquest.  There are a number of reasons for this.  The enchanter is a<br/>
defensive class.  Although they can be large damage dealers via charming,<br/>
they cannot do sustained direct damage via spells or DoT&#39;s in many<br/>
circumstances.  Soloing, whilst possible, is generally quite slow and as<br/>
such they do not raise levels as quickly as some other classes as their<br/>
experience is almost always through that of a group.<br/>
<br/>
In a grouped environment the Enchanter truly shines.  They can increase the<br/>
rate at which mana regenerates from level 16 onwards.  They can speed up the<br/>
attack rate of tanks, and slow down the attack rate of enemies.  They are<br/>
the only class who can cast damage absorbing shields on other players, and<br/>
are also the only caster class which can raise intelliegence or wisdom.<br/>
Enchanters can also charm NPC&#39;s and command them as a pet, but there are<br/>
risks associated with this.  They can mesmerise monsters for defined periods<br/>
of time, effectively immobilizing them.  <br/>
<br/>
An enchanter is a class which takes time to become good at.  They have the<br/>
largest number of spells for any class in the game, and only 8 slots to use<br/>
them in.  Learning the right spells for the right situation, is imperative.<br/>
At higher levels enchanters are virtually essential to most dungeon parties,<br/>
and a group will learn to rely heavily on their powers.  Likewise an<br/>
Enchanter will learn to rely heavily on the protection of their group.<br/>
<br/>
Enchanters die a lot at lower levels as they experiment and improve their<br/>
skills.  Some people enjoy the challenge, many give up.  From Level 50<br/>
onwards the role of the enchanter is almost purely crowd control and party<br/>
enhancement.  <br/>
<br/>
If you want a character which can deliver incredible damage, or play by<br/>
themselves, then an Enchanter is most probably not a good selection.  If you<br/>
are after a challenging class that plays a defensive role in predominantly<br/>
grouped situations, then it may very well be worth a try.<br/>
<br/>
Statistics<br/>
<br/>
Strength: Strength determines how much you can carry.  It influences maximum<br/>
and average damage and how quickly you learn many offensive skills.  As an<br/>
Enchanter, Strength is not truly that important.  You receive a Strength<br/>
increasing spell from Level 1, and many other Strength enhancing spells in<br/>
later levels. <br/>
<br/>
Stamina: Stamina affects how many hit points you have, and how long you can<br/>
hold your breath.  It also affects how long you can swing weapons before<br/>
tiring, and how often you can jump before becoming exhausted.  The main boon<br/>
to stamina for an Enchanter is the extra hitpoints.  However, the amount of<br/>
extra hitpoints received is minimal, and generally it isn&#39;t worth putting<br/>
your bonus points into this stat at creation. <br/>
<br/>
Agility: Agility affects how quickly you can learn some defensive skills,<br/>
how difficult it is to hit you as well as how much damage you take when you<br/>
are hit.  The true effect of Agility is often debated.  Since enchanters get<br/>
hit a lot in combat, there is sound argument for putting points into this<br/>
statistic.  However, it doesn&#39;t seem to make a noticeable difference, and<br/>
there are quite a few Agility increasing items in the game.  Enchanters also<br/>
receive an Agility increasing spell at Level 29.<br/>
<br/>
Dexterity: Dexterity affects how quickly you learn weapon skills, and how<br/>
often weapons will do their special.  This really only has any relevance to<br/>
Enchanters at lower levels when they are forced to melee.  You should not<br/>
put points into this skill at creation.<br/>
<br/>
Wisdom: Wisdom affects the amount of mana the priest classes have, also<br/>
rangers and paladins.   It also affects how quickly you can learn many<br/>
skills if your wisdom is higher than your Intelligence.  This skill has<br/>
absolutely no relevance for the Enchanter class and bonus points should not<br/>
be put into it. <br/>
<br/>
Intelligence: Intelligence directly affects how quickly you can learn most<br/>
skills.  It affects the amount of mana for bards and all pure casters, as<br/>
well as shadow knights.  It is the core statistic for Enchanters and a good<br/>
amount of your bonus points should be allocated here.  Whilst some people<br/>
may say it is easy to reach the soft cap of 200 intelligence through the<br/>
many bonus items in the game, this is one stat which you can never have<br/>
enough of.  Once you reach 200 intelligence you can then free up slots for<br/>
other stat enchancers such as for hitpoints, direct mana, AC, or charisma.<br/>
<br/>
Charisma: This affects amount you will be paid for goods by NPC merchants,<br/>
and how much they will pay you.  It also affects the saving throw on certain<br/>
Bard and Enchanter spells (charms in particular).  There is much debate over<br/>
the true importance of Charisma for enchanters.  It seems that the truly<br/>
defining element which impacts on charm durations, mesmerise resists and<br/>
other supposedly &quot;charisma&quot; based spells is actually the targets Magic<br/>
Resistance.  Some people claim that it makes a large difference.  Studies<br/>
run at Casters Realm have been inconclusive, so you may choose to say<br/>
&quot;better safe than sorry&quot; and add some points at creation.<br/>
<br/>
Picking the right race for your statistics<br/>
<br/>
The first thing you have to pick then is your race.   Which race you pick<br/>
will determine the foundation of you character for the rest of your life in<br/>
Norrath so it is kind of important you pick one you like.  Now in terms of<br/>
faction, races are generally meaningless to Enchanters.  Religion plays a<br/>
much larger role.  Enchanters can become any race they want through their<br/>
illusion spells, and also have direct faction increasing abilities.  So when<br/>
picking a race you are deciding on one of two reasons: statistics or looks.<br/>
Personally I think statistics are more important than looks, but looks can<br/>
go a long way in a game you are going to be playing for a long time.. <br/>
<br/>
Spending Your Bonus Points<br/>
<br/>
Enchanters can be a great character with any race, although the most popular<br/>
two are High Elves and Dark Elves.  Keep in mind also that humans get no<br/>
night sight, and have generally low statistics across the board. All<br/>
Enchanter races level at the same rate.  Here are our suggested bonus point<br/>
spendings: <br/>
<br/>
For Dark Elves add 25 intelligence, 5 Charisma. <br/>
For Erudites add 25 intelligence, 5 Charisma. <br/>
For Gnomes add 25 intelligence, 5 Charisma. <br/>
For High Elves add 25 intelligence, 5 Charisma <br/>
For Humans add 25 intelligence, 5 Charisma <br/>
<br/>
Religion<br/>
<br/>
Enchanters should, unless they are role-playing, always choose to be<br/>
agnostic.  In some areas your illusion will not be enough to keep you alive.<br/>
In some areas you will still be Kill on Sight for any number of reasons,<br/>
though these are very few indeed.  If you choose to be agnostic you<br/>
virtually eliminate the risk of being murdered on a religious background.<br/>
It may however exclude you from partaking in certain quests at stages during<br/>
the game or from using some items if you have no religion.  In many ways the<br/>
religion system in Everquest is still unfathomed, serving only as an<br/>
overriding faction system.  Who is to say what might happen as time goes on.<br/>
<br/>
Now it is time to go back to work. Feel free to ask questions in groups,<br/>

<br/>
Matt, you&#39;re right - the Robe of Tears does have some +AGI points. I <br/>
didn&#39;t know that AGI increases AC, thanks for the heads-up. Is there <br/>
a website that shows what stats boost others? I know that INT <br/>
increases MANA (for lower-level Chanters I hear). But not sure on <br/>
what else helps what.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help on the AC thing :)<br/>
