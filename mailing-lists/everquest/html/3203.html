fall off a boat into the water in the middle of the ocean and not be able to 
gate out. I used to do that all the time when I first started playing but I was 
playing an enchanter and so could gate out.</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt><br>My brother had the problem that when the shuttles 
  bumped together or one<br>passed through the other, it just knocked him into 
  the water in TD. he<br>couldn&#39;t zone back out, he swam and swam but couldn&#39;t 
  find land. He<br>petitioned bc he couldn&#39;t gate (he&#39;s a paladin). A GM 
  answered the petition<br>but ported him to the evil docks where he was 
  immediately killed. When he<br>tried to recontact the GM, she&#39;d already logged 
  off. He had to wait 3 hours<br>for a customer service rez and a port to the 
  correct docks.<br>So, if you do get stuck, make sure you specify which docks 
  you need to go<br>to.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br><br>&gt; Uh oh.<br>&gt; This does 
  not sound good since you are not on Druzzil<br>&gt; Ro, if I remember 
  correctly and I had the same problem<br>&gt; on that server.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I 
  heard you can petition and a GM will port you there<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I ended up 
  going to oasis and going that way.<br>&gt; it is trickier since in the 
  overthere good races are<br>&gt; KOS but I managed to jump off that boat and 
  swim to<br>&gt; the shore.&nbsp; I did not manage to get through the 
  other<br>&gt; zones though.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Good luck<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ---

  decided that a trip to Kunark was in<br>&gt; &gt; order for my<br>&gt; &gt; 
  druid. I will be needing Brute hides, and so was<br>&gt; &gt; ready to go and 
  hunt<br>&gt; &gt; them. However, the shuttles in Butcherblock never<br>&gt; 
  &gt; met the boat. I<br>&gt; &gt; tried three times, three different shuttles, 
  and<br>&gt; &gt; they went out to<br>&gt; &gt; Timerous Deep, got close to the 
  boat, then the boat<br>&gt; &gt; left. The<br>&gt; &gt; shuttles just went 
  back to BB.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; That avenue being out, I returned to SK 
  to pick off<br>&gt; &gt; gnolls, and<br>&gt; &gt; forage Plains Pebbles. I 
  almost have my bank tool<br>&gt; &gt; box full of them.<br>&gt; &gt; have 
  about eight to go. So, decided to stay there<br>&gt; &gt; until I get 
  the<br>&gt; &gt; rest.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Plus I have been getting fs 
  weapons from the gnolls,<br>&gt; &gt; which I have<br>&gt; &gt; tried to make 
  into another Vale Sewing Kit to sell.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Hope they get 
  the boat fixed. For my first trip I<br>&gt; &gt; want to do it the<br>&gt; 
  &gt; old-fashioned way.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Barto Proudfoot<br>&gt;
