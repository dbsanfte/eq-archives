<b>Subject:</b> Best Trade you ever made? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-368000707">I have made some good trades in my day and was wonder what some of the<br/>
better trades you guys made were?  My favorite trade I ever made was when I<br/>
traded an SMR and 2k pp for an Ishva Robe.  I then traded the Ishva robe for<br/>
1 pair of Golden Efreeti Boots, 1 SMR, 1 55hp 55mana necklace and 1 Box of<br/>
Abu Kar.  I then traded the 55hp 55mana necklace for another pair of Golden<br/>
Efreeti Boots.  All of this was Pre-Kunark/50+ so GEBS and SMR&#39;s were really<br/>
expensive (13k and 10k or so respectively.)<br/>
<br/>
My worst trade? Maybe the last one I did before I left I traded a Fungi<br/>
Tunic for a Bloodfire and 10kpp.  But its probobly the one item I have<br/>
wanted ever since I could remember, well not counting the Bladestorm, Katana<br/>
of Steel Sleet.  But they took that out of the game pretty quick.  That<br/>
weapon was just really crazy don&#39;t know how it ever made it into the game<br/>
(30/45 2hs with a 970 something or other AoE proc.  It proc&#39;d in waves so<br/>
you could move out of the waves you saw it had proc&#39;d.)  Anyone know of<br/>
someone with this sword?  I know of only one on my server but the guy moved<br/>
with the split.  They wouldn&#39;t let him use it in the Warrior Best of the<br/>
Best.  Well, rambled long enough.  5 months 3 weeks till I can play EQ<br/>
again.  <br/>
