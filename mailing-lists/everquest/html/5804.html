<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571602490">Hi gang,<br/>
	I&#39;m frustrated. I just picked up the Platinum pack, installed it and <br/>
double clicked on the exe icon. The game starts to load, goes throught <br/>
the download screen and then I get an error that eqgame.exe has <br/>
generated errors and I will need to restart the game.<br/>
<br/>
Ti&#39;s been a while since I played and have decided to get back into it <br/>
however I can&#39;t seem to get it going. so the first question I have is <br/>
where does the error log go to? I want to view it and see if it tells me <br/>
what the problem is.<br/>
<br/>
I have shut off Norton, set Zone Alarm to &quot;low&quot; and turned orr port <br/>
blocker. Can anyone else think of something that may be the cause?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Steve</div>
