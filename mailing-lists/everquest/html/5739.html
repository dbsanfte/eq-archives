<div id="ygrps-yiv-16634387">The effect on Journeman boots is not permanent, you have to click the effect<br/>
on the boots about once every 15 minutes and like most run speed spells the<br/>
effect only works out doors.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Peices You need an ancient ring off the Ancient Cyclops.  He<br/>
spawns in both the Ocean of Tears or in South Ro, he is very tuff to solo<br/>
unles your above lvl 45 or so.  The shadow rapier drops off shadow men at<br/>
various shadow men camps but it is a no rent item that means when you log<br/>
out for the night that item disapears and you have to go get it again when<br/>
you log back in the next day.<br/>
