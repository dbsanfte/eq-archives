&gt;  From the small bit I did see, they&#39;ve added 2 new tabs to the Inventory window.  One says Evolving Weapons, and the other one says Monster Alts.  The latest patch message I saw said that the monster alts was not working yet.  And some NPCs whose character models are not in zone yet are replaced by the standard human model.  They call this model &quot;Doug&quot;.<br/>
