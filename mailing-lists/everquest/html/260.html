<div id="ygrps-yiv-543815773">Forgive me if I didn&#39;t see the original post, but does that in anyway<br/>
justify the flame that was sent... and might I add yours.  I only read<br/>
someone&#39;s reaction and I wanted to make an attempt to halt any further post<br/>
in that direction.  Unfortunately you felt the need to personally attack<br/>
me.. therefore might I repeat my suggestion.<br/>
<br/>
Please refrain from personal attacks on people, everyone is entitled to<br/>
their opinion. This is how ideas are exchanged.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your understanding.<br/>
<br/>
If that statement in someway offends you.. I apologize.<br/>

 </span></blockquote> let me refresh your memory a little, the original letter here was written <br/>
with, shall we say not the best spelling. <br/>
   this comment was then added<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If English is your 2nd language, then I aplologize for this post.  That<br/>
 </span></blockquote>said, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;GOOD LORD MAN get a dictionary!!!!!  Your spelling is so bad I can&#39;t even <br/>
&gt;read your post.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Wizaro<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now this is totally wrong. and mike posts this.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Bah. Get a life. I have no problems with that and I&#39;m from Sweden. I know I<br/>
&gt;can&#39;t spell very well but at least I try and succeed many times (unless<br/>
&gt;dumbasses like you add a &quot;nice&quot; post)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Sorry just a bit frustrated.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And you want to bust him. Give me a break. Why didn&#39;t you post that after <br/>
Wizaro. Not everyone speaks good english, and if we are going to bust people<br/>
<br/>
when they try. why don&#39;t you go and try playing a game based in France and <br/>
see how good your French is <br/>
