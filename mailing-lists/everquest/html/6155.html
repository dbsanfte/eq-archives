<div id="ygrps-yiv-305158480">Oh cool!!<br/>
I don&#39;t know if EQ1 will still be around then though. Plus EQ2 could be considered a parrallel universe. <br/>
I didn&#39;t know Luclin had exploded in EQ2. Did they say the story behind why? What happened to the poor Vah Shir?<br/>
I imagine in 25 years the game interfaces will be much more advanced. Maybe there will be EQ 1.5 or 1.9A or something. :-D<br/>

&gt;72 minutes real time = 1 day game time<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You can check it if you want, I haven&#39;t verified it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Soooooooo......<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;72 X 365 = 26280 minutes real time<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;26280 /  60 =  438 hours<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;438  /  24 =  18.25 days<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;18.25 days real time = 1 year on Norrath<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;or roughly two and a half weeks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Current game date as of this writing is March 11, 3200.  EQ2 is supposed to take place 500 years in Norrath&#39;s future.  Luclin explodes, Kunark is nowhere to be found.  So how long will it take before EQ1 catches up with EQ2??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;18.25 X 500 = 9125  days real time<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;9125  /  365  =  25 years!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So if you play EverQuest for 25 years, you will reach the year 3700 game time in which case you should see the moon explode and you&#39;ll know what happened to Kunark.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Cool huh?<br/>
