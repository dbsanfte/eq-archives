<div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I have to agree with the 
nice gnome here.&nbsp; I had a Geforce 2 mx and it was all fine and dandy.&nbsp; 
I also had a geforce 3 TI 500 but I couldn&#39;t play EQ.&nbsp; I bought a GeForce 4 
MX 440 and the graphics are far superior in my opinion than that of a geforce 2 
mx.&nbsp; The reason the Geforce 4 TI looks better is that it has 
<strong>128</strong> MB of DDR ram not 64 MB DDR ram that the geforce 4 mx 
has.&nbsp; The geforce 2 only has 64 MB SDRAM.&nbsp; There is a big difference 
between the two of them.&nbsp; By the way I am running EQ with a full clip plane 
and it works just fine.&nbsp; </font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just looked at Compusa&#39; web 
site .&nbsp; PNY&#39;s Verto GEForce4 MX 440 sells for $179.99( which is how much i 
palyed for mine) while Visiontech&#39;s GeForce 4 TI 4600 runs for $399.99.&nbsp; 
Big price differnece.&nbsp; Now i know that the GEforce4 TI runs for about 
$299.99 or so but i didn&#39;t have the money.&nbsp; By the way if you want the real 
scoop on Video cards go to the cards web site.&nbsp; In this case it is <a rel="nofollow"
 target="_blank" href="http://www.nvidia.com">www.nvidia.com</a>&nbsp; You can download the 
latest drivers as well.&nbsp; Well that all I have to say.&nbsp; Sorry if I 
offened Anyone.</font></div></html></div>
