<div id="ygrps-yiv-777779726">Playing more than one song at a time is possible (and as far as I<br/>
know not a bug, just a matter of being able to hit the keys fast<br/>
enough) because the effects of a song continue for a few seconds after<br/>
you stop singing it.  So, starting and stopping and restarting songs fast<br/>
enough will allow you to have multiple song effects active all at the same<br/>
time.  I think 3 songs at a time is what most people try to manage.  The<br/>
best method I&#39;ve seen to do this is by programming a hotkey that would<br/>
look something like this.<br/>
<br/>
/pause 30;/sing 1<br/>
/pause 30;/sing 2<br/>
/pause 30;/sing 3<br/>
<br/>
When you hit this hotkey, it would start song in spell slot 1, wait 3<br/>
seconds, start song in spell slot 2, wait 3 seconds, then start song in<br/>
spell slot 3.  When you notice the effects of song 1 fading, you hit the<br/>
hot key again and it starts over.<br/>
<br/>
I have a lvl 5 bard char which I have only played a little.  If anyone<br/>
knows of better ways to twist songs I would like to hear them.<br/>

&gt; I just made a bard on Tallos Zek (And I don&#39;t have to tell you how frickin<br/>
&gt; difficult it is to get out the main gate without getting attacked) and I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; heard that you can play more than one song at a time.  Is this a system bug<br/>
&gt; or something that bards can actually do?<br/>
