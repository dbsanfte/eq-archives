<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089422030">I have a Cleric. But I haven&#39;t actually gotten xp in<br/>
over a year. I can&#39;t even get dialup where I live<br/>
because the phone company has spliced my lines so<br/>
badly I can&#39;t even dial out to an ISP. They refuse to<br/>
fix it and so far I haven&#39;t found any way to get them<br/>
to. Too much other stuff to worry about frankly. Like<br/>
finding a lawyer to sue a doctor for malpractice, and<br/>
still working on repairing hurricane Rita damage.<br/>
I currently have direcway Satellite-- which inherently<br/>
has latency. When I first got it with the Direcway<br/>
4000 2-way the bandwidth was 800k down and about 50k<br/>
up (allegedly 50k up-- clocked around 30k). Sometime<br/>
later when the modem died due to an incident with my<br/>
cat and a glass of milk I got the newer Direcway 6000.<br/>
Direcway then dropped the bandwidth to 500k down<br/>
(without informing me). When I play world of warcraft<br/>
I generally have between 1200 to 4000ms latency. Last<br/>
time I tried to get into EQ it just kept timing out on<br/>
me.<br/>
As for my system, I have an AMD athlon thunderbird<br/>
1.4Ghz processor, 1GB of DDR SDRAM, ASUS A7M266-M<br/>
motherboard, GeForce 4 Ti 4600 128Mb vid card, and<br/>
Philips Acoustic Edge 5.1 sound card.<br/>
I plan on upgrading to an ASUS A8V Deluxe (rev 2)<br/>
motherboard, 2Gb Kingston PC3200 ValueRAM, and AMD<br/>
Athlon 3500 2.0GHz processor (with venice core).<br/>
I will be using my same video card, sound card, and<br/>
power supply (Antec SmartPower 2.0 450W) and adding an<br/>
additional 300Gb harddrive.<br/>
I&#39;m currently trying to figure out how to transfer all<br/>
of my data from my puny primary drive and putting it<br/>
on the 300Gb drive and setting it as primary, then<br/>
upgrading to the new mobo setup without having to use<br/>
a windows xp cd. Unfortunately I don&#39;t have restore<br/>
CDs for my pc bc it didn&#39;t come with any software on<br/>
CDs. One of those deals where HP partitioned the<br/>
harddrive. Since the warrenty is up on it I doubt I<br/>
could get tech support from them.<br/>
I wish I could figure out a way to just copy all of<br/>
the programs so that they would be installable. I<br/>
should have an extra OEM of xp laying around somewhere<br/>
but it got lost in all the chaos of the hurricane.<br/>
luv,<br/>

Su&gt; what class are you?  And what is your connection<br/>
speed?  I assume you&#39;re on dial up in a rural area and<br/>
highs peed internet such as cable or DSL is not<br/>
available to you.  Even if you&#39;re connecting at<br/>
44k-46k sometimes you can help yourself by what kind<br/>
of computer you have.  I know at one point I had a<br/>
PIII 800mhz system on an ISDN line and I didn&#39;t have<br/>
TOO much lag.  But that was back when Kunark and<br/>
Velious were the newest expansions.  Now I have a P4<br/>
2.4 Ghz with 1GB RAM and a 256MB video card on a 5Mb<br/>
cable modem connection.  No lag at all.<br/>

<br/>
I prefer to solo, unfortunately its not possible with<br/>
my connection. At level 66 I still have trouble<br/>
killing level 30s. Mostly because of the damage<br/>
misreporting related to the lag. Although I haven&#39;t<br/>
played in months. My connection has gotten so bad that<br/>
I really can&#39;t play anymore. I tried doing an LDON a<br/>
few months ago but the lag got so bad that I was stuck<br/>
for 15 minutes unable to do anything. Zoning takes at<br/>
least 5 minutes. If I die it will take me 20 minutes<br/>
at the very least to get back to my corpse. Sometimes<br/>
an hour if I have to zone a lot.<br/>
I really don&#39;t think the game is designed for<br/>
characters of my class and level to be able to solo. <br/>
I&#39;ve pretty much switched to World of Warcraft now<br/>
because it doesn&#39;t do damage misreporting and death<br/>
doesn&#39;t take too much time.<br/>
luv,<br/>
