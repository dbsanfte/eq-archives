&gt;&gt; Hi everyone.. i have tried to creat a new account after a long time<br/>
&gt;&gt; off of everquest but i can&#39;t find my original cd case!  I can&#39;t find<br/>
&gt;&gt; what the account number is (cd number) for the original everquest if<br/>
&gt;&gt; anyone could please post what the cd key is i would be very<br/>
&gt;&gt; thankful.  You are in no danger, i phoned a everquest help line and<br/>
&gt;&gt; they said that all the CD codes are the same so its not like i can<br/>
&gt;&gt; steal your accounts or anything... any help would be great<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yeah, right....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Each CD Key *is* different, and can only be used once.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you want a new account you need a new CD Key, as your original one<br/>
&gt; is still tied to your original account (and ours are all used to make<br/>
&gt; our accounts and can&#39;t be reused anyway). If you can remember your<br/>
&gt; username and password you can just reactivate your old account. It<br/>
&gt; will still be there as the don&#39;t delete inactive acounts.<br/>
