<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547704828">I think it&#39;s  used as a temper for the racial needle or tannin for the<br/>
racial robes, but I&#39;d have to look it up. I&#39;ve got my brewing to 113 with<br/>
skull ale and am going to switch back to shar vahl essence once that trivs.<br/>

&gt; &gt; One problem with the war is it can screw up the zone until the server<br/>
&gt; &gt; is reset.  They have patched it but it still breaks, though less<br/>
&gt; &gt; often.  But it is fun!<br/>
&gt; &gt; If you want to increase your brewing cheaply just gather Payala fruit<br/>
&gt; &gt; in Shadeweaver Thicket and combine it with water.  It&#39;s a ground drop<br/>
&gt; &gt; so anyone can find it.  Just look for the blue topped trees.  It<br/>
&gt; &gt; makes Shar Val essence, triv at 180+.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; Heh. Got my brewing to 184 so far. :-)<br/>
&gt; A couple months ago I practiced going around the trees in the zone and got<br/>
&gt; it down so that by the time I got back to the starting point the fruit<br/>
&gt; repopped. Got lots of lots of the payala fruit.<br/>
&gt; Is Shar Vahl essence good for anything? I have tons of it.<br/>
&gt; luv,<br/>
