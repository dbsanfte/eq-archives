This cave is not completely undiscovered, I believe this is where you<br/>
find the giant zweihander, I think it is off that necro, you need a<br/>
group of high level 30&#39;s to pull it off too..<br/>

&gt; If you head north where the river comes to the mountain, take a look<br/>
&gt; thru the ice and you will see the cave.  Sometimes you will see a<br/>
&gt; goblin swimming at the mouth of the cave.  The cave itself is inside<br/>
&gt; the mountain, so as you swim it will eventauly open up above the<br/>
&gt; surface of the water.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I believe that the NPC Necro&#39;s con was aggressive and he was red at<br/>
&gt; lvl 16.  Be careful when approaching him.  BTW there is very little<br/>
&gt; light, and it is a maze ( oh what fun... hehe)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I never zoned so i dont believe its a new zone, just undiscovered..<br/>
&gt; the cave itself is quite large (or it seemed that way) but was<br/>
&gt; relativly empty. This is what i saw:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1.. House with 4 icebone skeletons<br/>
&gt; 2.. Shrine ( zone point )structure protected by 2 icebones skeletons<br/>
&gt; 3.. Human NPC Necromancer with pet  - red at lvl 16<br/>
&gt; 4.. Possible Giant.. (type unknown) - I never saw one myself<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And, there could be more to the cave that went unexplored, because i<br/>
&gt; had no way of passing the Necro at the time. I was informed of the<br/>
&gt; cave by a fellow player.  She stated that she had seen a giant, but<br/>
&gt; alass i have not.<br/>

&gt; Good Luck<br/>
