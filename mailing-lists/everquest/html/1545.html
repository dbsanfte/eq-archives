<div id="ygrps-yiv-434022244"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">I&#39;ve noticed that too. &nbsp;Especially on the NK/SK bridge. &nbsp;I find a druid 
<br>medding, breeze him, he stands up, sows me, we bow and go our way. &nbsp;I also 
<br>try to breeze everyone I can when I&#39;m passing by. &nbsp;But one thing that drives 
<br>me nuts. &nbsp;I&#39;ll have people walk up and Hail me and then they just stand there 
<br>after I say Hail back. &nbsp;Many classes. &nbsp;So then I&#39;m wondering, are they 
<br>wanting to start a conversation and just slow at typing OR are they waiting 
<br>for me to read their minds and breeze them.

<br>often find myself having to run 1/2 way or even clear across the continent
<br>to help out a guildmate) all I need do is find a medding Druid. &nbsp;I&#39;ll Breeze
<br>him and 9 times out of 10 they&#39;ll stand and SoW me, no questions asked. &nbsp;For
<br>that matter, unless I&#39;m in a huge hurry, I usually breeze/buff people I pass
<br>in my travels. &nbsp;I figure what goes around, comes around.</blockquote></span></blockquote></font><font COLOR="#000000" SIZE="3" FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial">
