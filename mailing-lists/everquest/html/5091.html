<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079240969">Hi, everybody.<br/>
<br/>
This might be a stupid newbie question, but maybe someone might be willing<br/>
to answer it for me: I noticed on EQAtlas.com that a few dungeon zones are<br/>
listed as having an experience bonus (usually listed as 13% when it<br/>
applies). Can anyone tell me how this works? Or is it as I assume and it&#39;s<br/>
an XP bonus for each kill made in that zone?<br/>
<br/>
