<br>Its been pretty quiet here lately so i&#39;ll see if i can get a thread going!
<br> 
<br>Ok whats the bravest (or most stupid) thing that you have done?
<br> 
<br>I&#39;ll start then:
<br> 
<br>This will probably sound a bit lame to you veterans, &nbsp;but as a newbi to EQ this was pretty scary (not to mention stupid!)
<br> 
<br>I got bored soloing round Qeynos hills with my lv6 Bard, my level 7 ranger has far more fun grouping round Greater Fay and CB so.....(in best forest gump voice) &quot;i just started running&quot; and tried to run (and boat) to kelethin.
<br> 
<br>Being a bard i can run pretty fast so the plains of karana were easy. &nbsp;The gorge that leads to highpass was a lot scarier, running round those narrow ledges with a small train of griffon things behind! (oops, still bound in Qeynos!!!). &nbsp;Highpass hold was just as bad - i must have run back out of the zone 8 or 9 times with a load of gnolls behind - anyway luckily a friendly Halfling guided me through - he was lv9 and we still only just made it!
<br> 
<br>Anyway my guide was going to Rivervale....and i have to be in work in the morning so i followed him there and finally got a bind before i camped.
<br> 
<br>tommorow......On to Freeport!
<br> 
<br>Ok so its not exactly soloing dragons on Velious - but it was the most nerve wracking thing ive done so far &nbsp;- and there is still a long way to go to Kelethin!
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Ok your turn!!
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Cheers
