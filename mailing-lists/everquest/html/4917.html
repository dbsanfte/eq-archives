 </span></blockquote>I played on FV a teeny bit. Trivial loot is gay. I was grouped with someone<br/>
close enough to the same level as me so I would get xp with him. We went to<br/>
fight a mob that was dark blue to him. It took us a looong time to kill the<br/>
mob and when we finally did it, it said that the mob was &quot;trivial&quot; to my<br/>
&quot;group&quot;. So it didn&#39;t even drop loot. Totally sucked.<br/>
Also, there is no &quot;common&quot; language. You start out with your native tongue<br/>
and people can&#39;t understand you if they speak a different language. There is<br/>
no /ooc channel. People use auction but auction advertises in your native<br/>
language. Even tells are sent in your starting language (unless you set it<br/>
to another language but you pretty much start out at 0 in other languages).<br/>
You don&#39;t get any alts on the server either.<br/>
It&#39;s kindof cool and there&#39;s some neat stuff. There isn&#39;t much no drop stuff<br/>
on the servers and it can be fun to roleplay.<br/>
Some author named R.A. Salvatore plays a wizard named Kimmuriel on FV. So I<br/>
guess he likes it.<br/>
luv,<br/>
