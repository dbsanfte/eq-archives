<b>Subject:</b> AllaKhazam and recommeded levels <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1859212577">I was looking something up on AllaKhazam when I took a peek at some <br/>
of the new item reviews. One in particular looked good for my druid. <br/>
A nice drop in Luclin. I investigated the journey and the target <br/>
creature, and it looked quite do-able for my character. However, I <br/>
was confused by the review on AllaKhazam stating that the recommended <br/>
level to attain was 50. I am lvl 30, and the npc doing the drop is 25-<br/>
25. The journey, though long, is not particularly difficult, at least <br/>
from what the maps and bestiary information indicate.<br/>
<br/>
Am I missing something about these recommended levels on the <br/>
AllaKhazam reviews?<br/>
