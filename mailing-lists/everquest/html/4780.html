<div id="ygrps-yiv-1934466910"><div>Ok then you all want me to type with good grammer&nbsp; ok I will do so.......while i am typeing email&#39;s to you all at least. But my friends have probably gotten used to me typeing that way so i am going to keep typeing on eq. But ok see .......am I typeing ok so far?? any way, I just&nbsp; think it is easier and faster so people dont have to wait forever to hear a response when they want it and especially while they are excited...am I correct? I am 14 years old and going on 9th grade, k-6 is elementry for me and 7 and 8 are middle school and 9-12 is high school..........so I have been going to school around 10 or 11 years, my mom put me in school when I was 5 years old. Ok is everything all cleared up and all or does some one else have a problem or challenge for me?</div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I thought this was kind of&nbsp;funny actually.&nbsp; I don&#39;t recall ever taking spelling after the elementary school levels.&nbsp; From Grades 9 - 12 they assumed that if we made it that far then we already knew how to spell.&nbsp; So if this person is still in that phase of his/her life where Spelling is a major subject of study then I could believe &quot;whole life&quot; could equal 10 years!</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I agree with Jerry, though, who stated in another email that if you do that by habit, then you&#39;ll find yourself doing it when you shouldn&#39;t.&nbsp; It&#39;s best to learn proper spelling and grammar skills first and make them a habit.&nbsp; Then you can use your internet-ese for fun.&nbsp; Worst thing you could do is turn in a research paper for your professor that&#39;s full of abbreviations and misspellings, or perhaps be making a big presentation at work and have that kind of spelling and grammar.&nbsp; Nobody would take you seriously.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">There are a few reasons why people type like that: 1.&nbsp; Because they don&#39;t know how to type properly so they can&#39;t keep up with how fast the internet chat room is moving, 2.&nbsp; Because they really don&#39;t know how to spell or how to use proper grammar, and/or 3.&nbsp; They think it&#39;s cool when it&#39;s really not.&nbsp;&nbsp; Which one are you?</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">You learned to spell for a reason.&nbsp; You say you&#39;re good at it.&nbsp; So use it. </font></div>
