<b>Subject:</b> Re: Playing Where&#39;s Waldo in Shar Vahl <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-599253911">You wouldn&#39;t believe the number of people who have asked for help finding <br/>
the Registrar in Shar Vahl. It&#39;s hard to explain where she is, but I will <br/>
try. Lets start with the bridge that leads to the thicket zone, not the <br/>
hollow... there are two bridges. Standing on the bridge to the thicket, run <br/>
into the city. Pass the black female vender - do NOT turn left or right, go <br/>
straight past her. Then turn right. There is a little passage that looks <br/>
like a tunnel. Go through that. You will then turn up in a little market <br/>
square. The Registrar is in one of the rooms in the square. I know it&#39;s <br/>
confusing, but that is the best way I can explain it. Let me know if you <br/>
need any more help.<br/>
<br/>
As for my favorite race and class to play... well, my main is a druid, but I <br/>
like to do a little fighting as well. I am also fond of pets and being able <br/>
to turn myself into another form. Because there is no class that does all of <br/>
that, I can&#39;t say I have a favorite. I enjoy my beastlord though. I can&#39;t <br/>
say what my favorite race is either... halflings are adorable, but I also <br/>
like Vah Shirs. However, I can&#39;t wait for Frogloks to come out!<br/>
