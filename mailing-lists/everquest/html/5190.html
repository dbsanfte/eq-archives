the link. It&#39;s WTFcomics, or something like that...<br/>
maybe someone else will know for sure.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; One day while sitting in class ignoring my<br/>
&gt; professor&#39;s lecture, I was browsing the web and came<br/>
&gt; across a weblink.  It was a series of comic strips<br/>
&gt; based on EverQuest that I thought was really well<br/>
&gt; done.  I had intended on posting the link to this<br/>
&gt; list, but never did.  Now I&#39;m trying to find the<br/>
&gt; link again but I cant remember how or where I found<br/>
&gt; it.  So I was hoping that maybe someone here might<br/>
&gt; know what I&#39;m talking about.  Essentially the comic<br/>
&gt; strip starts out with a female wood elf turning in<br/>
&gt; her quest paper to become a druid, but some things<br/>
&gt; happen and she ends up being taken under the wing<br/>
&gt; (?) of an Iksar who was a friend of her father.  The<br/>
&gt; Iksar character is named after the person&#39;s<br/>
&gt; character who draws the strip.  Hopefully this is<br/>
&gt; enough information that someone might recognize it<br/>
&gt; and post the link.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance.<br/>
