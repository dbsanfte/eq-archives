Subject: [EverQuest] Can Someone Help Me<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Was wondering, when I try to email from my personal email-the email<br/>
&gt; never shows up. My email address is verified etc, I can come on here<br/>
&gt; and post and it shows up instantly, I can also post from my yahoo<br/>
&gt; email and it shows up within few seconds. My wife posts from hers-<br/>
&gt; which her email is through same place mine is and she can post from<br/>
&gt; the email with no problems.<br/>
&gt; Why can I not post via email? Anyone able to help me?<br/>

Have you actually subscribed to the group using your home email address, or<br/>
are you only subscribed through your yahoo email account?<br/>
