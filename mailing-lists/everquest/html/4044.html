<div id="ygrps-yiv-2027689285">Sorry I&#39;m so late responding. I&#39;m waaaaay behind on my email.<br/>
I was actually there bc I was called to ME to rez people. There were mob<br/>
corpses at zone after I was done. I asked if anyone wanted corpses at zone<br/>
and they said to go ahead and loot. So it was my lucky day. :-)<br/>
I won&#39;t venture far into zone without a group either.<br/>
luv,<br/>

&gt; &gt; If you have Luclin you can do what I did, run to Dawnshroud and then run<br/>
&gt; &gt; along the wall as high as you can to reach Maidens Eye. Confirm there is<br/>
&gt; no<br/>
&gt; &gt; train on the inside or wait until a train has gone, then zone in and see<br/>
&gt; if<br/>
&gt; &gt; there are any corpses at zone to loot. :-)<br/>
&gt; &gt; I got a goranga idol and small brick of acrylia. :-) Those sell for a<br/>
&gt; decent<br/>
&gt; &gt; price. As long as you avoid mobs you&#39;re ok.<br/>
&gt; &gt; luv,<br/>
