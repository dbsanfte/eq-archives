I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve done anything wrong.  In game however it could <br/>
have appeared so.  The group probably thought you had pulled the <br/>
bandits intentionally.  There is little you could have done.  As far <br/>
as training them to zone, there&#39;s nothing wrong with that either as <br/>
long as you send a /shout that you have a train coming to the zone <br/>
line.  As far as what they can do to you, really all they can do is <br/>
kill steal and say things in /ooc and /shout to other players who <br/>
may be grouping with you.  It is unfortunate that things like this <br/>
happen, but as long as you explain what happened there&#39;s nothing you <br/>
can do.  If you play on Druzzil Ro, and are having problems with <br/>
them in-game send a /tell to Jaxum and I&#39;ll see if myself and some <br/>
guildmates can help you out.<br/>

&gt; I have been playing EQ for about 2 years and enjoying every min. <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; it. I play for only about 1 to 2 hours a day (maybe) so I really <br/>
get <br/>
&gt; in to my time in the game. This sunday something new happened to <br/>
me.<br/>
&gt; I have a 24th level Bar. shaman and have been grouping in Pav. <br/>
&gt; Caverns to work up in levels. I logged on and ooc&#39;ed asking to <br/>
group. <br/>
&gt; I got not responce. I went to camp 1 aqnd found a good mixed group <br/>
&gt; working it very well (8 people mixed classes teaming very nicely) <br/>
so <br/>
&gt; I went to camp 2, There were 5 people 3 casters (2 mages and a <br/>
necro) <br/>
&gt; a ranger and a fighter) all around 19 to 20., all at 100% health. <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; asked if they wanted a healer/buffer and got &quot;Shouted down&quot; &quot;This <br/>
&gt; Camp is TAKEN GO AWAY&quot;!!!....ok so I truned and started back. I <br/>
got <br/>
&gt; jumped by 3 of the bandits. I Camp was not doing anything so I <br/>
pulled <br/>
&gt; the mobs back in to the camp and ooced here is your mobs take them <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want to steal your kills(all the time I am getting <br/>
pounded) .. <br/>
&gt; no one said anything so I ran .. about 1/2 way back I get <br/>
ooc&#39;ed &quot;WTF <br/>
&gt; Frezz wait...&quot; as I as all ready near the cave to SH and the zone <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; just left... the &quot;group&quot; because of 5 mobs brok camp and ran (as <br/>
they <br/>
&gt; ran they pulled 2 more) and &quot;telled&quot; me to death about how they <br/>
were <br/>
&gt; going to cause me problems every time they see me and ect...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A. did I do wrong by trying to &quot;not steal&quot; the camp&#39;s mobs<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; b. what do I do about the &quot;problems&quot; I might have later by thes <br/>
&gt; people?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  I like doing the right thing and playing with people not causeing <br/>
&gt; problems for others...<br/>
