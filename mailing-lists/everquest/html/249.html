I don&#39;t know what that means but I have not had any problems with the<br/>
screen freezing or anything like that.<br/>

The deal with not being able to put your wrist pack on your wrist and<br/>
your backpack on your back is a problem.  I don&#39;t think they are fixing<br/>
it because they either don&#39;t think it is a gameplay changing issue, or<br/>
that is how they want it.  In the long run it bennifits you becasue you<br/>
can put armor on your wrists and back *and still* carry a backpack,<br/>
wrist pack and waistpack.<br/>
