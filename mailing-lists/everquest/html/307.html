<div id="ygrps-yiv-641431571">The hide skill works like this - you attempt to hide, and no matter what YOU <br/>
THINK you&#39;re successful (after all, you don&#39;t know if you&#39;re hiding good or <br/>
not, until someone finds you!)<br/>
<br/>
In reality, the computer will do a random check based on skill level for the <br/>
hiding skill, to see if you&#39;re successful or not. SO, even though you hide, <br/>
and you think you&#39;re hiding good and that you can&#39;t be seen, you still may <br/>
be in plain sight due to a skill roll failure!<br/>
