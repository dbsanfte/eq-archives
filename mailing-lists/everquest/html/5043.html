<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053142577"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I did something really stupid last night. I logged into Everquest and<br/>
&gt; opted to purchase LDoN online. One suggestion, DON&#39;T do it if you<br/>
&gt; have a 56K dial-up connection LOL. It started to download and said it<br/>
&gt; would take 22 hours and 26 minutes! I guess I will take my laptop to<br/>
&gt; work and download it on the T1 LOL. Sheesh!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh. When I had dialup I went to load a patch and it said it was going to<br/>
take over 80 hours to load. I was like &quot;Hell no!&quot;<br/>
I&#39;m glad I have satellite for download now.<br/>
I had started to play and was going to do a lost dungeon adventure but my<br/>
brother was a prick and he got me disconnected and then I couldn&#39;t get back<br/>
in.<br/>
luv,<br/>
