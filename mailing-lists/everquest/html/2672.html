<br/>
 </span></blockquote>let me thing back what i did at your level. i think i was in that range<br/>
just before velious was availible, because of this there might be also<br/>
some more possibilities, because of luclin.<br/>
<br/>
i believe i spent my time in frontier mountains at the giant fort until<br/>
34 (with a group, but it is easy to get into one at the fort). then i<br/>
did cougars in iceclad, and wolves in great divide (both of them solo).<br/>
<br/>
at 35 to 37 i also joined some groups in crystal caverns and tower of<br/>
frozen shadows. but at those levels i started to solo walrus and<br/>
ulthorks (in the north part of eastern wastes, they are the &#39;weaker&#39;<br/>
ones; the southern ones are for lvl 42 to 45 groups).<br/>
<br/>
at 39 i soloed my first frost giant scout in great divide. but i was<br/>
lucky, because it was sick or just died of old age ... after three<br/>
deaths, i decided not to touch them solo again for some time. actually<br/>
it was 44 when i started my personal war against all sorts of frost<br/>
giants ... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
i filled the levels from 42 to 44 with hunting young shardwurms in great<br/>
divide ... something that gets really boring at 43 or 44, especially if<br/>
you hunt them solo and don&#39;t have candy availible.<br/>
<br/>
two things you should do:<br/>
1) get your research spells from katta ! the merchants there have all<br/>
    the research spells from level 34 to 44 for mages, chanters and<br/>
    wizzies (research only spells, not quest spells). i don&#39;t know if<br/>
    necros have something similiar.<br/>
2) at 44 you should try to get jboots. you really need them and can do<br/>
    this at that level without any help !<br/>
<br/>
as said at the beginning, there should be more options with luclin, but<br/>
i don&#39;t have too much knowledge about luclin (i only know the way from<br/>
nexus/shadow haven to katta ... i think i already forgot it, because i<br/>
am bound there, and i have my personal lvl 40 wizzy for transports :)<br/>
<br/>
i almost forgot: you should check out &quot;The Magician&#39;s Tower&quot;. this is a<br/>
forum for mages, with many hints, where to hunt at which level. point<br/>
your browser to: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower">http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower</a><br/>
<br/>
on my personal web space, there is also the copy of the &quot;Everquest<br/>
Magician Resource&quot; (this is at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://muog.de/emr)">http://muog.de/emr)</a>. this is sort of<br/>
an official copy, but because i told the original author that i won&#39;t<br/>
add new things to it, he didn&#39;t distribute my link to other EQ sites.<br/>
so even if those pages may be outdated now, this copy will remain there<br/>
and still maybe useful to fellow mages.<br/>
<br/>
well, good luck,<br/>
