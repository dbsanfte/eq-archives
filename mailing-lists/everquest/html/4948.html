by Choon (which conned white to me) so I thought I could kill him. <br>

Yes, it would make me VERY happy if they would get rid of that part... the searching for the corpse. <br>
<br>
Side note though... has anyone noticed that the higher level you are, there is a difference in what cons you can kill? For example, when you start off it&#39;s usually not to hard to kill things that con white but as you get up in lvl sometimes even things that con blue can be hard.<br>
