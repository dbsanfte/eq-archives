and the surrounding orc camps were the best place to<br/>
level fast. Not only do you get XP for killing the<br/>
dratted things, but you learn pulling, group work --<br/>
if you happen to find a good group -- and you can get<br/>
XP from the dwarves for turning in CB belts,<br/>
shoulderpads and bracers.<br/>
<br/>
With my new Vah Shir rogue, I&#39;m finding the best way<br/>
to level quickly is to work on my throwing skill and<br/>
break camps. The Loda Kai camp near the mountains is<br/>
proving a great place to do both -- I throw, get a<br/>
couple skeletal brigands, kill them, heal for two<br/>
minutes, and then repeat.<br/>
<br/>
I was levelling my dwarf in about...maybe not an hour<br/>
but certainly two if I put my mind to it and I was<br/>
levelling my rogue in at least two. It&#39;s  bit harder<br/>
now because I&#39;m level 12 working on 13, so it simply<br/>
takes longer.<br/>
