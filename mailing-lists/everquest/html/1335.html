<b>Subject:</b> Faction for Iksars: Currently Kaladim <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-124221619">I&#39;ve started an iksar monk named Zainal....leve 14 (so close to double<br/>
damage)<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve decided to have great faction with him with almost everyone...cept<br/>
the people who don&#39;t matter like the orcs.<br/>
<br/>
And I was just wondering....does anyone know how to get better faction with<br/>
the merchants?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m currently killing everything in Crushbone (or will be when I make 15)<br/>
for faction with Storm Guards (dwarven guards in BB and Kaladim&#39;s warrior<br/>
guild)<br/>
Then I&#39;ll start turning in the pads/belts for faction.  I don&#39;t think<br/>
this&#39;ll help with the merchants....any help?</div>
