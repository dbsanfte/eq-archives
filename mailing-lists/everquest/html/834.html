<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882148342">Blackened Iron is nice to look at however..  Banded is a much better choice<br/>
for a rangers standard issue under level 25.  Blackened iron is heavy and<br/>
has less AC.  I&#39;m not saying Banded is the best overall, however its one of<br/>
the only armor sets a ranger can wear.. besides the silver plated bracers<br/>
and leggings.  But, if you can get your hands on those.. you can start<br/>
acquiring the ivy etched gear.  There is one exception.. Blackened iron<br/>
boots are great to have if you cant get dwarven workboots. Sure they have<br/>
one less ac as the banded, however they can kick for magic.. that always<br/>
comes in handy. =) <br/>

Ha, last night I was admiring a ranger in blackened iron armour (was real <br/>
cute too) and he up and gave me a tunic and leggings.  Now, I&#39;m not one to <br/>
stand in front of a mirror primping, but I sure look good!  I need to add <br/>
something for strength though.  I have a studded collar and a cutthroat <br/>
insigna ring, but I need lots and lots of strength, any suggestions?  Why do<br/>
<br/>
I need more strength you may ask, I need the weight capacity.  I only have<br/>
75 <br/>
naturally.  My armour takes up most of that and i no longer run while in run<br/>
<br/>
mode-more like crawl.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, where can I get more of this blackened iron?<br/>
