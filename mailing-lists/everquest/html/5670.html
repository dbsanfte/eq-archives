<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Man I&#39;m so excited!&nbsp; I&#39;m SOOOOOOO close to 
finishing my druid epic!&nbsp; I have exactly 2 more kills and I&#39;ll have 
it!&nbsp; My druid is level 56 now and working on his 4th AA point (yeah I 
know...&nbsp; but they say they come faster after 60). The last two kills I have 
to finish the quest are the dragon Faydedar and the Corrupted Seahorse.&nbsp; 
Faydedar will probably happen first since The Fabled Estrella seems to be 
roaming the area where the Corrupted Seahorse spawns.&nbsp; We tried that once 
already and she conned red to a level 65 beastlord with me.&nbsp; She used him 
as a footrug hitting him at 1500 a whack.&nbsp; So either gonna have to wait 
until the Fableds are past history or else get up one serious uber guild raid to 
take her down.&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to have the epic done before I hit 57 so I&#39;m 
working on AA xp until then.&nbsp; I&#39;ve also been stock piling a lot of my upper 
level spells as I see them drop or for sale cheap in the bazaar.&nbsp;I dont 
have them all yet but I got a few for each level up to 62 so it gives me 
somethign to look forward to.&nbsp; Anyway.... it&#39;s getting ever closer then 
I&#39;ll be epic druid!&nbsp; hehehe :)</font></div>
