<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836866902">As far as I know, you don&#39;t need to have anything but the original EverQuest<br/>
game in order to make another expansion work. Sure having Ykesha might help,<br/>
but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s required. That is something I will have to look<br/>
into.<br/>
(I would have replied sooner but for some reason my account started bouncing<br/>
emails and yahoo wouldn&#39;t let me send stuff)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I am seriously thinking about getting this. I agree on the opening<br/>
&gt; and bashing of chests and things. Other games I&#39;ve played, it&#39;s kinda<br/>
&gt; fun finding new treasures in chests and when I find a chest in EQ I<br/>
&gt; want to bash it then remember I can&#39;t LOL.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think that the private space will be cool! My help some of the<br/>
&gt; lower-level players (such as myself) level a little faster without<br/>
&gt; getting accused of Ks&#39;ing :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The EQ site mentioned LoY Broken Skull was the starting point of this<br/>
&gt; new expansion. Does anyone know if I need to purchase LoY first<br/>
&gt; before I can buy the new expansion?<br/>

&gt; &gt; So, another expansion pack is coming out. The features listed look<br/>
&gt; pretty<br/>
&gt; &gt; cool.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll be interested to see how they are implemented and how they<br/>
&gt; work in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; game.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyone else looked at the webpage and have any thoughts on this?<br/>
&gt; &gt; I love the idea of being able to unlock, open, or bash open chests<br/>
&gt; and such.<br/>
&gt; &gt; That is something I feel was missing from this game. And the<br/>
&gt; private space<br/>
&gt; &gt; sounds good too.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thoughts?<br/>
