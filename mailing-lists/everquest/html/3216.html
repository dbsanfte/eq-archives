<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I tend to solo, due to limited playing time, so 
that I don&#39;t waste others time by grouping, getting 4 or 5 kills, then 
logging...I try to avoid deaths, but if it looks like I have no choice but to 
die, I try to avoid it by doing a mana dump on the mob ( I have no toons that 
don&#39;t have mana).&nbsp; sometimes, it works out, sometimes, I die 
anyway...&nbsp; as far as rezzes, I don&#39;t ask for them, nor do I expect them, 
since, for the most part, I don&#39;t carry any pp with me, unless doing a bank run, 
or am in the middle of my soloing, where I have a bit of pp on me.&nbsp; my 
guild doesn&#39;t have a higher level cleric, so that option is out.&nbsp; most of 
the time, I tend to solo in zones or areas of zones that are less populated 
(less chance to train someone in the process of zoning a bad pull).&nbsp; as a 
result of this, and the fact that I play on off peak hours most of the time, 
there is rarely a cleric around anyway.&nbsp; there have been a few times, 
though, where a cleric went out of his way to rez me, while I was on a corpse 
run, even tho I had not asked (and not being grouped, neither had anyone 
else)&nbsp; to these people, I try to make sure I donate as well as I can with 
what I have on me (even if it happens to be just some buffs).</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>My locution in the previous message expressed my feelings 
  toward game <br>death, and raised my curiosity. What are other player&#39;s 
  attitudes <br>toward game death?<br><br>I play solo most of the time, and 
  haven&#39;t had a guild to depend on <br>since Wave of Change faded away. So, 
  death, especially death in <br>awkward circumstances, is more serious to my 
  character. I can&#39;t just <br>call on my guild reserector to pull my butt out of 
  the grave, nor do&nbsp; <br>have high level guildies to drag my corpse out 
  from under some big <br>nasty.<br><br>My son-in-law plays with abandon. He 
  leaves corpses all over the <br>place, joins groups readily, and seems to have 
  great fun doing all <br>that.<br><br>My son, on the other hand, is in a 
  powerful guild on our server. He <br>is less cautious than me, but still uses 
  sound strategy and tactics <br>and utilized his guild to advance on his goals. 
  His guild is the <br>Guardian Alliance on Zeb.<br><br>I figure I will have to 
  do the guild and group thing soon, but enjoy <br>my independence enough that I 
  want to do so as late in my career as <br>possible. <br><br>Barto Proudfoot
