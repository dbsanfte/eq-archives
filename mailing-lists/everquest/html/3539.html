<div id="ygrps-yiv-2017267233">Hey, nothing wrong with that then! You know, I sometimes wonder about<br/>
marriage. I mean I enjoy it and all and I love my wife but sometimes I<br/>
just want that &quot;alone&quot; time ya&#39;know. That time where you can do what you<br/>
want to do and don&#39;t have to answer to anyone.  ;-) <br/>

&gt; me tell you my story and see if you feel any better ok?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Huh? You can&#39;t give up something you never tried. lol. I&#39;m not feeling<br/>
bad<br/>
or anything. I just don&#39;t give a rats ass. lol.<br/>
I don&#39;t want to date anyone or anything like that. Just not interested.<br/>
It<br/>
would probably cut into my EQ gaming time too much.<br/>
I&#39;m happy being single.</div>
