<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Anybody play the beastlord class? I&#39;ve played one 
to level 13 and it is ok. The beastlord himself is about as good of a fighter as 
a bard except they can only wear leather armor. His pet is a good tank though 
with a neat taunt proc and the beastlord has cleric level heals for the pet. He 
also gets shaman spells too. It&#39;s a lot like a magician except with more of an 
emphasis on healing and buffs. I don&#39;t see why the beastlord pet couldn&#39;t be a 
main tank in a group. I kind of wish they got a few extra spells though most of 
their best spells you don&#39;t get until level 59 or 60. I wish there were weak 
lower level versions of some of their key spells like maybe a spell like the 
enchanter&#39;s augmentation spell that increases attack speed %15 or 
something.</font></div></html></div>
