<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I am in total agreement with Su here. Back before 
the nerf of KEI and other group buff spells not meant to be cast on the younger 
players&nbsp;you could have almost endless mana as a younger player and that was 
definitely not how the game was designed.&nbsp; I mean I would just log in my 
high lvl mage group with a newly made char on my other acct cast a 45 point 
damage shield on the lvl 1 character and be lvl 30 with in a matter of 
hours,&nbsp; after that with KEI and other PL&#39;ing tools I could make lvl 50 with 
in a couple of days, I think PL&#39;ing in it self is much to powerful of a tool 
right now, I do&nbsp;power level my characters on occasion but I wish they could 
find a way to tone that power down it makes the game a bit to easy.&nbsp; Good 
Luck with the letter, and if you do quit, I shall say we&#39;ll probably see you 
back in the game in a few months.</font></div>
