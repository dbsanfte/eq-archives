<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2061267252">I&#39;m back everyone. The last time I was a part of this group, I was <br/>
driven away due to a misunderstanding. After that, the owner and I <br/>
have made some-what of a friendship and I decided to give the group <br/>
another try. It is, after all, the only decent EverQuest group at <br/>
Yahoo! and I was disappointed that I had to leave in the first <br/>
place. So, I&#39;m glad to be back. First comes first, what servers do <br/>
you all play on?<br/>
