<div><font face="Arial" size="2">alrighty.....&nbsp; as far a necro, bonechips are 
what you need as a regent for your pet.&nbsp; other than that, for the most 
part, the same stuff applies for a necro as for a mage...&nbsp;&nbsp; int, int, 
and more int.&nbsp; mages use malachite for the regent for their pet.&nbsp; you 
don&#39;t say how long your break was, but I suggest you take a good look at the 
gear you have, as they have added focus effects to a considerable amount of the 
gear.&nbsp; in akanon there are newbie quests for newbie armor much better than 
what was available when my ranger, mage, necro, sk, and shammy were lower 
levels.&nbsp; allakhazams should have most of it listed, and who to talk to to 
get started on the quests...&nbsp; </font></div>

  myself</div>
  <div><br></div><tt>After taking a long break from Evercrack at the Betty Ford 
  Clinic I&#39;m<br>back. I actually did forgat a few things and want to 
  refamiliarize<br>myself, On the 3 bars that tell you your health and level 
  status, I<br>forgot what the blue line is for. I know it has something to do 
  with<br>your charma or something like that. <br><br>Also I just started 
  playing with a Necro just to see what it&#39;s like. Any<br>good suggestion for 
  getting Necro stuff? BTW I&#39;m a Gnome. <br><br>What are the elements a Magician 
  needs to conjure up a elementa pet like<br>fire or earth? I ran out and now I 
  can&#39;t remember what I need to get!<br>What a dummy!&nbsp; ;-)<br><br>Thanks
