<div id="ygrps-yiv-442660707"><div><em>&nbsp;for one am glad that you have fun doing it.....but to be honest everything that you have written I have gotten half way thru or less and given up reading it. Not because I don&#39;t understand but because it is too FRUSTRATING to read it witn some many &quot;incorrections&quot;. So hopefully when have something important to say you take the time to do it correctly so you can get your point across. Remember man (and woman) is a creature of habit you might accidently see it carry over when you don&#39;t need it most. Just some advice and I know that a $.35 will get you ...yadda yadda yaddda.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jerry</em><br><br><b><i>lori smith &lt;lizardbretteq@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:

And she sent me a private message with all<br>the<br>&gt; words misspelled asking me why I ask people to spell things correctly.<br>&gt; I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s just a joke to make fun of people who can&#39;t spell.<br>lol.<br>&gt; :-)<br>&gt; luv,<br>&gt;
