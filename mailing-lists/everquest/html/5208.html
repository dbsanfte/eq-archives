<b>Subject:</b> Overcamping the sarnak fort... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029359484">Hi, all. My main character is a 30th level ranger on the Tarew Marr server,<br/>
and I&#39;ve soloing the sarnak fort for the last few levels (since about<br/>
24th)...so all in all, probably about a month&#39;s worth of play time for me.<br/>
For the most part, the fort has been really quiet. More often than not, I&#39;m<br/>
the only one fighting there, but over the last few days, the sarnak fort has<br/>
become an extremely popular spot for some reason and the place is now<br/>
overcamped with groups that end up fighting over the sarnaks that spawn<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m trying to figure out where to take my ranger next for when I&#39;m<br/>
soloing. When I&#39;m in a group, I have a number of places to go, but I can&#39;t<br/>
figure out what my next step should be for soloing. Would anybody care to<br/>
share some suggestions, please?<br/>
<br/>
Chris</div>
