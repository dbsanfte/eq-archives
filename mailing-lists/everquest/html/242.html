<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-236229234">here is another interesting part, after i zone i usually notice<br/>
that my HD is stiill processing info, i have control of my character<br/>
but for about 10-15 additional seconds, sometimes as little as 5 seconds<br/>
after i regain control of my character after a zone,<br/>
  when i turn or start to move there is this &quot;processing lag&quot; dont know<br/>
what else to call it but i think THIS is when you receive the info   <br/>
regarding<br/>
other players etc in the zone. for it does seem to take longer to get<br/>
out of this post zone (processing lag)-jerky movents etc when there<br/>
are lots of players)pcs) etc as opposed when their are very few.  PCs<br/>
creating more lag  would seem logical for most NPCs dont have lots of   <br/>
items with various stats, and or skills, etc speech trade skills etc to   <br/>
have to load into memory as PCs do, unless someone can pretty much prove   <br/>
to me that NPCs and PCs should have no effect, i will have to conclude   <br/>
that my observation is correct,<br/>
