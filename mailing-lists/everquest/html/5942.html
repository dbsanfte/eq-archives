<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Well I received my Collector&#39;s Edition of EverQuest 
II on DVD on Monday Nov 22, exactly two weeks after the game went live.&nbsp; 
Already the servers are populated with a lot of people.&nbsp; Yet EQ2 does 
something EQ1 doesn&#39;t.&nbsp; It will create a new instance of the zone and give 
you a choice so that it can balance out the increasing number of people.&nbsp; 
I&#39;ve noticed a difference in the lag factor when I join a populated instance 
versus a non-populated instance.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure how they do it, but it&#39;s 
pretty cool.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I&#39;ve created 3 characters: Raido, Wulfric, and 
Celric.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raido is of course a wood elf priest, soon to be 
druid.&nbsp; He is currently level 8 and finished the first part of his priest 
training.&nbsp; Wulfric is a half elf fighter, currently level 7, and just 
gained his Qeynos citizenship last night.&nbsp; Celric is a dark elf priest and 
has yet to experience the world of Norath.&nbsp; All 3 characters are on 
Crushbone server.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">When I created Wulfric and Celric, I ran into a bit 
of trouble because the names wouldn&#39;t get past the name filter.&nbsp; I assume 
it had to do with the *ric* in both names and possibly alluding to profane words 
that sound similar.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I had used both names on the Beta server so 
I put in a CS ticket, and a GM responded about a few hours later (something you 
never see happen in EQ1).&nbsp; We discussed it and he went ahead and changed 
the names for me so I could use them.&nbsp; </font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Anyway, one thing I noticed, there does nto seem to 
be a drop feature for items.&nbsp; You can either trade it, sell it, or destroy 
it, but you can&#39;t drop it.&nbsp; I guess the citizens of Qeynos don&#39;t want 
random items littering their city.&nbsp; Hopefiully it&#39;ll be implemented 
soon.&nbsp; But so far the game is much kick ass.</font></div>
