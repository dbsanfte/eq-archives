<div id="ygrps-yiv-439353676">Wow I really like the new UI! Well worth the wait! I was out at EQ <br/>
Stractics.com and they listed a site that has skins available for the <br/>
new UI, I&#39;m going to try out the Mage one tonight! The URL is <br/>

I played a little last night, hardly anyone on, kinda nice, the lag <br/>
was practically nill! One thing I&#39;ve noticed was the increased amount <br/>
of Orc Centurions, I kept getting jumped on my way from Felwith to <br/>
the High Elf city and they spawned quickly! I wonder if this has to <br/>
do with the rumored alliance between the Gnolls and Orcs. Hmmmm. I&#39;m <br/>
going to try and get my ranger, Durgaa out tonight and see what I can <br/>
find.</div>
