<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I&#39;ve read about that, but I&#39;ve got an extra fan installed on the<br/>
&gt; side of the case blowing on the cpu and videocard. Also, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not playing the game. I can&#39;t get past the account setup.  I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t mention that I had downloaded the full version of the game a<br/>
&gt; few days ago and got this problem then as well.  one of the things<br/>
&gt; that I did was remove my unused 56k pci modem, then I moved my<br/>
&gt; network card to a different slot and was able to gett into the new<br/>
&gt; account screen. I was able to add my name and other registration<br/>
&gt; stuff, but couldn&#39;t go any further as I had no credit card(they are<br/>
&gt; evil) so I went to get a gamecard and when I tried to get into the<br/>
&gt; account, it kicked me out again!! Back to square one!! I tried<br/>
&gt; buying the game on cd and got the same issue.<br/>
&gt; By the way I did defrag(and needed it) but to no avail.<br/>
&gt; My big question is why can&#39;t I post at the station? I have cookies<br/>
&gt; enabled, I&#39;m signed in and it says &quot;hi muddywag&quot; at the top, but it<br/>
&gt; keeps telling me that I need to be registered.  AHHH! IWANNA KILL A<br/>
&gt; BAT!!  By the way I CAN play the tutorial.  Which only served to let<br/>
&gt; me know that I&#39;ll REALLY like this game- someday!!<br/>

&gt; &gt; I had problems with EQ crashing  too...turned out to be a filthy<br/>

&gt; on the desktop, look very seriously into heat as a cause.<br/>

&gt; &gt;   Have you defragged your hard drive lately? I have had some<br/>
&gt; instances in games, DAOC, Warcraft III, where the game would crash<br/>
&gt; or drop to the desktop and defragging the drive helped for a while.<br/>
&gt; I have actually been having problems with EQ dropping unexpectedly<br/>
&gt; lately now that I think about it. I have yet to defrag my HD but I<br/>
&gt; know I haven&#39;t done it in over a month, so it could be the problem.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;     Hello.  I bought eq today along with a game card.  I installed<br/>
&gt; it,<br/>
&gt; &gt;     went to new account, and when I click it it bounces me to the<br/>
&gt; &gt;     desktop.  i dried disabling my firewall, soundcard, starting<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt;     all unnecessary processes disabled.  uninstalled/installed<br/>
&gt; many<br/>
&gt; &gt;     times.  checked for irq and I found that the cable modem<br/>
&gt; network<br/>
&gt; &gt;     cark was sharing 12 with the onboard sound, tried moving the<br/>
&gt; network<br/>
&gt; &gt;     card and ended up having to reactivate xp!  As it stands, I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; yet<br/>
&gt; &gt;     to set foot in Norrath.<br/>
&gt; &gt;     I registered at the Station, and tried to use the tech<br/>
&gt; bulliten<br/>
&gt; &gt;     board, but it won&#39;t let me post, says that I need to me a<br/>
&gt; regisered<br/>
&gt; &gt;     user-- I thought I was!!<br/>
&gt; &gt;     anyways, that&#39;s why I&#39;m here.  PLEASE HELP!!  I can&#39;t wait to<br/>
&gt; play<br/>
&gt; &gt;     my new game!!!<br/>
&gt; &gt;     Thanks<br/>
&gt; &gt;     Dan<br/>
