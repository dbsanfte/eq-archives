<div id="ygrps-yiv-2097335099">Well, I just got on a bit ago, hunting in EW. Got the message that <br/>
they were doing an emergency shutdown in 10 minutes. Had to jump out. <br/>
I must assume that the EQ window option is the probable cause for <br/>
this emergency action.<br/>
<br/>
Still, the idea is good. I can see value in going out of the game to <br/>
check an information site, or even answer a chat. I don&#39;t know if my <br/>
marginal system can handle the window mode, but I will probably try <br/>
it. <br/>
<br/>
I think it is a good idea.<br/>
