<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787321437">Hi Keri,<br/>
<br/>
I know what you meant there. Though I know how everquest works, etc. But I got <br/>
online and didn&#39;t have much luck getting into groups. Everyone seem to do their <br/>
own thing and ignore me. I got to 7th level, but then go bored because I wanted to <br/>
get into a group of people who are online at the same time, which never seem to <br/>
happen.<br/>
Me coming from Australia (pacific time zone) didn&#39;t help either! lol! So given up and <br/>
now sticking games like Diablo 2, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway to answer your quest, to cast spell you need to click on the crystal icon <br/>
on your screen.<br/>
<br/>
To talk to people type /say HI! or /shout , etc.<br/>
<br/>
I love the concept of everquest but because none of my RL friends play makes it <br/>
kind of waste of time for me as it is a group orientated game.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Regards<br/>
Cha<br/>

&gt; Hi everyone.	I just got the game Everquest and am so confused!  I<br/>
&gt; read <br/>
&gt; through the manual and can get around but how do you cast spells,<br/>
&gt; talk to <br/>
&gt; people around you, etc.??  I&#39;m about to give up lol.	I&#39;d tell you my<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; characters name but I can&#39;t remember. :)  She is in the first world<br/>
&gt; though.  <br/>
&gt; Thanks ahead of time for any advice/help you can give me!<br/>
&gt; Keri </span></blockquote></div>
