<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941145444"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">Do things ever happen on your server and you want to tell someone but no one 
<br>you know will care? &nbsp;Does that make sense? &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Maybe it&#39;s just because I&#39;m a female and feel the need to gossip. &nbsp;I don&#39;t 
<br>know any females in RL that play the game. &nbsp;Only my husband and his friends. &nbsp;
<br>They don&#39;t care about the gossip of the game. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>The funniest things I see go on between males and females. &nbsp;Jealously mainly. 
<br>&nbsp;Female A gets jealous when Female B is flirting with Male A who &quot;belongs&quot; to 
<br>Female A. &nbsp;Male C is married to Female C. &nbsp;Female C&#39;s alt is engaged to Male 
<br>D. &nbsp;Male C doesn&#39;t like that Female C&#39;s alt is engaged to someone else. &nbsp;
<br>Stuff like that...I find it amusing. &nbsp;Everquest could turn into this huge 
<br>soap opera. &nbsp;Who cares about loot, who&#39;s &quot;cheating&quot; on who? &nbsp;It&#39;s just a game 
<br>and sometimes people really take it seriously. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>And since we have a former guide (or where you a GM) on here I have a 
<br>question. &nbsp;When you get married and you take the surname of your 
<br>husband...can you hypenate??? &nbsp;I don&#39;t like his last name (my RL husband&#39;s 
<br>character that is). &nbsp;It doesn&#39;t sound &quot;catchy&quot; with my first name. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Ok and I didn&#39;t know you could get divorced in Norrath. &nbsp;I just find that 
<br>funny too. &nbsp;I might want to marry my RL husband&#39;s character just to divorce 
<br>him. &nbsp;He doesn&#39;t take out the trash one night...I divorce him in EQ. &nbsp;LOL. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Ok so anyway. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Also, I wonder how many of Norrath marriages have one person being a young 14 
<br>to 16 year old male and the other either an old guy pretending to be a female 
<br>or an older female. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>What do you think the percentage of actual female players versus actual male 
<br>players are in the game? &nbsp;
