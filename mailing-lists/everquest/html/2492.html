<div id="ygrps-yiv-425813016">Not pathetic. Just new. Tax season? My brother in law is a cpa, and <br/>
at the end of tax season he looks like he has been beaten up.<br/>
<br/>
Try looking at alakhazam or caster&#39;s realm for something on quests. <br/>
As to names, try out ones that are easy to type. makes it easier on <br/>
other players. My first druid had a long name. This one just started <br/>
as Barto. My warrior, Bartoo. My magician i called martondo, a bit <br/>
longer but easy to type, and the best I could think of at the time <br/>
that the game would accept.<br/>
<br/>
Get some maps from the eq atlas, a link from alakhazam. I have quite <br/>
a few printed and in a binder for easy reference. better than getting <br/>
lost.<br/>
<br/>
when playing solo you have to find your own play style. I tend to be <br/>
cautious, exploring with care and engaging mostly things that are <br/>
blue. My son&#39;s play a bit more boldly, less concerned with getting <br/>
killed. Though the one that is a mid-40&#39;s shadow knight has become a <br/>
bit more cautious after learning how expensive higher level deaths <br/>
can be.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, and look into trade skills. a nice part of the game for those <br/>
who find it interesting. Some very high level quests require some <br/>
good trade skills, so they can be worthwhile, especially if you enjoy <br/>
pursuing the advancements. Not the same thrill as hack and loot, but <br/>
some of us find this aspect fun.<br/>
<br/>
good hunting to you.<br/>

&gt; So many questions, so little time....am really bummed<br/>
&gt; because with it being tax season and all I am not<br/>
&gt; getting much game time...Is really hard for this<br/>
&gt; newbie who is itching to play, play, play...Here is my<br/>
&gt; question though...I already have two characters that I<br/>
&gt; play with my boyfriend but am wanting to add a couple<br/>
&gt; characters to play with when he is over at<br/>
&gt; Fennin...While I am too afraid to play her now, I have<br/>
&gt; thoughts of an Enchanter but am also thinking of a<br/>
&gt; Druid character...I have a name for my Enchanter but<br/>
&gt; am at a loss for something really creative for my<br/>
&gt; Druid...Any suggestions on websites for research for a<br/>
&gt; name?  Guess I could go to Google but I thought I<br/>
&gt; would check with you guys first.  Also, any<br/>
&gt; suggestions for a really easy quest for my Cleric? <br/>
&gt; One I might be able to do fairly easily on my own?  I<br/>
&gt; have got to start learning this game on my own instead<br/>
&gt; of just doing what HE tells me to do...you know, AUTO<br/>
&gt; FOLLOW, ASSIST, Here take this..LOL...LOL...I keep<br/>
&gt; running around Freeport afraid to go out cause I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know if I could find my way back...I sound pathetic<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t I?? :-)<br/>
