<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020836013">I&#39;ve read about that, but I&#39;ve got an extra fan installed on the <br/>
side of the case blowing on the cpu and videocard. Also, I&#39;m <br/>
not playing the game. I can&#39;t get past the account setup.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t mention that I had downloaded the full version of the game a <br/>
few days ago and got this problem then as well.  one of the things <br/>
that I did was remove my unused 56k pci modem, then I moved my <br/>
network card to a different slot and was able to gett into the new <br/>
account screen. I was able to add my name and other registration <br/>
stuff, but couldn&#39;t go any further as I had no credit card(they are <br/>
evil) so I went to get a gamecard and when I tried to get into the <br/>
account, it kicked me out again!! Back to square one!! I tried <br/>
buying the game on cd and got the same issue. <br/>
By the way I did defrag(and needed it) but to no avail.<br/>
My big question is why can&#39;t I post at the station? I have cookies <br/>
enabled, I&#39;m signed in and it says &quot;hi muddywag&quot; at the top, but it <br/>
keeps telling me that I need to be registered.  AHHH! IWANNA KILL A <br/>
BAT!!  By the way I CAN play the tutorial.  Which only served to let <br/>
me know that I&#39;ll REALLY like this game- someday!!<br/>

on the desktop, look very seriously into heat as a cause. <br/>

&gt;   Have you defragged your hard drive lately? I have had some <br/>
instances in games, DAOC, Warcraft III, where the game would crash <br/>
or drop to the desktop and defragging the drive helped for a while. <br/>
I have actually been having problems with EQ dropping unexpectedly <br/>
lately now that I think about it. I have yet to defrag my HD but I <br/>
know I haven&#39;t done it in over a month, so it could be the problem.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;     Hello.  I bought eq today along with a game card.  I installed <br/>
it, <br/>
&gt;     went to new account, and when I click it it bounces me to the <br/>
&gt;     desktop.  i dried disabling my firewall, soundcard, starting <br/>
with <br/>
&gt;     all unnecessary processes disabled.  uninstalled/installed <br/>
many <br/>
&gt;     times.  checked for irq and I found that the cable modem <br/>
network <br/>
&gt;     cark was sharing 12 with the onboard sound, tried moving the <br/>
network <br/>
&gt;     card and ended up having to reactivate xp!  As it stands, I&#39;ve <br/>
yet <br/>
&gt;     to set foot in Norrath.<br/>
&gt;     I registered at the Station, and tried to use the tech <br/>
bulliten <br/>
&gt;     board, but it won&#39;t let me post, says that I need to me a <br/>
regisered <br/>
&gt;     user-- I thought I was!!<br/>
&gt;     anyways, that&#39;s why I&#39;m here.  PLEASE HELP!!  I can&#39;t wait to <br/>
play <br/>
&gt;     my new game!!!<br/>
&gt;     Thanks<br/>
&gt;     Dan<br/>
