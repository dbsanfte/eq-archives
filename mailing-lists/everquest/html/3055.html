&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess it depends on if you want to play an<br/>
&gt; important role in epic encounters or be able to solo<br/>
&gt; well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The classes that seem to be really important in epic<br/>
&gt; encounters are the warrior(defensive),<br/>
&gt; cleric(complete heal), enchanter(haste and clarity),<br/>
&gt; rogue(melee damage), wizard(magic damage) and<br/>
&gt; bard(resistance buffs). The other classes are better<br/>
&gt; if you want to play mostly by yourself, explore,<br/>
&gt; camp items, do quests, and just generally have fun.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am playing a paladin/magician duo right now and<br/>
&gt; they can really destroy what they are fighting,<br/>
&gt; often as many as 4 blues at once. The last classes I<br/>
&gt; tried were enchanter, wizard and ranger and those<br/>
&gt; are all really weak. I wanted to play some classes<br/>
&gt; that could kill exp giving mobs without resorting to<br/>
&gt; any kiting techniques, and actually go into<br/>
&gt; dungeons.  <br/>

&gt;   Another class that might be good is shadowknight.<br/>
&gt; The drawbacks: Good races<br/>
&gt;   won&#39;t want to sell to you and some may even want<br/>
&gt; to kill you. If you play a<br/>
&gt;   darkelf the newbie grounds completely and totally<br/>
&gt; suck but you get pretty<br/>
&gt;   cool armor when you can manage to find all the<br/>
&gt; stuff you need for it. People<br/>
&gt;   don&#39;t think of shadowknights when they think of<br/>
&gt; tanks. They don&#39;t often<br/>
&gt;   invite them to group. I don&#39;t think they get the<br/>
&gt; spell &quot;gate&quot;.<br/>
&gt;   The bonuses: You make a decent tank, you can<br/>
&gt; summon a pet to tank for you<br/>
&gt;   while you med, you can lifetap to heal yourself,<br/>
&gt; and you get a spell that<br/>
&gt;   snares and dots a mob at the same time. You can<br/>
&gt; solo alot and are a good<br/>
&gt;   asset to a group. Way later in the game you get to<br/>
&gt; summon your own horse<br/>
&gt;   called an Unholy Steed.<br/>
&gt;   My brother started a shadowknight and got him to<br/>
&gt; lvl 35 in 8 days.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Paladins are welcome in all good cities. Don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; usually have problems selling<br/>
&gt;   to merchants. Get good damage, duel wield, disarm.<br/>
&gt; Are thought of as tanks<br/>
&gt;   and can get into group. Can also heal and buff.<br/>
&gt; Can even resurrect. But they<br/>
&gt;   cannot gate. They can solo pretty well with a good<br/>
&gt; weapon and armor. There<br/>
&gt;   are newbie paladin armor quests for humans and<br/>
&gt; halfelves in freeport.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Druids, not really great tanks but can snare/root<br/>
&gt; and dot from afar. sucks<br/>
&gt;   alot of mana. Sometimes they can charm an animal<br/>
&gt; to attack a mob for them.<br/>
&gt;   But then the animal turns and attacks them when<br/>
&gt; charm wears off. They can<br/>
&gt;   also track, port, and heal.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   If you like things to be more difficult, there&#39;s<br/>
&gt; clerics. They can pretty<br/>
&gt;   much get into any group because people always seem<br/>
&gt; to want a healer. But<br/>
&gt;   they can&#39;t really solo much and have alot of<br/>
&gt; downtime from medding.<br/>
&gt;   luv,<br/>
&gt;   -Su<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; It depends on your playstyle. Solo or group,<br/>
&gt; this will matter a lot later,<br/>
&gt;   &gt; the druid you can solo all the way to level60<br/>
&gt; with if you want and can<br/>
&gt;   group<br/>
&gt;   &gt; up, but the warrior will have problems crossing<br/>
&gt; the road without getting<br/>
&gt;   &gt; killed without a healer back him up. But the<br/>
&gt; warrior is in need in numbers<br/>
&gt;   &gt; in the highe end raiding game where the druid is<br/>
&gt; an assist class.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; Answer is: it depends on your goals.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>

&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; I choose to be a Ranger right at the start,<br/>
&gt; maybe a bad choice<br/>
&gt;   &gt; because i&#39;m dying more often then playing.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; What is the best way to get started, & and which<br/>
&gt; character is a good<br/>
&gt;   &gt; newbie character?<br/>
