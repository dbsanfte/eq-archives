<div id="ygrps-yiv-946422931"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">I recently had grouped with someone who when he would ask for breeze, I would 
<br>right then breeze him. &nbsp;I asked very politely 
<br>
<br>/g My Sow is gone, may I please get another?
<br>
<br>No response, nothing. &nbsp;Finally 10 minutes later, I asked politely again. &nbsp;
<br>Nothing. 5 minutes later he asked for a breeze, I breeze him and said /g May 
<br>I have a sow when you get enough mana? &nbsp;Nothing. &nbsp;At this point my husband 
<br>was telling me to leave the group. &nbsp;But the others were great and I didn&#39;t 
<br>want to leave because of this guy. &nbsp;Finally I asked one more time, again 
<br>politely, and he finally does it.

<br>usually ignore them especially when they are rude about it. &nbsp;My husband and
<br>I both play at the same time and usually group together, and occasionally we
<br>will pick up someone and group with them. &nbsp;I think what I hate the most is
<br>when the other people in the group ask for SoW&#39;s and do it quite rudely.
<br>
<br>/g SOW me
<br>
<br>HOW RUDE&gt;&gt;&gt;!!!!
<br>
<br>Usually when people do that I tell my husband that I want to leave the group
<br>or don&#39;t buff that guy as much as the others. &nbsp;I can&#39;t stand that. &nbsp;If
<br>people want to group because I know its better and you can fight more, lets
<br>try not being so RUDE!
