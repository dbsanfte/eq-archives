do you have to keep track of? Its just one person.&nbsp; If its me I get rid of 
all my pp and gold give to a tank to hold that way its easier to just /split x x 
as we go.&nbsp; I just write down how much I have after each split so I know 
whets mine and whets theirs.&nbsp; Every few mobs you just type /s 12, I usually 
come out on the short end of the stick because I round up a lot and everyone 
else winds up getting more but no big deal its worth it not to have to target 
corpses or try and look over them.</span></font></div>

    don&#39;t FFA, Alpha or <br>roll for anything that&#39;s not a special drop. &nbsp;I 
    would say 99% of the time <br>the group picks someone we can trust and 
    someone with more than two bags of <br>free space to hold loot and that 
    person loots everything and when its time <br>for someone to leave he splits 
    the pp and the items that he has looted. <br>This system works very well for 
    most the groups I have been in. <br><br>Mu</blockquote></font><font color="#000000"
