Subject: [EverQuest] Adventures of a tailor/smithy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I had just returned from looting Permafrost to my home of Rivervale.<br/>
&gt; I sold my loot, visited the bank, and ran into a high level wood elf<br/>
&gt; druid. He was seeking a tailor to make the new 100% weight reduction<br/>
&gt; bags.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I told him I was a level 80 tailor, and level 70 smith. After not<br/>
&gt; finding anyone better, he and I went to the Vale Forge to try to make<br/>
&gt; the Vale Sewing Kit I would need. As getting parts for this kit<br/>
&gt; happens to be my present goal, I was delighted.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He had parts for five tries. In five tries I failed five times, but<br/>
&gt; gained three levels. Not bad for me, but unfortunate for my new<br/>
&gt; friend.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I gained also in learning how to get my hq metal bits. I have been<br/>
&gt; seeking the ore, but he suggested reverse-engineering fine steel<br/>
&gt; weapons. He said a fs weapon, flask of water, and chisel can break<br/>
&gt; down the fs weapon to the component parts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He suggested Hill Giants in Raith Mountains as a good source of fs<br/>
&gt; weapons to work with. I am nearly leveled enough for that adventure,<br/>
&gt; and so I may direct my efforts to leveling a bit so I may follow this<br/>
&gt; advice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone know of other good hunting which nets fine steel drops? I<br/>
&gt; expect that my quest to make my Vale Sewing Kit will raise my<br/>
&gt; experience and my smithing levels quite nicely.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And about reverse engineering. Anyone know much about this? For<br/>
&gt; example, I looted a chainmail tunic in Permafrost, but it was too<br/>
&gt; large for my alts to use. However, if I could break it down into<br/>
&gt; parts and remake it with the correct pattern for a small character, I<br/>
&gt; could come out ahead. Any idea if this works?<br/>

Fine steel drops off of Tae Ew mobs in Feerott near the Cazic Thule entrance<br/>
and off of pickclaw warriors and raiders in Highkeep. I think some sand and<br/>
hill giants drop fine steel as well. Rathe mountains has wonderful loot.<br/>
