<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533861199"><p>Basically you have a proc on your weapon..&nbsp; depending on what it is,&nbsp; you need to be a certain level before it will proc for you.&nbsp; If what you have is a velium mace,&nbsp; it won&#39;t proc until you are level 25 &amp; by then it is pretty much a useless weapon.&nbsp; you should look up what weapon you have on allakahzams,&nbsp; &amp; it will tell you when it will proc for you. (a proc is extra damage,&nbsp; like a velium weapon procs velium shards for about 25 dmg)
