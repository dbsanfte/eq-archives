	First of all my apologis, I wasn&#39;t flaming you or anything. It did <br/>
sound that way huh? It&#39;s cool you were able to get PL&#39;d by a player who <br/>
was willing to sit that long and do it for nothing in return. That is <br/>
VERY rare. I will admit that I am a little sceptical about the being <br/>
naked part, you had to have some sort of decent armor on. But again <br/>
thats just me, It may actually be possible to do it &quot;naked&quot;.<br/>
	I guess the biggest concern with PL&#39;ing for me is if you are PL&#39;d solo <br/>
you don&#39;t gain that &quot;group experience&quot;. What I mean there is not actual <br/>
experience points but how to function in a group. I&#39;ve had groups where <br/>
I&#39;ve been with PL&#39;d newbs that would just wrecklessly pull at thier whim <br/>
(cause thats all they know how to do) and end up nearly killing the <br/>
entire group because they wouldn&#39;t respect the puller or the group and <br/>
want that &quot;high&quot; from geting all that exp so fast. Im refering to the <br/>
rush one gets from being PL&#39;d solo and then seeing how fast they level <br/>
vs. the speed they level at while in a group. It&#39;s a much different <br/>
feeling.<br/>

&gt; Well first off if your a first time player. Good luck geeting a druid <br/>
&gt; to help. Secound i could get power lvled to 30 but ass naked if need <br/>
&gt; be. Gear just makes it eaasyer on the druid. However you find  druid <br/>
&gt; to lvl you and Useually  that well toss you crap out of the bank at <br/>
&gt; you (what iam wearing)in fact my pants ar ac 4. and as far as zones <br/>
&gt; go well i just bought the plat cd set and it has all but one zone on <br/>
&gt; it. 90 percent of the sets you buy today well have these zones if by <br/>
&gt; chance you find the origanle eq game in the bargain  bin its still <br/>
&gt; cheaper to buy the platinum cd set. so IAM sorry you cant seem to <br/>
&gt; find a druid to help you. the thread was on how to. not how to get <br/>
&gt; some one to do so. Iam an experinced player, and know how where and <br/>
&gt; when.  As a rogue iam grp dependent on groups yet i can still solo. <br/>
&gt; only by knowledge and bandaids lot of bandaids. if your a casual <br/>
&gt; player with one or two hours a week to play try a staarting a druid <br/>
&gt; and then you could power lvl yourself.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
