<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1027926688">Because of spammers. Before I turned posting pictures off there were some spammers uploading things that had nothing to do with EverQuest so I had to turn it off to prevent it. They were doing that for file uploading as well so I had to disable that.<br/>
Otherwise we&#39;d be getting graphics of ads for lousy porn and probably those annoying ones about Islam. Possibly those scams from Nigeria as well.<br/>
