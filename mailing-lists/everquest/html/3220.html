&gt; &gt; I was hunting the gnolls at the Spires in SK when I learned <br/>
&gt; something <br/>
&gt; &gt; about them which others may find useful.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; My current technique for gnolling is to find one by himself, and <br/>
&gt; hit <br/>
&gt; &gt; him with Creeping Crud. That dot gets his attention, and begins <br/>
&gt; doing <br/>
&gt; &gt; damage. I then begin running away from the Spires, to get some <br/>
&gt; &gt; distance from any possible gnoll back-up. Once I have the <br/>
distance <br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; &gt; want, I root him and hit him with another dot, Incinerate in this <br/>
&gt; &gt; case. I then rest to regain mana. I will run, root, and dot him <br/>
&gt; until <br/>
&gt; &gt; dead. With luck I have enough mana left to rest only a short time <br/>
&gt; &gt; before I go get another.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I was talking with my son-in-law while taking one gnoll, and <br/>
rooted <br/>
&gt; &gt; the thing at the spire rather than pulling him away. I guess I <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; &gt; distracted. A second gnoll came along and agroed on me, driving <br/>
me <br/>
&gt; &gt; away. I knew I did not have the mana to manage both, so ran south <br/>
&gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; Lake Raithtear. I reached the zone well ahead of them. I rested <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; &gt; full capacity, with no gnolls in sight. Didn&#39;t even zone.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I went back to get some more gnolls, but found someone camping <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; spire I had been working. I started to leave, honoring his claim <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; &gt; an abandoned camp, when a gnoll hit me from behind. I lead him on <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; &gt; fatal chase. The camper sent a tell regarding a perceived <br/>
violation <br/>
&gt; &gt; of camp courtesy, for which I appologized.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It seems that the gnolls will abandon a chase after some time and <br/>
&gt; &gt; distance, but remember you well. The second gnoll I had been <br/>
&gt; involved <br/>
&gt; &gt; with agroed on me from a considerable distance from the Spires. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So, gnoll hunters, keep in mind that an injured gnoll has a long <br/>
&gt; &gt; memory, and even longer agro range.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>

&gt; Yes, I&#39;ve had the same thing happen to me.  As long as you are the <br/>
&gt; only one to do damage to them you are still their primary target.  <br/>
&gt; Just wait until you get to Kunark, the place is crawling with <br/>
mobs!  <br/>
&gt; It looks like a newbie zone on Anatonica.  I&#39;ve run through FM and <br/>
&gt; seen giants, brutes, goblins and Burnayi all within aggro range of <br/>
&gt; each other.  So be careful!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for DoT&#39;in them I prefer to DD or shoot them, snare them, root <br/>
&gt; them then DoT them.  I read somewhere that DoT&#39;s work better if the <br/>
&gt; mob isn&#39;t moving.  As a Ranger I then pile on the arrows (Can&#39;t <br/>
wait <br/>
&gt; for Tolans Bracer!) and wade in when the root breaks.  If you get 2 <br/>
&gt; park one one, snare him and blast the other one.  You can even <br/>
&gt; Harmony him to break his aggro!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let&#39;s be safe out there!<br/>
