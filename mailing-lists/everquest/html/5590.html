<b>Subject:</b> Another Question.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-7045211">This might be a silly question for those of you who are experts at <br/>
playing Everquest, but, I still have to ask it.  What does it mean <br/>
when a person shouts &quot;looking for group check&quot;?  I&#39;ve been playing <br/>
for just over a year and have never quite figured out if this means <br/>
that the person is looking for new group members or if they are <br/>
acoounting for the members that are already in the group.  Just a <br/>
question from someone who simply does not know.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</div>
