<br/>
I have a sorta newby question.  Last spring I bought Evolution thinking I would<br/>
re-join Norrath.  Well, apparently not!  My system couldn&#39;t handle the change<br/>
on the first of April (no matter what I tried, my sad, tired machine couldn&#39;t deal<br/>
with the changes).  So, now I have a new machine that will work with the game<br/>
and will be getting dsl shortly.   I will be using the game I bought (Evolution) and<br/>
would like to know if any of the expansions beyond LoY offer anything for the<br/>
&#39;new&#39;, young player or if they are mostly for above levels 20, 30, 40, 50 or more?<br/>
<br/>
When I first played (on a borrowed account to see if I would like it) I couldn&#39;t get<br/>
out of the room/building where I was created!!!  It was hysterical!  My Mentor had<br/>
to come get me!  and he was kos in Felwithe!  I definately won&#39;t be repeating <br/>
that scenario......LOL<br/>
