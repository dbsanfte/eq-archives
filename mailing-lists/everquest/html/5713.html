<div id="ygrps-yiv-1901049765">Is there some way to see my faction scores?<br/>
<br/>
How can I tell what faction somebody is?  I see a guard and he does <br/>
not like me, how do I know what faction I need to raise to impress <br/>
him?<br/>
<br/>
I am an Iksar Swiftail Monk (yeah, question 2 comes up a lot) and I <br/>
just completed a quest.  It told me my faction with the Swiftails <br/>
increased.  Is that any good for anything?  They already think of me <br/>
amiably, can it get any better?<br/>
<br/>
Are there ever faction changes you are not told about?  When I kill <br/>
some creatures there is no message about a faction change, is it <br/>
possible one happened anyway?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
