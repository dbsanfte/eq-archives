<div id="ygrps-yiv-909364500"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">I&#39;ve seen and grouped with alot of female characters who were really males in 
<br>RL and I know there are some female characters in my guild who are males in 
<br>RL. &nbsp;So I&#39;m always curious as to the RL sex of the player of a female 
<br>character. &nbsp;

<br>where I know the player personally, *all* are RL females. &nbsp;Of course, maybe 
<br>I just know some weird girls, lol.</font><font COLOR="#000000" SIZE="2" FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial">
