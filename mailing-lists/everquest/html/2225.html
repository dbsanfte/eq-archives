<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219369713">Yes, necros are considered evil. In fact, my gnome necro was not able to buy<br/>
the spell Gate at the Caster&#39;s Guild in Akanon, his own home town. The<br/>
merchants would not even talk to him. I believe that gnome necros might even<br/>
be KOS in &quot;good&quot; cities, like Kelethin (not sure about that).<br/>
<br/>
From a purely role-playing perspective, you are entirely correct. Nobody<br/>
should want to group with a necromancer or a shadow knight -IF- they are<br/>
&quot;good&quot; themselves. In fact, a wood elf, for example, would not group with a<br/>
troll, ogre, iksar, or dark elf, period.<br/>
<br/>
However, you may have noticed =) that there is not that much true<br/>
role-playing and a lot of leveling and acquiring goodies in this game, and<br/>
so you see high elf paladins grouped with iksar necromancers, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that sort of grouping is not even possible on the Firiona Vie<br/>
(role-play) server, but I have not played my character to a high enough<br/>
level on that server to find out.<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] Necro questions myself.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Is a Necro considered evil? And if so, I always see<br/>
&gt; grouping and stuff in posts,which is why I wonder how<br/>
&gt; a necro can group since who would want an evil<br/>
&gt; char....IE: Paladin and Druid? Would they want a Necro<br/>
&gt; in a group?<br/>
