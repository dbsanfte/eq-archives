<div id="ygrps-yiv-726829928">There are lot&#39;s of options.  But finding a group before 20 isn&#39;t so <br/>
easy now.  You can try any of the Derv camps in Ro, Oasis, the <br/>
Commons.  Aqua Goblins camps in BB are good too.  Or you can go to <br/>
Highpass and do both Gnolls and Orcs.  You can get groups in PC and <br/>
that&#39;s the happening place for people your level.<br/>
<br/>
EQAtlas is good for maps and guides, but he doesn&#39;t update it <br/>
anymore.  Thank Sony for that.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good to see you working on group skills.  Too many people solo <br/>
so much when they need to group they have no clue what to do.<br/>
