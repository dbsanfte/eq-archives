<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032578351">For those of you who took the time to read my previous posting in reguards <br/>
to the 7500pp I lost to an exploiter, I would like to take the time to thank <br/>
you all. I recieved numerous suggestions, and more support than I ever <br/>
expected to get about the matter. But after all I have tried to accomplish, <br/>
it has amounted to nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Last night, I once again was in a heated debate with Tinysa (even though I <br/>
had been informed by a guide that she wouldn&#39;t be on until Thursday night).<br/>
<br/>
After lengthy discussion, I was informed that neither my money nor the Thick <br/>
Banded Belt would be returned to me, as there was no record on the backup <br/>
tapes of the transaction having ever occured. I was informed after much <br/>
questioning, that ALL COMPLETED trades conducted by players was logged.<br/>
<br/>
Grudgingly, I got Tinysa to admit that it seemed a bit odd that 7500pp would <br/>
simply vanish off a character into thin air. However, I was informed that it <br/>
did not warrant further investigation because I could have just left the <br/>
cash on the ground for someone else to pick up which also would not have <br/>
been logged (yeah - as if I&#39;m going to leave 48+ days of savings around for <br/>
someone to pick up).<br/>
<br/>
Based upon the information I recieved last night, and from the numerous <br/>
emails I have recieved from other players about the matter, I have come to <br/>
the following conclusion - I believe that the Thick Banded Belt that I <br/>
bought had indeed been exchanged. However it is my belief that for whatever <br/>
reason, the server detected it as a duplicate, and destroyed it. As such, it <br/>
would not have registered as a completed trade, and there for would not have <br/>
been logged.<br/>
<br/>
To the best of my knowledge, the GM&#39;s did everything they possibly could to <br/>
verify this information short of restoring the offending character, and <br/>
verifying that they did indeed have my 7500pp cash. In fact, they had me <br/>
doubting that I had actually conducted the trade until I pulled up the <br/>
screenshot of the trade that I had managed to take a snapshot of, and looked <br/>
at it closely. Based on the screenshot which I myself had taken, I can <br/>
clearly see the items in question in both trade windows so I know the trade <br/>
had taken place. I also presented the time and date that it occured <br/>
(Date/Time info off of the screenshot) to no avail. In the end, I lost my <br/>
money. I&#39;ll never see it again...... Cheaters 99999..... Good guys <br/>
0............. I guess it doesn&#39;t pay to be honest.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, I stress the fact that I merely present this information to all <br/>
so that you may avoid having this happen to you. This in no way is a rant, <br/>
flame, gripe, or an attempt to get a thread going about duping/cheating.<br/>
