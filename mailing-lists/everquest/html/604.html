<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787915148">It has nothing to do with holding an item...   its the ability to<br/>
equip such items.  You should be able to store such items in your bank until<br/>
the time in which you have proven the ability to use such items.  They<br/>
already have a form of this now.  Some weapons, which have a magical effect,<br/>
will not cast its spell until the bearer has achieved a certain level.  If<br/>
you wish to make the game a tad bit closer to reality how could you expect a<br/>
low level squire to have the ability to skillfully use the same weapon as<br/>
someone who has achieved the Master skill level for 2H slash. <br/>
