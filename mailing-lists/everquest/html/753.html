<div id="ygrps-yiv-518985123">i think the biggest point here is that as far as she can tell, the<br/>
characters are matched except for gender.  wouldn&#39;t it be one sick joke if<br/>
Verant had been nerfing the genders differently all along so that the female<br/>
is easier to play than her male equivalent?  this would definitely<br/>
demonstrate an evil intent by Verant to undermind the family unit and i<br/>
would have to report them to the appropriate conservative left wing<br/>
factions....just kidding.<br/>
<br/>
really wouldn&#39;t put it past them though...seriously<br/>

Well, this is probably just being caused by random rolls, and even if it<br/>
isnt, his better spell-casting abilities you talked about would be better.<br/>
Don&#39;t worry about melee damage, after 25 or so I rarely used it, and if you<br/>
really wanted to you could give it up after 14 or so. Also you said you used<br/>
cracked staves, consider switching to 1hs and 2hb, then 1hb if you have<br/>
time. At higher levels 1hs is much better for druids then 1hb.<br/>
