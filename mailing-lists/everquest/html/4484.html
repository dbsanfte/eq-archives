<div id="ygrps-yiv-94690097">Good morning everybody :) I was wondering if there are any Erudite <br/>
Enchanter Quests out there that aren&#39;t listed on the Alakhazam site? <br/>
I was so excited to get to level 12 so I could use my Dark Elf <br/>
Illusion spell to finish the Stein of Moggok quest. Did it twice, <br/>
guess what? Clurg&#39;s goon didn&#39;t kill me this time, but Clurg gave me <br/>
some exp. and NO stein! I am going to do this quest again and again <br/>
just to get the book. Heck, giving the book to Gregor gives you 4PP <br/>
and exp! What can I do to raise faction with the Ogres so Clurg will <br/>
give me my stein?!<br/>
<br/>
A couple nights ago I thought I&#39;d get my jeweler&#39;s kit out of the  <br/>
bank that I bought 2 months ago and combine a Velium Ruby with an <br/>
Enchanted Silver bar. It said &quot;you can not use this container for <br/>
this&quot; or something like that. I had thrown 5 training points into <br/>
jewel making when I was level 5 so I figured I&#39;d try it out. The I <br/>
bought a Lupis stone (I think that&#39;s what it&#39;s called) and put it in <br/>
the container with the bar and it made a necklace! I was so excited <br/>
LOL. Ok, so what do you all suggest I try to make next where the <br/>
components are somewhat cheap to buy because I am broke? Also, I want <br/>
to buy the &quot;Enchant Silver&quot; spell but can&#39;t seem to find it. I am in <br/>
Qeynos but none of those vendors sell it...<br/>
<br/>
This is long-winded, sorry :) Have a great day everyone.</div>
