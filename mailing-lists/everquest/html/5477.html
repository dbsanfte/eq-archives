&gt;  EQtraders.com is the best place to learn recipes for tradeskills.<br/>
&gt; The Plains root and water flask combination will make Plains Dye. <br/>
&gt; This is used for LoY tailored robes not to dye armor. <br/>
&gt;  If want you are wanting to do is change the color of visible armor <br/>
&gt; on your toon, then here is what you need to do:<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  First, you need the LoY expansion.(just a reminder)<br/>
&gt;  Now time to make some stuff:<br/>
&gt;     In a kiln put a Unfired Vial and a High Quality Firing Sheet<br/>
&gt;   the trivial on this is 54. (pottery skill)<br/>
&gt;     In a brew barrel or medicine bag combine a Prism Shard and <br/>
Glaze <br/>
&gt; Lacquer, this is also trivial at 54. (brewing skill)<br/>
&gt;     You now will have a Dye Vial and Prismatic Dye, combine these <br/>
two <br/>
&gt; items in a brew barrel or medicine bag. trivial at 68<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  On your inventory screen there is a button that says dye. This is <br/>
&gt; used to pick the color to dye your armor.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Good Luck<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have a question about dying my armor. Is there a website that <br/>
has <br/>
&gt; &gt; the dye recipes and the steps I need to take to make dyes? I <br/>
found <br/>
&gt; &gt; something on Allakazham but it just listed the components needed <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; not what I need to do with them. I hunted in N. Karana to kill <br/>
&gt; &gt; beetles and get Plains Roots and put one at a time in a brewer <br/>
&gt; along <br/>
&gt; &gt; with a water flask. I am up to 3 in brewing now LOL. But no dye. <br/>
Do <br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; &gt; need to be putting a bottle or empty flask in there too with the <br/>
&gt; &gt; other stuff? And does anybody know what color Plains Dye is? <br/>
Thanks <br/>
&gt; &gt; in advance for your help.<br/>
