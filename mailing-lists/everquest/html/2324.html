<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-462121471">Got some sites you might want to check out<br/>
Allakhazam- a very good site for looking up quest information<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com">http://everquest.allakhazam.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Eqtraders-- tradeskill info, gives recipes and where to find <br/>
ingredients, good place to look up Vahshir quests<br/>

<br/>
Everquestraids-- site to get raids together.  Mostly used by the big <br/>
guilds to schedule epics but it&#39;s also used for lower level raids.  <br/>
You can look up guilds for your server from this site, that&#39;s how I <br/>
found my guild.<br/>

<br/>
EQ links-- a general info site.  You can look up links to other sites <br/>
on almost any EQ related topic.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eqlinks.com">http://www.eqlinks.com</a><br/>
<br/>
There are many more sites out there but these are the ones I use most <br/>
often.  <br/>
<br/>
Specifically to the guy on FV: I&#39;ve played on FV too and noticed that <br/>
not many people there are friendly.  On Bristlebane, every five mins <br/>
in Sharvahl there is a shout about the citizen quest, I put locs that <br/>
are needed on hotkey so i didn&#39;t have to type it anymore.  FV is a <br/>
hard server to learn about EQ on because of the ruleset.  Try a <br/>
different server-- don&#39;t go for a PVP one till you understand how to <br/>
play better.  Most of the people on FV have been playing for a long <br/>
time and they wanted a challenge, that&#39;s why they want to solo all <br/>
the time. <br/>
<br/>
If you wanna come to Bristlebane look me up<br/>
