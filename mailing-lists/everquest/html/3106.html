arrowheads.  Arrowheads go trivial at 41.  They might be good to <br/>
raise your skill to that point but are cheaper to buy.  And there&#39;s <br/>
no failures when you buy.<br/>
<br/>
But the new Condensed substance arrowheads are a reason to build your <br/>
smithing skill, as are the acrylia shafts.  The problem is all that <br/>
stuff is on the moon and it is in high level zones, except the <br/>
acrylia which is on mid-level mobs.  And they are all highly prized <br/>
thus hard to find.<br/>
<br/>
As for money, until the recent patch you could master blacksmithing <br/>
for under 100 plat if you had decent int.  Now most of the skill <br/>
building stuff, like skewers, top out in the 50&#39;s.  So you&#39;re stuck <br/>
having to make armor, and that&#39;s an expensive way to go.  And since I <br/>
haven&#39;t seen anyone looking for a smith in months it&#39;s probably <br/>
unprofitable.  I can&#39;t remember the last time I saw someone in banded <br/>
or even plate.  Everyone is in drop armor, or now their newbie armor.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily my guys mastered smithing a while ago.  It looks like <br/>
smithing will be expensive now, unless you find a lot of dropped <br/>
stuff to work with.  Good luck<br/>
