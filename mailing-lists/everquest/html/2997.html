<div id="ygrps-yiv-292062440">With the goal you set up your current loot scheme might work well. But<br/>
ponder this, some play more, some play less. Its also likely that those who<br/>
play more expect more from the game. In order to distribute loot fair in a<br/>
scenario like that you would need a better loot system than a simple /random<br/>
when something drops. If this isnt a problem for the people in your guild<br/>
then choose random. If it is, then try to find an alternative method. Based<br/>
on hours invested in guildraids, levels or whatever scheme that would fit<br/>
you. The general rule in our guild is that NOTHING comes for free basically.<br/>
For us we earn tradepoints for bossmob kills and raiding hours. these points<br/>
are our internal currency. if no one will be using an item its sold and<br/>
money to clerics/mages for peridots/pearls.<br/>
<br/>
At your level there isnt a lot you can do to raise funds, actually the<br/>
fastest way for you to get more is to a) trade all day and be good at it. b)<br/>
level up fast and take it from there. This does not leave out the trading<br/>
possibility as this becomes vital later on in game to fund reagents.<br/>
Remember that a peridot is 10pp and one is consumed on every aegolism cast.<br/>
Or that every cast of call of the hero takes a pearl for 5pp. But with your<br/>
level this will take a while. But some thinking on how to handle it is good.<br/>
Either via dues based on levels for example, as higher levels get more cash<br/>
or just grab all loot that isnt going to be equipped and sell it for<br/>
finance. And using autosplit on sucks hard. Heres why:<br/>
<br/>
lets say the mobs you kill drop 2pp and 5gold on average. You have a full<br/>
group. you kill one every 30 sec for 60 mins. Thats 120 mobs. That equals to<br/>
240pp and 1100gp. That should give each player 40pp and 183gp. But.... the<br/>
mobs wont drop money this evenly all the time. Some will drop 3 some will<br/>
drop 1pp. If you rotate looting it wont compensate this. fisrt player gets<br/>
1pp and 1gp. second player gets 1pp and 1 gp, third player gets 0pp and 1<br/>
gp. In the end the result in 99% of all groups are very skewed. and split<br/>
only works with single groups, how would you handle multiple groups? In<br/>
single group loot with cash you should assign a master looter (trusted<br/>
person) that loots EVERYTHING. When one person is about to leave you do a<br/>
manual /split &lt;pp&gt; &lt;gp&gt; &lt;sp&gt; &lt;cp&gt; of all cash earned during grind. This way<br/>
is much better from the fairness perspective. But then again, those using<br/>
reagents need a larger share of it. Worrying about cash loot is something<br/>
for the lower levels, higher up the only things that are worth any is bigger<br/>
gems or items. But since you only played for 4 months you havent experienced<br/>
that yet. <br/>
<br/>
The advice im offering is heavily skewed towards a raiding guild, this is<br/>
perhaps not at all what youre aiming for. But for me this is the purpose of<br/>
a guild, we meet basically everyday with the intent of killing something<br/>
big. There is not much time to do stuff outside guild. We raid about 4h<br/>
every day and if you want to play more then you do exp or quests basically.<br/>
We once were in the stadium you are setting as goal, and guildchat was<br/>
basically a chatchannel. But we reworked it as we grew. Reworking standars<br/>
and rules with old members can be a bit painful thats why its good with some<br/>
basic set of rules and organizational issues from the start.<br/>
<br/>
Well, try it out with your model and maybe change it later.<br/>

Subject: RE: [EverQuest] Guild Leaders Guide.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is sound advice and got me thinking.<br/>
<br/>
I have wanted to start a guild for a while now.  I<br/>
have only been playing since January and have 4 chars,<br/>
nothing above 20 level, yet close.  18 Druid, 18 Mage,<br/>
17 Ranger, and 13 Rogue.<br/>
<br/>
I am 37 years old and understand what it takes to form<br/>
a gaming group, since I have in the past.  Here are my<br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
But first the Goal of the guild and its purpose would<br/>
be as follows.:<br/>
 &quot;To promote a good gaming experience, meet fellow<br/>
players to build relationships/friendships, help<br/>
others when possible, and most important, to have fun<br/>
at what we do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That said,:<br/>
<br/>
1. You mention having GOOD funding.  Well, certainly<br/>
with no chars over 20 you can imagine I have like 300<br/>
PP combined if lucky. I would be looking to find new<br/>
players to EQ which would entice them to join my guild<br/>
for friendships and not freebies nor to promote<br/>
twinkies.  In fact, I would rather oppose twinkies for<br/>
this guild since there are plenty of others that<br/>
approve of it.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Loot would be ALWAYS keep split on, even on a<br/>
raid, and randomize anything worth while.  I would not<br/>
expect a char who earns some good PP on his own to<br/>
stash it in the guild vault, per se, but I might<br/>
decide to have them pay dues, or even after a raid,<br/>
donate something to the guild.<br/>
<br/>
Well to keep this short, what do you think?<br/>
Am I not at all high enough to even consider this or<br/>
can this work?<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts are appreciated, criticize away.<br/>

&gt; without a set goal just<br/>
&gt; inviting people randomly for no apparent reason.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The most important things that needs to be adressed<br/>
&gt; by a guild is:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Handling of loot (this is a central driving force<br/>
&gt; for many playing eq, like<br/>
&gt; it or not)<br/>
&gt; Leading events/Raids<br/>
&gt; Handling of recruiting<br/>
&gt; Selling off uneeded loot to finance guild<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The most common misconception (in my opinion) is<br/>
&gt; that cause youre a part of<br/>
&gt; a guild you get groups and items for free. You dont.<br/>
&gt; You work for them and<br/>
&gt; sometimes group within guild sometimes outside. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also running a guild costs in game money. Make sure<br/>
&gt; guild is well on<br/>
&gt; finances so you can give<br/>
&gt; clerics/chanters/wizards/magicians reagents for<br/>
&gt; raiding and not worry about beeing broke all the<br/>
&gt; time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Structure and leadership organization. How many<br/>
&gt; officers, what do they do,<br/>
&gt; is there a set chain of command. Democracy is good,<br/>
&gt; but not in all<br/>
&gt; questions. The larger you get the more likely that<br/>
&gt; one person doesnt like<br/>
&gt; another, this happens but they still need to be able<br/>
&gt; to respect each other.<br/>
&gt; Differences in opinions and personality exists, deal<br/>
&gt; with it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To simplify these tasks its much easier to have<br/>
&gt; offline boards that can<br/>
&gt; handle organizational tasks apart from the online<br/>
&gt; enjoyment. This is pretty<br/>
&gt; much the same as playing for a team in any sport<br/>
&gt; that requires 10+ people.<br/>
&gt; How well everyone understands and likes the goal of<br/>
&gt; the guild will determine<br/>
&gt; how successful you are. Its a bit harder here cause<br/>
&gt; things that are written<br/>
&gt; can easily be misunderstood cause of age and<br/>
&gt; language differences. Be very<br/>
&gt; clear, try to print a set of rules or guildelines. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Encourage people to be a part of the team...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just some small tips from the top of my head.<br/>
