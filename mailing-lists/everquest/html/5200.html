<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020961105">Depending on how fast you pick up on games and commands, etc. I <br/>
would think twice about starting the game with a bard.  Bards are <br/>
very good charecters, and can be a great asset to any group, but <br/>
they are also among the hardest chars to masters in the game as it <br/>
requires some decent skill to get down what is refered to <br/>
as &quot;twisting&quot; or playing multiple songs virtually at the same time <br/>
to help your group.  This takes a good amount of dexterity on your <br/>
keyboard and getting timing down just right while also moving and <br/>
doing normal stuff in EQ.<br/>
<br/>
My advice would be to start with a simpler char until you get down <br/>
the basic commands and movements.  No offense to anyone here, but <br/>
making a human warrior would be the best charecter to start with <br/>
when learning EQ.  It is a simple hack and slash char in the early <br/>
levels and gives you time to learn a bit.  Again, don&#39;t get me wrong <br/>
anyone, warriors are some of the hardest chars to play in the end <br/>
game because you have to worry about holding aggro and working with <br/>
all the other classes, but like I said, early on they are the <br/>
easiest to learn the game with.<br/>
