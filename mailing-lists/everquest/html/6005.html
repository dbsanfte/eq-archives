I hate to be the one to say this but you really should focus on your <br/>
battle skills. Trust me, at the lower levels that is a perfect time to <br/>
get the skills built up. I can understand wanting to go in and just beat <br/>
the heck out of everything and being uber and killing it all in one <br/>
shot. But ponder this, When you get to be up in levels (50&#39;s, 60&#39;s, and <br/>
70&#39;s) you are going to be taking on some majorly nasty monsters. If you <br/>
have just gained levels and have an uber weapon but never really worked <br/>
on your fighting skills and they are low, it&#39;s not going to help you or <br/>
your party out very much. Actually you will hurt your group more than <br/>
help them. Now being a Shammy you have some awesome spells at higher <br/>
levels. This is another thing I would suggest focusing on. If your at a <br/>
higher level and your fighting say a dragon and 60% of your casts fizz <br/>
then you may as well run or be able to hit! (See first part) otherwise <br/>
your gonna get killed or your group killed.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just my 2 cents.</div>
