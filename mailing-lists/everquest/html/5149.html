<div id="ygrps-yiv-946711528">It would depend on your view of the game.  I wouldn&#39;t hunt any of <br/>
the &quot;Light&quot; races just because of the roleplay aspect.  But that&#39;s <br/>
just me.  But I do remember seeing trains of Dorfs following a wolf.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have LoY?  Gunthak is in your level, plenty of mobs and a good <br/>
spawn rate.  From there you can move on to Dulak and work the yard, <br/>
then the boats.  And they drop gems!  I usually stagger out of there <br/>
with 200-300 plat in items and gems, after a group split!<br/>
<br/>
And Druids do have a role in LDoN.  I know you don&#39;t like to group, <br/>
but you&#39;re missing a lot.  Just be careful.  I&#39;ve gotten a few <br/>
questionable groups, with the usual dire results.<br/>

&gt; They drop ringmail, finesteel, up to 5pp and always a<br/>
