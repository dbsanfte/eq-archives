<div id="ygrps-yiv-556932925">Heh, might work if I didn&#39;t have 16 containers already and all of them are<br/>
full. I can&#39;t even use my sewing kit anymore bc it&#39;s full. I have to go find<br/>
a loom...<br/>

&gt; The bazaar is a really kewl place ... as long as there&#39;s not too many<br/>
&gt; people there :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Satchels cost a little under 2 plat and they hold 10 items.  You can buy<br/>
&gt; as many satchels as you like, but remember that folks can only see the<br/>
&gt; first 30 items you have for sale.  I&#39;ve got a bunch of satchels in the<br/>
&gt; bank for storage space.  You have to activate every item you want to<br/>
&gt; sell specifically, so you an use the satchels for anything.  They do<br/>
&gt; weigh a tonne (practically) so the bank is the only useful use for them<br/>
&gt; outside of the bazaar.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh a side note .. there is no weight penalty to movement rate in the<br/>
&gt; bazaar.  So you can safely haul around 3 (or more) of those 25 WT<br/>
&gt; satchels!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You get the satchels from the first merchant on the right in the big<br/>
&gt; building between the 2 banks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope that helps!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh .. and takeout is a wonderful thing :-)<br/>
