<div><font size="2">I&#39;ve been to one there, one in POG, one in Gfay, and one in 
TwiSea at the Elemental Island. Beautiful all, mind you, but OMG the lag in TS! 
Even on the best of days that zone is brutal to my poor puter, and with the 
whole guild there...</font></div>

<div><font size="2">The Gfay wedding had a reception in D&#39;vinn&#39;s tower in CB, 
incidentally, and we had a couple of deaths from drunken revellers falling out 
the window...this was pre Luclin for sure, and possibly pre 
Velious...</font></div>

  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">First off, I agree with you.&nbsp; Weddings held 
  in /shout or /ooc are a bad idea.&nbsp; Plus it defeats the entire reason why 
  channels were made.&nbsp; Anybody who wants to attend the wedding should just 
  join the wedding channel.&nbsp; Stop spamming up the public chat with crap 
  people dont necessarily care about except who&#39;s involved.&nbsp; Also, the 
  waterfall in Thurg is a bad choice of places.&nbsp; Granted it&#39;s beautiful to 
  look at, but its a high traffic area.&nbsp; They should expect people to 
  constantly be running through there.&nbsp; Especially for the reason you 
  stated, training mobs to zone to escape.&nbsp; Everyone does it, nobody&#39;s 
  innocent, it&#39;s part of the game.&nbsp; </font></div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">Personally, I wouldn&#39;t think too much of it 
  because there&#39;s nothing they can really do to you to get revenge.&nbsp; And if 
  they do want revenge then they have serious issues cause it&#39;s JUST A 
  GAME!&nbsp; </font></div>

    <div><br></div><tt>I was in GD today and was slicing through wurms with my 
    trusty <br>necromantic pet when 2 more wurms jumped me and i had to 
    run.&nbsp; The <br>closest zone was thurgadin and i had to pray to 
    cazic-thule that the <br>coldain didn&#39;t hate Iksar Necromancers.<br>I had 
    heard about a wedding being held earlier and i remembered that <br>it was at 
    the waterfall by thurgadin so i shouted train to thurgadin <br>and 
    remembered that i could FD so i did to make sure that i wasn&#39;t <br>killed 
    and that the wurms did&#39;t spoil the wedding.&nbsp; Luckily i was far 
    <br>enough from the wedding that the wurms ran back to their caves.<br>Heres 
    where it stars...&nbsp; First of all the wedding was in OOC.&nbsp; Bad 
    <br>choice.&nbsp; Second the peeps of the wedding kept telling people in the 
    <br>zone to &quot;Shutup&quot; or &quot;Stfu&quot;&nbsp; That was being rude.&nbsp; I proceeded 
    to tell <br>them that they should hold a wedding in SAY or a seperate 
    channel.&nbsp; <br>They all got pissed at me and everyone there kept vowing 
    revenge on <br>me.&nbsp; Made me a bit mad but i held it in so that i didn&#39;t 
    purposefully <br>give them a reason to get mad.&nbsp; They continued to nag 
    on and on so i <br>allerted my guild and they all thought the same 
    thing.&nbsp; A Wedding <br>should be held in private chat and if others talk 
    in the zone just <br>filter the ooc and shouts.&nbsp; The wedding was very 
    badly planned and <br>now i have a whole guild mad at me.&nbsp; ( the other 
    guild that was <br>having the marriage not mine)&nbsp; I was wondering what 
    you all think of <br>weddings in EQ and was i justified in shouting train 
    and telling them <br>that they should hold their wedding in private if they 
    don&#39;t want to <br>hear all the shouts and ooc&#39;s of a zone.&nbsp;
