<div id="ygrps-yiv-2028650769"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I think that craft items should be more beneficial and thus more<br/>
&gt; valuable. At present, there is little motivation to craft unless you<br/>
&gt; have a gaming predilection to do things like that. At present, by the<br/>
&gt; time you have leveled up enough to aquire materials, plus leveled your<br/>
&gt; crafting, the items you make aren&#39;t as good as what you can hunt or buy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Very good idea. I think with Lost Dungeons of Norrath they are doing<br/>
something so that you can add enhancements to your items and that&#39;s the<br/>
closest I can see to what you&#39;re aiming at. I really do wish that more of<br/>
the stuff you make was useful. I think it&#39;s horrendous that you have to<br/>
spend so much money on acrylia and superb rockhopper hides to make something<br/>
that sells for maybe 3pp to other players. I also wish they would do<br/>
something so that they have more tailoring supplies available from<br/>
merchants. Heh, I have my tailoring at 167-- cost me over 900pp to get it<br/>
from 158 to 167... And I couldn&#39;t even sell the stuff back to the merchant<br/>
for even 1/3 of the cost.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; A real in-game economy would add to the fun. Especially if it would be<br/>
&gt; good even for casual gamers. I can&#39;t always find the time to play<br/>
&gt; enough to level and aquire stuff in ways which seem economical. There<br/>
&gt; should be provision for a good gaming experience even for very casual<br/>
&gt; gamers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good point. :-)<br/>
