<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541276875">Heh. Since both of you said it, I&#39;m more likely to remember it when I&#39;m<br/>
helping my mom do her shammy&#39;s epic.<br/>
Right now I need to start on my own epic. People would love me if I had a<br/>
click stick. And it would save so much mana. I swear I would rez anyone who<br/>
helped me for free forever. Oh wait, I rez most people for free anyways. I<br/>
never ask for donations for it. I just occassionaly accept donations. If the<br/>
person is a friend I refuse donation. And if it was a really easy rez or I<br/>
found the body or just offered to go do the rez without being asked I refuse<br/>
donation. Which would explain why I have no money. lol. I know, I&#39;m not the<br/>
most aggressive or best player, but I enjoy the way I play.<br/>
luv,<br/>
