<div id="ygrps-yiv-672138663">Hi ...<br/>
<br/>
  Sorry for the short post before. <br/>
<br/>
  Find out what server your friends use and be sure<br/>
 to start there. For your first character please do<br/>
 something simple. Once you know the game and your <br/>
 way around the game then experiement a bite.<br/>
<br/>
  Warriors, cleric and druids are good for you to<br/>
 learn the system with. Any of the magic users can<br/>
 be great if you have friends to be online with. <br/>
 It can be alot harder if you are alone or soloing.<br/>
 The &#39;best race&#39; depends on what you are playing.<br/>
 Humans make good warriors and not bad at others.<br/>
 several races get higher intellegence which is <br/>
 great for magic users. Actually it helps any class<br/>
 for skill advancement.<br/>
<br/>
  Make friends annd conteacts .. everywhere you go.<br/>
 The idea is to always having friends to run with <br/>
 and share the adventure with. Meeting people starts<br/>
 with talking and helping others. Be sure to ask if<br/>
 someone needs help before you jump in. Much as you<br/>
 want to help someone who looks like they need it be<br/>
 sure not to take someone elses kill. You will see<br/>
 people standing around someone who looks in real<br/>
 trouble .. doing nothing. Thats because they are <br/>
 waiting for the person to accept their help. Its <br/>
 also a good idea to be sure you can help before <br/>
 you jump in. jumping into a fight WAY over your<br/>
 level only gets one more person killed ..YOU.<br/>
<br/>
   more later ...             Mauraze <br/>
