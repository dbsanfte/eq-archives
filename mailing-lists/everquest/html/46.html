<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504782120"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Do you all agree with the red pvp stuff? i dont, when i was just <br/>
 </span></blockquote>starting i gave the book to the priest *before i knew how to read it <br/>
because wheni played the demo i couldn&#39;t figure it out either* and am <br/>
red, and as of last night i found out another thing that will suck in <br/>
the future, and i dont want to start another character because im <br/>
already a level 9 necromancer, noone can cure diseases or heal me <br/>
unless they are red too... this seems like overkill to me and verant <br/>
needs to change some things.<br/>
<br/>
I disagree.  This makes perfect sense, to help avoid people <br/>
exploiting *pointed stare* the game...<br/>
<br/>
If a blue could heal a red, then all the dewdz and exploiters would <br/>
just make a red ogre warrior, and get a friend to make a blue <br/>
cleric...The cleric heals the ogre, the ogre bashes a different red, <br/>
the other red can&#39;t do jack to stop the healer.<br/>
