<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368528208">I build my own machines and run EQ very well.  The price is way less than<br/>
$1700 and they are fully upgradeable :)  I recently built one for my husband<br/>
so that we could play together.  Case, 19&quot; monitor, keyboard, optical mouse,<br/>
motherboard w/ AMD 1.3 processor, Audigy MP3 sound card, GEforce 3 video<br/>
card, 512 megs of ram, 60 gig hard drive, CD/RW drive and speakers.....<br/>
around $1000.  There are also advantages to being able to load only the<br/>
software you want on a blank hard drive.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really not hard to build your own :)<br/>
