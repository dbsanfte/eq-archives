<div id="ygrps-yiv-444069454">The previously posted advice covers most of what you asked. As a <br/>
casual gamer and rpg fan, you will do very well as a halfling druid. <br/>
The halfling can go most places with little concern for faction (how <br/>
you get along with other races.) The druid can port around, so you <br/>
don&#39;t have to depend on others for travel. You can fight well enough <br/>
get by, and have lots of good spells. I think halfling druid is a <br/>
great first character.<br/>
<br/>
There are many good help sites on the net. Research is part of a good <br/>
game, and there is a great deal to learn. <br/>
<br/>
The druid is very good for groups, as they can heal (though not so <br/>
well as a cleric) and can help the group with track and with rooting <br/>
or snaring prey.<br/>
<br/>
I recommend building a map library from sites like EQATLAS. It helps <br/>
a lot to know a bit about a zone before going there. Unless breaching <br/>
the unknown is a thrill for you. I do that a bit, but having to spend <br/>
hours working out how to get to your corpse in a place you should not <br/>
yet have been is not particularly thrilling. Well, maybe the first <br/>
time, but not something to do often.<br/>
<br/>
Unless you plan to upgrade right away, just trilogy should be fine <br/>
for quite some time. For Luclin you need the biggest and fastest <br/>
thing you can afford to buy or build. Not worth waiting for. Get <br/>
trilogy and get gaming.<br/>

&gt; Hi all, <br/>
&gt; Having been a fan of computer RPG&#39;s for years I am considering <br/>
trying <br/>
&gt; EQ. Having never played an online rpg before I have a few <br/>
questions ?<br/>
&gt; (Forgive my lack of knowledge and feel free to laugh at my <br/>
questions)<br/>
&gt; 1. Being used to playing solo games I could pretty much play at my <br/>
&gt; own pace. How does EQ work? I know you join other online players <br/>
but <br/>
&gt; seeing as I am a casual gamer i only spend  10-15 hours a week <br/>
gaming <br/>
&gt; is this enough for EQ ? I am assuming that play occurs with whoever <br/>
&gt; is online at the time and am I not tied into a specific group/times.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2. Is it easy to find other adventurers to join with? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3. I see different EQ&#39;s (Original, Ruins of Kharnak, etc) does it <br/>
&gt; matter which one I start with or are the later addons geared for <br/>
&gt; higher level characters.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 4 Finally system requirements. I have seen the system requirements <br/>
&gt; but what is recommended ?. I have a P3 866, 128sdram, 32mb ddr <br/>
nvidia <br/>
&gt; geforce2 gts card, 56k modem is that suffiecient or should I wait <br/>
&gt; till I upgrade.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for any feedback </span></blockquote></div>
