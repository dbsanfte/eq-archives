<div><font face="Arial" size="2">You are entitled to your opinion, and obviously 
there&#39;s no point in arguing with you about it.&nbsp; Some people are thick 
headed and enjoy invincible ignorance.&nbsp; EQ2 was in development for a LONG 
time.&nbsp; And even the OPEN beta that most of us were in on was in the very 
last 3 months of the testing.&nbsp; It was in beta for much longer before 
that.&nbsp; A lot of the things you mentioned were in the beta test when I tried 
it - the instanced zones, the quest system, the class system, the spells.&nbsp; 
None of that stuff came along a week before it went live as you say.&nbsp; That 
stuff was around and in development even before I started playing the 
beta.&nbsp; So if you liked EQ before the Luclin expansion, I suggest you 
uninstall all the expansion packs and just keep Kunark and Velious.&nbsp; Go 
back to the old way and see how much you&#39;re missing out on.&nbsp; Or hey, even 
better idea, develop your own damn game the way you want it and stop wasting 
your time with EQ.&nbsp; No, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re here because you enjoy hearing 
other people&#39;s opinions of the game; I think you are here to feed trolls.&nbsp;

  can&#39;t please all the people even some of the <br>&gt; time.&nbsp; If you&#39;re so 
  hell bent against the game, then why are you even on <br>&gt; this 
  list???<br><br>Just never left.&nbsp; It&#39;s not like there is a ton a mail that 
  clogs my inbox.<br><br>&gt; I don&#39;t believe your argument that EQ2 was rushed 
  either. <br><br>Whether you want to believe it or not, it was 
  rushed.&nbsp;&nbsp; WoW beta was <br>twice as long as the EQ2 beta and EQ came 
  out 2 weeks earlier.<br><br>&gt; Considering<br>&gt; there was word of EQ2 in 
  development long before there was ever a <br>&gt; release date set, 
  considering the game was in closed beta for months <br>&gt; before we ever got 
  a peek at it, considering it was in open beta for <br>&gt; several months 
  BEFORE it went live, AND considering the release date was <br>&gt; even pushed 
  back so tha tit came out later than it was supposed to, I <br>&gt; seriously 
  have a hard time believing it ws a rush job.<br><br>They didn&#39;t even put in 
  class spells until a week before release.&nbsp; How <br>on earth do you 
  balance and test the classes with only a week of <br>testing, after the game 
  has already gone Gold?&nbsp; They basically reworked <br>the entire class 
  system a week before the game went live without any <br>player testing.&nbsp; 
  That doesn&#39;t sound rushed to you?<br><br>Instancing zones was rushed because 
  they suddenly realized that they <br>couldn&#39;t handle player traffic in their 
  zones.<br><br>The quest system was added later in development, almost as an 
  <br>afterthought because, I guess, WoW had one that people were fawning over 
  <br>so SoE needed one.<br><br>They still haven&#39;t figured out how to make nice 
  graphics that don&#39;t need <br>a supercomputer to run.&nbsp; Guild Wars has 
  great graphics (just as good, if <br>not better than EQ2), and well made 
  player models that don&#39;t take high <br>end video cards to run well.&nbsp; And 
  GW is still in Beta.<br><br>They continue to run with the model that slow 
  leveling equals a challenge.<br><br>&gt; And apparently you don&#39;t know 
  anything about business.&nbsp; It would seem to <br>&gt; me that to be 
  competitive in the market place you have to take into <br>&gt; account things 
  like the release of other games and holidays and so on.&nbsp; <br>&gt; Let&#39;s 
  face it, Sony Online Entertainment is a profiteering company.&nbsp; <br>&gt; 
  they want to make money just like the rest of us.&nbsp; If they have to cut a 
  <br>&gt; few edges to get the product out in manner to be more competitive 
  with <br>&gt; other companies, then that&#39;s what they have to do.&nbsp; Since 
  the game is an <br>&gt; ongoing development, they can always add the stuff 
  after the fact. <br><br>No, they did it because they were worried that no one 
  would buy their <br>product after playing WoW.<br><br>&gt; As far as I&#39;m 
  concerned they did a damn good job with EQ2 and I think <br>&gt; they will 
  continue to do a damn good job with it.&nbsp; EQ2 had far more <br>&gt; 
  content to it than Lineage II did when L2 was released. <br><br>Lineage 2 was 
  a piece of garbage.&nbsp; If that is your benchmark, then there <br>isn&#39;t a 
  MMORPG around that doesn&#39;t get high marks.&nbsp; Hell, the Knight <br>Online 
  beta was better than Lineage 2 retail and KO was pretty crappy.<br><br>&gt; 
  Besides, SOE is only adding the stuff that people are asking for anyway, 
  <br>&gt; so if we don&#39;t like it, we can&#39;t complain cause we&#39;re the ones who 
  asked <br>&gt; for it. <br><br>Maybe you want some of this stuff, but there 
  are a lot more people out <br>there playing games that don&#39;t want pulls handed 
  to them or knowing that <br>a mob is underconned or overconned.&nbsp; Or don&#39;t 
  want flagging for <br>mid-level content.&nbsp; Or don&#39;t want to have to buy a 
  $300 video card to <br>have decent graphics.<br><br>&gt; If you really don&#39;t 
  enjoy the game, then why are you here?&nbsp; <br><br>Because I&#39;m interested in 
  hearing people&#39;s opinions about games.&nbsp; I&#39;m <br>sorry if you can&#39;t accept 
  the fact that some/many people don&#39;t have <br>ultra glowing reviews of 
  EQ2.<br><br>&gt; This list is <br>&gt; supposed to be for people that like 
  EverQuest and want to see it grow, <br>&gt; not for people who are going to 
  argue every single little nitpicky thing <br>&gt; wrong with the game or SOE. 
  <br><br>If you think the problems that people have with the game are 
  &quot;nitpicky&quot;, <br>you are mistaken.<br><br>EQ was a great game, until probably 
  Luclin (which was, I believe, the <br>first &quot;SoE expansion&quot;).&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
  &quot;moon&quot; was always buggy and most of the <br>features never really worked 
  well.&nbsp; Was the Hollowshade Moor &quot;war&quot; ever <br>fixed to work 
  correctly?&nbsp; The high end Luclin game was poorly <br>implemented into a 
  massive timesink.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From there it just went downhill <br>(LDON 
  was good for casual players for a time, but it was far too little <br>and too 
  late to save most server populations and guilds after PoP came <br>out.)&nbsp; 
  It doesn&#39;t seem to be that SoE has learned much from their <br>previous 
  titles.<br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel="nofollow"
