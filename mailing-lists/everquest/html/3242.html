such a nice rig as you have described.<br/>

&gt; I absolutely hate game death and try to avoid it whenever possible. <br/>
I let<br/>
&gt; people know right off that if I think I am going to get killed I <br/>
will flee.<br/>
&gt; A dead cleric isn&#39;t very helpful. Especially since I only have a <br/>
21.6k<br/>
&gt; connection and we&#39;re talking about waiting 5 or more minutes to <br/>
reload from<br/>
&gt; death. When my mother is playing also, my zoning like that can <br/>
cause her to<br/>
&gt; lag very badly. If she has to zone or gets killed then one or both <br/>
of us get<br/>
&gt; booted offline. And I lose alot of xp. So that isn&#39;t fun.<br/>

&gt; &gt; My locution in the previous message expressed my feelings toward <br/>
game<br/>
&gt; &gt; death, and raised my curiosity. What are other player&#39;s attitudes<br/>
&gt; &gt; toward game death?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I play solo most of the time, and haven&#39;t had a guild to depend on<br/>
&gt; &gt; since Wave of Change faded away. So, death, especially death in<br/>
&gt; &gt; awkward circumstances, is more serious to my character. I can&#39;t <br/>
just<br/>
&gt; &gt; call on my guild reserector to pull my butt out of the grave, nor <br/>
do<br/>
&gt; &gt; have high level guildies to drag my corpse out from under some big<br/>
&gt; &gt; nasty.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My son-in-law plays with abandon. He leaves corpses all over the<br/>
&gt; &gt; place, joins groups readily, and seems to have great fun doing all<br/>
&gt; &gt; that.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My son, on the other hand, is in a powerful guild on our server. <br/>
He<br/>
&gt; &gt; is less cautious than me, but still uses sound strategy and <br/>
tactics<br/>
&gt; &gt; and utilized his guild to advance on his goals. His guild is the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Guardian Alliance on Zeb.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I figure I will have to do the guild and group thing soon, but <br/>
enjoy<br/>
&gt; &gt; my independence enough that I want to do so as late in my career <br/>
as<br/>
&gt; &gt; possible.<br/>
