<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526840349">I&#39;m going to try them on monday.  <br/>
BTW I did try using a 16&quot; housefan directed into the open case- no <br/>
change in symptoms.<br/>
I just know that the cause is going to be the same as most other <br/>
probs so far: drivers. I&#39;ve tried to update them, nvidea is updated<br/>
(signed and everything!!) but the 4in1 and av97 8233 onboard sound <br/>
drivers don&#39;t want to load right.  <br/>
Thanks for the replys!!<br/>
