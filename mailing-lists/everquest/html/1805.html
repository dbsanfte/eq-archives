<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Welcome to EQ. =) </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Firstly, way to go on choosing a cleric! hehe I&#39;m 
biased as I play a level 50 High Elf Cleric on Xegony. Clerics are a lot of fun 
imo. As a new cleric I agree with some of the statements made below. Being BRAND 
new, just solo around your starting point and loot everything. Sell that stuff 
and save all the money. You will need it for spells obviously and you&#39;ll also 
want to pick up some better armor than the tunic your guild gives you. I wore 
leather armor for a very long time until I had saved enough to buy something 
else. </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">When you do get higher&nbsp;in level and can start 
buying some better items, work on buying stuff that is +wis. This will help a 
lot. Farther down the road at much higher levels you will want to work on making 
your AC and saves better, but you shouldn&#39;t have to worry about that too much 
for quite some time.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Everyone has different opinions on how to play, but 
the important thing is to have fun. Find some people on your server that play in 
your area. Usually you&#39;ll start seeing familiar faces. </font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>Rico,<br><br>I have a 38 dwarf cleric on The 
  Nameless.&nbsp; A few tips:<br><br>1) Max wisdom - not all subscribe to this, 
  but you have an inate strength already as a dwarf.&nbsp; I put my other points 
  to bring up either dex or agility, whichever lower<br>2) Find a regular 
  partner to help you to level at the low levels - you can solo first few 
  levels, but I found grouping with one other PC helped<br>3) As a cleric, go to 
  Kurn&#39;s tower around level ten - lots of undead to nuke on when alone and 
  clerics were always welcome in groups there<br><br>Use the other yahoogroups 
  specifically for clerics for more help and advice: EQ_Cleric@yahoogroups.com 
  and EQ-Clerics@yahoogroups.com - Some of the folks there are quite, er, vocal 
  and opinionated, hehe.&nbsp; But we all know that Dwarves make the best 
  clerics - you picked the right race.<br><br>Use Caster&#39;s Realm and Rayne&#39;s 
  cleric site for cleric reference information.&nbsp; Also Allakhazam&#39;s for a 
  lot of general information.<br><br><a rel="nofollow"
