&gt;With a vote count of 19 here are the results of the survey concerning &gt;no <br/>
&gt;drop items.. The survey will close on Sunday the 15th so if you &gt;havent <br/>
&gt;voted hurry up and do it...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hmm, level caps on items, that&#39;s better.. 11 57.89 %<br/>
&gt;NO DROP is the way to go! 3 15.79 %<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t want either, twinking is fun! 1 5.26 %<br/>
&gt;Why not both at once? 4 21.05 %<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m no twink (lord knows I&#39;ve tried to become one, but other twinks seem to <br/>
want an arm and a leg for anything worth having; so I&#39;ve stayed on the <br/>
straight and narrow). I&#39;d hate like hell to see a level cap put on certain <br/>
items, and here&#39;s why. I saved every single copper I could, and worked my <br/>
smithing skills up just high enough to be able to make a few banded items <br/>
with a decent success rate. After saving for weeks, lagging behind in <br/>
levels, spending countless hours at the forge, and seeing a lot of good <br/>
friends lose interest in EQ, I managed to save up enough to get a steel <br/>
chestplate. If they impose a level cap on items, then I just may well lose <br/>
the ability to wear what took about 2.5 to 3 weeks to save for, and that was <br/>
after the month of saving enough cash to work up my smithing skill in the <br/>
first place. I don&#39;t think that it would be fair to lose the ability to <br/>
wear/wield it after all that. However, on the same note, I don&#39;t think that <br/>
1st level characters should be wearing mithril and steel either. So where is <br/>
the line drawn, where it&#39;s fair for those of us who don&#39;t/didn&#39;t twink, but <br/>
manage through legitimate means to get something of great worth and those <br/>
who twink? It&#39;s a fine line. And by the way - I&#39;m 14th level.</div>
