<div id="ygrps-yiv-320067497"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">I don&#39;t have any male characters. &nbsp;I don&#39;t know why exactly. &nbsp;I have noticed 
<br>that my wood elf rogue has been given ALOT of stuff. &nbsp;I don&#39;t ask, these 
<br>people just come up and give it to me. &nbsp;The other day my rogue was the group 
<br>leader at Orc 1 in EC. &nbsp;Maybe I should have used a male character because I 
<br>can&#39;t tell you how many times I said please move back, the whole camp will 
<br>aggro on us when they spawn if we are too close, please move back, add, add, 
<br>add, ok let&#39;s move back, we&#39;re pulling the whole camp, hey move back, please 
<br>move back. &nbsp;Over and over and over. &nbsp;They never did listen. &nbsp;There was 2 who 
<br>were especially bad about it. &nbsp;After my guildmate had dinged, I left the 
<br>camp. &nbsp;I was just tired of trying to explain that the closer we stood, that 
<br>every spawn would aggro on us no matter if we were ready for them or not. &nbsp;
<br>And the 2 just didn&#39;t seem to have that figured out. &nbsp;I wonder if they would 
<br>have listened to me if I was something other than a cute female wood elf. &nbsp;LOL

<br>Although I find that while people tend to give more stuff to females, people
<br>listen better to males. ie. as group leader with my female alt I set loot
<br>order and organize strategy. People tend not to obey loot order nor to they
<br>listen to strategy. But even when not as group leader playing a male, people
<br>will listen to my suggestion of loot order as well as strategy. Odd isn&#39;t
<br>it?
