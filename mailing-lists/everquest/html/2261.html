&gt; travesty.. :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; i don&#39;t mind giving sows.. i often sit at home by<br/>
&gt; the PoD lift and buff.. but a &quot;thank you, m&#39;Lady&quot; is<br/>
&gt; always welcome.. :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;nods&gt; I try to do the same when I have a little<br/>
downtime to kill. I often go to GFay to buy stacks of<br/>
Spiderling Silks, usually park myself at newbie lift<br/>
and give SoW&#39;s and whatnot. Same deal in EC tunnel.<br/>
What&#39;s really starting to bug me is the number of<br/>
Druids (and other classes for that matter) being<br/>
downright stingy with things like SoW. I mean,<br/>
nobody&#39;s obligated to give them out, but at least for<br/>
me access to SoW was one of the primary reasons for<br/>
playing a Druid, I don&#39;t mind sharing it cause I know<br/>
how good it feels to be on the recieving end of one.<br/>
(playing my rogue is maddening until some kind soul<br/>
decides to SoW me, gods I need JBoots :) When<br/>
something as simple as a laughably tiny amount of mana<br/>
that will be recovered in two seconds of medding can<br/>
enhance another person&#39;s gaming experience that much,<br/>
I see it as a bargain. Plus, more often than not, for<br/>
every ten or so SoW&#39;s I give out, I get a Clarity in<br/>
exchange, or someone cuts me a deal on an item, or<br/>
some other nicety. (had one guy give me a HQ Bear Pelt<br/>
last night just because I SoWed him :) In a way I also<br/>
view it as my contribution to the community as a<br/>
whole. People have been very generous and helpful so<br/>
far, it&#39;s the least I can do to give back a little. :)<br/>
