<div id="ygrps-yiv-102434290">Ok. I&#39;ve been playing Everquest on line for one night and part of a <br/>
day now. I fell off of the bridge once. I got killed by a young rock <br/>
hopper. I&#39;m having fun but I&#39;m still looking for Registrar Bindarah. <br/>
Will somebody please give me more detailed directions that the npcs <br/>
in the game are providing? The velvet on my poor feet is wearing <br/>
out. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m running a female tiger-like Shaman. I&#39;ve also noticed that some <br/>
of the characters seem to be walking through walls. That&#39;s <br/>
interesting but it&#39;s very puzzling. G.<br/>
