<b>Subject:</b> Question for you druids out there ... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1920276778">I&#39;m sure this thread has been beaten to death here but<br/>
I&#39;m going to ask it anyway cuz I&#39;m new to the list :)<br/>
<br/>
I have a 47 druid on Cazic-Thule and, like many of<br/>
you, I get *very* tired of being begged for SoW,<br/>
ports, HP buffs, etc. Also like many of you, I SoW,<br/>
buff, and port newbies and friendly people for free<br/>
whenever I can. I hand out nice weapons and decent<br/>
armor to newbies like they&#39;re candy, and I genuinely<br/>
enjoy helping people (That&#39;s a big reason I chose a<br/>
druid as my main).<br/>
<br/>
However, like almost all druids, I have times when<br/>
newbies and/or experienced players come up to me and<br/>
ask for things without saying please or when I&#39;m very<br/>
busy (like for instance the cleric just left the<br/>
group, we haven&#39;t found another healer, my heals blow,<br/>
but I am the primary healer until another is located).<br/>
I have a standard hotkey set up for those who ask for<br/>
SoW or whatever rudely (the &quot;Can I get a SoW&quot; irks me<br/>
no end): <br/>
<br/>
Beggar: Can I get a SoW?<br/>
Nymue: I&#39;m sorry, I do not comply with rude requests.<br/>
Nymue: Have a nice day!<br/>
<br/>
This does not work. They hang around begging, saying<br/>
please, and so on and so forth. One guy told me today,<br/>
&quot;Damn druids ruin the game.&quot; Lovely.<br/>
<br/>
So my poll today is to collect people&#39;s favorite ways<br/>
of denying requests when they don&#39;t want to/don&#39;t have<br/>
the time/are in a group/don&#39;t feel like complying. If<br/>
anyone has an amusing, polite, or snotty reply to<br/>
share with me I&#39;d love to hear it - I&#39;m going to set<br/>
my favorites up as hotkeys, so please don&#39;t share it<br/>
unless you don&#39;t mind me copying it :)<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks in advance for everyone&#39;s assistance,<br/>
