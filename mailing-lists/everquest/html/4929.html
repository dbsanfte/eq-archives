<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845345026"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I have been playing EQ for about 2 years and enjoying every min. of<br/>
&gt; it. I play for only about 1 to 2 hours a day (maybe) so I really get<br/>
&gt; in to my time in the game. This sunday something new happened to me.<br/>
&gt; I have a 24th level Bar. shaman and have been grouping in Pav.<br/>
&gt; Caverns to work up in levels. I logged on and ooc&#39;ed asking to group.<br/>
&gt; I got not responce. I went to camp 1 aqnd found a good mixed group<br/>
&gt; working it very well (8 people mixed classes teaming very nicely) so<br/>
&gt; I went to camp 2, There were 5 people 3 casters (2 mages and a necro)<br/>
&gt; a ranger and a fighter) all around 19 to 20., all at 100% health. I<br/>
&gt; asked if they wanted a healer/buffer and got &quot;Shouted down&quot; &quot;This<br/>
&gt; Camp is TAKEN GO AWAY&quot;!!!....ok so I truned and started back. I got<br/>
&gt; jumped by 3 of the bandits. I Camp was not doing anything so I pulled<br/>
&gt; the mobs back in to the camp and ooced here is your mobs take them I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want to steal your kills(all the time I am getting pounded) ..<br/>
&gt; no one said anything so I ran .. about 1/2 way back I get ooc&#39;ed &quot;WTF<br/>
&gt; Frezz wait...&quot; as I as all ready near the cave to SH and the zone I<br/>
&gt; just left... the &quot;group&quot; because of 5 mobs brok camp and ran (as they<br/>
&gt; ran they pulled 2 more) and &quot;telled&quot; me to death about how they were<br/>
&gt; going to cause me problems every time they see me and ect...<br/>
&gt; A. did I do wrong by trying to &quot;not steal&quot; the camp&#39;s mobs<br/>
&gt; b. what do I do about the &quot;problems&quot; I might have later by thes<br/>
&gt; people?<br/>
&gt;  I like doing the right thing and playing with people not causeing<br/>
&gt; problems for others...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Some people just aren&#39;t friendly. Considering they yelled at you to get out<br/>
of &quot;their&quot; camp when you were LFG then they sound like the uptight type<br/>
anyways. They&#39;ll probably just not invite you to group and such. Since you<br/>
were trying to bring them mobs so as not to steal you meant well,<br/>
unfortunately they probably thought you were training them on purpose to get<br/>
them killed or something bc they told you to go away. The official rule is<br/>
that if something attacks you, you have the kill because it aggrod you<br/>
first. If you couldn&#39;t kill them by yourself best thing to do is to pull<br/>
them away from other players and zone, but shout a train warning. If they<br/>
complain that you are &quot;stealing&quot; their mobs, just tell them you got aggro<br/>
and needed to defend yourself. Or you could ask them to take a mob or two<br/>
off of you bc you got aggro and don&#39;t want to steal, but not pull into their<br/>
camp. It&#39;s a tough call. The people might call you names and junk but from<br/>
my experience, unless you did something really nasty to them or did<br/>
something mean repeatedly they are likely to forget about it.<br/>
I had people cussing at me one day when I was calling trains that I saw<br/>
going by (bc the people pulling them weren&#39;t calling them). Someone started<br/>
calling me names and telling me to stop pulling trains and I had to explain<br/>
that I was not pulling the trains, I was just warning people when I saw<br/>
them. And I had someone accuse me of pulling trains when I was running from<br/>
something that had been trained onto me. If the people are nice enough to<br/>
listen when you explain then that&#39;s cool. If they won&#39;t listen and just get<br/>
nasty then you don&#39;t want to be grouping with them anyways.<br/>
It&#39;s just a game and people get too uptight about it sometimes.<br/>
