<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-494179251">Having played them both, I think I can give you a good understanding from my <br/>
perspective.  Both of them has good things and bad things.  <br/>
<br/>
UO has a housing system, transportation system, and economic system that <br/>
surpasses EQ.  <br/>
<br/>
In EQ, to sell items, you have really only two choices.  1) is to sell <br/>
directly to a NPC 2) Using an auction command to sell off your wares to those <br/>
PC&#39;s that are in the zone you are in.  You can&#39;t sell your items while <br/>
offline.<br/>
<br/>
In EQ, you can&#39;t purchase or create any sort of house, building, or castle.  <br/>
You basically camp where ever you deem that is safe.  Your only facility to <br/>
store items in, is the bank.  The banks are better organized, in EQ, as they <br/>
have fixed slots to put things in, and to my knowledge there is no weight <br/>
limit.<br/>
<br/>
Transportation in EQ is quite limited.  There are a few boats that will take <br/>
you to and from a specific destination.  You can&#39;t purchase your own boat.  <br/>
You can borrow a very small ship in certain zones that you can maneuver, but <br/>
you can&#39;t move it out of the fixed zone that they are found in.  Horses, <br/>
etc., are also not available for riding.  The only true options that you have <br/>
is running (this includes levitation), taking the boat, or teleporting.  <br/>
There are spells and equipment that you can use that will make you faster <br/>
(much like a horse.)<br/>
<br/>
The graphics are far superior in EQ.  However, this does create long loading <br/>
times when you travel between zones.  There is FAR more equipment in EQ.  <br/>
This allows for a lot of versatility.  The mood music in EQ and sound itself <br/>
in general, sounds far more sophisticated and professional.  There are quite <br/>
a few individual quests that exist with EQ.  There are so many NPC&#39;s that you <br/>
can talk to, who can send you on various quests.  Sometimes these quests will <br/>
send you from one end of EQ to the other end.  <br/>
<br/>
I think in UO you have a better understanding of the world that you exist in. <br/>
 Few people understand what&#39;s really happening in EQ.  The &quot;events&quot; that <br/>
occur, are very popular, but are so infrequent.  I have played for 5 months, <br/>
and have seen only 3 events (perhaps my timing is just poor.)<br/>
<br/>
Ugh, let me try to summarize.  There is no doubt, that I love EQ.  EQ scares <br/>
me, makes me laugh, makes me feel proud, and gives me a warm fuzzy feeling <br/>
sometimes.  I have a lot of close friends in EQ that have made EQ even more <br/>
enjoyable.  I think the players on EQ are more mature.  I like the fact that <br/>
I don&#39;t have to worry about some 14 year old that could blast the heck out of <br/>
me, just because he felt like it.  I love both games, each gives me something <br/>
that I really like.  In fact, sometimes I wish UO and EQ designers would <br/>
merge to create a game that had both of the games qualities.  <br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, give EQ a whirl, but keep your UO account open as well.  See <br/>
which one you like the best and then either keep them both open, or close one <br/>
down.  They are both really good games.<br/>
<br/>
Please remember that these are just my opinions.  Corrections requested, <br/>
flames ignored. =)<br/>
