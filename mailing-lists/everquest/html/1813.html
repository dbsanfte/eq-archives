<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610685527">I have a 40 druid and have a lot of friends that have alts (in other words I <br/>
power lvl ppl a lot lol) .....my normal way to go is to take then to a level <br/>
appropriate area (since I&#39;m high enough, I generally take then to oasis - i <br/>
can keep them alive there) then sow skin str and ds them....then heal when <br/>
needed....for a change I won&#39;t ds them, rather I let them hit the monster <br/>
down to half hps then take it out myself (don&#39;t ds and then kill it yourself <br/>
- they won&#39;t get exp)<br/>
<br/>
But since oasis is also still dangerous to you, I&#39;d stay in ec....anything <br/>
that is blue to you, have him whack at and that should work.<br/>
<br/>
As for armor....a suit of fs on Drinal costs about 1500pp, bronze is much <br/>
less, so that might work better....You might hang around nfp and auc for <br/>
good warrior armor for the money you have, some ppl just want to get rid of <br/>
stuff and sell for super cheap or are quitting the game and getting rid of <br/>
everything on them....<br/>
<br/>
I have a 23 warrior, and my druid recently was widowed (he quit the game) <br/>
and I had 2 really nice wedding rings....so I sold them and hung around nfp <br/>
for a while, and managed to get a full suit of crafted (warrior specific <br/>
quest armor) minus the helm for 1200 - quite a lot less then the going price <br/>
on my server....<br/>
<br/>
sorry off the subject there had to brag :)<br/>
<br/>
And as for a weapon, my warrior has icetooth claws (11/29) and a giant <br/>
militia longsword (11/39) but she started out with kodiak claws (I think <br/>
7/30) and a langseax (I think 6/28) The giant militia longsword is about <br/>
80pp on my server, but the icetooths are a couple hundred *I think* they <br/>
were a gift.....<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps somewhat :)<br/>
