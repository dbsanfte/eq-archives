&gt; I play solo most of the time, and haven&#39;t had a guild to depend on <br/>
&gt; since Wave of Change faded away. So, death, especially death in <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; My son-in-law plays with abandon. He leaves corpses all over the <br/>
&gt; place, joins groups readily, and seems to have great fun doing all <br/>
&gt; that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My son, on the other hand, is in a powerful guild on our server. He <br/>
&gt; is less cautious than me, but still uses sound strategy and tactics <br/>
&gt; and utilized his guild to advance on his goals. His guild is the <br/>
&gt; Guardian Alliance on Zeb.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I figure I will have to do the guild and group thing soon, but <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Death is something I try to avoid.  I made Locate and Corpse hotkeys <br/>
early on for corpse runs.  But I hate the XP loss.  I died 3 times <br/>
last week, which added another 2 days before I reached 38.  I have no <br/>
guild or high level friends to depend either, so I go where I know I <br/>
can get back to.  But I do have a Druid cousin that jumps me around <br/>
when he&#39;s on.  So spend a few minutes scouting before you jump in!  <br/>
Learn from your mistakes!<br/>
<br/>
Once you get to Kunark your solo career is limited.  There are just <br/>
too many mob&#39;s and too big a chance of a bad pull.  I have seen <br/>
Druids quadkiting in the OT and I saw one go down on an overpull.  It <br/>
helps to group until you get a feel for the area.  And watch out for <br/>
the Goons in OT!<br/>
