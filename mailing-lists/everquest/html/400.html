<div id="ygrps-yiv-1350995107">Hi<br/>
<br/>
I found it quite easy starting off as a dark elf necromancer, even though <br/>
most people seem to think they are impossible to start with.  The spells to <br/>
get to start with is locate corpse (saves you hours when you die, I found <br/>
Nektulos forest to be very confusing to start with).  Most people would say <br/>
get the 1st level skeleton spell, however I never bothered with it.  level <br/>
1 to 4 is easy enough, you will die a few times, but not that often - the <br/>
biggest problem is the beetles who may gang up on you.<br/>
<br/>
Sense the dead is also useful - save every bone chip you pick up, don&#39;t <br/>
sell them - you need them for your skeleton at level 4!  Disease cloud is <br/>
useful - doesn&#39;t seem to damage your target much, but they don&#39;t seem to <br/>
heal either - and it improves conjuration which is good for your skeletal <br/>
pets.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest problem with nektulos is that there aren&#39;t any shops there - <br/>
the first thing you should buy is a backpack.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s it really - if you need any help and I&#39;m online feel free to ask me <br/>
any questions, I&#39;d be pleased to help.  I&#39;m bound in Qeynos at the moment, <br/>
but I can give advice easily enough.  When you reach level 8 or so and you <br/>
start adventuring into the commons, don&#39;t go near any human npc&#39;s - they&#39;ll <br/>
attack you on sight.  That&#39;s the biggest disadvantage to being a dark elf - <br/>
nobody likes you.<br/>
<br/>
If anybody in Qeynos needs help finding any corpses, please ask me - I&#39;ll <br/>
be glad to help, and I only ask for some food and water as payment :-) <br/>
 They really should start selling food and water in the necromancers guild!<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>
<br/>

I just rolled up a dark elf necromancer.  Can anyone give me some tips on <br/>
how to build up, and what spells to buy?  I am new to spellcasters, i have <br/>
only played one warrior so far.<br/>
