<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058897318"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; So its like that Star Trek episode where Wes and that<br/>
&gt; cute chick resist the piece of headgear that zaps the<br/>
&gt; crew&#39;s brain on every success?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The cute chick was Lt. Robin Lefler (Ashley Judd in her second appearance on<br/>
ST:TNG-- previously in the episode &quot;Darmok&quot; she played Ensign Lefler) in the<br/>
episdoe &quot;The Game&quot;. The director of &quot;Darmok&quot; said in a scifi magazine way<br/>
back then that Ashley was going &quot;to be a big star&quot; someday.<br/>
Yes, I&#39;m a Star Trek geek. I have a uniform, a phaser, rank pips,<br/>
comunicator with sound, and a tricorder. Oh, and I have a tribble. :-)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; If it was like that there&#39;d be more subscribers I<br/>
&gt; think.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lol. True.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, I don&#39;t know any *real* junkies who give up<br/>
&gt; their horse for EQ horses :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, my horse is a real jerk. He bit my leg and broke the skin just to<br/>
prove he&#39;s a jerk. So I&#39;d take EQ over my horsie on some days. Would be cool<br/>
if there were horsies in game that look like him though.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Some people have no lives, and if it wasn&#39;t EQ it&#39;d be<br/>
&gt; button collecting, beanie babies and crap.  Just<br/>
&gt; because they focus their neurotic behavior on EQ<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t mean EQ caused their neurotic behavior.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly! I was neurotically addicted to TV and internet before EQ. :-)<br/>
luv,<br/>
