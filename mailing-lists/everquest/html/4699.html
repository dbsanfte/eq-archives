<div id="ygrps-yiv-151926333">About the sound problems... not sure if this is what<br/>
you mean or not, but I&#39;m almost positive that when<br/>
Planes of Power was released, they changed all the<br/>
music from midi format to mp3. So that might help your<br/>
sound problems.<br/>

&gt; a Sound Blaster Live, but I also don&#39;t have the<br/>
&gt; music turned on. In regards<br/>
&gt; to the PoP and LoY Expansions - each of these<br/>
&gt; expansions have some of the<br/>
&gt; best utilities in all of Everquest. I couldn&#39;t live<br/>
&gt; without these utilities<br/>
&gt; ever again.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The PoP has teleporting stones throughout all the<br/>
&gt; lands. There is no real<br/>
&gt; need to wait on ports or even pay for a port unless<br/>
&gt; these is no Plane of<br/>
&gt; Knowledge Stone anywhere around, 1 or 2 zones away.<br/>
&gt; Levels 1 through 65 can<br/>
&gt; use the stones.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The LoY expansion released on screen maps. You can<br/>
&gt; zoom in and out. You can<br/>
&gt; look at all of Felwithe or just the platform and hut<br/>
&gt; you are standing on.<br/>
&gt; All my maps have the name of the class GM listed<br/>
&gt; where he is located. Really<br/>
&gt; no reason to get lost anymore. I would say 90% of<br/>
&gt; the zones have maps. Maps<br/>
&gt; have succor locations. You can modify each zone map<br/>
&gt; to mark key locations<br/>
&gt; and spawn points.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure how long ago you played, but travel has<br/>
&gt; been one of the very<br/>
&gt; low points for me. I can remember waiting on the<br/>
&gt; boat in Butcher Block many<br/>
&gt; times, thinking there has to be a better way - this<br/>
&gt; is not fun. Well travel<br/>
&gt; is longer a task that takes you forever. These 2 key<br/>
&gt; EQ tools were well<br/>
&gt; worth the cash in and of itself in my onion. <br/>

&gt; Subject:	[EverQuest] WinXP and Sound Blaster (live)<br/>
&gt; music (midi)<br/>
&gt; problems.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; First I hope this group is for the PC version of<br/>
&gt; Everquest. I quit <br/>
&gt; about a year and a half ago when I upgraded to<br/>
&gt; Windows XP. I have a <br/>
&gt; Sound Blaster Live (value) card. I had the Shadows<br/>
&gt; of Luclin <br/>
&gt; expansion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The sound effects and ambient sounds were good, but<br/>
&gt; the music was <br/>
&gt; horribly distorted. I did the usual card driver<br/>
&gt; updates with XP and <br/>
&gt; posted to the Vault and other fan sites. Others with<br/>
&gt; XP and this <br/>
&gt; sound card had the same problem. EQ support emailed<br/>
&gt; me back a <br/>
&gt; response that they were aware and were working on<br/>
&gt; the problem.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Before I consider coming back, I was wondering if<br/>
&gt; anyone had similar <br/>
&gt; problems and were they solved with the current, new<br/>
&gt; expansion I <br/>
&gt; believe is called &quot;Planes of Power&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d hate to invest in the expansion to discover I<br/>
&gt; still can&#39;t have <br/>
&gt; the music specific to areas within the zones. Any<br/>
&gt; feedback would be <br/>
&gt; appreciated.<br/>
