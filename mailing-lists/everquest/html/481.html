<br/>
Except for the magic user having to learn languages for research I found a <br/>
use for them on the PvP : speak your racial language when attacking others.<br/>
<br/>
So when the big evil uglies raid freeport they use dark speech to coordinate <br/>
actions and not letting the humans know anything about it. :)<br/>
<br/>
Else, it&#39;s true that I&#39;m a little disappointed in the use of languages...<br/>

&gt;Subject: Languages !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Dear friends from EQ.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I wish to divide with you my opinion on languages and how to enchant<br/>
&gt;everquest using it better.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Already in game is included languages, we have Troll, dark elf, halfling,<br/>
&gt;elf and some secret languages. But what is use of this very important<br/>
&gt;feature in game?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Nearly nonexistent unfortunatly only some magic users use it for reading<br/>
&gt;some lost magic books in long lost languages and nothing more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In all citys merchants speak common, people in remonte huts talk common,<br/>
&gt;trolls talk common, elfs a nobile and arrogant race talk common you can go<br/>
&gt;in every city and every place and all shop vendors speak common ALL PLAYERS<br/>
&gt;talk perfect common also. So all other languages are nearly never used !!<br/>
&gt;Why to waste this valuable resurce ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What we can do,  as now in Verant they have under work a new race war<br/>
&gt;server it will be nice to include this option in new code and enchant this<br/>
&gt;interesting new idea!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My points to change<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1.) I think that some MAX knowelege based on inteligence and wisdom for any<br/>
&gt;language can be imposted so that you can learn max awaful in dragon if you<br/>
&gt;have inteligence under 60. It is very strange to have a Troll wich speak<br/>
&gt;fluent and with melodic elf language or read a long lost book writen in<br/>
&gt;combine language.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2.) all city vendors speak a local language and some rare speak also common<br/>
&gt;in some degre. In some citys arogant high elfs can speak only their<br/>
&gt;languages and will not hear any of  beast races languages.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3.) All players start with a race language based on total inteligence and<br/>
&gt;wisdom and common in some degre but not at maximum. On base of class i will<br/>
&gt;add some rare aditional languages but only for casters some base of<br/>
&gt;languages at wich are writen a basic spell books.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;4.) all aditional lv of spells can be only writen if you have enough<br/>
&gt;knowelege in language on wich a scroll is writen. This can create a<br/>
&gt;traduction skills to translate spells from one language to another and so<br/>
&gt;on. Some paterns instructions can be in a specific language.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;5.) In spell research you must have a tome with instruction in one hand and<br/>
&gt;a combine book in another and to create new spell is checked not only your<br/>
&gt;skill but also a language knowelege for language in wich is writen a book.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;6.) Npc will nor reply on your questions or trade with you if you dont know<br/>
&gt;a language enough<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This are only some of possible uses of languages and there are many more im<br/>
&gt;shure that some can be easily implemented right from start and others will<br/>
&gt;require much work and maybe will not enter in game untio a everquest 2 but<br/>
&gt;i think that here is hiden posibility to make a new profondity to this<br/>
&gt;great game .<br/>
