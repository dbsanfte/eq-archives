<div id="ygrps-yiv-204563570">Hmm.. My brother actually logged in the other day and was 55 still. I think they had a mistake with the credit card again like they did with his account previously. I wanted to just do the renew thing again but I don&#39;t have that option as it says I don&#39;t have an account. So I&#39;ll have to wait til they open to renew. As it is, I already had renewed a few monthsa go for a 2 year subscription. But they keep doing a monthly thing and I think the credit card company is being retarded and refusing to pay bc they think we are being triple billed for one thing.<br/>
So frustrating.<br/>
Just 4 more hours til they open I think. I hope anyways..<br/>
Thanks Scott. *hugs*<br/>
luv,<br/>

ps. Btw, has anyone here played World of Warcraft?<br/>

&gt;hacked or something because your cleric is showing up as level 34 ( I<br/>
&gt;think ) and your brothers SK is showing up as level 19 ( I think ) and<br/>
&gt;that really freaked me out.  I understand that the guild aplet can<br/>
&gt;sometimes be hosed, but that&#39;s never happened to me before.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Please consider working it out with SOE, the rewards they are offering<br/>
&gt;long timers like us for renewing for another year at $99 is actually<br/>
&gt;really attractive and I bet you are 6 year vet too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Let me know if there is ANYTHING I can do to help you.<br/>

&gt;I may be through with EQ now. I went to login to check my email and<br/>
&gt;apparently for no reason my account was shut off. I have no idea why.<br/>
&gt;Well, I have an idea and it might be the same fuck up as with my<br/>
&gt;brother&#39;s account previously. So, I have to decide whether or not I want<br/>
&gt;to bother renewing because they will probably charge me a higher price.<br/>
&gt;I had a 3 year subscription dammit. It just pisses me off that they<br/>
&gt;pulled this with me. I&#39;m thinking of writing them an angry letter of<br/>
&gt;complaint. I should wait til I&#39;m less angry though.<br/>
&gt;ARG. Just ARG!!!<br/>
