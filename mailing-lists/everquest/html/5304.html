<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692764501">I too have attended a few weddings.  One was LOIO, one in TD on Ogre <br/>
Island and one in Highpass.  They were all held far from people and <br/>
standard train routes.  They were all done in /Say so they didn&#39;t <br/>
take over the zone.  There were a few shouts to warn off people from <br/>
the area before it started.  And they were short!<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, we all got drunk after every one!  It was great hearing all the <br/>
gibberish.  No deaths though.  GM&#39;s made sure of that.<br/>

&gt;   First off, I agree with you.  Weddings held in /shout or /ooc are <br/>
 </span></blockquote>a bad idea.  Plus it defeats the entire reason why channels were <br/>
made.  Anybody who wants to attend the wedding should just join the <br/>
wedding channel.  Stop spamming up the public chat with crap people <br/>
dont necessarily care about except who&#39;s involved.  Also, the <br/>
waterfall in Thurg is a bad choice of places.  Granted it&#39;s beautiful <br/>
to look at, but its a high traffic area.  They should expect people <br/>
to constantly be running through there.  Especially for the reason <br/>
you stated, training mobs to zone to escape.  Everyone does it, <br/>
nobody&#39;s innocent, it&#39;s part of the game.  <br/>

want revenge then they have serious issues cause it&#39;s JUST A GAME!  <br/>
