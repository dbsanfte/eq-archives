<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just my opinion, but as a paladin, it is *possible* to solo, <br/>
especially at the earlier levels. But you don&#39;t necessarily have to <br/>
get a large group or anything. I personally prefer a partner or <br/>
small groups, as far as getting the most xp for your effort.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; pretty average to aim for. That would lvl me up once a week. Is <br/>
 </span></blockquote>that <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the norm? How long did it take you in the beginning?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the beginning, first character, I&#39;d say that&#39;s about right. Once <br/>
you know the places to go, gaining a level per (solid)night of <br/>
playing is a pretty realistic goal, if you know what places to go, <br/>
and are relatively decently geared up.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>impossible <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; on your own. Grouping is the only way but I HATE that place so <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; it makes me so nervous to go there.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Many, many options for you at level 11. Mind you, I did most of my <br/>
pre-30s leveling in the old world, before most of the expansions <br/>
came out:<br/>
<br/>
- Crushbone (orc city in Faydwer, north of the elf city Kelethin)<br/>
<br/>
- Estate of Unrest (kill yard trash to mid teens, then group inside <br/>
or pull outside from 1st floor).<br/>
<br/>
- FIELD OF BONE (iksar newbie area)- its perfect for leveling up to <br/>
about 20ish, depending on the area you hunt. Over in front of <br/>
kaesora is great for you.<br/>
<br/>
- Kurn&#39;s Tower: Esp as a paladin, when you get your vs. udnead nukes <br/>
and/or a ghoulbane, you will ROCK against undead, and this place is <br/>
full of &#39;em. You can solo here, or join a small group and watch the <br/>
exp fly by.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; as well?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends on the time you play. A lot of the older servers and players <br/>
rush off to the new expansion zones for the xp/loot there, but I <br/>
honestly still prefer the old world.<br/>
