<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-222799751">If I&#39;m not mistaken, you get 5 practice points each time you level. Most of<br/>
your skills go up so fast at these early levels, that there is no need to<br/>
put any of you practice points into any skill. Most people just save their<br/>
points to use later in life. <br/>
<br/>
As far as some skills costing plat, gold etc., once you reach a certain<br/>
point in your skills, the train will not train you for free, you will have<br/>
to pay him. So say at level 35 my warrior&#39;s sense heading skill is 96 and I<br/>
have 80 skill points to use and I want to increase my skill. The warrior is<br/>
past the free training point and it would cost me 1 skill point and 5 gold<br/>
to increase the skill to 97 and so on so on.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this wasn&#39;t too confusing, but I tried to explain it the best I know<br/>
how.<br/>

	Hey all.  I&#39;m a level 8 Half Elf ranger (first character) and I want<br/>
<br/>
	to train up some of my abilities beyond the 5 practice credits I get<br/>
<br/>
	when I level.  I&#39;ve noticed several skills that have what look like <br/>
	prices (coins of varying colors with numbers inside them) but I have<br/>
<br/>
	been unable to get the trainers to teach me those skills.  When I <br/>
	click practice (after putting my practice credits into another <br/>
	skill), it tells me that I&#39;m out of practice credits and have to go <br/>
	adventuring some more.  Is there ANY way to pay gold (or silver or <br/>
	copper) for training?  If so, HOW?  What do I click and all?  It <br/>
	shows my available money and I&#39;ve got the cash, but I just can&#39;t<br/>
seem <br/>
	to get the trainer to take the money and train me.<br/>
	Thanks for any help.<br/>
