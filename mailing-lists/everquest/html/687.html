I was wondering if there is some place to actually *see* your specific<br/>
stats in a given skill.  For instance, I see my 1H Blunt going up<br/>
point by point on the text box, but can&#39;t see any place that shows<br/>
what point I&#39;m at *now* in all my skills.  I have a friend who says<br/>
she&#39;s seen a screen that lists them but can&#39;t remember how to get to<br/>
it now.  :o/<br/>
<br/>
Also, I was recently killed by Tovax Vmar.  I was confused at first<br/>
but was informed he kills random newbies... Okay, I can live with that<br/>
(even if my character didn&#39;t &lt;grin&gt;) but before he killed me he &quot;said&quot;<br/>
&quot;Cannot open file Q2TovaxPL.txt&quot;.  What is that?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
