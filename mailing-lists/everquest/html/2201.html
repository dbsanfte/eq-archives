<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487570258"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I am just wondering your thoughts on which class<br/>
&gt; makes for the best soloing.. all the way from 1-60..<br/>
&gt; -emily<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This question comes up way way too often, i&#39;ve seen it<br/>
argued about 20 seperate times on message boards,<br/>
here&#39;s how it usually plays out. The Necros and Druids<br/>
immediately leap up and shout &quot;We&#39;re best!&quot; and<br/>
frankly, they are. Necros and Druids solo better than<br/>
any other class in EQ. Which is better? It&#39;s largely a<br/>
matter of personal preferance and where you&#39;re<br/>
soloing. Then everyone else crowds in on the thread<br/>
arguing the merits of their pet class. (as in<br/>
&quot;favorite class&quot;, not Mages ;) Technically really any<br/>
class can solo, it just involves unmanagable amounts<br/>
of downtime, picking less than profitable mobs, and<br/>
unacceptable amounts of risk... unless you&#39;re a Druid<br/>
or Necro. :)<br/>
<br/>
Just an afterthought, had to reply to the post<br/>
questioning Mage&#39;s dominance as &quot;the pet class&quot;, take<br/>
a look at the message boards on eqvault.ign.com<br/>
there&#39;s a large thread comparing the Mage Epic pet to<br/>
the highest level Beastlord pet.<br/>
