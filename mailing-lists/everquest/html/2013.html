<b>Subject:</b> Questions about the new attributes on some new SoL weapons <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191771277">Ok, I sent this to several of the EQ Yahoo group I belong to in hopes<br/>
someone will know the answer. With the release of SoL and all the new armor<br/>
and weapons, there are many new attributes given to weapons. I have listed a<br/>
few weapons below. Some of the new weapons have various damage attributes<br/>
given to some weapons. I have seen lots of different types. Some of that<br/>
I&#39;ve seen are Fire Damage, Magic Damage,  Undead Bane Damage, Cold Damage,<br/>
Grimling Bane Damage and many others I am sure. <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know how these weapon will work? What kind of impact will these<br/>
modifications have on the damage output? Does a 10 damage 20 delay with a 4<br/>
damage undead turn into a 14 damage 20 delay verses undead mobs? I am sure<br/>
this can&#39;t be true, but I&#39;d sure like to know how this works.<br/>
<br/>
Also, other weapons are popping up with skill type bonuses. For example, I<br/>
saw a 2 hand blunt weapon that had a + 5 % to 2 hand blunt. Now does this 5%<br/>
go to your 2 hand blunt skill? Or is it that you will hit for 5% more<br/>
damage. How does this work. I also saw an item that had 3% lock picking<br/>
skill gloves, a HtH held item that gave like 2% hand to hand. I am sure<br/>
there are a lot more of these to be found.<br/>
<br/>
I f anyone has any thought or knowledge on how these attributes affect the<br/>
player, please post. I hope this was not too confusing. <br/>
