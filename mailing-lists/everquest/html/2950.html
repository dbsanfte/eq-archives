<div id="ygrps-yiv-1559133482">If you want to build your brewing fast and cheap, and can forage, you <br/>
can do so with vegetable oil. Just foraged vegetables and purchased <br/>
water. No containers, just water to buy. Everytime I have a load of <br/>
veggies I stop and brew some. Still don&#39;t know what vegetable oil is <br/>
for.<br/>
<br/>
For smithing the best advance with little cost is metal bits. When <br/>
metal bits no longer gains advance, make toolboxes. Use the tool <br/>
boxes as bank containers.When toolboxes no longer advance, make <br/>
skewers. This seems to be the lowest cost and least involved product <br/>
to get you up to lvl 85.<br/>
<br/>
At lvl 85 you can begin cranking out banded armor with reasonable <br/>
success. Haven&#39;t yet looked past that.<br/>
<br/>
Baking is easy to advance if you forage. Fish rolls. Hunt a stack of <br/>
bat wings, fish a mess of fish. Combine in oven, one and one. The <br/>
level to trivial is around 100. <br/>
<br/>
I am based in Rivervale, so I can do all of this mostly in that zone. <br/>
Have to pop over o misty for the batwings.<br/>
<br/>
Haven&#39;t found a quick and easy way to advance pottery, yet. Tailoring <br/>
has been my primary skill, advancing with my main experience as I <br/>
made my own armor. Hope one day to make Misty armor.<br/>
