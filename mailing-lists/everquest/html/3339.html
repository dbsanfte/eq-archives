<div id="ygrps-yiv-502224550">Hey guys I have been lurking around this group for a few months. I just <br/>
got Luclin and just d/l the new UI. It looks great! I have been an EQ <br/>
player for several years and in all that time I have managed to level up <br/>
my dwarf warrior to teh whopping level of 35!! Well actually, I got to <br/>
36 once but died almost immediately after the ding! LOL<br/>
<br/>
With all the new zones and stuff what is you advice for a warrior of my <br/>
level and of fairly meager means. I only play about 6 or 7 hours a week.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!</div>
