    do you know where I can get it?<br/>
    seems the enchanter class might be useful after all...<br/>

      Its called Staff of Writhing or Writhing Staff and is 1 (one) hand blunt. Its gotten in a really really tough place for 30 + people. Its stats are awesome of course, however, we clerics cannot use it. Its restricted to true casters like wizards and enchanters. Which is too bad as most of them suck at 1h blunt.<br/>

        I&#39;ve heard that the runed totem staff and skull of jhen tra can be used <br/>
        together/in conjunction with each other, yet there is no obvious way to do <br/>
        this.  Is this information wrong, or am I just missing something?  Thanks in <br/>
        advance. <br/>
