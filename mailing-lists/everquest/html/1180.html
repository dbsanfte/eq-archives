<div id="ygrps-yiv-1931360069">The last 2 nights my server, Tunare has been up and down ( LOCKED ) 6 - 8<br/>
times. This does not include being down for patches. The server would come<br/>
up for 20 - 30 minutes and then crash again. This happened over and over<br/>
during prime time ( US time ) the past two days. When a server dumps 2,300<br/>
people and then everyone tries to get back in to see if it is up or just log<br/>
into chat, it affects everyone trying to log on to their own server. So, I<br/>
would guess that is where and why you are seeing the delay.<br/>
<br/>
Went to bed at 9 pm Central Time, not sure what time my server even came<br/>
back up.  <br/>

	A few servers have been running a few emergencies patches. Maybe the<br/>
login<br/>
	server was laged due to folks from these servers trying to login.<br/>
