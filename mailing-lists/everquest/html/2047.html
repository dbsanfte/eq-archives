<div id="ygrps-yiv-1483345746">I have seen the Athlon used in some nice systems. There is a nice <br/>
shop near here that has been custom building systems for about 20 <br/>
years. I may check with them and see if they can cobble up something <br/>
at a good price. I don&#39;t want to build it myself. Had enough of that <br/>
back in the mid-80&#39;s. I think over the next year or so I will come up <br/>
with a servicable solution.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great Holiday Season.<br/>

&gt; If you are looking for a new system, I recommend you go with an AMD <br/>
Athlon<br/>
&gt; processor. I know they have had problems with EQ in the past but <br/>
they cost<br/>
&gt; much less than pentiums. I used to be loyal to pentiums but even <br/>
though my<br/>
&gt; mother has more RAM in her computer and a 1.7GHz P4, my system with <br/>
a 1.4GHz<br/>
&gt; AMD (both have same OS and both are HPs) runs faster. It cost $119 <br/>
for 256M<br/>
&gt; of RAM for the P4. I&#39;d have to ask my dad how much he payed for my <br/>
upcoming<br/>
&gt; RAM, but for xmas he&#39;s getting me 1.2GHz of RAM. I also read some <br/>
articles<br/>
&gt; on building new computers and Pentiums run hotter and require <br/>
special<br/>
&gt; sockets and special RAM that all cost more than it costs for AMDs. <br/>
For a<br/>
&gt; modem, you could try a V92 Zoom. I got one for about $21 (not <br/>
including<br/>
&gt; shipping) online. But that&#39;s for phone line modem. Once you figure <br/>
out what<br/>
&gt; you want, look up pricegrabber.com, epinions.com, pricewatch.com, <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; cnet.com. You can compare them and see which one has the lowest <br/>
price and<br/>
&gt; best review.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I bought my machine last year for Christmas. A gift for the <br/>
family.<br/>
&gt; &gt; It was a mid-range system at that time, though I did not know that<br/>
&gt; &gt; the 256k memory limit would make it low-end so quickly. I added a <br/>
3d<br/>
&gt; &gt; card at about six months, not knowing that the standard was moving<br/>
&gt; &gt; ahead so fast. With the knowledge I now have, I may have scraped <br/>
up a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bit more and bought higher end, but it was not then a good <br/>
economic<br/>
&gt; &gt; move.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I will be adding enough memory in a few weeks to bring my system <br/>
up<br/>
&gt; &gt; to it&#39;s 256k max. I ordered sol in the summer, with the <br/>
expectation<br/>
&gt; &gt; that the 128k minimum would be in place when released. I found <br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; my max would now be the new minimum.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As is the system is nominally playable. With the new memory and<br/>
&gt; &gt; possibly a new graphics card (fortunately the cost of a gforce 2 <br/>
has<br/>
&gt; &gt; dropped to an easily reachable level) the machine will serve. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; expect Sony/V will make improvements in the game to keep lower end<br/>
&gt; &gt; players viable for some time.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now I must plan to upgrade hardware and catch up, perhaps pull <br/>
ahead<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the curve a bit so I am not always catching up.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, I am not able to scrape up the $4k bucks for a real<br/>
&gt; &gt; kick-ass system like I see in the magazines. I will probably see <br/>
what<br/>
&gt; &gt; a new tower with lots of memory, a gforce 3 and a good sized hard<br/>
&gt; &gt; drive will cost me, and begin saving in hopes of getting it online<br/>
&gt; &gt; before this system gets too old to play.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; For those of us on the lower end, we must hope Sony/V wants our <br/>
bucks<br/>
&gt; &gt; enough to keep us alive a bit longer.<br/>
