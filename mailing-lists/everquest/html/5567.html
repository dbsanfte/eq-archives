Thanks for the  info.  I&#39;ll keep that definately in mind for the next one =)<br/>
I dont have Photoshop but PaintShop Pro would work just as well for putting<br/>
in the names  yes?<br/>
As for the music I had 3 songs i had planned on using for this film before I<br/>
made my final decision. and that was made just after I finished putting in<br/>
the Expanding Pirate Ship effect.<br/>

&gt; It looked great.  My only suggestion is have people do<br/>
&gt; some of the screenshots without names.  Then you have<br/>
&gt; more room to add more captions and if you happen to<br/>
&gt; know who the people are in the shot you can write them<br/>
&gt; in using photoshop.  I hate the font SoE use.  And I<br/>
&gt; loved the music also great choice....Dead<br/>
