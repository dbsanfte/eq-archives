Subject: [EverQuest] Serious Skill question for all<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi Everyone,<br/>
&gt; I have been on this board and playing since January.<br/>
&gt; So YES I am a newbie.<br/>
&gt; I have three chars between 10 and 20 in level.  My<br/>
&gt; question is this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Are the trade skills really good and do they play a<br/>
&gt; part of succeeding at higher levels?&quot;<br/>
&gt; Here is why I ask.  My friend is a level 17 druid and<br/>
&gt; a tailor.  He can&#39;t make armor that my level 13 Ranger<br/>
&gt; can use that is worthwhile to me.  I bought some mail<br/>
&gt; boots and chest armor, which are far better than what<br/>
&gt; he can make.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am also doing pottery with my Druid and I can&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; any value to this trade.  If I make 30 muffin tins, is<br/>
&gt; some baker really going to buy the lot off me?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I feel that as I get up in level, I will be able to<br/>
&gt; get better Drop items than I can make.<br/>
&gt; However, I do know that trades take part in some<br/>
&gt; quests and this is the only purpose I can see for<br/>
&gt; them.  I think<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Am I missing something here?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Trade confused!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
