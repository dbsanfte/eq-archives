<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459753063">I forgot which spell ability casting darkness has but use that one.  That&#39;ll<br/>
be your main aggro drawing spell (along with Terror/Fear-in the upper 50s).<br/>
When shopping for items remember that your main job is to tank, take all the<br/>
hits for the group so if a wep has anything with STA/AC/HP on it use those.<br/>
For the weapon you mentioned what kind of stats does it have?  <br/>
The stats will determine if you should use that over something with high dmg<br/>
and no stats.  Like I said earlier the main ones you should focus on are<br/>
STA/AC/HP and STR/DEX to a lesser degree, anyone with WIS and CHA is pretty<br/>
much useless to this class.<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] SK Help ????<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello All:<br/>
I started an alt SK and wanted to know what is a good focus effect for them <br/>
if that makes sense.  They don&#39;t seem to have any Direct Damage spells that <br/>
I could see on the spell list so that is out.<br/>
Also, having a hard time finding a decent weapon for my SK.  I have one now <br/>
that does 28 damage with no stats--should I go for lower damage and more <br/>
stats or stay with high damage and no stats. lololol.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks :)<br/>
<br/>
