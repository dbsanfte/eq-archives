<div><font face="Arial" size="2">First off, I agree with you.&nbsp; Weddings held in /shout or /ooc are a bad idea.&nbsp; Plus it defeats the entire reason why channels were made.&nbsp; Anybody who wants to attend the wedding should just join the wedding channel.&nbsp; Stop spamming up the public chat with crap people dont necessarily care about except who&#39;s involved.&nbsp; Also, the waterfall in Thurg is a bad choice of places.&nbsp; Granted it&#39;s beautiful to look at, but its a high traffic area.&nbsp; They should expect people to constantly be running through there.&nbsp; Especially for the reason you stated, training mobs to zone to escape.&nbsp; Everyone does it, nobody&#39;s innocent, it&#39;s part of the game.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Personally, I wouldn&#39;t think too much of it because there&#39;s nothing they can really do to you to get revenge.&nbsp; And if they do want revenge then they have serious issues cause it&#39;s JUST A GAME!&nbsp; </font></div>

<div><br></div><tt>I was in GD today and was slicing through wurms with my trusty <br>necromantic pet when 2 more wurms jumped me and i had to run.&nbsp; The <br>closest zone was thurgadin and i had to pray to cazic-thule that the <br>coldain didn&#39;t hate Iksar Necromancers.<br>I had heard about a wedding being held earlier and i remembered that <br>it was at the waterfall by thurgadin so i shouted train to thurgadin <br>and remembered that i could FD so i did to make sure that i wasn&#39;t <br>killed and that the wurms did&#39;t spoil the wedding.&nbsp; Luckily i was far <br>enough from the wedding that the wurms ran back to their caves.<br>Heres where it stars...&nbsp; First of all the wedding was in OOC.&nbsp; Bad <br>choice.&nbsp; Second the peeps of the wedding kept telling people in the <br>zone to &quot;Shutup&quot; or &quot;Stfu&quot;&nbsp; That was being rude.&nbsp; I proceeded to tell <br>them that they should hold a wedding in SAY or a seperate channel.&nbsp; <br>They all got pissed at me and everyone
 there kept vowing revenge on <br>me.&nbsp; Made me a bit mad but i held it in so that i didn&#39;t purposefully <br>give them a reason to get mad.&nbsp; They continued to nag on and on so i <br>allerted my guild and they all thought the same thing.&nbsp; A Wedding <br>should be held in private chat and if others talk in the zone just <br>filter the ooc and shouts.&nbsp; The wedding was very badly planned and <br>now i have a whole guild mad at me.&nbsp; ( the other guild that was <br>having the marriage not mine)&nbsp; I was wondering what you all think of <br>weddings in EQ and was i justified in shouting train and telling them <br>that they should hold their wedding in private if they don&#39;t want to <br>hear all the shouts and ooc&#39;s of a zone.&nbsp; <br><br>Piezie V&#39;rix<br>47th Necromancer<br>Fennin Ro<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.everquest.com/">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your use of Yahoo!
