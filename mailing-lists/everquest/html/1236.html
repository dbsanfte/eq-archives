<div id="ygrps-yiv-1925566240"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">People of all ages like the game so what&#39;s the cut off age? &nbsp;My sons are 7 
<br>and 6 and they play. &nbsp;They group with each other. &nbsp;I&#39;ve grouped with plenty, 
<br>young and old alike, who were complete idiots. &nbsp;You just have to leave the 
<br>group and find another if you aren&#39;t happy with the one you are in. &nbsp;The only 
<br>buff I will ask for is a Sow. &nbsp;I will offer a breeze to trade and if they 
<br>can, great, if not, fine. &nbsp;I have had people ask me and I&#39;ve been busy but I 
<br>say if they come to me. &nbsp;I had one person tell me and say if I come breeze 
<br>them they will pay good. &nbsp;I go and all I get is 1 gc. &nbsp;Whoopee. &nbsp;I&#39;ve had a 
<br>couple people who bug me for breezes, they walk up and stand in my way until 
<br>I breeze them. &nbsp;Usually I don&#39;t mind though.

<br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote TYPE="CITE" style="BORDER-LEFT:#0000ff 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;">I sort of know what you mean. Even if I&#39;m already in a group I get people
<br>sending me tells asking for a heal or a bind. They&#39;ll expect me to leave my
<br>group and go find them to bind or heal. but most people are polite about it.
<br>If I ask for clarity or breeze I generally offer to donate or pay for said
<br>service. Or I offer to return a buff if my buffs are good enough.
<br>I mostly have people outside my group being polite. but when I have people
<br>in my group they can be rather rude. Like I was grouped with his one kid
<br>(who I later found out was only 9 yrs old) who kept saying &quot;Heal me. HEAL
<br>ME!&quot; when he wasn&#39;t even halfway down and I&#39;d already told him I was out of
<br>mana. I had said to other people I swore he was only 10. but then his father
<br>told me he was 9.
<br>Personally I don&#39;t think kids that age should play EQ. Especially when they
<br>could potentially screw things up for other people&#39;s characters.
<br>go figure.
<br>luv,
