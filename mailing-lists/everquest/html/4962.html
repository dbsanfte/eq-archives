 I have been playing EQ since the betas and I am female. =) Back in the<br/>
good ole days they said that is was 1/3 to Â½ actual female  RPGers in<br/>
game.not sure about now-a-days though. I know there are a ton of female<br/>
characters played by guys, which I don&#39;t really understand. Are there<br/>
really that many men who secretly want to be female? *grin* Just<br/>
kidding.</div>
