<div id="ygrps-yiv-874910420">My Halfling Druid will ding 42 on Thursday. I have him hunting Orcs in<br/>
CC. I may stay there one more level, as it is profitable to hunt<br/>
miners and sell the Velium. However, I am beginning to cast about for<br/>
my next adventure.<br/>
<br/>
I go solo most of the time, and prefer that style of play. Not that I<br/>
don&#39;t enjoy the social elements of the game. Just don&#39;t want to depend<br/>
on groups. Kind of a loner, even in a game world. <br/>
<br/>
What would be a good next step, seeking modest to good leveling, and<br/>
good to great cash? I hunt mostly blues, as I can take one easily, and<br/>
two with care, and three if I must (and none of them are casters). Any<br/>
suggestions as to where I go next?<br/>
