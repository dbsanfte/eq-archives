<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-351979933">Wow...thanks so much for the really helpful and encouraging <br/>
replies.  I feel so much more courageous ;o) than before...have <br/>
printed off all your tips and will study, yahhhhhhhhhh I have a <br/>
little more guidance now...<br/>
<br/>
I made it to Luclin to the Bazaar, but may be stuck there now...feel <br/>
like a bobble head Paly doll from all the lag.  Oh, went to Kunark <br/>
and somehow have lived to tell about it...wandered to what is called <br/>
the wizzy towers or some sort of settlement...hugged the treeline <br/>
all the way back to the PoP spires...reallllly don&#39;t want to go back <br/>
there til&#39; I am about a level 60 ;o)!  I hope I can get the items I <br/>
want and get back to Greater Faydark sometime before spring...<br/>
<br/>
