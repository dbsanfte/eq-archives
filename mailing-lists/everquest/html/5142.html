<div>I&#39;m hoping someone can remind me about this... I got the LDoN message about who to speak to for the adventure stone when I was level 16, and since I wasn&#39;t at 20 yet, I didn&#39;t do it. Now that I&#39;m at 22, I can&#39;t remember who it was I was supposed to talk to. Who is the person in Halas that gives you the stone?</div>
