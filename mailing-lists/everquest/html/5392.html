<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#004080">there are a few options to hunt between 10 and 20, alot depends on your race/ class combination.&nbsp; Kurn&#39;s Tower off the Field Of Bone is an excellent choice for undead, as well as Estate of Unrest.&nbsp; I had fun in Everfrost Peaks also.&nbsp; Or even a little deeper into Blackborrow..&nbsp; There are so many servers now unless you&#39;re on an older one like Karana where I play, it&#39;s really tough to find a sustain groups outside of a guild.</font></html></div>
