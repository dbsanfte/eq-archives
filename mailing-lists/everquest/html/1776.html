<div id="ygrps-yiv-892332429">Start working on your foraging. And see if anyone wants to buy the<br/>
vegetables for baking or brewing.<br/>
Also, look for a bright green thing laying on the ground near Kelethin.<br/>
There&#39;s two near the ruins, one between the lifts, a couple on the hill near<br/>
the lifts, and another on orc hill... They are called evergreen leaves and<br/>
sell for decent prices. people buy them from me for 5pp a piece.<br/>
