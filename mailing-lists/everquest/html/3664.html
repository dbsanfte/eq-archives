<div id="ygrps-yiv-425199519">Agreed but why take on the task alone. Meaning, if<br/>
they have a submission venue, which they may have, it<br/>
would allow tons of people to venture and help write<br/>
the descriptions....Then they could keep it up easily.<br/>
<br/>
Actually one suggestion would be to take applications<br/>
from people and give them an area or zone for<br/>
specialty.<br/>
<br/>
So I could take my 20 mage lets say and keep the guy<br/>
in EC and once per week waltz around and kill stuff to<br/>
see if anything changed or not.......as well as walk<br/>
the zone to remap any changes in landmarks.<br/>
<br/>
I do agree with you and understand entirely.<br/>

&gt; maps are ok but since Lucline has been out for a<br/>

&gt; currently.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There also needs to be updates to the existing<br/>

&gt; For example we raided Runnyeye the other day and a<br/>

&gt; was<br/>
&gt; on floor two with another friend and it dropped off<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; something not even stated..... which is fine but it<br/>
&gt; was not expected at all, updates like this would be<br/>
&gt; great.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; my 2 cents<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll be picking it up too. EQ Atlas is a good<br/>
&gt; &gt; resource, however their<br/>
&gt; &gt; maps aren&#39;t the best IMHO. One, they need to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; consistence and have one<br/>
&gt; &gt; map that they update off the other maps they have.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Two, No cartoony<br/>
&gt; &gt; maps. It makes things a little too confusing; And<br/>
&gt; &gt; three, Add a legend to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the maps and include a N S E W compass. I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; &gt; saying they suck, just<br/>
&gt; &gt; would like to see some improvements. Hopefully<br/>
&gt; &gt; Verant&#39;s will be more<br/>
&gt; &gt; consistent. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; As for the dual monitor, It&#39;s easy, just have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; second video card<br/>
&gt; &gt; installed and run EQ on one and your other info on<br/>
&gt; &gt; the other. You may<br/>
&gt; &gt; have to tweak the settings a little but that<br/>
&gt; &gt; shouldn&#39;t be hard to do.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The monitors can be mapped to do this. <br/>

&gt; &gt; I will probably buy the forthcoming atlas, once it<br/>
&gt; &gt; is out. It will be <br/>
&gt; &gt; cheaper than printing up the rest of the maps I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t have, since I <br/>
&gt; &gt; have been only printing maps as I need them. Plus,<br/>
&gt; &gt; we ran out of ink <br/>
&gt; &gt; and nobody in my household wants to be the one to<br/>
&gt; &gt; spring for the new <br/>
&gt; &gt; ink. Probably because they know a large number of<br/>
&gt; &gt; maps will be <br/>
&gt; &gt; printed as soon as the ink is loaded. ;)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; What I would really like is to have eq in a<br/>
&gt; window,<br/>
&gt; &gt; with a second <br/>
&gt; &gt; monitor to hold my data; maps, charts, lists, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; recipes. I know <br/>
&gt; &gt; there is a hack to allow this, but I would prefer<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; sanctioned <br/>
&gt; &gt; window. Plus I don&#39;t have the horsepower on this<br/>
&gt; &gt; system to carry such <br/>
&gt; &gt; a load. My game would suffer.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Twenty bucks for the atlas sounds cheaper all<br/>
&gt; round.<br/>
