<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-909788874">My brother had the problem that when the shuttles bumped together or one<br/>
passed through the other, it just knocked him into the water in TD. he<br/>
couldn&#39;t zone back out, he swam and swam but couldn&#39;t find land. He<br/>
petitioned bc he couldn&#39;t gate (he&#39;s a paladin). A GM answered the petition<br/>
but ported him to the evil docks where he was immediately killed. When he<br/>
tried to recontact the GM, she&#39;d already logged off. He had to wait 3 hours<br/>
for a customer service rez and a port to the correct docks.<br/>
So, if you do get stuck, make sure you specify which docks you need to go<br/>
to.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Uh oh.<br/>
&gt; This does not sound good since you are not on Druzzil<br/>
&gt; Ro, if I remember correctly and I had the same problem<br/>
&gt; on that server.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I heard you can petition and a GM will port you there<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I ended up going to oasis and going that way.<br/>
&gt; it is trickier since in the overthere good races are<br/>
&gt; KOS but I managed to jump off that boat and swim to<br/>
&gt; the shore.  I did not manage to get through the other<br/>
&gt; zones though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good luck<br/>

&gt; &gt; The other day I decided that a trip to Kunark was in<br/>
&gt; &gt; order for my<br/>
&gt; &gt; druid. I will be needing Brute hides, and so was<br/>
&gt; &gt; ready to go and hunt<br/>
&gt; &gt; them. However, the shuttles in Butcherblock never<br/>
&gt; &gt; met the boat. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; tried three times, three different shuttles, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; they went out to<br/>
&gt; &gt; Timerous Deep, got close to the boat, then the boat<br/>
&gt; &gt; left. The<br/>
&gt; &gt; shuttles just went back to BB.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; That avenue being out, I returned to SK to pick off<br/>
&gt; &gt; gnolls, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; forage Plains Pebbles. I almost have my bank tool<br/>
&gt; &gt; box full of them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; have about eight to go. So, decided to stay there<br/>
&gt; &gt; until I get the<br/>
&gt; &gt; rest.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Plus I have been getting fs weapons from the gnolls,<br/>
&gt; &gt; which I have<br/>
&gt; &gt; tried to make into another Vale Sewing Kit to sell.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hope they get the boat fixed. For my first trip I<br/>
&gt; &gt; want to do it the<br/>
&gt; &gt; old-fashioned way.<br/>
