&gt; If you need any other files this way just let me know.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmm just by putting that url above, keep giving me a blank website <br/>
(only tripod banner ads shown), trying to put index.html or www <br/>
infront of the url also give me nothing. Changing the http to ftp <br/>
also yield no success. <br/>
<br/>
If you would be so kind as to instruct me on how to proceed? Perhaps <br/>
tripod is down currently? Anyway.. just to thank thee, for the kind <br/>
gesture.. I have Trilogy, Velious, Luclin and PoP lying around <br/>
somewhere.. and if you need it for yourself or just to get another <br/>
friend addicted, feel free to send carrier pigeons my way.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.. I will keep on trying. Please do update.</div>
