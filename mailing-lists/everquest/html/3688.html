<br/>
or try Drakkel Wolves if you want to go for thurgadin and skyshrine faction ... the Tracking Wolves should be a bit lower, and <br/>
give you good faction with Kael (frost giants) but lower it with Thurgadin.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
IMHO it is better to start with Thurgadin (and SS) faction, because it makes the start in Velious easier: two zones you can <br/>
call home (or actually use the bank ... :-). also - if your SS faction is good enough - you can gate/port to WL without <br/>
checking if Wuoshi is up (normally this poor lady is killed every week). and if you start hunting in CS (another quad kiter ... :-<br/>
( ... zone is still popular for this, but too small to supply many quadders at once) you have a city just one zone away (on the <br/>
other hand this shouldn&#39;t be really a problem for a druid).<br/>
<br/>
after completing (or getting it to a certain level) some of the thurgadin quests (like the prayer shawl) and you don&#39;t need <br/>
Thurgadin as a base, you can start to work on your Kael faction with killing Dwarves in icewell keep (this is sort of higher <br/>
level stuff). so after some (long) time, you can have SS and Kael faction.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
good luck and have fun<br/>
