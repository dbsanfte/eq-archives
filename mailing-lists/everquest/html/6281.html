<b>Subject:</b> I&#39;m considering taking the game back up, but I have a question first. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-496412426">Three years ago I played using the Kunark and Luclin expansions. If I<br/>
were to invest the ~$15 per month to start playing again would it be<br/>
enjoyable if those were the only two expansions I played with?</div>
