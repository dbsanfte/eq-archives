<div><font size="2">One more thing to think about.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">Assuming you get PL&#39;d to 40+, your skills will only be maybe 
level 20 if that.&nbsp; In order to raise your skills you have to practice them 
on mobs that you still get xp from.&nbsp; Your skills don&#39;t increase unless the 
mob is at least light blue.&nbsp; Skilsl like divination and conjuration can be 
worked while sitting in POK just repeatedly casting them over again.&nbsp; 
Skills like Abjuration and alteration will go up just by repeatedly buffing 
people, which you can also sit in POK and do.&nbsp; BUT, the big skill, 
Evocation doesn&#39;t go up unless you&#39;re actually killing mobs.&nbsp; And that&#39;s 
where it&#39;s gonna hurt you.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">I find as a druid, my least commonly used skill is divination. 
Divination is Invis and See Invis.&nbsp; spirit of Eagle and Flight of Eagles 
has See Invis included.&nbsp; so you may want to work Invis because it comes in 
handy in the higher levels.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">As a druid, probably your most commonly used combat skill is 
Conjuration since you will primarily be using DOTs.&nbsp; Mix in a heaping of 
Evocation for nukes and you can raise them pretty quick, but only if you&#39;re 
getting xp for the mob, and as has been pointed out, that&#39;s very hard to do if 
you&#39;re PL&#39;d</font></div>

        <div>I have to agree&nbsp;with all that&#39;s said here and add a little, 
        there&#39;s 2 ways to PL someone from what I&#39;ve seen, the way they&#39;ve talked 
        about here putting a damage shield on you and healing you as and when 
        you need it, or taking the mob down to about 50% then you finish it off. 
        </div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div>Lets take the first one for example, DS and heal. the DS hurts the 
        mob before they hit you, you don&#39;t get hit as much and usually not as 
        hard so your defense doesn&#39;t go up. Because the DS is damaging them you 
        don&#39;t have to hit as much as normal so your attack doesn&#39;t go up either. 
        Yes being PL by a druid or a class equal to them will get you to 65 in a 
        hurry but you&#39;re going to be a wimp unable to either take a hit or make 
        a hit leading to yours and possibly your groups untimely death. You&#39;re 
        also not going to be using your spells as much as they&#39;re going to be 
        rooting the mobs for you.... can we say fizzle city here, you can&#39;t save 
        your group or yourself if you can&#39;t cast once before your oom</div>

        <div>&nbsp;</div><tt>Skills, skills, skills, skills, skills, skills, 
        skills!<br><br>I hate to be the one to say this but you really should 
        focus on your battle skills. Trust me, at the lower levels that is a 
        perfect time to get the skills built up. I can understand wanting to go 
        in and just beat the heck out of everything and being uber and killing 
        it all in one shot. But ponder this, When you get to be up in levels 
        (50&#39;s, 60&#39;s, and 70&#39;s) you are going to be taking on some majorly nasty 
        monsters. If you have just gained levels and have an uber weapon but 
        never really worked on your fighting skills and they are low, it&#39;s not 
        going to help you or your party out very much. Actually you will hurt 
        your group more than help them. Now being a Shammy you have some awesome 
        spells at higher levels. This is another thing I would suggest focusing 
        on. If your at a higher level and your fighting say a dragon and 60% of 
        your casts fizz <br>then you may as well run or be able to hit! (See 
        first part otherwise your gonna get killed or your group 
        killed.<br><br>That&#39;s just my 2 cents.<br><br></tt></td></tr>
