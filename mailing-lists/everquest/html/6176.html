<div id="ygrps-yiv-563308544"><div>You can rename your ini file to include the new servername and then when you launch EQ it will have all your original configurations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you have launched EQ since the merger, there will be a default ini file named UI_charname_newservername.ini. Just delete this one (or rename it&nbsp;save_ or something if you don&#39;t want to delete it). Then find your old UI_charname_oldservername.ini and rename the oldservername section to the newservername.</div>
<div>Do the same thing to the charname_newservername.ini and an charname_oldservername.ini as well as bazaar and barter files you can rename to get all your old prices and stuffies.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Good luck!<br>Lilli<br><b><i>Steven Hulse &lt;steveh@...&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div>
