stability and speed difference once the VM was fixed to reflect <br/>
changes in real ram.Overall, spending $50 for a Geforce 2 will be an <br/>
investment you&#39;re likely to be pleased with. Also, if your power <br/>
supply is wimpy, consider invest in a bigger one...300 watts should <br/>
be plenty for a Geforce 2 and sufficient cooling for everything, but <br/>
250 will do the trick with less breathing room...any less, upgrade.<br/>

&gt;   You can try all of that stuff, but I would think it&#39;s your CPU <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and video card that&#39;s hampering you more than anything.  I ran EQ on <br/>
a PII 333mhz with an 8MB video card and 8MB accelerator while I was <br/>
in Japan.  It was slow as molasses.  No matter how many options I <br/>
turned off.  I noticed moderately better performance once I upgraded <br/>
the video card.  Even on my PIII 800 with 640MB of RAM itwould run <br/>
everything but Luclin.  Then I upgraded the video card to 128MB and <br/>
it ran fine.   If you really want to improve performance, upgrade <br/>
your video card if at all possible.  It can sometimes compensate for <br/>
a slower processor.<br/>
