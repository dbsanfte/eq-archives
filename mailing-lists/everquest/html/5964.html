<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777526309">LOL in a way that&#39;s nice to hear! At least I won&#39;t be running around all <br/>
by myself! Ha ha ha!<br/>
<br/>
I think for me even if I could run EQ2 I would play EQ1 at least for a <br/>
while. I have invested to much time into my toons. I&#39;ve been playing a <br/>
little over 2 years now off and on (RL issues playing into that) and <br/>
granted the highest lvl I have is a 32 Ranger. It&#39;s just that I have so <br/>
many things to do yet within the game, places to go, things to see, <br/>
monsters to kill, (Equstrielle, you will die!) trade skills to master <br/>
and much more.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I&#39;ve noticed a lot of guild activity as of late in EQ1. New ones <br/>
forming, old ones either folding, merging with others, and lots of <br/>
recruiting. Our guild, (Mystic Crusaders), is surviving the fallout of <br/>
EQ2 so far. It&#39;s funny and a slightly odd feeling at the same time, but <br/>
there seems to be only 3 maybe 4 of us still actively playing EQ1 and <br/>
when I log in it&#39;s just so quiet. A little eerie at times. I&#39;ve been <br/>
actively recruiting so hopefully we will rebuild soon.<br/>
<br/>
As for EQ2, beautiful graphics. That&#39;s about all I can say. I haven&#39;t <br/>
actually played the game so I&#39;m not sure what game play is like. <br/>
Although one thing I&#39;ve heard about and I kind of wish they would <br/>
include in EQ1 is the conning system. Now I guess instead of the little <br/>
color ring, you also get icons either above or below the NPC name that <br/>
shows exactly how tough they may be. Also if you have a mob and you <br/>
target one it shows you ALL the others that will come running if you attack.<br/>
<br/>
Happy adventuring!<br/>
