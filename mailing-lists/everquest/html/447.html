&gt; do it any other way...why its just a glorified irc chat room.  You<br/>
&gt; still cant fight anything beyond your level, you just stand out<br/>
&gt; someone whos trying to bypass the system, and most people will look<br/>
&gt; down on you as someone who cant handle the game.  Nothing personal i<br/>
&gt; just put all twinkies in the same catogery.  The game is just not that<br/>
&gt; hard, but as in real life everyone is looking for a handout.  Later...<br/>

&gt;      In my experience on The Rathe, the only level 2 players you<br/>
&gt;      will see in full bronze got that full bronze from one of<br/>
&gt;      their older siblings, who DID it the hard way to begin<br/>
&gt;      with...worked their way up the ladder until they were high<br/>
&gt;      enough to acquire such good items.  I currently have only<br/>
&gt;      one persona in EQ...a cleric who is almost level 40 now.<br/>
&gt;      She acquired her exp and items the hard way...fighting and<br/>
&gt;      dying for them, saving enough plat to buy them, camping for<br/>
&gt;      hours and days on end for them, and trading some of them for<br/>
&gt;      others.  I have all my banded from my early days and some<br/>
&gt;      other nice things vaulted...I did not sell them.  Why?<br/>
&gt;      Because when my current persona DOES get a sibling, you can<br/>
&gt;      bet that is whom they are going to go to. A Twinkie? Yah,<br/>
&gt;      you betcha.  But don&#39;t forget....they were originally gotten<br/>
&gt;      the long, hard way. Been there...done that....not gonna do<br/>
&gt;      it again. Mikaela Tristram of The Rathe<br/>

&gt;            Sometimes I ponder this.  Why to people just give<br/>
&gt;           things away to people. Let them work for it, or at<br/>
&gt;           least pay for it.  Especially when the person<br/>
&gt;           receiving it has no idea where it came from.  Its<br/>
&gt;           funny and sad really, when your in the newbie yard<br/>
&gt;           and you see a level 2 player chasing a snake<br/>
&gt;           around in full bronze armor.  The Crude Stein is<br/>
&gt;           no big deal, but if someone wants to give you<br/>
&gt;           something that is significant don&#39;t accept it.<br/>
&gt;           Add a little character to your character, so to<br/>
&gt;           speak. Get down in the trenches with the rest of<br/>
&gt;           us, in the long run it will make you a better<br/>
&gt;           player.  Some call it twinking, I call them<br/>
&gt;           Twinkies..  looks good yet not much substance. :)<br/>
&gt;           hehe<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;           Anyways...   have fun... hehe<br/>
