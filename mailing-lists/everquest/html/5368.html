<div id="ygrps-yiv-536825616">I make money baking.  I came up with an idea of a meal in a bag I buy a <br/>
small 4 slot bag put a stack of patty melts and a stack of dessert and a <br/>
stack of wine, milk or water and top it off with a flower.  It is quick and <br/>
easy and they sell like HOT cakes.  Also as you get higher in baking you can <br/>
make things that have a proc value like justice fruit pies that raise your <br/>
states and halas meat pies.<br/>
<br/>
Those that have 100kpp pay for it on site they buy their money I think that <br/>
is cheating and I won&#39;t waste that kind of money just to buy an over priced <br/>
weapon or pievce of armor<br/>

&gt; &gt; hello everyone.. I am new to this club but not EQ..  Lets talk about<br/>
&gt; &gt; makeing money.. I know to kill giants and farm silks and hides to<br/>
&gt; &gt; make money and you make god money doing this.. But how the heck do<br/>
&gt; &gt; people make 100k and more lol.. most i have had at one time is 5k..<br/>
&gt; &gt; If there is a better way to make pp  please let me know  thanks<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;Basically farming and doing lost dungeon adventures is pretty profitable. I<br/>
&gt;myself am not good at making money yet. I need to work on it. I&#39;m hoping to<br/>
&gt;be able to profit from my jewelcraft when I get it high enough. I had to <br/>
&gt;get<br/>
&gt;it high to work on my 7th shawl. If you have a foraging class, you can make<br/>
&gt;coin foraging stuff to sell.<br/>
&gt;Anyone know of good websites that have money making advice (not the pay<br/>
&gt;sites)?<br/>
&gt;luv,<br/>
