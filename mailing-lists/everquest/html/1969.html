What type of modem do you have? Do you know the brand name?<br/>
What type of internet connection do you have?<br/>
If it&#39;s a phone line connection, pick up the receiver on your phone (while<br/>
offline) and see if you hear static. If you hear static, your lines are<br/>
disrupted. In which case you either call the phone company and tell them to<br/>
repair your lines (which they are obligated to do bc you are paying for the<br/>
service of having decent lines) or check for sources of disruption. Running<br/>
your phone line (and cable modem lines/ethernet cables) through a surge<br/>
suppressor can disrupt it. You lines being too close to a power cord can<br/>
disrupt it. Make sure your monitor and computer power cords are not right<br/>
next to or touching your line.<br/>
Also, the speed of your processor and the amount of RAM you have on your<br/>
computer can affect the speed of your connection if you are using a<br/>
SoftModem/Winmodem (any modem that runs off of software rather than a<br/>
hardware chipset). Go to www.56k.com to look for your modem and see if it is<br/>
marked as a bad modem and/or check for updates in drivers for it. I found a<br/>
nice init string to keep my mother&#39;s Lucent Winmodem from disconnecting<br/>
every two minutes- which gave me time to download the new drivers for the<br/>
modem.<br/>
My ISP also mentioned a website called modemhelp.com but I haven&#39;t visited<br/>
it yet.<br/>
If you have windows XP try going to www.tweakxp.com it has all sorts of info<br/>
on how to make your computer run faster and get rid of unneccessary junk. I<br/>
think my father said there&#39;s another one called tweakui for different<br/>
operating systems but I haven&#39;t looked yet.<br/>
If you are able to get a new modem, I recommend the Zoom v92. It comes with<br/>
built in lightning protect and a 7 yr warrenty. I got mine for around $21.<br/>
Any new hardware you want to get you can search for at www.pricegrabber.com<br/>
It lists reviews of products as well as the stores selling them. I&#39;ve found<br/>
it extremely useful.<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
luv,<br/>
