&gt; Training points? That implies training which I didn&#39;t get. I&#39;ll back <br/>
&gt; track and see what I missed. My newbe weapon is a club. I haven&#39;t <br/>
&gt; been able to use it because it won&#39;t equip. Maybe that&#39;s because I <br/>
&gt; need hand-to-hand training to use it. I&#39;ll check that out. Thanks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The only reason you wouldn&#39;t be able to equip your newbie club is because you <br/>
already have something in your primary hand slot.  Did you put your worn candle <br/>
in that slot?<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to train any points to be able to equip a weapon.  And the club <br/>
uses 1 Hand Blunt skill, not Hand-to-Hand<br/>
