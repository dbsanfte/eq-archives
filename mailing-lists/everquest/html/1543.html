<div id="ygrps-yiv-776218865">It&#39;s a great thing to do...it helps with the overcrowding.  Being a Druid.<br/>
You can understand the nature of what happens when too many bears exist<br/>
without known predators.  So yes it is a good thing.  My suggestion is to<br/>
never put the furry friends out of their misery anywhere near the druid ring<br/>
or other bears.  They just won&#39;t understand how your are trying to help<br/>
them.  <br/>
<br/>
Try this...if you see a Young Kodiak....cast snare....Panic animal...hit em<br/>
in the butt with your stick (please no beastiality here...that ISN&#39;T helpful<br/>
for nature). and repeat as needed.<br/>

&gt; Subject:	[EverQuest] Druid question<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi, all.  I&#39;m relatively new to the list (been reading it for a month or<br/>
&gt; so, but I&#39;ve never posted before).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s my question:  My lvl 10 Druid is currently in EC and I desperately<br/>
&gt; want to start hunting bears, would this be a bad<br/>
&gt; thing for a Druid to do?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hest, lvl 10 Druid on Teris Thule<br/>
