<div id="ygrps-yiv-1397281207">Yeah, you&#39;ll like WC hunting at your level.  You can<br/>
solo or do a derv or orc group.  Befallen is cool when<br/>
you get a little more exp under your belt.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as being a newb goes, no worries.  Have fun,<br/>
its a game, and you are paying for it.  If others<br/>
don&#39;t like your style of play for whatever reason, who<br/>
cares?  There&#39;s several hundred thousand accounts<br/>
active out there.  Find someone else to play with :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hi<br/>
&gt; As a newb, its hard not to feel a little intimidated<br/>
&gt; by the <br/>
&gt; discussions here. I am in AWE of you people even<br/>
&gt; though I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; understand half of what you say. I long for the day<br/>
&gt; when I can talk <br/>
&gt; about the finer ponts of EQ like you guys. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For the moment I have a love/hate relationship with<br/>
&gt; EQ after playing <br/>
&gt; for about two months or so. Its a type of game I<br/>
&gt; have never <br/>
&gt; experienced before - I am totally fascinated and<br/>
&gt; mildly (well, at the <br/>
&gt; moment!) addicted. The game boths thrills and scares<br/>
&gt; me. I find <br/>
&gt; myself nervously approaching the PC every night<br/>
&gt; mentally preparing <br/>
&gt; myself for the dangers ahead. Once I&#39;m in, I am<br/>
&gt; immersed. GET THAT <br/>
&gt; LEVEL UP is my only goal.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I levelled 10 I knew that I was going to have<br/>
&gt; to deal with REAL <br/>
&gt; dying and corpse retrieval. Boy, that was - and<br/>
&gt; still is  - a <br/>
&gt; learning experience. The first few times I got so<br/>
&gt; depressed that I <br/>
&gt; vowed to give up and cancel my subscription. But I<br/>
&gt; crawled to lvl 11 <br/>
&gt; and am much more careful about conning.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; By nature I am not a team player so grouping is<br/>
&gt; still a bit alien to <br/>
&gt; me although I realise its the only fast way to get<br/>
&gt; xp. But too often <br/>
&gt; I find myself in groups that just gung ho for<br/>
&gt; everything in sight <br/>
&gt; hitting anything that moves (= Excelsis having to<br/>
&gt; retrive his corpse <br/>
&gt; ONCE more in some weird, out of the way loc).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can I ask you guys some questions? I reckon a 1/5<br/>
&gt; bub a night is <br/>
&gt; pretty average to aim for. That would lvl me up once<br/>
&gt; a week. Is that <br/>
&gt; the norm? How long did it take you in the beginning?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have tried to solo in Black Burrow but that is<br/>
&gt; well nigh impossible <br/>
&gt; on your own. Grouping is the only way but I HATE<br/>
&gt; that place so much <br/>
&gt; it makes me so nervous to go there. I am soloing in<br/>
&gt; West Kerana but <br/>
&gt; grizzly and giant spider spawns are pretty rare so I<br/>
&gt; spend a lot of <br/>
&gt; time hanging around and trying to avoid the bandits<br/>
&gt; (by the way, they <br/>
&gt; seem to be walking all over WK recently,  not just<br/>
&gt; around their huts. <br/>
&gt; Is this new?)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any advice and encouragement you can give me is<br/>
&gt; greatly appreciated. <br/>
&gt; I know I&#39;m not alone, but sometimes it feels as<br/>
&gt; though I am! I use <br/>
&gt; the English server Venril Sathir (I live in<br/>
&gt; Amsterdam) and sometimes <br/>
&gt; the zones are completely deserted. Is it like that<br/>
&gt; on the US servers <br/>
&gt; as well?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope to hear from some of you anyway, especially<br/>
&gt; your experiences and <br/>
&gt; feelings about EQ when you first started. I&#39;m off<br/>
&gt; again now to that <br/>
&gt; HUGE VAST world that we all know and love (and<br/>
&gt; sometimes hate...)<br/>
