<div id="ygrps-yiv-743116593">I don&#39;t play EQ for a couple weeks and I come back to find out my home town <br/>
has been overrun by FROGGIES... You know HOW MANY froggies I had ta eat <br/>
when I was a little troll? I&#39;m sick and tired of the things... Always <br/>
jumpin around, trying ta kill little trolls...Now they invade MY hometown. <br/>
My family has been ousted, made to eek out an existance collecting swamp <br/>
scum and snake oil.... I WILL exact my revenge! I now have a purpose!<br/>
<br/>
   The upside is, if I have to go to Neriak, there is a lot of dark meat <br/>
running around, and I&#39;ve got this new sauce I&#39;ve been meaning to try.... <br/>
This might not be so bad...<br/>
