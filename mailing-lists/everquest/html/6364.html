<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I did the digital download and the bonus was a free 
spirit shroud (a golem).&nbsp; I&#39;ve used it once, but the mechanical mount looks 
like the war piggies in Plane of Tactics.&nbsp; They had a big problem with 
people doing the monser missions.&nbsp; They were too easy and people were 
soloing them for AA xp.&nbsp; They&#39;ve nerfed them a bit now.&nbsp; And now it&#39;s 
like watching paint dry.&nbsp; they don&#39;t mvoe very quickly, and I&#39;m wondering 
if the amount of xp is worth the effort.&nbsp; Still, some of the drops are 
really decent.&nbsp; Frankly, I think Dragons of Norrath was a better expansion 
pack.&nbsp; They have overhauled the UI somewhat.&nbsp; Now you&#39;ve got 4 hotkey 
bars: 2 horizontal, and 2 vertical.&nbsp; You can customize all 4 of them in the 
Options window.&nbsp; A lot of people say it looks a lot like EQ2 now, but I 
dont think so.&nbsp; It basically looks similar to what it was, just more colors 
to contrast some of the data.&nbsp; Yadda Yadda.</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>The person who created the list quit EQ and left, but he 
  handed it over to me a couple years ago. So I can&#39;t take credit for making it. 
  And I have a moderator who handles most of the messages for me. :-) So I can&#39;t 
  take much credit for that.<br>But I am glad that people are joining and hope 
  that they enjoy it here.<br>To start a topic, has anyone received the new 
  expansion yet? I heard if you buy the box set you get a free mechanical 
  mount.<br>I also saw that the hotkey bar was changed to look more like the 
  setup in World of Warcraft.<br>Anyone else noticed 
  this?<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br>======= At 2005-11-01, 14:46:00 you wrote:
