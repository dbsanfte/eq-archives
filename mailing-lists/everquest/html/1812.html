initiates combat (This of course depends on zone/mobs).<br/>

&gt; I am not too crazy about using damage shields on very low level players to<br/>
&gt; help them power-level, because the newbie mobs often kill themselves on the<br/>
&gt; damage shields before you can even get in one damage point. When soloing,<br/>
&gt; you have to inflict at least one damage on a mob to get exp. for killing it.<br/>

&gt; I know I always hated it when a well-meaning druid would cast Shield of<br/>
&gt; Spikes or whatever on my newbie characters. Gray wolf, orc pawn, fire<br/>
&gt; beetle, bat, goblin whelp etc. -- attack, bingo dead time after time without<br/>
&gt; me getting exp for it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Skin and regen is much more helpful, as well as standing by and healing at<br/>
&gt; need.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My opinion only =)<br/>
