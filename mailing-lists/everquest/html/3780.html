<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741085169">What do you need the cash really for? Meaning, if you<br/>
made lots of cash then why not just find a place where<br/>
the exp is Excellent.  My attitude is you can always<br/>
make money in the higher levels.  Or take up a trade<br/>
like pottery and get your skill up to make things that<br/>
sell for good PP.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents...... I have a 32 druid and currently<br/>
hunt in the Overthere and I find the PP good as well<br/>
as the exp.  But I am grouping since lots of baddies<br/>
resist spells.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any ideas where I can go as a lvl 35 Druid to get a<br/>
&gt; good balance of <br/>
&gt; cash/loot and experience? Mostly I solo, as I am<br/>
&gt; usually in for an <br/>
&gt; hour at a time. Get in a few hours together now and<br/>
&gt; then, but for <br/>
&gt; short sessions getting a group consumes most of the<br/>
&gt; time available.<br/>
