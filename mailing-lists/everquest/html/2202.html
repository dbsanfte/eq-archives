<b>Subject:</b> RE: [EverQuest] Best soloing class <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631301643">At the high-end game, there is no class that can touch the shaman in<br/>
ability to singlehandedly take down big mobs, or even solo alot of small<br/>
ones.. A friend of mine, level 60 shaman, can easily solo dragons in<br/>
western wastes, not all of them of course, but a couple he can do of the<br/>
easier ones, I have also seen him solo level 50ish mobs 4 at a time in<br/>
various zones for exp. How does he do it? Well, forget clarity, shaman<br/>
cannibalise is ALOT better than clarity, and now he just got the<br/>
cannibalise class skill that came with luclin which gives him about 1750<br/>
mana for 2000 hitpoints in one single blow, skill is usable every 3<br/>
minutes.. Pair that up with Torpor and regular cannibalise 4 and you<br/>
have endless mana, he can go through 30,000 mana in a couple of minutes<br/>
when buffing a guildraid.. He just Malo&#39;s and slows the mobs, then has<br/>
his pet beat on it while he dots and nukes it while tanking it. I don&#39;t<br/>
think I have ever seen him OOM to this day..</div>
