<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032118806">Looks like I will spend the whole of level 33 sitting in a cave in <br/>
Warsliks Woods, hunting brutes. Need the hides for my tailoring. <br/>
Halfling tailor, Vale Armor. The exp is not great, but since I need <br/>
the hides anyway, it is working well.<br/>
<br/>
It is unfortunate that the Halfling cultural armor does not offer <br/>
that much in stats. I have replaced all of my armor which has not <br/>
been superior to the Vale armor, except next trip to Rivervale I need <br/>
to make leggings.<br/>
<br/>
I may try to sell some pieces in the Bazzaar, but don&#39;t think the <br/>
market is very good for that. Probably will make a few pieces to give <br/>
to young Halfling druids, then find my way to Velious to begin <br/>
aquiring pieces of fur for the Underhill bags.<br/>
<br/>
I think there will be a market for those.<br/>
