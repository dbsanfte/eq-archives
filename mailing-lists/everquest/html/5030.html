<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; After the last small patch, I couldn&#39;t get past the character select<br/>
&gt; screen either. I went into chat and asked the GM for help. He never<br/>
&gt; DID reply. But another player told me to right-click on my dial-up<br/>
&gt; connection, select properties. Then click on the &quot;Networking&quot; tab,<br/>
&gt; highlight &quot;QoS Packet Scheduler&quot; and uninstall it. This seemed to<br/>
&gt; work for me.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Speaking of bugs...<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was at the chat waiting for error 1018 to clear and the GM was<br/>
&gt; saying that<br/>
&gt; &gt; there is a known issue with dialup not letting people past<br/>
&gt; character select.<br/>
&gt; &gt; There are people with dialup accounts who haven&#39;t been able to<br/>
&gt; login for 2<br/>
&gt; &gt; months now.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m interested in hearing about other bug as well. I&#39;m thinking of<br/>
&gt; compiling<br/>
&gt; &gt; a list.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve never had to hail the NPC to turn in quest stuff, but I<br/>
&gt; usually did<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; make sure I had the NPC I was looking for. I&#39;d also say it could<br/>
&gt; be a bug,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but we all know there isn&#39;t any bugs in EQ.<br/>
