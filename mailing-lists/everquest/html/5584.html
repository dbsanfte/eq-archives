<div id="ygrps-yiv-1254667353">I had the same problem in one of the expansions<br/>
<br/>
This is what I did to fix it:<br/>
<br/>
1. Start the EQ patcher<br/>
2. Once its done with its patching, click on advanced <br/>
3. Click on complete file check.<br/>
<br/>
The game will then search the files, most likely find a couple that <br/>
were wrong, and the game should work fine from there.<br/>
<br/>
Past that you may want to try reinstalling the game, or contact <br/>
customer service.<br/>

&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just bought a new DELL computer for gaming.  When I played EQ <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; other day, I went to the OVERTHERE.  Instead of seeing the usual <br/>
&gt; creatures (succulents, rhinos, Sarnaks and tigers), I see only <br/>
&gt; various sizes of human men.  Now this computer is supposed to have <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; top line graphic card, so I&#39;m not sure how to adjust my settings <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; see the normal bestiary for this area.  Does anyone know what I <br/>
&gt; should adjust to get things back to normal?   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks.... </span></blockquote></div>
