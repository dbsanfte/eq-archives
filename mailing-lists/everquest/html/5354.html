<div id="ygrps-yiv-440629091">If you have Luclin you might want to kill Lesser Shades in shadeweaver&#39;s<br/>
thicket for shadeling silks and swirling shadows. swirling shadows are used<br/>
in smithing and sell pretty well. If you can take down Shak Dratha they drop<br/>
shade silk and condensed shadow (used in smithing to make arrowheads which<br/>
are used for high level fletching).<br/>
Also, hold on to low quality pelts and high quality pelts. Even medium<br/>
quality pelts. They are used in tailoring and pottery (lined poison vials<br/>
require quality pelts or zombie skins). You also might want to hold onto<br/>
gems you get if you ever want to do jewelcraft. Farming gems can save you<br/>
alot of coin.<br/>
