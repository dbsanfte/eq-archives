<div id="ygrps-yiv-1988624821">Many thanks everyone.<br/>
<br/>
The local computer store only had Planes of Power in stock and not Shadows<br/>
of Lucin, so that sorta decided for me.<br/>
Thanks for all your thoughts though.  I also don&#39;t like to be dependant on<br/>
wizzies or druids for travel as I play in a different time zone than most<br/>
other people on my server so I tend to only have 3-20 people in a zone at<br/>
once.... hence I do quite a bit of soloing.....<br/>
