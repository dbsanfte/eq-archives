<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] The boat to Kunark <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-423603977">If you are able to get to Oasis, you should be able to <br/>
take the Raft to TD to Ogre Island and pick up the boat <br/>
from ogre Island to OT.  Keep inmind if you are KoS at <br/>
the Outpost where the boat docks you will need to swim <br/>
to shore once the boat Zones in.<br/>
<br/>
just a little help that you might like to help you get <br/>
to Kunark the old fasioed slow way.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; The other day I decided that a trip to Kunark was in order for my <br/>
&gt; druid. I will be needing Brute hides, and so was ready to go and hunt <br/>
&gt; them. However, the shuttles in Butcherblock never met the boat. I <br/>
&gt; tried three times, three different shuttles, and they went out to <br/>
&gt; Timerous Deep, got close to the boat, then the boat left. The <br/>
&gt; shuttles just went back to BB.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That avenue being out, I returned to SK to pick off gnolls, and <br/>
&gt; forage Plains Pebbles. I almost have my bank tool box full of them. <br/>
&gt; have about eight to go. So, decided to stay there until I get the <br/>
&gt; rest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Plus I have been getting fs weapons from the gnolls, which I have <br/>
&gt; tried to make into another Vale Sewing Kit to sell.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope they get the boat fixed. For my first trip I want to do it the <br/>
&gt; old-fashioned way.<br/>
