<br>Yeah. Sometimes you group with the only people available though. Like in
<br>Highpass if you need in a group you&#39;re stuck with the people camping the
<br>room you want to camp.
<br>I&#39;ve had mostly good experiences with looting but there are a few people
<br>who&#39;ve given me trouble. One thing that pissed me off-- I was group leader
<br>and had alpha loot established. My computer crashed. When i logged back in
<br>there was a new group leader. Despite the fact that I had been at the spawn
<br>point first and had established the group, he felt that bc he had reinvited
<br>people that he was now in charge. He said it was FFA -- ninja loot.
<br>When I asked them to allow me to loot just once corpse he told me I could if
<br>I was fast enough. Often while I was busy healing him he&#39;d go loot
<br>something. When it was clear he didn&#39;t appreciate my help, I left. I mean, I
<br>need money to buy spells and stuff.
