I would have to agree with the &quot;NO WAY&quot; vote...I started as a brand <br/>
newbie before guild lobby was invented and it really sucks when ur <br/>
corpse is stuck at the bottom of a massive mob area and there is no <br/>
one around to come bail you out of the mess.  :(  <br/>

&gt; Hey Kids...Been gone awhile...been busy..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, in talking to my old EQ chums and with what I read on the <br/>
&gt; websites, there is/has been some talk about SOE making a &quot;classic&quot; <br/>
&gt; server.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now the &quot;classic&quot; server would be EQ prior to PoP, no adds or toys, <br/>
&gt; with the exception of the stuff necessary. This would mean no PoK, <br/>
no <br/>
&gt; Guild Lobby, etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Knowing that many of you have been here since around Beta or just <br/>
after <br/>
&gt; and that most of you can honestly say &quot; I remember when... or Back <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; the Day we had to run from X t Y and it was 4 day run....&quot;; I am <br/>
&gt; curious to know if any of you kids would use such a server, or have <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; all become stuck on how things are now that going back to the old <br/>
way <br/>
&gt; would kill the game for you?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As always, but now just plainly nosey..<br/>
