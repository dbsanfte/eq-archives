<div id="ygrps-yiv-94130565">I made it to lvl 2 delivering bardic mail but then realized I had to be able<br/>

How did you get money for CB pads if you weren&#39;t killing anythng?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; heh...I made a rogue purely from using CB pads/belts...he&#39;s now<br/>
&gt; level 7...hasn&#39;t killed a thing...and can&#39;t hit anything either<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1)  How does &quot;sneak&quot; work exactly?  Can I sneak across someone&#39;s line of<br/>
&gt; &gt; sight?  What is the difference between &quot;Sneak&quot; and &quot;Hide&quot; that comes<br/>
&gt; &gt; later?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; I know that with my iksar monk you can&#39;t sneak within someone&#39;s line<br/>
&gt; of sight<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2)  I do not yet have the &quot;Backstab&quot; ability.  Does it do me any good to<br/>
&gt; &gt; attack monsters from behind without the ability yet?  I have been making<br/>
&gt; &gt; an<br/>
&gt; &gt; effort to do just that, but should I not even bother?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; just good practice?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3)  I noticed that &quot;Disarm Traps&quot; is a later ability, but I cannot<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt; where and when this ability would come in handy?  And how do I know that<br/>
&gt; &gt; there is a trap around to disarm in the first place?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve heard we have two current traps in the game :&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sorry for being so naive, but thanks for any help.<br/>
