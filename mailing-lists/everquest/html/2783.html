&gt; This is the main problem I have with both powerleveling and<br/>
&gt; twinking.  There are points in the game where your role changes.  I<br/>
&gt; have been through 3 of them already.  If you don&#39;t play the lower<br/>
&gt; levels of your class you miss a valuable learning experience.<br/>

a whole lot in XP groups from 9-60.   The only huge difference for a Ranger<br/>
is that they have better soloing abilities starting at 22, increased<br/>
soloring abilities at 30, and a way to control aggro at 51.  Rangers *can*<br/>
tank in most XP zones from 1-60....they may not be as good as other classes<br/>
(and it&#39;s not as mana efficient for healers), but they can.  Outside of<br/>
that, the primary role of a ranger is dealing damage, snare, and keeping<br/>
mobs off the casters.</div>
