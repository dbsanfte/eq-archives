<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368200341">Great idea!  I had him run dxdiag already (we took this off list) and<br/>
nothing came up bad.  all passed.  After discussing it further, Justin<br/>
revealed that he has a new &quot;USB&quot; DSL modem.   After searching the MS<br/>
Knowledge base, found an article referring to Dinput8.dll and a conflict<br/>
with a USB device.  I suspect that you are waiting for  0-patch-thirty to<br/>
come so that you can try try again.<br/>
