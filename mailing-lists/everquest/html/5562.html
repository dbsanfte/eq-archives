  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">I love the Mano War song.&nbsp; That band always 
  gets me going!&nbsp; Some excellent shots&nbsp; in game.&nbsp; Some of those 
  things even I haven&#39;t seen yet.&nbsp; still working on it.&nbsp; As far as 
  some things to work on..&nbsp; Me personally, I had a very hard time reading 
  some of the captions in red as they came into the frame. I&#39;d suggest making 
  them in a different color, possibly contrasting it with the background.&nbsp; 
  For example, if the background is light, use a dark font color, and vice 
  versa. That was really the main thing.&nbsp; The other thing I wondered is if 
  it were possibly to import MPEG video into Flash, Here was my thought:&nbsp; I 
  have a video card with a TV out.&nbsp; I could easily play EverQuest while 
  connected to a standard TV and use a VCR to record the game play.&nbsp; Then I 
  have a video capture card with a video in port.&nbsp; I could then connect the 
  VCR to that and capture what I had recorded from EverQuest and save it as an 
  MPEG file.&nbsp; Then, if Flash can import MPEG files, maybe you could then 
  syncronize the music to the video so you get some &quot;live&quot; action fight scenes 
  in it.</font></div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">I have never used Flash before so I don&#39;t know if 
  it can be done.&nbsp; However, I have a few friends that do use it so I will 
  ask them and get back to you.</font></div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">But that&#39;d be my thoughts.&nbsp; Otherwise, it&#39;s 
  very kickass and stuff!</font></div>
