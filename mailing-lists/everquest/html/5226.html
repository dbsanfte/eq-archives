&gt; back to the wis caster.  The druid.  I think people<br/>
&gt; will choose a natural affinity for one type of<br/>
&gt; character over another.  I guess it depends on<br/>
&gt; personality sometimes, but I find the druid is the<br/>
&gt; easiest for me to play.  I don&#39;t know why.  It just<br/>
&gt; is.  I even played a rogue for nearly 40 levels<br/>
&gt; before I realized I got more enjoyment playing the<br/>
&gt; druid.  bards are probably one of the more difficult<br/>
&gt; characters to play becuase of their song weaving<br/>
&gt; abilities.  They have elements of both casters and<br/>
&gt; non caster classes.  Because of this they are one of<br/>
&gt; the most well rounded classes for all around<br/>
&gt; purposes.  So if you think your personality is such<br/>
&gt; that you can handle the difficulty of playing a<br/>
&gt; bard, then I&#39;d say go for it.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I would agree...playing a bard right off is not a<br/>
&gt; good idea.  I <br/>
&gt;   played a bard twice..and both chars have been<br/>
&gt; deleted....start off <br/>
&gt;   with a warrior or a cleric..work your way up to a<br/>
&gt; bard.<br/>
