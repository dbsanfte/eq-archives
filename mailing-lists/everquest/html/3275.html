<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906156301">Well, any exchange of accounts is forbidden by the terms of service. Part of<br/>
the reason for this is that the person buying the account may get swindled.<br/>
They may pay for the account only to find that the character is deleted or<br/>
the person changes passwords on them and so forth. I&#39;ve heard of this<br/>
happening. Or they may get an account that has many soulmarks for bad<br/>
behavior. Also, people who work for Verant and EQ have been invited to this<br/>
list. If they see the people advertising they are selling their accounts<br/>
here, they may bust the person who is trying to sell it.<br/>

&gt; I would like to remind people that anything that violates the terms of<br/>
&gt; service of EQ is not allowed on this mailing list. If you are trying to<br/>
&gt; sell<br/>
&gt; your account, please do not do it here.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If anyone wants this account, I am done with it. Time to try<br/>
&gt; &gt; something new. All expansions enabled.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Will take account trade, platnum, or items. Send email to<br/>
