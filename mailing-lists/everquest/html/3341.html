<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639651776"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Hi again everyone!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yesterday I was playing Genmay, my Gnome Warrior and I&#39;m using a<br/>
&gt; mace as my weapon. I kept getting a message saying something like my<br/>
&gt; will isn&#39;t right to command this weapon. What does that mean? That I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not able to use it or more specifically my class doesn&#39;t wield this<br/>
&gt; weapon as well as others? Heck I seemed to be kicking some butt with it<br/>
&gt; as my hits were ranking between 12-16 points each. Any ideas?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Someone may have answered already but I just got over 200 emails-- my<br/>
server&#39;s modem got fried a couple days ago and my power has been out. I went<br/>
into total withdrawal without electricity!<br/>
The thing about your will is that the effect of the weapon (in the<br/>
description it says Effect and maybe something like Velium Shards) will not<br/>
work until you are a higher level. It&#39;s called proccing. Your weapon will<br/>
proc when you get higher level.<br/>
