<div id="ygrps-yiv-108773132">Greetings  all and Happy Thanksgiving.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just uploaded more pics and created more galleries if you want to <br/>
have a <br/>
look:<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
If any of you have any more pics  from any of the events listed you <br/>
would <br/>
like me to add to thew galleries, please send them to me and I will <br/>
be happy <br/>
to add them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be posting more info on upcoming gigs and other cool projects on <br/>
my mailing list those interested can email me privately, but lately I <br/>
have been just busy getting equipment sorted out from TRF, and of <br/>
course, <br/>
teaching, and getinmg my armor and tack ready to begin riding again  <br/>
on the weekends, since <br/>
it is cool enough to start riding in full armor again. So be patient <br/>
if you <br/>
don&#39;t hear from me for a few days. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the cross post. This isnt a shameless plug so much as <br/>
letting people know what I&#39;ve been up to in case I havent responded <br/>
to email. I have been driving back and forth between Houston , <br/>
Plantersville and Austin and Splendora over the past two weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, Happy Turkey Day.<br/>
 Immer ritterlich,<br/>
