<div id="ygrps-yiv-968895615">The Night Elves are pretty damned ugly. At least they move more smoothly than the He-Man cartoons, and aren&#39;t quite as bad. Man, I lost my first tooth while watching He-Man..... *getting flashbacks*<br/>

Personally, I don&#39;t like the night elf graphics.  The ears are just way too big.  Makes them look more like goblins.  And the bodies look like they were drawn by the same people who did the He-Man cartoons.  But the scenery graphics in game are pretty good.<br/>
