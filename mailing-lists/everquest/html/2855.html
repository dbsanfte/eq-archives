<div id="ygrps-yiv-270451698">&quot;When is the last time you been to a GM event, or have seen a majot development to the story with new zones or changes in zones?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, I&#39;ve been to a gm event within the last few weeks and my RL girlfriend has been on 2 within the last month or month and a half. Perhaps you&#39;re just missing them?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;As many of you know Eq2 looks ok for the ps2.  does everyone know that the network adapter tfor the ps2 is $40 on top of who know s what fees for the isp?  If that wasn&#39;t bad engough.  What will the cost of EQ2 be?  I like EQ and will continue to play it on my computer but most likely not the ps2.  i have to afree the fraphics look carttonish and I like the ones on the pc myself&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Umm, you&#39;re just a bit confused here. EQ2 (pc) and EQ Online adventures (PS2) are two different games. The PS2 one is set 500 years in the past, whereas EQ2 will be set 500 yrs or so in the future of the current EQ. The EQ2 graphics in NO way look cartoonish and will be (so far) require a GF3.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to set some facts straight. Have a good day! )<br/>
