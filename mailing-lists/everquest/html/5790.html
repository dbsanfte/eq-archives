<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Lag Issues <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-640557324">Well, I don&#39;t know about Feerrott, but I seem to get<br/>
lag issues after I&#39;ve had my computer running without<br/>
a reboot for a while. And it can happen in zones that<br/>
had no lag before. I&#39;ve not really tried to fix it<br/>
(other than rebooting).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m just wondering if anyone else has been<br/>
&gt; experiencing an inordinate amount of lag lately?  I<br/>
&gt; mean more than you usually get, even in zones that<br/>
&gt; are unpopulated.  For example, whenever I port to<br/>
&gt; the Feerrott, I start lagging immediately, and then<br/>
&gt; if I port out, the lag gets even worse, as if I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; carrying it with me.  But I had absolutely no lag<br/>
&gt; before I zoned itno Feerrott.  So I&#39;m wondering if<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s something about that zone?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And before you say it&#39;s my computer system, I am<br/>
&gt; running a Pentium 4 1.8Ghz with 1 GB of RAM, and a<br/>
&gt; 128MB ATI Radeon 9200 video card.  I also have a<br/>
&gt; cable modem connection.  And as I said, there&#39;s no<br/>
&gt; lag until I zone into Feerrott.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Before you ask if I have anything running in the<br/>
&gt; background, I use this system for nothing but<br/>
&gt; Everquest, so I have already gone ahead and shut<br/>
&gt; down all the background programs.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Before you ask if I have checked EQ&#39;s knowledgebase,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve already done everythign they&#39;ve reccomended and<br/>
&gt; it hasn&#39;t solved the problem.  One thing I did find<br/>
&gt; out was that certain zones will lag becasue on ATI<br/>
&gt; cards there&#39;s an option for Wait For Vertical Sync,<br/>
&gt; and they reccomend setting it to Off.  So I did<br/>
&gt; this, but now I&#39;m getting lag in EVERY zone so I<br/>
&gt; really don&#39;t think that&#39;s it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And before you ask if I have updated to the latest<br/>
&gt; video drivers, I did that when I found out about the<br/>
&gt; Vertical Sync issue.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As you can probably tell, I&#39;m not without some<br/>
&gt; troubleshooting knowledge, but I&#39;ve done everything<br/>
&gt; I can think of, and the problem is still persisting.<br/>
&gt;  The one clue I have is that the problem didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; start happening until after last patch.  So I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know if that has anything to do with it.  I thought<br/>
&gt; I would check and see if anyone else is having this<br/>
&gt; problem.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
