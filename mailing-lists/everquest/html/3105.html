<b>Subject:</b> Good news for Halfling tailors <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891475698">The required hq ore was a rare drop from a rare spawn in Runnyeye. <br/>
Now the pieces can be chiselled off a small block of hq ore, a drop <br/>
in Permafrost. So, I have been beating up gobs in Permafrost and <br/>
taking their stuff. However, no ore yet.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know how rare this drop is? Alakhazam said Ice Goblins drop <br/>
the stuff. Only Ice Goblins, or any Ice Goblin tribe mob? I have been <br/>
beating up any greens near the entrance, since I am solo there most <br/>
of the time and it gets ugly in there.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I put in a little time there, then go out for some exp <br/>
kills to balance my game.<br/>
<br/>
The new cultural tailoring stuff is great. I am working on getting my <br/>
Vale sewing kit before lvl 34. Then I will have to split my time <br/>
between Kunark and Velious to get exp plus materials for tailoring. <br/>
Some components will depend on my Gnome Mage, which I am glad I <br/>
created even before the changes.<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t keep up on all the new skills, items and quests. So much to do, <br/>
so little time.<br/>
