&gt; Another class that might be good is shadowknight. The drawbacks: <br/>
Good races<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t want to sell to you and some may even want to kill you. If <br/>
you play a<br/>
&gt; darkelf the newbie grounds completely and totally suck but you get <br/>
pretty<br/>
&gt; cool armor when you can manage to find all the stuff you need for <br/>
it. People<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t think of shadowknights when they think of tanks. They don&#39;t <br/>
often<br/>
&gt; invite them to group. I don&#39;t think they get the spell &quot;gate&quot;.<br/>
&gt; The bonuses: You make a decent tank, you can summon a pet to tank <br/>
for you<br/>
&gt; while you med, you can lifetap to heal yourself, and you get a <br/>
spell that<br/>
&gt; snares and dots a mob at the same time. You can solo alot and are a <br/>
good<br/>
&gt; asset to a group. Way later in the game you get to summon your own <br/>
horse<br/>
&gt; called an Unholy Steed.<br/>
&gt; My brother started a shadowknight and got him to lvl 35 in 8 days.<br/>
