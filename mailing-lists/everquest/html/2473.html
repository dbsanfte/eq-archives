<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180505533"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;geforce 1 system performs the same as the ge-force2 system. so maybe u<br/>

  That&#39;s great. But considering he was asking about upgrading from a TNT2, not the original GF, it doesn&#39;t answer his question.<br/>
<br/>
  Yes, you will see an improvement from the TNT2. I&#39;m assuming, since you said it&#39;s a 32 MB pci GF2, you are refering to the GF2 MX 200. To be honest tho, save up the extra $10-15 and get the GF2 MX 400 which has 64MB. You&#39;ll be happier with the results.  Also look into getting at least 256MB of system ram.<br/>

 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I&#39;ve searched all over and have been unable to find a pci GF3. If he really has one, I&#39;d be interested in where he got it from. None of the numerous manufacturers I&#39;ve checked have made them as pci.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s true that the prices might drop a bit more, as not all the GF4 versions have come out yet. I saw on the visiontek site that the GF4 MX versions (which are just revamped GF2 MXs) were listed as agp/pci. Unfortunately, after hours of searching around, I found plenty of the agp versions but not the pci. It could be they will be released in the future, but who knows.<br/>
