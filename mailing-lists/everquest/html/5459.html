 </span></blockquote>Not entirely true seems.....I&#39;ve seen a bunch of people with the surname<br/>
Everlost (my friend chose that one then realized how many there were) and I<br/>
know they are not the same person or same account.  Seems you can get a<br/>
surname that someone else has it just has to be approved.</div>
