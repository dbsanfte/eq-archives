Just to update.. I am currently in the cable company.. they are doing <br/>
1-10mb per minute.. manage to download WHOLE EQ, took up 2.741gig <br/>
(somehow eq resize most sounds from GoD from a bigger files to <br/>
smaller ones, perhaps to ease the lag).. EQ full install with patch, <br/>
goes down from 2.79 to 2.74gig..<br/>
<br/>
All&#39;s well but this time not ends well.. as those files downloaded <br/>
using patch, didnt shown the date.. I mean the eqfeartintros.pak <br/>
shown it as a feb 2004 files, some like ldonequip file shown as a <br/>
2003 files.. so, our initial plan to JUST copy the 76/150mb file to <br/>
ONE cd has become moot, as we do NOT know which files had been d/led <br/>
by the patch (GRR should had just carry my PC with my harddisk along, <br/>
but the cable staff was saying that my pc might not have network lan <br/>
card)..<br/>
<br/>
Short version is.. from network pc no 12 to transfer to pc no 1 that <br/>
has burning cd drive.. I had to separate the EQ folder that has <br/>
2.74gig files into 5/6 separate folders and then transfer EACH of <br/>
that folder to pc no 1 so that Nero could read and then burn every <br/>
one of that disc. Currently transferring folder no 1 to pc no 1 and <br/>
it took roughly 30min for 600+mb.. estimation time of finish would be <br/>
3-6 hours and the thought of going back to my home and bringing my pc <br/>
back to the cable center then do the 2 hours round trip, not counting <br/>
the downloading time that might took 4 hours then.. then..<br/>
<br/>
GRR another frustated hobbit..</div>
