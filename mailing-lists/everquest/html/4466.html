<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605795738">I have two totally unrelated questions I need some help with.<br/>
<br/>
First, I could have sworn I read somewhere that there is a way to raisse one of your skills past 200, even if you already are a GM of some other skill?  I thought I had read it was something with an AA point, but now I can&#39;t find where I read it at, LOL. My main is 191 skill in Baking.  I plan on taking her to 250...but I also want to do Tailoring with her.  She is a Halfling, and I am interested in making the Haversack 100% WR bags also.  If this is not possible (to GM two different skills) I may just keep Baking at 200, and go forward with GM Tailoring, as that probably would hold a better profit, just in the bags, alone.<br/>
<br/>
Second, I was reading on Caster&#39;s Realm, under the Warrior section, and it lists a Discipline called Resistance at Level 30.  Problem is, when I type in /resistance, it says invalid command.  Am I doing something wrong, is that not the command for it?  I have tried my /shield command, and that works fine.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone can help with these, I would greatly appreciate it!  Thanks...and I hope everyone is having a good week so far!<br/>
