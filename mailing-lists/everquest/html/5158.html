I don&#39;t mind helping you out.  If you want, send me an email to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:wulftech@...">wulftech@...</a> and we can set up details from there.  I don&#39;t think<br/>
compensation&#39;s necessary.<br/>

Subject: [EverQuest] Looking for some volunteers<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
This is an odd request, but I am looking for some Everquest players that<br/>
wouldn&#39;t mind being interviewed either by IM, phone, or if practical in<br/>
person. I<br/>
am a graduate student at the Institute of Design at Illinois Institute of<br/>
Technology in Chicago. For one of my classes, entitled Observing Users, we<br/>
have to study a product and its users. Our group chose Everquest because we<br/>
think that it is very interesting and complex. As a retired online gamer I<br/>
know<br/>
how much fun and involving the games can be. In fact, I am very tempted to<br/>
jump into Everquest, but I am worried that I may lose concentration on my<br/>
studies. If anyone is willing to devote a little of their time to helping us<br/>
out we<br/>
would really appreciate it. Unfortunately, we are poor grad students and<br/>
will<br/>
not be able to compensate anyone who helps us out, but we will very very<br/>
thankful. Thanks<br/>
<br/>
