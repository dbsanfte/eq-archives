<div id="ygrps-yiv-852189106"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I tried pottery myself, I ran my ass off and I am quite fast with the<br/>
&gt;mouse clicking items around, and I never got more than 40p per hour,<br/>
&gt;which means that I make more money fighting things with my level 23<br/>
&gt;paladin. But sure, you can &quot;cheat&quot; like this, I imagine that if you &gt;have <br/>
&gt;the patience, you can be wearing steel plate and wield a well &gt;balanced <br/>
&gt;sword within a month of a new server opening, with a level &gt;10 character.. <br/>
&gt;But the pottery you would have to do would take SOOO &gt;much time.. It will <br/>
&gt;bore you to death not to mention give your &gt;fingers cramps.. ;) I estimate <br/>
&gt;if you do it well you can have full &gt;set of steel plate and a wb sword in <br/>
&gt;about 75 realtime hours of &gt;pottery.. If you really want to &quot;cheat&quot; like <br/>
&gt;this, and spend the time &gt;required to do it, I feel VERY sorry for you.. ;) <br/>
&gt;But then again &gt;there are those that play over 10h per day(I feel sorry for <br/>
&gt;them &gt;already;), they can be wearing this set of nice items in about a week <br/>
&gt; &gt;and a half..<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I myself have used pottery to help work up my smithing skills, after having <br/>
sunk over 300p into it without using ANY trade skills at all. So I can <br/>
understand how easy it is to use, and the temptation to abuse it. What I&#39;ve <br/>
found is happening now, is that players are forming super &quot;twink&quot; guilds; <br/>
they all learn pottery, and then work up their cash. Now as you said, for an <br/>
example 75 hours of pottery, is now cut to 7.5 hours. Now just imagine a <br/>
larger guild which is pretty common - say 20 to 30 members. You just cut it <br/>
down to 2.5 to 3.5 hours each. In no time whatsoever, you&#39;ll have a massive <br/>
army of &quot;twinks&quot; that could quite possibly mow down most things (within <br/>
reason mind you - I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll be taking on giants and dragons!) if <br/>
they group rush and gaining levels quickly. With this in mind, I&#39;d be <br/>
perfectly happy just to break even, rather than make a profit off of a trade <br/>
skill. After all, Verant put them there for us to use wheter it was <br/>
forethought or afterthought. But truthfully, who wants to use a trade skill <br/>
which at the moment, has little to no real value/use and that costs you both <br/>
time and money ingame? Very few will endeavor to take on such a task.</div>
