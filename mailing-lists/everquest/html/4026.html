<div id="ygrps-yiv-880082336">Hey, I live in California. I live in one of the most temperate areas <br/>
of California. We have almost no weather. Pretty much short sleeve to <br/>
sweater weather year round. So, two days ago, first rains in almost <br/>
forever. Power goes out. Now this is the beginning of my days off. No <br/>
EQ. Dark. No stereo. No TV, even with two unwatched Netflix sitting <br/>
on the DVD player. Whisked back to the 18something-or-others.<br/>
<br/>
Yet it was kind of fun. Hanging out with the family. Just relaxing. <br/>
Doing (literally) nothing. Drank a few more beers than I would if I <br/>
could game, but other than that, it was kind of nice.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the power comes back on, and where am I? Sitting at my <br/>
computer, catching up on email and trying to figure out where I can <br/>
go in EQ with a few beers in me, and not get very dead.<br/>
<br/>
Life in the twenty first century.<br/>
