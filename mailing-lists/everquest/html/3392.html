<div id="ygrps-yiv-119383650"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Got on in the bazaar at a good time, with few enough people that the<br/>
&gt; lag was not terminal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Cool!<br/>

&gt; Buy a trader satchel, load it up. Find a spot on one of the trading<br/>
&gt; platforms. You cannot trade if you are not on a platform. Type /trade<br/>
&gt; and set your prices. Hit List Items so others can scan the list. Now<br/>
&gt; either sit there and chat or afk and do something else.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How much do the satchel&#39;s cost? How many slots does it hold? Do you have to<br/>
buy it more than once? What if you already have 8 containers?<br/>
Hmm.. Good advice. :-)<br/>

&gt; I sold for an hour, but no buyers. Then I scanned the shopping list<br/>
&gt; and found a hq brute hide for 5pp. Seemed a good deal, so I bought<br/>
&gt; it, banked, and logged.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sweet! I had a lvl 60 offering me like 25 to 30pp per Brute hide I found for<br/>
him. :-)<br/>
So 5pp is a very good deal.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; This is a fabulous setup once you get it set up. Find a spot on the<br/>
&gt; platform and your toon can sell all day while you work or sleep. Just<br/>
&gt; the thing when you actually want to eat in real life. A real meal, I<br/>
&gt; mean, not just gamer food.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL. Would help if I could cook I guess. Mom&#39;s out of town so I have been<br/>
eating cold leftovers and junk food. If I wasn&#39;t so lazy I&#39;d actually make<br/>
some raman or something.<br/>
luv,<br/>
