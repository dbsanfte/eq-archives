<font face="Arial" size="2">I&#39;d have to ask 
where you heard/saw this information.&nbsp; Can you provide a link for 
us?<br><br>All the expansions prior to Planes of Power are commonly referred to 
as Legacy.&nbsp; This includes classic EQ (the original game), Ruins of Kunark, 
Scars of Velious, and Shadows of Luclin.&nbsp; The level cap back then was only 
level 50.&nbsp; Epic weapons and the Iksar race were introduced with Ruins of 
Kunark and the Nexus and the Vah Shir race was introduced with Luclin 
(obviously).&nbsp; <br><br>A lot of people have often suggested SOE should 
release a Legacy version of EverQuest for those hard core gamers that want to 
get back to the way it used to be.&nbsp; Use the new XML UI with the old classic 
EQ expansions.&nbsp; I&#39;d hazard to think they should still probably keep some of 
the newer ideas though such as AA skills, group leadership ooints, raid 
leadership points. <br><br>That&#39;s just my two cents.&nbsp; I&#39;d still like to 
hear more about it if what you say is actually the 
case.<br><br>Wulfric<br><br><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> ----- Original Message ----- <br>From: Shawn
