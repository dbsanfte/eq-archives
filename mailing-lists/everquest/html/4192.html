<div id="ygrps-yiv-378077899">I guess what I dream about in a machine is one that will let me run <br/>
EQ with everything turned on, and use anti-aliasing. That is a very <br/>
fast, memory loaded machine on the new Radeon ubercard. With multiple <br/>
hard drives in a RAID array.<br/>
<br/>
Those machines begin at about $5000. Now I don&#39;t mind driving my <br/>
Hundai Accent a few more years, and paying for such a machine. <br/>
However, my wife may object, as well as some of those who wait each <br/>
month for a piece of my paycheck.<br/>
<br/>
Now if I drop the wife and family, move into a very cheap studio <br/>
apartment, within walking distance of work, I could have my machine <br/>
with no trouble at all. But I kind of like the family, so I will <br/>
still dream. Perhaps, someday.<br/>

pre-Luclin.  It&#39;s only when they souped up the game engine for better <br/>

virtually no lag on zones that existed prior to Luclin.  There is <br/>
still lag on Luclin, but I can turn the clip plane down to nil and <br/>
turn off spell effects (which are annoying anyway) and get almost no <br/>
lag at all.   However, same system specs with a 64MB video card and  <br/>
was getting major lag in Bazaar.  Now it&#39;s pretty smoothe.  I plan on <br/>
upgrading the processor to a 1Ghz or better next month so I am sure <br/>
even Bazaar will be fine.<br/>

flawless.  <br/>

&gt;   I&#39;m also running Win ME with 384 megs of ram. It&#39;s slowing down <br/>
 </span></blockquote>now, due to the fact that my processor is just a Celeron 400 and is 3 <br/>
years old (time for an upgrade) but ME has done fine. I can&#39;t <br/>
remember the last time I got the blue screen of death. I might <br/>
eventually upgrade to XP Pro (Home edition doesn&#39;t play games very <br/>
well), but ME is doing just fine for me now.</div>
