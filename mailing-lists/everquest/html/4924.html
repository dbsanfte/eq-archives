I&#39;m still relatively new to EQ, but so far I love it.  I agree about <br/>
corpse runs, they bite.  I think the idea about the NPC and buying <br/>
back your corpse has potential but needs refinement.  As far as <br/>
tradeskills go, I have been working up my first tradeskill <br/>
(Fletching as I am a ranger).  I am actually have pretty good <br/>
success with it.  I&#39;ve gotten it to 120 (making THOUSANDS of arrows) <br/>
and I&#39;m to the point now where I can make pretty good arrows.  I <br/>
partner with a fellow guildmate (cleric) to sell them in the bazaar, <br/>
because I&#39;m using a dial-up connection :( and can&#39;t really set up a <br/>
trader to run as much as he does.  We sell the arrows for 1pp a <br/>
piece and split the money 50/50.  I pay for all the supplies, but I <br/>
would anyway to level my fletching.  We&#39;re doing okay.  Recently we <br/>
sold 450 arrows made 450 pp, my cut was 225 pp, and it cost me <br/>
approx 125 pp to buy supplies.  It&#39;s not a huge money maker, but it <br/>
allows me to buy the next flight up of materials for increasing my <br/>
skill.  Bows are the other aren&#39;t going as well.  It hurts to pay <br/>
25pp for materials and then fail :(.</div>
