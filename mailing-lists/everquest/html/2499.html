I have a Druid level 15.<br/>

You can go to sites like Alakazam and Everlore.com to<br/>
find Great info without someone leading you by the<br/>
hand.  It gives pointers and ideas which should help<br/>
you build a character.<br/>
<br/>
Be careful in Kelethin since it is a hard area to<br/>
learn.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you need to hunt.  The only way you will level.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and if you choose Druzzil , let me know<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>

&gt; Ok..i have decided my new character will probably be<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; Wood Elf Druid, i think i have her name picked out<br/>
&gt; (even a last name should i EVER get that far..lol)<br/>
&gt; Not<br/>
&gt; sure what server i will play on yet but....my<br/>
&gt; question<br/>
&gt; is, is there anywhere i can read about what i should<br/>
&gt; do first as a new character and yadda, yadda,<br/>
&gt; yadda....See the problem with my boyfriend being<br/>
&gt; experienced in the game is that he did it ALL for<br/>
&gt; me,<br/>
&gt; or led me around by the collar doing it all for me<br/>
&gt; :-P...i want to do this on my own and have no idea<br/>
&gt; where to start...Do i just jump out there and start<br/>
&gt; killing critters or run around and hope i can find<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; way back from wherever i leave??  i know i sound<br/>
&gt; foolish but it is really important to do this on my<br/>
&gt; own..how else can one really learn??  Help is great<br/>
&gt; and i really do appreciate it but i also want to<br/>
&gt; feel<br/>
&gt; like i have accomplished something personally...Does<br/>
&gt; that make sense...<br/>
