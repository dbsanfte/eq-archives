<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001233809">Yes I remember this happening. I was playing D&D at the time and when <br/>
the story came out all the parents freaked out. We litterally had to <br/>
hide our D&D stuff from our parents. This is an age old debate <br/>
whenther or not violence in TV, games, movies, ect cause violence. <br/>
Personally I believe that no they don&#39;t. The problem is already there <br/>
in the persons mind. Really, think about it. If those mediums did <br/>
cause it then why don&#39;t we have more people going around squirting <br/>
others with water hoses? (Refrence to Super Mario Sunshine)<br/>
