&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hello all,  I am a brand newbie, and am wondering if there are any <br/>
&gt; other dwarf Pally&#39;s out there.  and if so, what are the important <br/>
&gt; quests for low level.....Thanks<br/>

the newbie area.  Never fear you don&#39;t have to stay there forever.<br/>
<br/>
You are in luck. They added armor quests to the dwarf city recently.  Go <br/>
  back to your guildhall (the room you started in should be your guild) <br/>
and hail NPCs until one of them answers you and part of the answer is in <br/>
brackets [...]  repeat the bracketed words to them as a question.  For <br/>
example, somebody says &#39;We have been having trouble with [orcs]&#39;, you <br/>
say, &#39;What orcs?&#39; to get them to continue with the script.  If you find <br/>
the right one for your class you will get a box of some sort and a bunch <br/>
of patterns or molds, not sure of specifics for your class, write down <br/>
everything the NPC tells you to get and how to combine the stuff to get <br/>
your armor.  If you want a full suit, it will take some time but during <br/>
that time you will make a lot experience.<br/>
<br/>
You can try looking up the quests on the eqtraders.com quests page <br/>
www.eqtraders.com/quests/quests.htm<br/>
<br/>
What server do you play on and what is your game name?  I&#39;m sure someone <br/>
on this list may be able to help you out some in-game with more playing <br/>
tips.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
<br/>
