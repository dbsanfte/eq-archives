I think Taunt falls under the category of a doability.  Here is a definition from a website I use:<br/>\n<br/>\n/doability # - Causes player to perform the special ability specified by number. For example, if Lay On Hands if your characters 4th ability (1-6 are the 6 general abilities, while 7-10 are the 4 combat abilities besides Melee and Ranged.), /doability 4 would perform the Lay on Hands.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, a taunt macro could go like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n/g Taunting %t onto me<br/>\n/doability 7(or whatever number it ends up being)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe /g tells your group what you are doing.  The /doability # performs the taunt.  It should work.  Good luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, here is a site one of my bard friends Tallies keeps up that has lots of good information:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqcommands.htm\">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqcommands.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWatch out for word wrap when you click the link.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobiinton Masterhealer<br/>\nPiemur Draggonsinger<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">  ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nMessage: 2<br/>\n   Date: Mon, 7 May 2001 17:19:21 -0400<br/>\n   From: &quot;The Mad Macinchaote&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scendera@...\">scendera@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Use macros to communicate(was About loot order)<br/>\n<br/>\nCan that be done with taunt? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
