(in game money--not money from you) <br/>\nIf you need to purchase armour there are now alot of new armour quests <br/>\nfor new players or you can pop into the Bazaar in Plane of Knowledge <br/>\nand buy something there.  <br/>\nHope to see on Maelin :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nTartracheon <br/>\nWraiths of Discord <br/>\nMaelin Starpyre Rules...lolol <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;lindamiddleton_99&quot; <br/>\n&lt;lindamiddleton@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lots of products to choose from.
