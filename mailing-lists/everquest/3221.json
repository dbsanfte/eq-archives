Weapon skill has a major \n  effect on your attack abilities. The maximum skill you can have in a weapon \n  type I think is Level * 5 + 5, so the highest skill you could have in 1hs at \n  level 11 is 60 which is much higher than the 25 you currently have. Generally \n  you should try to get your skills up in all available&nbsp;weapon types as you \n  might get your hands on something really nice and you will want to have at \n  least some ability with it. So yeah you should alternate between the weapon \n  types and try to be good at each one.</font></div>\n  <div>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div>----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\">\n    <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rlebeau65@...\" title=\"rlebeau65@...\">Rob \n    LeBeau</a> </div>\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Wednesday, July 10, 2002 7:35 \n    AM</div>\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> [EverQuest] Warrior and skills \n    question</div>\n    <div><br></div><tt>Ok, I have a level 11 warrior and would like \n    your<br>opinion on the following:<br><br>I started wondering why I was not \n    hitting that much<br>with him even though he has a good weapon. After \n    some<br>research, I found that the reason I am not hitting as<br>much as \n    others is because I have been switching<br>between 2HS and 1HS weapons to \n    increase the skills of<br>each attribute.&nbsp; <br><br>Example: My skill in \n    both is 25, let&#39;s say and my<br>attack is at like 152.&nbsp; If I were to \n    just use 1HS<br>let&#39;s say, my ATK rating would be like close to \n    300.<br><br>I have proved this because now that I am using the 1HS<br>more, \n    the skill is close to 30 and my ATK rating is<br>close to 200 where with a \n    2HS weapon, it is still at<br>152.<br><br><br>Would you continue to \n    alternate both weapon types or<br>would you just pick one and go with \n    it?<br><br>THanks<br><br>__________________________________________________<br>Do \n    You Yahoo!?<br>Sign up for SBC Yahoo!
