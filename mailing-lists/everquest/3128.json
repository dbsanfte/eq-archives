When it is good it is very, very <br/>\ngood. When it is bad, it sucks.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the most part, it is nice to be free of wires. This one is radio, <br/>\nnot infra-red. Not bad, until it runs out of juice when you are doing <br/>\nsomething important. Don&#39;t forget to put it in it&#39;s docking station <br/>\nto recharge.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t put it in the docking station with care, it calls up a <br/>\nhelp window. That is a pain, since the screen saver and monitor shut <br/>\noff don&#39;t seem to want to work while the help window is open. A <br/>\nlittle care prevents this, but what a pain.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe up side is that you can re-arrange your gaming hardware <br/>\nconfiguration to suit your tastes without worrying about the mouse <br/>\ncable. This wireless stuff may be rather nice once the bugs are <br/>\nworked out.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
