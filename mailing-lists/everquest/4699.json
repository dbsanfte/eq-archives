In regards<br/>\n&gt; to the PoP and LoY Expansions - each of these<br/>\n&gt; expansions have some of the<br/>\n&gt; best utilities in all of Everquest. I couldn&#39;t live<br/>\n&gt; without these utilities<br/>\n&gt; ever again.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The PoP has teleporting stones throughout all the<br/>\n&gt; lands. There is no real<br/>\n&gt; need to wait on ports or even pay for a port unless<br/>\n&gt; these is no Plane of<br/>\n&gt; Knowledge Stone anywhere around, 1 or 2 zones away.<br/>\n&gt; Levels 1 through 65 can<br/>\n&gt; use the stones.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The LoY expansion released on screen maps. You can<br/>\n&gt; zoom in and out. You can<br/>\n&gt; look at all of Felwithe or just the platform and hut<br/>\n&gt; you are standing on.<br/>\n&gt; All my maps have the name of the class GM listed<br/>\n&gt; where he is located. Really<br/>\n&gt; no reason to get lost anymore. I would say 90% of<br/>\n&gt; the zones have maps. Maps<br/>\n&gt; have succor locations. You can modify each zone map<br/>\n&gt; to mark key locations<br/>\n&gt; and spawn points.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure how long ago you played, but travel has<br/>\n&gt; been one of the very<br/>\n&gt; low points for me. I can remember waiting on the<br/>\n&gt; boat in Butcher Block many<br/>\n&gt; times, thinking there has to be a better way - this<br/>\n&gt; is not fun. Well travel<br/>\n&gt; is longer a task that takes you forever. These 2 key<br/>\n&gt; EQ tools were well<br/>\n&gt; worth the cash in and of itself in my onion. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: \tinflamatory890 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jjjdaniel@...\">jjjdaniel@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tSunday, June 01, 2003 6:30 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\t[EverQuest] WinXP and Sound Blaster (live)<br/>\n&gt; music (midi)<br/>\n&gt; problems.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; First I hope this group is for the PC version of<br/>\n&gt; Everquest. I quit <br/>\n&gt; about a year and a half ago when I upgraded to<br/>\n&gt; Windows XP. I have a <br/>\n&gt; Sound Blaster Live (value) card. I had the Shadows<br/>\n&gt; of Luclin <br/>\n&gt; expansion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The sound effects and ambient sounds were good, but<br/>\n&gt; the music was <br/>\n&gt; horribly distorted. I did the usual card driver<br/>\n&gt; updates with XP and <br/>\n&gt; posted to the Vault and other fan sites. Others with<br/>\n&gt; XP and this <br/>\n&gt; sound card had the same problem. EQ support emailed<br/>\n&gt; me back a <br/>\n&gt; response that they were aware and were working on<br/>\n&gt; the problem.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Before I consider coming back, I was wondering if<br/>\n&gt; anyone had similar <br/>\n&gt; problems and were they solved with the current, new<br/>\n&gt; expansion I <br/>\n&gt; believe is called &quot;Planes of Power&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d hate to invest in the expansion to discover I<br/>\n&gt; still can&#39;t have <br/>\n&gt; the music specific to areas within the zones. Any<br/>\n&gt; feedback would be <br/>\n&gt; appreciated.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
