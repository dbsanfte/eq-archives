Consider this: If I make a character, I should have two options for making my character better. One option is getting out there and hacking down some monsters to gain experience, treasure, and increase in skills. On the other hand, I should be able to just sit around, increase my trade skills, and as that goes up, be able to bring in some decent money. If I spend 3 hours of play time working on my trade skills, and making items to sell, as opposed to 3 hours hacking monsters, why shouldn&#39;t I get something comperable? <br/>\nIf that were the case, you&#39;d have only a small amount of people really taking advantage of it, since adventuring gives you better character advancement, and items, rather then just a single skill getting better, and some money; and because most people don&#39;t want to sit around crafting arrows all day. <br/>\nMy argument is really about making money. Adventuring is what this game is all about, but killing things shouldn&#39;t be the only way. It&#39;d be great for my situation, because of the limited hours I can play it&#39;s hard to form a group and go adventuring, so I have to solo a lot. But right now I have 4 characters at 5th level, and it&#39;s hard getting to the next step without a group. If I could spend a few days making some money to better equip myself, it would be a lot easier.<br/>\nAnyway, that&#39;s my two cents. Let me know what you all think!<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDarwyn Darkwynd<br/>\nChampion of the Faydark<br/>\nBertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGet your FREE Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mailcity.lycos.com\">http://mailcity.lycos.com</a><br/>\nGet your PERSONALIZED START PAGE at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://my.lycos.com\">http://my.lycos.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
