I have some of<br/>\n&gt; the components to do the Scourge Knight Armor Quest (found out that<br/>\n&gt; this is what the Klicnick Warrior bile sack and Decaying Skull is<br/>\n&gt; for). I have read that doing this quest can screw up faction with the<br/>\n&gt; Qeynos Guards. Is this true? I kinda enjoy being about to go to the<br/>\n&gt; Qeynos vendors above ground without being KOS :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Enie Erudite Enchanter/Quellious 12<br/>\n&gt; Lorlei Human Shadow Knight/Bertoxx 9<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at http://www.everquest.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
