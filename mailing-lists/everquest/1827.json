I personally find the whole power leveling idea to be \n  most dishonorable. To see an orc camp taken over by a 50+ druid and a lv 6 \n  ogre warrior in full crafted with a wurmslayer reminds me how people are have \n  no willingness to work for things (the whole cheat code thing). But many \n  people find it ok to twink/power level and, well, so be it. I can see it, \n  shiver, and keep moving. Live and let live. I am fortunate that at lv 43 I can \n  solo and this is only an inconvience at worse to me instead of a real issue. \n  But up until lv 35 I was still having camps stolen from me by uber twinks and \n  anon druids. </font></span></div>\n  <blockquote>\n    <div align=\"left\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-726681595OutlookMessageHeader\" dir=\"ltr\"><font face=\"Tahoma\"\n size=\"2\">-----Original Message-----<br><b>From:</b> Thomas H.
