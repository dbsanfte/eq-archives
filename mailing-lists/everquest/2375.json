I get those if I try to log in while there is a patch <br/>\ngoing on. Once it happened after a patch and I was locked out for two <br/>\ndays until another patch was run. Good thing it does not occur often. <br/>\nGot email in to sony. Anoying, as I had set aside several hours to <br/>\nquest today and found them wasted.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuess I will play an alternate game. Spent the day hunting sites for <br/>\ngood stuff to quest for. Sony should no better than to frustrate <br/>\ntheir addicts. Not smart. There are other dealers on the street.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., Rob LeBeau &lt;rlebeau65@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; check out this link, it gives status of downtime and<br/>\n&gt; servers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everquest.station.sony.com/netstat/index.jsp\">http://everquest.station.sony.com/netstat/index.jsp</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; are you dialing in or through a router?
