I am new to this mailing list so I thought I would give a word<br/>\n&gt; or many of introduction.  At this point I would introduce myself as my<br/>\nmain,<br/>\n&gt; but since I&#39;m still undecided as to who my main actually is, I will tell<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; about my characters and how this all began.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I started playing EverQuest a little over a year ago.  The first character<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; ever created was a half elf rogue by the name of Wulfric Rennison who is<br/>\n&gt; currently level 31.  Since Wulfric I have created a druid who originally<br/>\n&gt; started out as a half elf until I realized druids are wisdom based casters<br/>\n&gt; and half elves don&#39;t have much wisdom.  So I deleted the druid at level 15<br/>\n&gt; and recreated him as a wood elf.  His name is Raido Covenfall.  Currently<br/>\nhe<br/>\n&gt; is level 40.  Wulfric and Raido are really my two mains, though Wulfric<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t get played much.  I mainly use Raido to earn plat to buy better<br/>\ngear<br/>\n&gt; for Wulfric.  Then my two lesser characters are Celric Feldrak (an anagram<br/>\n&gt; for &quot;dark elf cleric&quot; in case you didn&#39;t catch it) a level 20 currently<br/>\n&gt; working on faction in Qeynos for the Testament of Vanear quest, and<br/>\nSavawulf<br/>\n&gt; Tageric (a combination of two words - Savatage and Wulfric.  Savatage<br/>\nbeing<br/>\n&gt; my favorite band and Wulfric you already know.  Wulfric incidentally is<br/>\nmade<br/>\n&gt; of two words &quot;wolf&quot; and &quot;reich&quot;.).  Those are all on the Cazic Thule<br/>\nserver.<br/>\n&gt; If you see one of them sometime, feel free to send a tell.  Then I have<br/>\n&gt; various characters on other servers, the primary ones being Kenjite<br/>\nArimasen<br/>\n&gt; (in Japanese means &quot;There are no forbidden subjects&quot;), currently a level<br/>\n18<br/>\n&gt; wood elf druid, and Petrus Steelsinger (so named for Peter Steele, front<br/>\nman<br/>\n&gt; for the band Type O Negative), who, of course, is a bard half elf,<br/>\ncurrently<br/>\n&gt; level 11 and rarely played.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All of these characters are in various guilds.  Raido and Celric are both<br/>\n&gt; tagged in the guild &quot;Amicus Concordiam&quot;.   Wulfric and Savawulf are tagged<br/>\n&gt; to the guild &quot;Draconis Rampant&quot;.  Kenjite and Petrus are tagged to the<br/>\nguild<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Bane of Tunare&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have many friends who play online, and I am also responsible for getting<br/>\n&gt; several people addicted.  I love the game, I don&#39;t plan on quitting any<br/>\ntime<br/>\n&gt; soon, and I believe that if I ever get married, my wife will have to be an<br/>\n&gt; EQ addict as well!  Oh yeah... and she has to like cartoons and kung fu<br/>\n&gt; movies... but that&#39;s neither here nor there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And for what it&#39;s worth... I don&#39;t really have a life outside of EQ.  :b<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; See you online!!<br/>\n&gt; Send me a tell!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Aluve Norrathians!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wulfric/Raido/Celric/Savawulf/Kenjite/Petrus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Friends In Unity&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;CHAOS to All Our Foes&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (PS Hi Kwasi!)   :) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
