It&#39;s on a website somewhere. If anyone wants to see it I can find the<br/>\nurl again.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I personally was bummed when they made it impossible<br/>\n&gt; to solo monks any more.  I haven&#39;t been feeling the<br/>\n&gt; urge to log in much since they did that, so I was one<br/>\n&gt; of the ones who voted to let people solo, even with a<br/>\n&gt; penality... I&#39;d enjoy it more than begging for groups<br/>\n&gt; in the planes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been in the game since 4/1/99 so I think I can<br/>\n&gt; say with certainty that its a million times easier<br/>\n&gt; than it used to be.  Many more zones, much less<br/>\n&gt; crowding, tons of more items, features like the Bazaar<br/>\n&gt; and being able to move around without a drood&#39;s help,<br/>\n&gt; etc.  Its a better game now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But I&#39;d give it all back to not have to beg for<br/>\n&gt; groups.  Sitting and spinning on my arse while I wait<br/>\n&gt; for a group desperate enough to take a monk is a<br/>\n&gt; bummer, and not fun in my view.  Figuring out a<br/>\n&gt; stratagy to solo certain spots was great fun for me,<br/>\n&gt; as well as the competition with other solo&#39;s for the<br/>\n&gt; good spots.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I didn&#39;t care so much about the monk nerf power wise<br/>\n&gt; except that it came at a time when we were being<br/>\n&gt; forced to group past 60... double whammy that makes it<br/>\n&gt; hard to get in a group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Quwi Changkane, Fenin Ro Grandmaster<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
