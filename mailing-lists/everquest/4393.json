I use to be scared <br/>\nof the same thing, but trust me, you always find it. Besides, it stays there <br/>\nfor days, so you have a long, long time to find it and get your stuff back. <br/>\nJust remember what zone you died in, and you will be fine. And if you can&#39;t <br/>\nfind it for some odd reason, call for a Necromancer... they have locate <br/>\ncorpse and can help you find it in no time! The only thing I worry about <br/>\nwhen dying is losing experience because as you get bigger, it gets harder <br/>\nand harder to gain any!<br/>\n<br/>\n-= Mippon - Level 40 Druid Halfling =-<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSTOP MORE SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
