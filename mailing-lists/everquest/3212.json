That dot gets his attention, and begins doing <br>damage. I \n  then begin running away from the Spires, to get some <br>distance from any \n  possible gnoll back-up. Once I have the distance I <br>want, I root him and \n  hit him with another dot, Incinerate in this <br>case. I then rest to regain \n  mana. I will run, root, and dot him until <br>dead. With luck I have enough \n  mana left to rest only a short time <br>before I go get another.<br><br>I was \n  talking with my son-in-law while taking one gnoll, and rooted <br>the thing at \n  the spire rather than pulling him away. I guess I was <br>distracted. A second \n  gnoll came along and agroed on me, driving me <br>away. I knew I did not have \n  the mana to manage both, so ran south for <br>Lake Raithtear. I reached the \n  zone well ahead of them. I rested to <br>full capacity, with no gnolls in \n  sight. Didn&#39;t even zone.<br><br>I went back to get some more gnolls, but found \n  someone camping the <br>spire I had been working. I started to leave, honoring \n  his claim to <br>an abandoned camp, when a gnoll hit me from behind. I lead \n  him on a <br>fatal chase. The camper sent a tell regarding a perceived \n  violation <br>of camp courtesy, for which I appologized.<br><br>It seems that \n  the gnolls will abandon a chase after some time and <br>distance, but remember \n  you well. The second gnoll I had been involved <br>with agroed on me from a \n  considerable distance from the Spires. <br><br>So, gnoll hunters, keep in mind \n  that an injured gnoll has a long <br>memory, and even longer agro \n  range.<br><br>Barto Proudfoot<br><br><br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit \n  the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
