First question, is, no matter how hard I try, I can NEVER run away<br/>\nform anything. I jump while I run. I have tried strafing to the side while I<br/>\nrun. I just can&#39;t seem to do it. Also, I have seen a rat named &quot;Scruffy&quot;<br/>\nseveral times. Does this thing serve any purpose besides an extra rat?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n-Faddor<br/>\nLevel 6 Monk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
