It&#39;s not hard in the Dreadlands either. Just pull the mob to a \nsafe place and fear kite animals or bow kite. I agree about Frontier Moutains, \nit&#39;s too dangerous to solo there. Unless you can find a good place to pull to \nyou definately shouldn&#39;t fight out in the open. </font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"bigmaca3@...\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bigmaca3@...\">bigmaca3</a> \n  </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Saturday, July 13, 2002 10:53 \n  AM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> [EverQuest] Re: Gaming \n  Death</div>\n  <div><br></div><tt>--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@y\">EverQuest@y</a>..., \n  &quot;mlockridge01&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MLockridge01@c\">MLockridge01@c</a>...&gt; \n  wrote:<br>&gt; My locution in the previous message expressed my feelings \n  toward <br>game <br>&gt; death, and raised my curiosity.
