I am lvl 70 in tailoring, and <br/>\nworking toward making Halfling tailored and imbued armor. I am a <br/>\nlevel 29 halfling druid, able so far to brew and smith the various <br/>\nparts I have needed to make my reinforced leather armor. I am soon to <br/>\nbe off to Kunark to obtain my brute hides. Anyone been a brute <br/>\nhunter, who can give me any advise?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat minimum level shall I need to succeed in brute hunting? And what <br/>\nsources for the high quality ore? I am not a good dungeon fighter, <br/>\nespecially solo. Runnyeye is a bit much without a good group, and so <br/>\nfar I have not found good groups for that fun place. Any suggestions <br/>\nfor the getting of the required ore? Any other places it drops?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo the metal pieces used in the halfling armor have to also be made <br/>\nof hq ore, or just the sewing kit? The sites I have visited are not <br/>\nall that clear on that one.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood hunting, everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
