And how many expansions are there now?<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t get back into it even if I really wanted to<br/>\nbecause there is no way in hell I could download the<br/>\npatches and such with my connection. I&#39;ve got<br/>\nHughes.net Satellite and it totally blows. They have a<br/>\nlimit on how much I can download per day and there are<br/>\nall sorts of problems with their software that makes<br/>\nthe &#39;net stop working.<br/>\nWhen I play World of Warcraft my latency is around<br/>\n1200ms on a good day. Most of the time its over 1500ms<br/>\nand its not unusual to have 2300ms.<br/>\nHave they fixed zoning, damage misreporting, or the<br/>\nmemory leaks in EQ?<br/>\nToo bad its been so long that my characters are not<br/>\nreally worth much now. I&#39;d be tempted to sell them so<br/>\nthey could go on being played by someone else.<br/>\nPlus some natural disasters have left me with<br/>\nfinancial problems. :-(<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;D.
