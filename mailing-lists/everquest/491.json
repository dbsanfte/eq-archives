I was with a party in The Estate of Unrest Sat night<br/>\nand most of the day Sunday, and we found quite a bit of Sm. bronze armor and<br/>\na Blood stained mantle. The bronze armor was mostly on the high level<br/>\nskeletons and high level ghouls. The blood stained mantle was on The undead<br/>\nknight of Unrest, a very nasty guy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also heard there is bronze on the dry bone skeletons in lake rathe that<br/>\nonly come out at night, but that place is camped BIG time. I am not sure the<br/>\nsize.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris AKA Thunderheart<br/>\nLevel 27<br/>\nWood-Elf<br/>\nDruid<br/>\nInnoruuk server<br/>\n---=== Divine Wind ===---<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: kale usi &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat location, and on what monsters can I find the following:<br/>\n<br/>\nSm Bronze Armor<br/>\nLg Bronze Armor<br/>\nMed Bronze Armor<br/>\nBlood Stained Mantle</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
