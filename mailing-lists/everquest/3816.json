because i am from germany.<br/>\n<br/>\nand i use EQ as sort of a vaction from my job. in the last weeks,<br/>\nmany events made it no real enjoyment for me anymore. and after some<br/>\nRL friends moved from Tarew Marr to Solusek Ro, i really started to<br/>\nthink about my EQ-future. i thought about moving the highest level<br/>\nchar from each of my four accounts (would be $200). also i stopped<br/>\ngoing after items, but only more exp (to save the spells) and i<br/>\nreally try to finish my (mage) epic, because this is the only epic<br/>\nthat can be moved with you (because it is a spell). there are also<br/>\nsome othere reason, why i don&#39;t want to loose all the time, energy<br/>\nand nerves i invested in collecting the items in the last 18 months.<br/>\n<br/>\nbut with those PoP annoucements i really have to make up my mind<br/>\nagain: is the EQ addiction really worth all the pain it gives me?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  - bilt<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBiltilie Dwimmerlaik<br/>\nlevel 54 female gnome magician<br/>\nTarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
