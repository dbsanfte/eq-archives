I will be needing Brute hides, and so was<br/>\n&gt; ready to go and <br/>\n&gt; hunt <br/>\n&gt; &gt; them. However, the shuttles in Butcherblock never<br/>\n&gt; met the boat. I <br/>\n&gt; &gt; tried three times, three different shuttles, and<br/>\n&gt; they went out to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Timerous Deep, got close to the boat, then the<br/>\n&gt; boat left. The <br/>\n&gt; &gt; shuttles just went back to BB.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; That avenue being out, I returned to SK to pick<br/>\n&gt; off gnolls, and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; forage Plains Pebbles. I almost have my bank tool<br/>\n&gt; box full of them. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; have about eight to go. So, decided to stay there<br/>\n&gt; until I get the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; rest.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Plus I have been getting fs weapons from the<br/>\n&gt; gnolls, which I have <br/>\n&gt; &gt; tried to make into another Vale Sewing Kit to<br/>\n&gt; sell.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hope they get the boat fixed. For my first trip I<br/>\n&gt; want to do it the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; old-fashioned way.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve found the big boat to FV to be broken too. <br/>\n&gt; Luckily I have a <br/>\n&gt; friend that&#39;s a Druid so I got a port to the DL.  I<br/>\n&gt; tried to petition <br/>\n&gt; the GM but it doesn&#39;t work if there isn&#39;t one on!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kunark is a dangerous place for the good races.  The<br/>\n&gt; only place you <br/>\n&gt; can bind a good melee is in FV and it&#39;s surrounded<br/>\n&gt; by mid-level <br/>\n&gt; mobs.  If you port over you end up in the DL, which<br/>\n&gt; is ok, it&#39;s just <br/>\n&gt; getting out of there that&#39;s the problem!  The DL<br/>\n&gt; does have <br/>\n&gt; connections to the FM and FV if you know where to<br/>\n&gt; look.  It&#39;s not a <br/>\n&gt; place to be without a map!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And I am also looking for a place to take me to the<br/>\n&gt; mid-40&#39;s.  I&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt; been to the moon, Kunark, the Karanas and Velious. <br/>\n&gt; I like to go to <br/>\n&gt; the zones that have been abandoned, like all the<br/>\n&gt; dungones on <br/>\n&gt; Anatonica.  I&#39;m in the FM now and will probably be<br/>\n&gt; in the DL, like <br/>\n&gt; everyone else. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tuldayen Grimblade<br/>\n&gt; 37th Season Ranger of Tunare<br/>\n&gt; Teris-Thule<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSign up for SBC Yahoo!
