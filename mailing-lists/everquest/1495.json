However, I did a bit of hunting in the <br/>\nKaranas which eventually put my level in jeopardy. I sought a way to <br/>\nget to the middle of 14 so that I could risk death a few times <br/>\nwithout losing my ability to sow and bind myself. These spells were <br/>\ncritical to my freedom of travel.<br/>\n<br/>\nI discovered the mail run. Being from Rivervale I knew that my home <br/>\nwas in the middle of the contenent. I could take runs to Qeynos or <br/>\nFreeport with reasonable ease. When I discovered High Pass as a mail <br/>\ndestination, the pattern was set.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bound myself in High Pass Keep, just beside the bard who gives and <br/>\nreceives the mail there. Take the Freeport mail from that bard, run <br/>\nto Rivervale. Take the mail from there to Freeport. Run to Freeport. <br/>\nDeliver mail. Take the mail for High Pass. Gate to High Pass. Do it <br/>\nagain. <br/>\n<br/>\nI did this until my level 14 was secure. Made some cash, gained <br/>\nexperience. Now I am ready for a bit more adventure.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto of Rivervale.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
