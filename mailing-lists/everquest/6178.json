Odd only because I am <br/>\nthinking about it and not being able to play...well...<br/>\n<br/>\nI was going through the &quot;EQ Journal&quot; of mine and came across the <br/>\ninventory list. It wasnt complete, but fairly accurate and almost <br/>\ndone for all 16 of my toons. Now, I am the kind of user that gets <br/>\neach toon their own armor, weapons, etc...so at one time or another <br/>\nI had 8 or 9 centi short swords, etc. Occasionally...if a weapon was <br/>\ntoo good and not no-drop and I couldnt get another one, I&#39;d switch <br/>\nthem between toons that could use it ( thank the gods for the shared <br/>\nbank..lol)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I was thinking about weapons and their usage in particular. <br/>\nMainly, the correct way of giving waepons to a Dual-Wielder( which <br/>\nweapon goes in primary/secondary....faster weapon or the more <br/>\ndamaging weapon.  Also, when learning a new skill (i.e piercing) <br/>\nwhen your level 40..lol...does it matter which hand you have the <br/>\ndagger in?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have heard many answers and many conflicted with each other..and <br/>\nit was never something I was clear on..considering my two &quot;mains&quot; <br/>\nare a caster and druid...lol...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs always..longwinded..and Greg</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
