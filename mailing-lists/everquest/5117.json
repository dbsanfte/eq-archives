I&#39;m working on a new <br/>\nshow for VH1 entitled &quot;My Obsession&quot; It focuses on pop-culture and <br/>\nit&#39;s effects on society, people, etc.  We are working on a segment <br/>\nthat highlights people submerged in the world of Everquest, and I&#39;m <br/>\nlooking for possible candidates for the show.  Our ideal person would <br/>\nbe someone who plays the game continuously/excessively and has <br/>\nencountered problems be it family or friends due to their EQ habits.<br/>\n<br/>\nSide note: This is not meant to be an Everquest &quot;bashing&quot;<br/>\nstory as so many from the past have been.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nReg</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
