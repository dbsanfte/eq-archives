Been busy doing construction/cleanup/repair<br/>\nat the house and junk.<br/>\nI have a 40Gb primary and 120Gb secondary drive.<br/>\nI started having even worse problems where my character got stuck after<br/>\ngoing LD in various zones and then had to wait for a week for a walkout from<br/>\na GM. I could get my other characters into the same zone and I had no active<br/>\ncharacter warnings. I deleted and repatched zone files, deleted skins<br/>\nfolder, deleted eqclient, deleted all files with that characters name.<br/>\nreloaded all the stuff. rebooted. defragged, diskcleanup, scandisk.. and I<br/>\nstill had the problem. After the umpteenth walkout and several calls to tech<br/>\nsupport they told me there were brand new drivers for my video card to dl.<br/>\nSo I dled those drivers and so far haven&#39;t had problems. But I haven&#39;t<br/>\nplayed enough since then to find out if the problem is completely gone. The<br/>\nbazaar problem I think is just because my connection is too slow to handle<br/>\nthe lag from too many people in the zone and I just go LD.<br/>\nThanks for the suggestions though. :-)<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Su, i just had another idea about your Bazaar problems:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; how much space do you have availible on your harddisk?<br/>\n&gt; is there enough room for your swapfile?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; besides, if you enable EQ texture caching, it will also<br/>\n&gt; eat up harddisk space.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; one more thing to add: when did you run defrag the last<br/>\n&gt; time?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; just an idea...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  - bilt<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Biltilie Dwimmerlaik, lvl 57 gnome magician, Tarew Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
