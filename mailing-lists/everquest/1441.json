I think. But it works best<br/>\nto buy from merchants who won&#39;t sell to you. You can sneak up behind them<br/>\nand buy from them. Hide can only be done while holding still.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2)  I do not yet have the &quot;Backstab&quot; ability.

Might not make a diff though. It might just seem like it does.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3)  I noticed that &quot;Disarm Traps&quot; is a later ability, but I cannot recall<br/>\n&gt; having ever seen or heard of a trap in EQ.  Can anyone give an example of<br/>\n&gt; where and when this ability would come in handy?  And how do I know that<br/>\n&gt; there is a trap around to disarm in the first place?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have no idea about that one. I started a rogue recently and haven&#39;t found<br/>\nany traps to disarm yet.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sorry for being so naive, but thanks for any help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Alazais&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s no problem. :-)<br/>\nYou&#39;re welcome.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
