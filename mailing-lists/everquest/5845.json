I&#39;m 10 miles out from <br/>\ntown in the middle of the woods.<br/>\n&gt; Before satellite I had dialup that only had 19.2k bandwidth <br/>\nbecause my phonelines suck and the phone company refused to fix <br/>\nthem. They are the only phone company available to me in my <br/>\nparticular area. In the city they have full phonelines going to each <br/>\nhouse, but out here they decided to be cheap and split up a line <br/>\nthat should go to one house to serve several houses. The box the <br/>\nlines are in got knocked over and the lines have probably been <br/>\ndamaged. Whenever it rains my lines get even worse, but the phone <br/>\ncompany denies there is a problem and won&#39;t send anyone out to look. <br/>\nThe last time I dialed up when I lost connection from satellite <br/>\nduring a thunderstorm I used dialup but only connected at 6k. So my <br/>\nphonelines now provide less bandwidth than legally required.<br/>\n&gt; So satellite was the lesser of the 2 evils. I do get some latency, <br/>\nbut I can download about 800k.<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ======== At 2004-09-29, 10:09:00 you wrote: ========<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t generally have lag issues.  I have a cable modem <br/>\nconnection and I turn off some game options that would cause lag, <br/>\nlike Spell Effects, full names, etc.  And in some places, if <br/>\nnecessary, I&#39;ll drop the clipp plane down a little.  So assumng I&#39;m <br/>\nrunning at full speed with no lag, I still have a hard time soloing <br/>\nthe tasks, even as a 64 druid, mainly because of miscellaneous aggro <br/>\nin close quarters.  Sure I can kite one or two mobs, but in close <br/>\nquarters, where adds are coming out of the woodwork, even greenies <br/>\ncan beat you down.  I&#39;m not big on soloing per se.  It takes too <br/>\nlong and requires too much attention.  I prefer grouping anyway.  XP <br/>\nis much quicker, and in a full group that knows what they&#39;re doing, <br/>\nI only have to snare/dot once per round as opposed to 2 or 3 per <br/>\n(high level) mob.So I don&#39;t waste nearly as much mana meaning I can <br/>\ndo other things like back up heal, buff sporadically, or be <br/>\navailable to evac if necessary.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I understand that some people are limited to what kind of <br/>\nconnections they can get in certain geographical areas, but <br/>\npersonally I don&#39;t think satellite is one of the best connections to <br/>\nplay EQ.  You should try for an ISDN connection at least.  <br/>\nConnection would probably be more stable, and your uplink would be <br/>\nroughly same speed as your downlink.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wulfric </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
