I managed <br>to <br>&gt; force my hef rgr to lvl 18/19--18 is where I spend most of my time, <br>&gt; but sometimes I lvl to 19. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; I have been recently been building my fletching skills(104). I <br>spent <br>&gt; about 4hrs a day hunting in front of Qeynos killing green mobs for <br>&gt; about 3wks. All I make is about 150plat in the 4 hrs with no exp, <br>but <br>&gt; when I go hunting elswere--like bb--I only get about 5 plat for 4 <br>hrs <br>&gt; and some exp. I seem to go up about 2 skill points in that time in <br>&gt; front of Qeynos. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; I don&#39;t mean to complain, but I am starting to feel sorry for all <br>&gt; knolls and gopher snakes I&#39;ve killed. Plus I\n would like to be able <br>to <br>&gt; do more quests.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I do want to earn everything myself, but would like to know where I <br>&gt; can earn some serious plat? I have heard of people lvl 12 earning 4-<br>&gt; 5000 plat/hr. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; How do they do that?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Anyone have any suggestions?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thanks<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com/\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; ---------------------------------<br>&gt; Yahoo!
