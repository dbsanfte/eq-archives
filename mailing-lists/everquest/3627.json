Heh. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe blank Inventory persona screen is indeed &quot;normal&quot; now. I too found it quite useful, altho it wasn&#39;t to look at my pretty face, I liked seeing what was happening behind me when I looted something. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRob C.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Deidre Choksy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:electrum101@...\">electrum101@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: RE: Question<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;I was told they did away with this feature but I found<br/>\n&gt;a workaround myself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you load the luclin images BUT use the old UI, you<br/>\n&gt;can hit inventory and then hit the face button.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;What&#39;s UI stand for? I tried what you suggested below and it actually<br/>\n&gt;worked! I adjusted my face and waited forever for my character to save. &gt;Then my face stayed the same through multiple zones! And it&#39;s finely &gt;correct on the character selection screen! However, my inventory picture &gt;is still black!? I guess I&#39;ll just go to tech support chat...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Remove head gear/masks. Pick your desired features<br/>\n&gt; &gt; using the /face command. Force a character save.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Zone into another area, still without head gear.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Check yourself, you should be &quot;yourself&quot;. If<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not...start over and try again. If you are okay,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; then you should be okay and can put back on head<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gear/masks. Remember, this is if it&#39;s happening to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you only.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________________________<br/>\nYour favorite stores, helpful shopping tools and great gift ideas.
