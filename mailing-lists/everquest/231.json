About the same for my cable<br/>\nmodem. I agree it is the line speed that affects the<br/>\nzoneing time. My machine is a AMD 333 64MB with 8MB<br/>\nVideo I also have a Ultra SCSI drive which probable<br/>\nhas some affect when loading the zone graphics over<br/>\nslower IDE drives. I played over a DS3 connection as<br/>\nwell and it was not much different as far a zone times<br/>\ngo. Ofcourse there is also the 2500 other people in<br/>\nthe building that have nothing better to do but surf<br/>\nthe web. Clogs up the line. Thats your tax dollars<br/>\nhard at work on the TY site. I just changed jobs<br/>\nhowever and now my work machine is serviced by a proxy<br/>\nthat wont pass EQ data. :(<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Lary, William&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WLary@...\">WLary@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Lary, William&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WLary@...\">WLary@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hiya<br/>\n&gt;   i have a amd 400mhz 64mb of ps100 ram   16mb video<br/>\n&gt; card-banshee<br/>\n&gt; and an awesome creative 128bit sound card. however i<br/>\n&gt; have NEVER zoned in   <br/>\n&gt; less than a minute, usually more, i know a lot of it<br/>\n&gt; is processor<br/>\n&gt; i have hit zones withgroups and i am the last one to<br/>\n&gt; wake up so to speak<br/>\n&gt; the others had p2 350mhz etc  i do have a 33.6 modem<br/>\n&gt; so i think it is<br/>\n&gt; the modem connection that makes the biggest<br/>\n&gt; difference, i wish my work<br/>\n&gt; computer had a cd rom drive installed, its just a<br/>\n&gt; p266 with 80mb but the<br/>\n&gt; 45kps T1 connection would surely be nice as opposed<br/>\n&gt; to my<br/>\n&gt; 3.5 to about 4.0kps i get with my 33.6 modem. does<br/>\n&gt; anyone out there<br/>\n&gt; play on a recommended p200 or above system req and<br/>\n&gt; use a T1?<br/>\n&gt; i wold love to know the zone times ya get:)<br/>\n&gt; Doublestar  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ONElist:  Where Star Wars fans unite!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Find your Star Wars list today!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
