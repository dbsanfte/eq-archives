EQ runs awesome on it too. Anyway, now I&#39;m playing catch-up on the e-mails....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVery good suggestions from the others. I haven&#39;t seen an answer if those worked for you or not. If it did, great! If not tho, you might want to head on over to the EQ tech forums, as this topic has been brought up lots of times over there, and do a search of that forum for &quot;linksys&quot; or something similar. You should come up with a number of threads you can read through for various possible solutions. Good luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=Technical+Help&number=3&DaysPrune=20&LastLogin=\">http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=Technical+Help&number=3&DaysPrune=20&LastLogin=</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Ariaya&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ariaya@...\">ariaya@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, August 11, 2002 10:20 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Network setup help<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m hoping that someone on this board can help.
