Sometimes the tanks aren&#39;t doing enough damage to<br/>\nmaintain aggro. I&#39;ve been in groups where the tank sucked and couldn&#39;t keep<br/>\naggro off of someone who was doing very little damage.<br/>\nAlso, it *is* the tank&#39;s job to keep aggro off of the groups healers.<br/>\nHealers can try to keep their aggro down, but if we have to CH the tank,<br/>\nthat means we will probably get aggro (unless the tank is good at taunting).<br/>\nIt just comes down to how the group works as a whole. I&#39;ve heard rangers and<br/>\nwarriors argue with each other about aggro and using nonaggro or aggro type<br/>\nweapons.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\nIn PoP a bard is the puller of choice. Who cares if lull fails, if we can<br/>\nfade. Faster then trying to split the pull. If you are pulling aggro off of<br/>\na tank, well, you are doing it wrong. It is not thier job to keep aggro off<br/>\nyou, but your job to not pull it off the tank. Try FD every 30 seconds. Then<br/>\nyou can do max damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nAwulfie A&#39;Mused<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.551 / Virus Database: 343 - Release Date: 12/11/2003</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
