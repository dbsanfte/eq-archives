EQ, AC, and UO were pretty much the first in<br/>\nthis genre, and like that will very soon not fit the players needs. As the<br/>\npeople play more and more, they expect more and more from the game. Coney Island<br/>\nwas originally a huge attraction because of its many many lights, however, the<br/>\npeople began demanding more and more. EQ, UO, and AC in this genre you could<br/>\nrelate pretty much to doom in the 1st person shooter genre. Things will only<br/>\nbuild from here, as the players demand more and more, the companies will produce<br/>\nbigger and better games trying to fit the players demands. Am I saying that EQ<br/>\nis no longer worth playing, no. EQ is a really great game, and despite the<br/>\ndebate as to whether the changes within it are good or bad, it still attracts<br/>\nmany people. However, EQ is a dying game, I personally do not intend to give up<br/>\non it because it satisfies my needs in gaming for now, however the companies,<br/>\nseeing that this is a very good market will keep releasing bigger and better<br/>\ngames. I imagine there to be a flood of titles coming in, and within a year or<br/>\nso, one of them will fight its way to the top, such as half life, or unreal in<br/>\nthe 1st person shooter genre. EQ isn&#39;t any worse then when people first started<br/>\nplaying and loved it. The thing is that the players demands are increasing more<br/>\nand more, and EQ is striving to keep up. The only question is, how long can it<br/>\nlast?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
