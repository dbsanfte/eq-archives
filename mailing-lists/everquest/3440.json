The Gnolls of <br/>\nBlackburrow come pouring out to attack the entrance to Surefall.  The <br/>\ndefenders are from Surefall, all look like Wood Elves.  They have <br/>\narchers and regular foot soldiers.  It was an awesome sight to see, <br/>\nbut very laggy.  My meter hit 6000 before it dropped me.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nactually seen this twice, on 2 different servers.  I&#39;ve seen these <br/>\nguys before so it may have happened more than once.  It might be a <br/>\nrecurring thing, like the ring war.  I haven&#39;t checked that out.  And <br/>\nthat majority of the Mobs were red to me!  Defending the homeland has <br/>\na heavy price to pay!<br/>\n<br/>\nTuldayen Grimblade<br/>\n39th Season Ranger of Tunare<br/>\nTerris-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Su&quot; &lt;suceress@k...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m blanking on OS.

Thanks!<br/>\n&gt; Speaking of jaggedpine I had someone beg me to come to Qeynos Hills <br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; them to rez a bunch of people who were killed in some sort of GM <br/>\nevent. all<br/>\n&gt; kinds of npcs were in front of surefall glade. I hung out and <br/>\nrezzed people<br/>\n&gt; then after waiting and finding they might not be able to make it <br/>\nhappen<br/>\n&gt; again for another hour or more I decided to head out and get some <br/>\nsleep.<br/>\n&gt; Was anyone around for an event of that type in Qhills?<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Only 2 places like that are Vox&#39;s lair (only inside it where she <br/>\nis, NOT<br/>\n&gt; the rest of the zone) and Naggy&#39;s lair (same thing). Any OTHER part <br/>\nof the<br/>\n&gt; zone is 100% normal for all levels, and can be gone into. As for <br/>\nexp...try<br/>\n&gt; Karnor&#39;s and  OS. Jaggedpine might be a good bet too.<br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;   From: Su<br/>\n&gt;   To: EverQuest@y...<br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Sunday, July 28, 2002 12:38 PM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: [EverQuest] Hunting grounds for 50+<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Ok now that my cleric is lvl 52, I&#39;m trying to find a good place <br/>\nto hunt<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt;   get xp. Also, are there any parts of my epic that I can do out of <br/>\norder.<br/>\n&gt;   Like can I kill some mob in nagafen&#39;s lair or such without doing <br/>\nthe other<br/>\n&gt;   parts first? Or does the king something or other.. whatever it is <br/>\nthere..<br/>\n&gt;   does it have to be triggered by the quest to spawn? I&#39;m worried <br/>\nthat I<br/>\n&gt; will<br/>\n&gt;   hit one of those zones where if you are over 52 you will be <br/>\nbanished to<br/>\n&gt; zone<br/>\n&gt;   beginning so I want to do what I can while lower lvl and then do <br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; higher<br/>\n&gt;   lvl stuff once I&#39;ve gone up more.<br/>\n&gt;   Any suggestions?<br/>\n&gt;   luv,<br/>\n&gt;   -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         Yahoo!
