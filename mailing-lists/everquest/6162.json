Plus EQ2 could be <br/>\n&gt;&gt; considered a parrallel universe.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I didn&#39;t know Luclin had exploded in EQ2. Did they say the story behind <br/>\n&gt;&gt; why? What happened to the poor Vah Shir?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Seems according to Sony&#39;s plans the Vah Shir were all wiped out when it <br/>\n&gt;went.  But dont worry you can still be a cat in the game, just as a Kerra. <br/>\n&gt;Kerra were originally (by EQ lore) 4 tribes that united as one.  The Vah <br/>\n&gt;Shir were only 1 of those 4.  When they got blown to the moon the other 3 <br/>\n&gt;seperated going to the 3 areas they flurish in EQ, Kerra Isle, Erud&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;Crossing, and Stonebrunt Mountains.  But don&#39;t count the Vah Shir bloodlines <br/>\n&gt;out yet, they could have had some living with the Kerra on Norrath when <br/>\n&gt;Luclin went boom.  As for why it went boom....I&#39;m still looking for lore on <br/>\n&gt;that. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-- <br/>\n&gt;No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\n&gt;Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>\n&gt;Version: 7.0.308 / Virus Database: 266.10.3 - Release Date: 4/25/2005<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;Yahoo!
