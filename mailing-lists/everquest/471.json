My guess is that <br/>\nyour armor, stats, defense, etc. combined give you your total AC that you <br/>\ncan read in your persona screen. Now the attacker hes his attack defined by <br/>\nhis offense and weapon skill, and stats, given by the ATK field in the <br/>\npersona screen.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen for each hit there&#39;s a some kind of dice rolls dice roll added to the <br/>\nATK from which you then substact the AC of the target. You then get a value <br/>\nwhich will tell you if you hit or not and if you do how high in your damage <br/>\nrange you hit. So the highest AC you have, the lower damage you take, and <br/>\nthe less chance to get hit you have. I believe that there is no hidden <br/>\nabsorption stat, just this kind of calculus which is fairly common in pen <br/>\nand paper RPGs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t get high enough in level to see monks get hit rarely but for huge <br/>\namounts of damage, which would prove this wrong, but I&#39;m kinda certain this <br/>\nis true (maybe not exactly addition and substractions like I said, maybe <br/>\nthere are some coefficients added, etc. but you get the idea).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2c.<br/>\n<br/>\nThormael<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Ok, I can&#39;t give you an exact formula, nothing is known precisely<br/>\n&gt;about the game itself, but I can give you a general indication.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Each piece of armor, in addition to it&#39;s AC value has a value that<br/>\n&gt;is not visible which is how much damage it absorbs from attacks.<br/>\n&gt;This is apparently chained with the difference between the attackers<br/>\n&gt;attack and the defenders defense, so is extremely difficult to put<br/>\n&gt;a fixed value on.  This is also the greatest weakness of monks at<br/>\n&gt;high levels - they have exceptional AC but almost no absorbance,<br/>\n&gt;so get hit for huge amounts when the blow lands.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As an experiment to see the effects, try equipping a full set of cloth<br/>\n&gt;armor ( which as far as I can see has negligible absorbance ) and<br/>\n&gt;attacking a blue monster to get an idea of how much damage it does,<br/>\n&gt;then swap the chest piece for something with good absorbance<br/>\n&gt;such as banded. You will notice that the most of the attacks will do<br/>\n&gt;the same damage, but every so often the monster will hit for much<br/>\n&gt;less - this is when the hit lands on your banded piece.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A full set does not garauntee the lower damage attacks though -<br/>\n&gt;a monster of any level always has a chance to do full damage<br/>\n&gt;with an attack and a monster with a much higher attack than your<br/>\n&gt;defense will almost always bypass your armor when it hits you.<br/>\n&gt;Also, your defense is severely decreased when fighting multiple<br/>\n&gt;oppponents - as an example with a level 15 necromancer in full<br/>\n&gt;woven fighting level 8 skeletons, when fighting one at a time<br/>\n&gt;would rarely get hit for more than 1 point of damage ( the minimum<br/>\n&gt;for a succesfull hit ) but fighting two at once would frequently get hit<br/>\n&gt;for over 10.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Armor with higher AC values *usually* has a better absorbance,<br/>\n&gt;but this is not always the case - a good example that springs to<br/>\n&gt;mind is the lightweight armors from the innothule swamp/guk area.<br/>\n&gt;Woven armor has the same AC as patchwork, but absorbs<br/>\n&gt;as much damage as leather does, and mesh has the same AC<br/>\n&gt;as leather, but absorbs as much damage as chainmail.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, I am told that Lockjaw&#39;s tunic and snakeskin armor only<br/>\n&gt;absorb damage as well as leather, despite having a much<br/>\n&gt;better AC.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Jason&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:IB_Jason@...\">IB_Jason@...</a>&gt; on 18/06/99 13:21:52<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please respond to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;cc:    (bcc: Michael Wyatt/AU/AMP)<br/>\n&gt;Subject:  Re: [EverQuest] Bronze Armor, a little explanation please?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;Jason&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:IB_Jason@...\">IB_Jason@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hey,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have heard about absorbtion of armor, but do not understnad the<br/>\n&gt;mechanics/formula/general idea behind it. My deep armor knowledge is<br/>\n&gt;confined to games as primal as UO =) Sooo, if you can do a little<br/>\n&gt;explanation of the general differences between AC and Absorbtion, I would<br/>\n&gt;be<br/>\n&gt;most gracious. And also, will I notice a big difference between no armor<br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;my new Bronze (let&#39;s assume it&#39;s a full suit)? I know it should be an<br/>\n&gt;obvious yes, but I have been less than enthralled with armor effects in the<br/>\n&gt;game so far, and am wondering if I&#39;m going to noticed monsters about my<br/>\n&gt;level that did 20 or so damage suddenly start doing 4 or 5.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks a bunch again,<br/>\n&gt;-Rukkak<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(Just to cover my prospective flame bases, nothin against UO. IT is just my<br/>\n&gt;personal opinion that EQ is faaaaaar better. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
