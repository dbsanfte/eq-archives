There seems to be some type of Tradeskill bug going around &amp; I wanted to know if you know anything about it? I am not able to go past 252 in skill? Not with my Grandmaster Corker/Spoon or Geerlock? At 252 it just stops &amp; it will not pass 252 I enclosed snapshots &amp; have also forwarded this to Everquest as well. I am also not able to get my Grandmaster Carry all bag from Gnome in Bazaar either. This is a real bummer &amp; EQ has known about this &amp; isn&#39;t doing much atm? Even with Enhanced Patch I am failing insainly still:(( &amp; Am not able to make anything in the Higher trivials passing 252 either.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Maridizi</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Quellious Server</div></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p><hr size=\"1\"><font face=\"arial\" size=\"-1\">Do you Yahoo!?<br>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://us.rd.yahoo.com/evt=23609/*http://promotions.yahoo.com/design_giveaway/static/index2.html\">Yahoo!
