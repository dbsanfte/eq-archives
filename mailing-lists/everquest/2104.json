I am <br/>\ncurrently running a 1.2 gHz Gateway Athlon system with 512 MB of PC-<br/>\n133 SDRAM, nVidia GeForce 2 Ultra with 64 MB, and a Sound Blaster <br/>\nLive! X-Gamer 5.1 sound card. Operating System is Windows XP Home <br/>\nEdition. Connection is via aDSL. I have downloaded and installed all <br/>\nthe latest drivers.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sound, particularly the music, &quot;stutters&quot; and repeats in the game <br/>\nto the point it is almost unbearably annoying and I have to turn the <br/>\nspeakers off or way down. It does not appear to affect the video <br/>\nand/or gameplay, but I should think my system is more than adequate <br/>\nto play the game with sound turned on. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do have the Luclin expansion, and I have turned on a FEW of the <br/>\nnew skins, but only those of the races and genders of my own <br/>\ncharacters: Wood Elf, Dwarf, Erudite, and Human (necessary to <br/>\ndisplay Erudite). I also have horses and elementals turned on, but <br/>\nthat is all. Social animations, mip mapping, texture mapping, and <br/>\ntexture compression are off.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried turning the sound acceleration down in Control Panel, <br/>\nbut that appears to have no effect on the choppiness of the sound. I <br/>\nalso turned sound realism up and turned off reverb by using /reverb <br/>\nin the chat box, at one person&#39;s suggestion. Does anyone have any <br/>\nideas/tips/solutions? <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nFroondor Oakenbark, 41 Wood Elf Druid male<br/>\nFroontor Whipslash, 29 Barbarian Warrior male(retired)<br/>\nFroondar Oakenbark, 27 Wood Elf Warrior male<br/>\nTexxas Rannger, 21 Wood Elf Ranger male<br/>\nFroonvah, 12 Vah Shir Beastlord male<br/>\nFroondoc, 11 Dwarf Cleric male<br/>\nSquiddles, 9 Vah Shir Shaman female<br/>\nFroonlea, 4 Erudite Wizard female<br/>\n<br/>\nAll on Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
