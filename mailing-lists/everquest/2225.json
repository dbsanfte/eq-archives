In fact, my gnome necro was not able to buy<br/>\nthe spell Gate at the Caster&#39;s Guild in Akanon, his own home town. The<br/>\nmerchants would not even talk to him. I believe that gnome necros might even<br/>\nbe KOS in &quot;good&quot; cities, like Kelethin (not sure about that).<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom a purely role-playing perspective, you are entirely correct. Nobody<br/>\nshould want to group with a necromancer or a shadow knight -IF- they are<br/>\n&quot;good&quot; themselves. In fact, a wood elf, for example, would not group with a<br/>\ntroll, ogre, iksar, or dark elf, period.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, you may have noticed =) that there is not that much true<br/>\nrole-playing and a lot of leveling and acquiring goodies in this game, and<br/>\nso you see high elf paladins grouped with iksar necromancers, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that sort of grouping is not even possible on the Firiona Vie<br/>\n(role-play) server, but I have not played my character to a high enough<br/>\nlevel on that server to find out.<br/>\n<br/>\nFroondor, 41 wood elf druid of Tarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Rob LeBeau&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rlebeau65@...\">rlebeau65@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 21, 2002 10:16 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Necro questions myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Is a Necro considered evil?
