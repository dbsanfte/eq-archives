I worked it out finally. G. The email Sony sent me on the <br/>\nweekend had a link to reset my password but it didn&#39;t work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tied the support page again to get another password reset email <br/>\ntoday and it worked.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem was that the new update required an 8 character password <br/>\nand my original password was created when only 6 characters were <br/>\nrequired. ;) I&#39;m not the only one having that problem. I tried to <br/>\ncall sony and the lines busy. G. Wouldn&#39;t it have been nice if the <br/>\nlast upgrade simply asked you if your old password was less thn 8 <br/>\ncharacters long when the password failed? Then all of those angry <br/>\ngamers who will be calling Sony about that problem for the next week <br/>\ncould have been told what to do next when they answered yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHind sight is 20-20? The programmers don&#39;t have to answer the phones. <br/>\nG. Hehehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdward</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
