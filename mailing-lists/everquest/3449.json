I&#39;ve played one \n  to level 13 and it is ok. The beastlord himself is about as good of a fighter \n  as a bard except they can only wear leather armor. His pet is a good tank \n  though with a neat taunt proc and the beastlord has cleric level heals for the \n  pet. He also gets shaman spells too. It&#39;s a lot like a magician except with \n  more of an emphasis on healing and buffs. I don&#39;t see why the beastlord pet \n  couldn&#39;t be a main tank in a group. I kind of wish they got a few extra spells \n  though most of their best spells you don&#39;t get until level 59 or 60. I wish \n  there were weak lower level versions of some of their key spells like maybe a \n  spell like the enchanter&#39;s augmentation spell that increases attack speed %15 \n  or something.</font></div><br><br><tt>Visit \n  the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
