My gear is<br/>\nonly average.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuwi<br/>\n--- Su &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Well, there is a lvl 52 monk named Technoe who has<br/>\n&gt; soloed Nagafen and Vox.<br/>\n&gt; There is a video of him soloing Nagafen to the tune<br/>\n&gt; of &quot;My Balls, Your<br/>\n&gt; Chin&quot;. It&#39;s on a website somewhere. If anyone wants<br/>\n&gt; to see it I can find the<br/>\n&gt; url again.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I personally was bummed when they made it<br/>\n&gt; impossible<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to solo monks any more.  I haven&#39;t been feeling<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; urge to log in much since they did that, so I was<br/>\n&gt; one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of the ones who voted to let people solo, even<br/>\n&gt; with a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; penality... I&#39;d enjoy it more than begging for<br/>\n&gt; groups<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in the planes.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been in the game since 4/1/99 so I think I<br/>\n&gt; can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; say with certainty that its a million times easier<br/>\n&gt; &gt; than it used to be.  Many more zones, much less<br/>\n&gt; &gt; crowding, tons of more items, features like the<br/>\n&gt; Bazaar<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and being able to move around without a drood&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; help,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; etc.  Its a better game now.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But I&#39;d give it all back to not have to beg for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; groups.  Sitting and spinning on my arse while I<br/>\n&gt; wait<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for a group desperate enough to take a monk is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bummer, and not fun in my view.  Figuring out a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stratagy to solo certain spots was great fun for<br/>\n&gt; me,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as well as the competition with other solo&#39;s for<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; good spots.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t care so much about the monk nerf power<br/>\n&gt; wise<br/>\n&gt; &gt; except that it came at a time when we were being<br/>\n&gt; &gt; forced to group past 60... double whammy that<br/>\n&gt; makes it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hard to get in a group.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Quwi Changkane, Fenin Ro Grandmaster<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nSBC Yahoo!
