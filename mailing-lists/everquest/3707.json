I saw this cute tiny<br/>\nperson standing there. It said brownie scout over it&#39;s head. I was like &quot;How<br/>\ncute! Hello little guy&quot; and walked over to greet it. It started casting a<br/>\nspell but I was so new I didn&#39;t know what it was doing. Next thing I know I<br/>\nsee LOADING PLEASE WAIT.<br/>\nThat was the first time I died in the game.<br/>\nOne day, I will have my revenge.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\nAt level 48 the corrupted Brownie killed me and my wife(level 49 warrior).<br/>\nLFay is a tricky dangerous place.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
