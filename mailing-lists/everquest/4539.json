A video card has memory for a purpose.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>The video card&#39;s job is to draw, redraw, and crunch the numbers that <br/>\nadds texture to graphics.  EQ being a constantly changing 3D <br/>\nenvironment needs a card with the ability to render the graphics.  In <br/>\nlayman&#39;s terms, the better the video card, the better graphics <br/>\nperformance you&#39;ll get.  So why memory on a video card?  Well the <br/>\nmemory is a localized storage for functions and information that the <br/>\ngraphics processor on the card will perform before sending the <br/>\ninformation to the CPU via the graphics bus.  The more memory your <br/>\nvideo card has, the more information it can store and retrieve to <br/>\ncomplete its tasks before it gets sent to the processor.  The less <br/>\ndistance it has to travel, the faster it will be.  Therefore, having <br/>\nmemory on a video card makes sense.  It doesn&#39;t have to travel far.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you don&#39;t have enough memory on a video card to perform all the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>functions the game requires of it, then these functions have to be <br/>\nperformed SOMEWHERE.  Where then does this happen?  You guessed it!  <br/>\nVirtual Memory.  Where is virtual memory stored?  You guessed it.  On <br/>\nthe hard drive.  The hard drive is miles away from the video card.  <br/>\nThink about what the video card has to do to process that <br/>\ninformation.  First, it has to send that information via the graphics <br/>\nbus to the processor saying it needs to assign this information to <br/>\nvirtual memory, then the processor says, &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll get to it as <br/>\nsoon as I can finish these other functions.&quot;  Then the processor <br/>\nlooks up in its memory mapping to see where information from the <br/>\nvideo card can be stored and then sends the information to the IDE <br/>\nBUS and says &quot;Put these here&quot;.  So then the IDE bus kicks in and <br/>\nsends the information to the appropriate spots.  So the hard drive <br/>\nkicks in and says &quot;Wait! I need to locate those spots.&quot; So the hard <br/>\ndrive spins and spins and spins until it&#39;s managed to store all that <br/>\ninformation that could be handled elsewhere. Once all this is done, <br/>\nthe information is stored and everyone is happy, until the video card <br/>\nsays &quot;I need this information.&quot;  Then the hard drive gets upset and <br/>\nsays &quot;Can&#39;t you see I&#39;m busy here???  CPU can&#39;t you do anything about <br/>\nthis?&quot;  And the CPU grumbles and says &quot;Don&#39;t look at me man, it&#39;s the <br/>\nvideo card&#39;s problem; I just do what everyone else tells me to.&quot;   <br/>\nThen the hard drive gets aggitated and says &quot;Well if the video card <br/>\nwould upgrade its stupid memory, it wouldn&#39;t have to utilize my <br/>\nresources to do its work.  I got my own problems!&quot;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then the video card said &quot;God, I wish my user would upgrade my <br/>\n </span></blockquote>memory cause it&#39;s such a pain in the ass having to deal with all <br/>\nthese unnecessary steps!&quot;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; The repetitive act of accessing the hard drive unnecessarily for <br/>\n </span></blockquote>virtual memory is called Disk Thrashing, and over a period of time <br/>\ncan cause undue wear and tear that could have otherwise been <br/>\nprevented.  Upgrade your video card.  Let it do the tasks so the hard <br/>\ndrive doesn&#39;t have to.  Your hard drive won&#39;t be accessed as often <br/>\nthus giving it another few good years of life, and you&#39;ll get better <br/>\ngraphics performance in the game.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wulfric<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;   From: apcooper <br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, April 09, 2003 1:32 PM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: [EverQuest] Re: Slow load and zoning<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Thanks again for all of the suggestions!
