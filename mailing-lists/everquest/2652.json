The &quot;real&quot; GeForce 4 cards are <br/>\nthe Ti 4400 and Ti 4600, which cost about $300 and $400, <br/>\nrespectively. It&#39;s a marketing gimmick and somewhat underhanded, in <br/>\nmy opinion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   On the other hand, if you do not have an AGP slot, you will be <br/>\nlimited to these less expensive cards. They are not bad video cards <br/>\n(I am running a GeForce 2 Ultra and it works just fine with EQ), they <br/>\nare just deceptively named. <br/>\n&gt;     ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;     From: J.
