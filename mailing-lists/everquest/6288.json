\nthat I had in mind but something completely different.&nbsp;&nbsp; Think \nGregorian Chant form one of the Masters of Chant albums&nbsp; and the theme was \ngonna be completely different.&nbsp; But when i heard that Man O War was gonna \nbe in&nbsp; Orlando I wanted to check the date to see if I&#39;d be able to make it \ndown there to go seem em at the House of Blues.&nbsp; Unfortunately&nbsp; for me \nthat fell on a night that I needed to be at work so&nbsp; That went out the \nwindow but I was kinda surprised to see that&nbsp; Man O War really wasn&#39;t that \nmuch&nbsp; as a group any more and i came across DSG form the Man O War Online \nStore and was pleasantly surprised to see that David Shankle&nbsp; was still \ndoing music and I saw the original video for &quot;Calling All Heroes&quot; and decided to \nrework the Theme&nbsp; for the film centering around the song.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">What&#39;s bad is it took me up to this vid of the 4 or \n5 previous to figure out how to keep the shots in sync with the song lol and \nactually give people an idea of how long they were gonna need to wait in regards \nto Download time.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">And this film is literally the largest yet out of \nall my past ones.&nbsp; </font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Just as an FYI&nbsp; I had full graphics on for all \nthe vid caps used in the film&nbsp; except for the use of Shadows.&nbsp; Already \nwith a system that has an AMD Athlon 1.4Gig processor with 1Gig Ram and a \nGeforce 5500 FX 256MB vid card I tended to lag as you could tell by the vid caps \nand Thats with&nbsp; running WinEQ 2.0 Pro&nbsp; to play Eq all the time and \nusing that proggie for the vid caps, my FPS is at anywhere between 29 to 35FPS \nout of 40 but when I turn on the shadows it takes my FPS down to almost \nnothing&nbsp; and WinEQ&nbsp;actually helps cut down cpu usage.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Once I had the viid caps I use Sorenson Squeeze to \nconvert all or part of the vid caps into a workable format to be used&nbsp; in \ncombining those and the stills using Flash MX 2004 Pro </font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Took me forever to get the FPS for the film to be \njust right as well as figuring out how to get the last few stills to \nappear&nbsp; the way they do at the right time.&nbsp; </font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">once I had the .swf file saved i used Flash \nOptimizer to&nbsp; optimize the film&nbsp; to the least amount of&nbsp;size \npossible and not&nbsp; compromise the quality of the whole thing .&nbsp; Managed \nto get the .swf file from 100MB to 79MB Any lower and the quality of the whole \nappearance went all to hell in a hand basket and back</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Oh and Stephen&nbsp;&nbsp; I took care of what \nyou&nbsp; mentioned and managed to get that uploaded&nbsp;and also&nbsp; fixed a \nminor blooper at the end of the film as well&nbsp; thanks for the \ninput.&nbsp;</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Halyburton <br>70 Barb Fateseer<br>Legion of \nVengeance<br>Saryrn <br>(aka Kwasi) </font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote dir=\"ltr\"\n style=\"PADDING-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"wulftech@...\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wulftech@...\">Wulfric \n  Rennison</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Tuesday, August 02, 2005 5:26 \n  PM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Calling All \n  Heroes</div>\n  <div><br></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">hey Kwasi, glad to see you&#39;re still doing these \n  videos, they&#39;re fun tow atch and you have ood musical selections.&nbsp;&nbsp;
