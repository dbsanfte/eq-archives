It<br/>\nreally wouldn&#39;t have killed them to come up with a low<br/>\nres Vah Shir model and make that an option purely for<br/>\nnon-expansion viewing. This reminds me way too much of<br/>\nwhat Origin did with it&#39;s Ultima/Wing Commander/etc.<br/>\ngames, and i&#39;m sure half the mailing list is saying<br/>\n&quot;Origin who?&quot;. ;)<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Message: 15<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 11 Dec 2001 10:22:31 +0100<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:alexander.jones@...\">alexander.jones@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: I hate Shadows of Luclin and I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; even own it yet...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Old puters work just fine. The only problem you have<br/>\n&gt;is that your video card *MUST* be dx8 certified.<br/>\n&gt;Other than that even going as low as 128 megs will<br/>\n&gt;work. There is not the slightest chance in hell you<br/>\n&gt;can install luclin on that machine tho, cause it will<br/>\n&gt;die while trying to render the new graphics.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t gone over the list, but how many low end<br/>\n(8mb) video cards are dx8 certified? Keeping in mind<br/>\nthat there&#39;s a lot of video card manufacturers who<br/>\neither got out of that aspect of the business or flat<br/>\nout went under, so recent drivers are also a problem.<br/>\nI know Verant can&#39;t cater exclusively to the low end<br/>\nuser, I suppose you could argue they&#39;ve done that by<br/>\nnot making drastic changes in Kunark and Velious.<br/>\nPerhaps in six months once Verant has hammered out a<br/>\nfew more of the hardware issues with patches, this<br/>\nwon&#39;t be as drastic a problem. Although I still hate<br/>\nthis mentality of &quot;we have to release software that&#39;s<br/>\nnot ready to make the xmas sales rush, we&#39;ll patch it<br/>\nto death til it actually works once it&#39;s been<br/>\nreleased&quot;. Software that doesn&#39;t work properly on AMD<br/>\nprocessors is *NOT* market ready yet. :) (what&#39;s AMD&#39;s<br/>\nmarket share up to these days? I believe last number I<br/>\nheard thrown around was 30%)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And you should really get more ram, it isnt that<br/>\n&gt;expensive. Ram and a nice video card and everything<br/>\n&gt;works a lot smoother. CPU power isnt that important.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s the best investment one can make at this point<br/>\nfor the price involved, but for a lot of people simply<br/>\nkeeping up with Verant&#39;s $10 a month (read: high<br/>\nschool/particularly broke college students) and their<br/>\nbroadband fees is expensive enough. In a perfect world<br/>\neveryone would be running 1ghz+ Athlons with a gig of<br/>\nRAM, 40gb of HD space, and new GeForce3 cards, but the<br/>\nreality is that for every one customer running a<br/>\nmachine like that, i&#39;d wager they have five running<br/>\nthe bare min reqs. (or in some cases &lt;gasp!&gt; even<br/>\nbelow ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And dont be so negative, SoL is a whopping expansion<br/>\n&gt;worth the new specs. Graphics are cool (some char<br/>\n&gt;models are a bit weird) but mobs/surrondings<br/>\n&gt;are very nice. The mob features are a LOT improved<br/>\n&gt;adding more tactics to fights. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From what little i&#39;ve heard being unable to actually<br/>\nplay for the last week, it&#39;s a great expansion. :P The<br/>\ngeneral consensus among players I talked to during my<br/>\nweek long pre-SoL binge though was that the game<br/>\nwasn&#39;t really in need of a major earthshattering<br/>\nexpansion. There&#39;s TONS of worldspace that the<br/>\nmajority of us haven&#39;t explored already, plenty of<br/>\ncool items and armor to acquire, the alternate<br/>\nadvancement is interesting but doesn&#39;t effect most<br/>\npeople, etc. I&#39;d go so far as to wager only a tiny<br/>\nhandful (if any) of people have explored every nook<br/>\nand cranny of Kunark and Velious. mmmmmm... Who knows,<br/>\nmaybe if it wasn&#39;t for DAoC Shadows wouldn&#39;t have been<br/>\nreleased for another year. ;) (whole other debate<br/>\nthere though...)<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________ <br/>\nSend your holiday cheer with <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://greetings.yahoo.ca\">http://greetings.yahoo.ca</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
