The higher the<br/>\nnumber for the ping, the worse your connection or speed. When the green bar<br/>\nturns red, you are experiencing bad lag. You are basically not receiving<br/>\nand/or sending information from/to the server in a timely fashion. So you<br/>\nmay disappear from other player&#39;s view or fall behind. Or get hit and not<br/>\nknow it.. That is one of the biggest drawbacks of the online game thing.
