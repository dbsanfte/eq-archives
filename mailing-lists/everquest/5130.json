I used Windows Network Setup Wizard to establish my network. It<br/>\n&gt; leaves much to be desired. The computers all run WinXP Home edition.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yes. I have 5 on a single connection, myself. One is directly connected<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the DSL, and runs a program called Sygate which shares the connection to<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other machines. It has a special configuration package for EQ, but<br/>\nworked<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fine without it, for me, so try working without it first. If you have<br/>\nany<br/>\n&gt; &gt; trouble with it, email me, it has a few rare but known issues that can<br/>\nbe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hard to diagnose but are pretty easy to fix.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at http://www.everquest.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
