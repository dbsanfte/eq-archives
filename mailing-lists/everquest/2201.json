The Necros and Druids<br/>\nimmediately leap up and shout &quot;We&#39;re best!&quot; and<br/>\nfrankly, they are. Necros and Druids solo better than<br/>\nany other class in EQ. Which is better? It&#39;s largely a<br/>\nmatter of personal preferance and where you&#39;re<br/>\nsoloing. Then everyone else crowds in on the thread<br/>\narguing the merits of their pet class. (as in<br/>\n&quot;favorite class&quot;, not Mages ;) Technically really any<br/>\nclass can solo, it just involves unmanagable amounts<br/>\nof downtime, picking less than profitable mobs, and<br/>\nunacceptable amounts of risk... unless you&#39;re a Druid<br/>\nor Necro. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust an afterthought, had to reply to the post<br/>\nquestioning Mage&#39;s dominance as &quot;the pet class&quot;, take<br/>\na look at the message boards on eqvault.ign.com<br/>\nthere&#39;s a large thread comparing the Mage Epic pet to<br/>\nthe highest level Beastlord pet.<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________ <br/>\nWeb-hosting solutions for home and business! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://website.yahoo.ca\">http://website.yahoo.ca</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
