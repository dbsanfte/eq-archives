Now max is 26k.<br/>\nIt&#39;s because I&#39;m being a slick. Basically the phone company was lazy and<br/>\nrather than giving me a full phone line, they set up a slick where they<br/>\nspliced up existing lines and spread them out among houses in my area. So we<br/>\nonly get partial lines and low bandwidth. I talked to my ISP and they first<br/>\nsuggested I was behind a slick. When a repairman for my phone company came<br/>\nout he confirmed that we&#39;re behind a slick. Said that the bandwidth was<br/>\nwithin &quot;acceptible&quot; limits. When I asked the phone company about being taken<br/>\nout from behind the slick they didn&#39;t know what one was. After I explained<br/>\nthey denied that I was behind one. I told them that I had been informed by<br/>\nsomeone who worked on the phone lines that I was and that he even told me<br/>\nthe location of the slick. So I have 10 miles of spliced lines. Hell, when<br/>\nthey worked on my neighbors lines they turned off my caller ID, call<br/>\nwaiting, and disabled my main phone line for 3 days. Well, the line wasn&#39;t<br/>\nworking for 3 days. it kept saying it was busy bc they mixed it up with my<br/>\nneighbors. the call waiting and caller ID still aren&#39;t working. I&#39;m trying<br/>\nto find some type of solution to get decent lines. But I can&#39;t even get TV<br/>\nout where I live-- or get my road paved. so I&#39;m probably out of luck.<br/>\nSorry for the rant.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you tried replacing your modem wire? The one that plugs into the wall?<br/>\nThey can go bad, and it&#39;s a cheap fix that can help sometimes on a &quot;noisy&quot;<br/>\nline, if nothing else is really noisy (like the phone).<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: Su<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Sent: Friday, March 15, 2002 3:28 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [EverQuest] Re: MORE then one account?? please explain<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; there are hints about the bandwidth EQ needs on the official EQ site,<br/>\n  &gt; but it is somewhat hard to find ... it is sort of information for ISPs<br/>\n  &gt; so they know how much traffic within an hour or so can occur playing<br/>\n  &gt; this game.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, when I was connecting around 40k we could have 3 people on at the<br/>\nsame<br/>\n  time and not have lag too badly.<br/>\n  but our phone lines here just suck so bad.
