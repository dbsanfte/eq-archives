Very good idea. I think with Lost Dungeons of Norrath they are doing something so that you can add enhancements to your items and that s the closest I can","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2028650769\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; I think that craft items should be more beneficial and thus more<br/>\n&gt; valuable. At present, there is little motivation to craft unless you<br/>\n&gt; have a gaming predilection to do things like that. At present, by the<br/>\n&gt; time you have leveled up enough to aquire materials, plus leveled your<br/>\n&gt; crafting, the items you make aren&#39;t as good as what you can hunt or buy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Very good idea. I think with Lost Dungeons of Norrath they are doing<br/>\nsomething so that you can add enhancements to your items and that&#39;s the<br/>\nclosest I can see to what you&#39;re aiming at. I really do wish that more of<br/>\nthe stuff you make was useful. I think it&#39;s horrendous that you have to<br/>\nspend so much money on acrylia and superb rockhopper hides to make something<br/>\nthat sells for maybe 3pp to other players. I also wish they would do<br/>\nsomething so that they have more tailoring supplies available from<br/>\nmerchants. Heh, I have my tailoring at 167-- cost me over 900pp to get it<br/>\nfrom 158 to 167... And I couldn&#39;t even sell the stuff back to the merchant<br/>\nfor even 1/3 of the cost.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; A real in-game economy would add to the fun. Especially if it would be<br/>\n&gt; good even for casual gamers. I can&#39;t always find the time to play<br/>\n&gt; enough to level and aquire stuff in ways which seem economical. There<br/>\n&gt; should be provision for a good gaming experience even for very casual<br/>\n&gt; gamers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good point. :-)<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
