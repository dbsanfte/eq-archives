Most comprehensive information so far. <br/>\nAllakhazam can&#39;t keep up with all the new stuff and since eqtraders is<br/>\nset up for the tradeskills and nothing else it is ideal for looking up<br/>\nLuclin quests.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLuclin is the best place to play if you like to do quests and<br/>\nroleplay.  I love the quests, lots of challenges and not as mindless<br/>\nas just collecting stacks of things to get faction somewhere.  All of<br/>\nthe quests build on themselves and I love that.  Tho there is a<br/>\npenalty if you loose all your stuff as a newbie, you gotta start over<br/>\nif you loose your cloak cuz you need it to get better stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck and check out that site<br/>\n<br/>\nBebinn Maolcataig<br/>\n25!
