It&#39;s something funky with my mail I guess.&quot;<br><br>aw, mail&#39;s messing up for me too.</p>\n<p>&lt;Steve&gt; Stupid Yahoo! <br><br>&quot;Anyway to answer your email David, I do understand where your<br>coming from but for me that&#39;s the whole point. last night is a good<br>example, I got over to Dagnor&#39;s and unfortunately went the wrong way<br>and got killed, (several times), while trying to recover my body. I<br>also was bound over in WF so that made the trip even more fun! One of<br>my guildmates and a necro from another guild came to my aid but<br>before this happened we spent the majority of the evening trying to<br>get my corpse.&quot;<br><br>:( Why did it take you so long to get your corpse?</p>\n<p>&lt;I was based in West Freeport and I had to take the boat back each time which was the big delay. Plus I was naked the first two times and got jumped. The third time was when a fellow guildmate and a necro stepped in to help. Just the fact I had to keep taking the boat back and forgetting to re-bind is what was so funny about it. <br><br>&quot;To answer the issue of getting invites, well I really don&#39;t<br>have that much of a problem getting them. My Ranger is invited<br>because of her skills in track and sence heading more than for her<br>&quot;gear&quot;.&quot;<br><br>:) you&#39;re lucky. I always hear that them and halflings are the butt<br>of all jokes. and btw, how do you show them that you have high track<br>and sense heading?</p>\n<p>&lt;Steve&gt; They usually ask and I provide the info. Plus my Ranger is kind of &quot;known&quot; over in GF from helping out so many others. I bult up those abilities by making them the first two hotbuttons and then mapping my left and right arrow keys to them. So when I turn left i activate my Sense Heading and when i turn Right I activate my Track. You can do this under the Options selection.<br><br>&quot;My Gnome Warrior is invited alot by lower to mid level classes<br>to help them with exp and funds. Mostly because I enjoy it and don&#39;t<br>really care about my own personal gains.&quot;<br><br>Gnome warrior? That must make some good roleplaying.</p>\n<p>&lt;Steve&gt; Oh man it&#39;s a blast! When&nbsp;I created him I wanted to do something obscure and figured what better than a Gnome! Who would expect such a little guy to whup so much butt! Man he&#39;s fun! He&#39;s also quickly starting to become my favorite. I think this is also the reason for the invites, Heck watching a Gnome go at it on an Orc leigonare is just funny!<br><br>&quot;My Mage is just coming up but he gets invited alot too mostly<br>becuase he can take care of his own pretty well without his<br>magic.&quot;<br><br>ok, um, how&#39;s that possible?</p>\n<p>&lt;Steve&gt; Well when I was able to aquire some funds and was able to purchase a decent piercing weapon he could use I got that and then just started physically attacking instead of casting. believe it or not a Mage can become a pretty decent fighter but it takes time. Plus he&#39;s only lvl10 and the availability of spells I&#39;ve been able to find aren&#39;t the most impressive so I tried to compensate for that. I don&#39;t suggest using them as tanks but as for a solo character they are fun. Now I was very consious about what I attacked and made sure I was able to hang in there or be able to run if needed. It&#39;s nice to have this ability as a backup in case you run out of mana! Right now I&#39;m able to take on 4 Grikbar Kobolds without magic and kill them all. Actually I think it all started because I kept getting frustrated because I kept having trouble casting. <br><br>and gtg, i will finish this later.<br><br>&lt;Steve&gt; Cool! C-ya later!<br></p>\n<p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Steven R.
