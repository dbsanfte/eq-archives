My name is<br/>\n&gt; Cary. I&#39;m 25 years old married. Both my husband and I<br/>\n&gt; play EQ. He is the one that got me hooked. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My Characters:<br/>\n&gt; Venetia Valgrave - Lvl 43 Ench High elf - Currently<br/>\n&gt; gaining exp to dungeon groups and not liking it<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Clawdya Valgrave Lvl 23 - Beastlord Kitty - Currently<br/>\n&gt; in PC<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I play on the the Tarew Marr server with my husband<br/>\n&gt; Morrdak Valgrave who is a lvl 52 Iksar SK. Also a<br/>\n&gt; bunch of My RL friends play on that server. We all<br/>\n&gt; have the family name of Valgrave. Its pretty funny.<br/>\n&gt; Hehe<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to level to 46 as quickly as possible so I<br/>\n&gt; can level in POJ with my friends who are in their 50&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; now. It sucks not being able to level with them. The<br/>\n&gt; Dungeon groups suck because everybody is sooo rude and<br/>\n&gt; I have been jipped out of split 4 times now. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well I just thought I would introduce myself! <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cary<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
