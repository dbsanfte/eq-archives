My graphics card is an <br/>\nNvidia TNT 64 (don&#39;t know what the 64 means, it is 32meg). It is the <br/>\nbest I could find last year for the money I had, and more than <br/>\nadequate for the game at that time. I needed pci, so my choices were <br/>\na bit limited. More than that, my knowledge was much less in those <br/>\ndays.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am curious as to what kinds of graphics cards people use, and <br/>\nwhether or not they are experiencing lag in zones like Rivervale in <br/>\nspite of having a pretty good system.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone have a killer rig, and still find lag or other problems? I <br/>\njust wonder how much is the game, how much my now low end system.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
