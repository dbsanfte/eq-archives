I am sure <br/>\nthat whatever package they are producing will be fair and informative <br/>\nto both players and non-players of Everquest. Call for help is, as you <br/>\nmight guess from the title, is a call-in show where the host help <br/>\npeople out with their computer questions. I hardly think they will be <br/>\ngrilling interview-ees about EQ suicides or any other hot button <br/>\nissues. They may mention the addictive nature of EQ, but I doubt it <br/>\nwill turn into any sort of an inquisition. TechTv has always been cool <br/>\nabout covering computer games and the culture of computer gamers. Heck, <br/>\nthey are sponsoring their own LAN party of Unreal Tournament 2003.<br/>\n<br/>\nAshley Dusenbery<br/>\nDesigner<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ashley@...\">ashley@...</a><br/>\n(901) 383-1200</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
