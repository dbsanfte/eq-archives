I want to be able to go into \n  dungeons for experience instead of outdoor kiting. One of the characters I \n  would like to be is&nbsp;a paladin. I have been playing a paladin/magician duo \n  and it seems really good for dungeon play. I have been looking at \n  necromancers, shaman and druids as well. They all seem to have their strengths \n  and weaknesses. Paladin/Shaman duo seems really good, as the Shaman would be \n  like a third tank. The others would go down fast when \n  swarmed.</font></div><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
