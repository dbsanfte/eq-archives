There is one person <br/>\nthat almost everyone on the Fennin server knows.  Uncledread.  The <br/>\nother night someone petitioned the GM&#39;s on an unrelated issue and <br/>\nright after the gm introduced him/her self, he/she asked if the <br/>\npetition was about Uncledread.  The person went ahead and said yes.  <br/>\nUncledread&#39;s account is now banned lol.  That will hopefully teach <br/>\nhim a lesson and change his attitude towards other people.  I guess <br/>\nhe had so many bad flags on his account that the GM&#39;s decided enough <br/>\nis enough.  Why waste our time on this guy if he keeps ignoring our <br/>\nwarnings.  I&#39;ve only been playing EQ for about 3 months to the day <br/>\nand despite the negative aspects, I am addicted hehe.  Not so much <br/>\naddicted as to getting mad about having to do RL stuff but addicted <br/>\nenough to sometimes say lol in RL speech or to say &quot;group&quot; or &quot;guild&quot; <br/>\nverbally before saying something to someone lol.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 41st Iksar Necromancer formally known as Necrosars Corpses.<br/>\nNow known as Piezie V&#39;rix :(<br/>\n(My name was changed without my knowledge because the combination I <br/>\nsaw as part Necromancer and part Iksar, someone else saw as &#39;NE&#39;(any)<br/>\ncro&#39;SARS&#39; &#39;CORPSES&#39;.  I mean come on.  That is just rediculous.  I&#39;m <br/>\nstill trying to get my name back hehe.  One day, one day.  O btw to <br/>\nedumicate the masses, more people die from the Flu each year than <br/>\nthat stupid SARS thing everyone is so fricken afraid of.  I mean come <br/>\non.  You get more germs on your hands grabbing the door handle of the <br/>\nrestroom than you do wiping your self with your hand.  A lot good <br/>\nwashing your hands did before you touched the door handle lol.  Well <br/>\nI&#39;ll quit babbleing.   I&#39;m just so bored.  I&#39;m at college and i can&#39;t <br/>\nplay everquest on the computers there.  I look forward to reading <br/>\nmore chats :D<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso the 19th Iksar Shaman known as Gloknich.<br/>\n<br/>\nFennin Ro again btw for those that wanna play hehe.  I&#39;m usualy on <br/>\nalmost all day.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
