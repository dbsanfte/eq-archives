I already knew I<br/>\nneeded more video memory but it was excellent to see<br/>\nthe various explanations on this board (good job tech<br/>\nheads and thanks for the info). <br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem is that I have to use a laptop to play EQ<br/>\n(I travel for a living) and I can&#39;t upgrade my video<br/>\ncard... ATI Rage with 8MB of memory.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can run in any zone without trees, but if there are<br/>\ntrees forget about it.  Why Sony put all those damn<br/>\nlittle leafs in that have to be rendered on object in<br/>\nthe landscape is beyond me.  Sometimes when I&#39;m<br/>\nthrashing trying to get by a bunch of trees I&#39;ll go<br/>\nahead and put my toon on autorun (autocrawl actually)<br/>\nand I make a bug report asking why Sony had to be so<br/>\nstupid with landscape features that don&#39;t matter. <br/>\nMake the leafs one solid green circle and the game<br/>\nwould be 100x better for us low video memory players. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, render mobs, render players, render the sky...<br/>\nall that&#39;s cool since that stuff matters to game play,<br/>\nbut when the trees bog me down it makes me mad because<br/>\nthey don&#39;t matter at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuwi Changkane, Grandmaster<br/>\nFenin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Wulfric Rennison &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wulftech@...\">wulftech@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The best answer to your question is go with whatever<br/>\n&gt; your system&#39;s motherboard can support.  If you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; running a PII, there is a possibility you might not<br/>\n&gt; be able to use a 4X AGP card.  The max it may<br/>\n&gt; support is 2X.  If that is the case you&#39;ll have to<br/>\n&gt; go with the card that will fit your form factor<br/>\n&gt; regardless of which one it is.   You might even want<br/>\n&gt; to open the case to make sure you actually HAVe an<br/>\n&gt; AGP slot and that the graphics aren&#39;t built into the<br/>\n&gt; board.  It would suck to buy a card for $200 only to<br/>\n&gt; find out you can&#39;t install it.    But all that<br/>\n&gt; aside, assuming you can use it and either will fit,<br/>\n&gt; then I&#39;d say yes, go with more memory.  I use an ATI<br/>\n&gt; Radeon 9000 128MB 4X AGP.  I&#39;ve had excellent<br/>\n&gt; performance with it.  But the choice is yours. <br/>\n&gt; Either way, you&#39;ll still get better results.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wulfric<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;   From: apcooper <br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, April 09, 2003 2:47 PM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: [EverQuest] Re: Slow load and zoning<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Thanks very much indeed for that excellent<br/>\n&gt; explanation!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   From what you say then, I would be better off with<br/>\n&gt; a 128Mb ATI Radeon <br/>\n&gt;   based card than a 64MB nVidia for my money?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
