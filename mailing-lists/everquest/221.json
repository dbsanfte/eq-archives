That doesnt seem to make<br/>\nsense. The only reason I can think of is that when you<br/>\nload a zone you need to recieve lots of packets<br/>\ncontaining info on the position and status of each NPC<br/>\nand PC in the zone. What items are for sale for how<br/>\nmuch and what kinda loot each mob has although that<br/>\ninfo could wait untill the kill. I also thought maybe<br/>\nthe Eq each PC was carrying would have to be<br/>\ntransfered as well. Or at least the texture map for<br/>\neach diferent item and which character might be<br/>\nassociated with which particular texture map. <br/>\nAfter the zone is loaded you only need to recieve<br/>\nupdates. Also obviuosly the graphics change but these<br/>\nare locally stored and load rather quickly. I think if<br/>\nthe Zone was on a different server it would load<br/>\nquicker. As each physical machine is supporting fewer<br/>\nplayers they can spend more time sending info and less<br/>\ntime crunching data. I agree about pipe and processor<br/>\nsize I have a cable modem and an AMD 333 and I zone in<br/>\nabout 8-10 seconds sometimes faster depending on the<br/>\nzone and I would guess how crowded it is. <br/>\n<br/>\n--- Shane Horne &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dextrin@...\">dextrin@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Shane Horne&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dextrin@...\">dextrin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The reason it takes so long to go from zone to zone<br/>\n&gt; is your going to another <br/>\n&gt; server.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lilu<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
