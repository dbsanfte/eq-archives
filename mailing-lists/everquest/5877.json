And I advice you to do the<br/>\ntutorial. You&#39;ll get a nice little charm just for<br/>\ntalking to all the folks there. And you can get to lvl<br/>\n5 fairly easy with not as much fear of being killed.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll probably be ok with just what comes with<br/>\nEvolutions for a while. LDoN, GoD and OoW are all for<br/>\nhigher levels. (Well, you can technically start using<br/>\nLDoN at lvl 15, but you can&#39;t go on an adventure until<br/>\nyou&#39;re 20)<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome back to Norrath!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Starshyyn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starshyyn@...\">starshyyn@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Merry Meet!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a sorta newby question.  Last spring I bought<br/>\n&gt; Evolution thinking I would<br/>\n&gt; re-join Norrath.  Well, apparently not!  My system<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t handle the change<br/>\n&gt; on the first of April (no matter what I tried, my<br/>\n&gt; sad, tired machine couldn&#39;t deal<br/>\n&gt; with the changes).  So, now I have a new machine<br/>\n&gt; that will work with the game<br/>\n&gt; and will be getting dsl shortly.   I will be using<br/>\n&gt; the game I bought (Evolution) and<br/>\n&gt; would like to know if any of the expansions beyond<br/>\n&gt; LoY offer anything for the<br/>\n&gt; &#39;new&#39;, young player or if they are mostly for above<br/>\n&gt; levels 20, 30, 40, 50 or more?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When I first played (on a borrowed account to see if<br/>\n&gt; I would like it) I couldn&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt; out of the room/building where I was created!!!  It<br/>\n&gt; was hysterical!  My Mentor had<br/>\n&gt; to come get me!  and he was kos in Felwithe!
