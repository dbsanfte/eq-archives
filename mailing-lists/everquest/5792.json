I have played for two years or so <br/>\nnow and I love the game. I had friends who played, and i did not <br/>\nunderstand how or why they could spend so much time and effort <br/>\nplaying an online game. They all responded...&quot;Play it for a month <br/>\nand you will understand&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI did, and it didnt take me a month to understand, it took me a few <br/>\ndays. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe game overall is..fun. It allows you to &quot;pretend&quot; to be someone <br/>\nyou aren&#39;t, who you want to be, and within certain guidelines, <br/>\nbehave how you want to be. There are those heavy-duty &quot;role-players&quot; <br/>\nand those who are not. I am in between I guess. I have 2 accounts <br/>\n(16 toons)and with some I roleplay and others I just play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have made alot of friends on EQ, and alot of enemies too ( mostly <br/>\nfolks who do not appreciate the true evil-nature of the Dark-Elf or <br/>\nthe snobbyness of the High-Elf.) Most importantly though, I have met <br/>\nthe love of my life on EQ and know of others who have done so as <br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ is a thinking game. There is as much knowledge, research, and <br/>\nstudying to EQ as there is in most peoples real lives. There are web-<br/>\nsites who are dedicated to Everquest, many that I frequent <br/>\neveryday...(much for the reason of being informed before I enter <br/>\nNorrath)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found EQ to be a stress reliever too. I know I am not alone <br/>\nwhen I say that killing some mob in EQ after a very stressful and <br/>\nLONG day doesnt make you feel good. It&#39;s a good feeling when you and <br/>\na group of people manage to kill a whole lot of mobs (train).<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I have spent around 72 hours straight in EQ..only <br/>\nstopping when my computer would crash or I lost connection. LOL. <br/>\nPlay the game, you will like it.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
