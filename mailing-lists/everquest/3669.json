It will be a topographical map<br/>\nand nothing more.  No landmarks, no points of interest.  There will be<br/>\nno info about what mobs are in the zone etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I will stick with EQ atlas for now, the maps are detailed<br/>\nenough that I don&#39;t get lost (usually) and I can usually find what I am<br/>\nlooking for after adventuring for a little bit =D<br/>\n<br/>\nKatashaka Naboombu<br/>\n47 Vah Shir Shaman            Claws of NIght<br/>\n<br/>\nGwenevieve <br/>\n30 High Elf Cleric of Tunare    Claws of Night</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
