So, starting and stopping and restarting songs fast<br/>\n&gt; enough will allow you to have multiple song effects active all at the same<br/>\n&gt; time.  I think 3 songs at a time is what most people try to manage.  The<br/>\n&gt; best method I&#39;ve seen to do this is by programming a hotkey that would<br/>\n&gt; look something like this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; /pause 30;/sing 1<br/>\n&gt; /pause 30;/sing 2<br/>\n&gt; /pause 30;/sing 3<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When you hit this hotkey, it would start song in spell slot 1, wait 3<br/>\n&gt; seconds, start song in spell slot 2, wait 3 seconds, then start song in<br/>\n&gt; spell slot 3.  When you notice the effects of song 1 fading, you hit the<br/>\n&gt; hot key again and it starts over.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a lvl 5 bard char which I have only played a little.  If anyone<br/>\n&gt; knows of better ways to twist songs I would like to hear them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -mac<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
