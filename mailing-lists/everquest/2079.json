All of us were newbies \n  once.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Question: Is it possible for someone to Steal or Loot my \n  corpse? The book<br>says no but I beg to differ.<br>&gt;Is it possible that I \n  had two corpses out there? Meaning, When I went back<br>with a dead body I \n  died again?&nbsp; &gt;Which meant I found the wrong corpse?<br>&gt;<br>You \n  must have found the second corpse. It can be tough sometimes getting \n  the<br>right corpse if you die more than once. And sometimes if you don&#39;t have \n  any<br>items other than foraged food, you lose the foraged stuff anyways and \n  just<br>get back the food you started with. Up to level 5 I think you get \n  your<br>food/drink and tome of discord back. I think your starting weapon \n  too.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;And to add one last question, &quot;what do I do now? seeing as \n  I have no food,<br>no money, no nothing?&quot;&nbsp; Do I &gt;beg or do I start \n  another char?<br>&gt;This game is totally fun but with the fact of trying to \n  learn which way to<br>go all the time and dying, it is starting &gt;to get to \n  me,<br>&gt;I don&#39;t want to give up just yet and I turned to this board since \n  the Chat<br>from the game options was &gt;USELESS.<br>&gt;<br>Well, if it bugs \n  you that much, you can start over again. But even if you<br>lose everything, \n  at that low level you can just keep the character and just<br>build your items \n  and such back up again. I recommend that you not carry<br>anything you really \n  don&#39;t want to lose until you get level 6. Keep<br>everything else in the bank. \n  Especially your money. Oh, and practice<br>foraging alot. It will help you \n  later on in the game. Trust me. Begging is<br>not a good idea. Begging tend to \n  piss people off. And you might want to<br>avoid orc camps at that level. at \n  least stay close to the lift with a good<br>group and have someone to pull \n  wandering orc cents. I think even some orc<br>pawns might give you xp at that \n  level.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Please help and Thanks in \n  advance<br>&gt;Rob<br>&gt;<br>You&#39;re welcome.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit \n  the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
