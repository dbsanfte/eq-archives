Mostly used by the big <br/>\nguilds to schedule epics but it&#39;s also used for lower level raids.  <br/>\nYou can look up guilds for your server from this site, that&#39;s how I <br/>\nfound my guild.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquestraids.com\">http://www.everquestraids.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nEQ links-- a general info site.

On Bristlebane, every five mins <br/>\nin Sharvahl there is a shout about the citizen quest, I put locs that <br/>\nare needed on hotkey so i didn&#39;t have to type it anymore.  FV is a <br/>\nhard server to learn about EQ on because of the ruleset.  Try a <br/>\ndifferent server-- don&#39;t go for a PVP one till you understand how to <br/>\nplay better.  Most of the people on FV have been playing for a long <br/>\ntime and they wanted a challenge, that&#39;s why they want to solo all <br/>\nthe time. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you wanna come to Bristlebane look me up<br/>\n<br/>\nBebinn Maolcataig<br/>\n30 Woodelf Ranger<br/>\n<br/>\nLindir <br/>\n12 Vah Shir Bard<br/>\nBristlebane Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
