To do this","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-37673525\">Speaking of trade skills and great items, there is a new earring you can<br/>\nmake if your trade skills are high enough or you have a lot of friends.<br/>\n <br/>\nTo do this quest you need the trade skills to make 9 gifts. All 9 gifts are<br/>\ntradable. Some gifts are harder than others. Once you have all 9 gifts, put<br/>\nthem in the forge and hit combine, you can not fail at this last combine.<br/>\nYou will receive an Earring that is druid only called Xanthe&#39;s Earring of<br/>\nNature with stats of AC 5 STR 8, STA 8, WIS 10, HP 55, mana 55, sv fire 7,<br/>\nsv cold 7, sv magic 7 and recommended level 51. Druid only ! You also<br/>\nreceive the spell called Protection of the Cabbage. This spell is no drop<br/>\ndruid spell, single target version on the Protection of the Glades, level<br/>\n59.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are not a druid, you can take this earring to Fungus Grove and turn<br/>\nthe druid only earring into Rebecca and she will give you a new one. The all<br/>\n/ all earring is called Earring of the Solstice and the stats for the<br/>\nearring are AC 5, STA 5, WIS 8, INT 8, HP 55, mana 55, sv fire 5, sv cold 5,<br/>\nsv magic 5 and recommended level is 51. All - All<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of the trade skill combines are not trivial to a 250 skilled tradesman.<br/>\nSo be prepared to work to get this item. My guild made about 18 of these<br/>\nEarrings this past weekend. We all worked as a team and collected<br/>\ncomponents, bought gems and killed mobs for the needed items. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would say of the 9 gifts needed, the hardest gift is the Ceremonial<br/>\nSolstice Robe. This robe is selling on my server for 10,000 platinum. I have<br/>\nsold 2 of them for my guild. My guild mate has a tailoring skill of 241 and<br/>\nit is good to see that he is making some good money for all the hard work he<br/>\nhas done over the last 18 months. He also completed his 8th prayer shawl. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother guild mate has a smithing skill of 244, but 3 weeks before this, his<br/>\nskill was below 50. Smithing is a lot easier to raise that tailoring.<br/>\nTailoring takes forever to raise. Could you imagine clicking 150 combines<br/>\nwith a skill of 240 and not getting 1 skill increase? This is how it is for<br/>\ntailoring.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not want to bore anyone by copying and pasting the entire quest, but I<br/>\nwill paste just 2 of the 9 gifts you need to give you an idea how complex<br/>\nthis quest is. Just notice how many combines are not trivial at 250 skill. I<br/>\nwas in the group when they were making the robes and I saw the first 20 robe<br/>\ncombines they had 3 successful tries out of 20 and the next time he was 5<br/>\nfor 20. <br/>\n<br/>\nCeremonial Solstice Robe Gift<br/>\n*\tCombine: Gem Studded Chain + 3 Sacred Tunare Silks (unstacked) +<br/>\nTunic Pattern + Embroidery Needle (sewing kit, tailoring trivial &gt;250, gem<br/>\nstudded chain and embroidery needle returned on failure, needle returned on<br/>\nsuccess) <br/>\n<br/>\n\tOther combines that you need<br/>\n*\tGem Studded Chain = Worked Silver Chain + Sapphire + Ruby + Emerald<br/>\n(jeweller&#39;s kit, jewelcraft trivial &gt;250) <br/>\n*\tWorked Silver Chain = 1 Enchanted Bar of Silver + 1 Metal Bits +<br/>\nwater (forge, smithing trivial 111) <br/>\n*\tSacred Tunare Silk = 1 Silk Swatch + Celestial Essence + Blessed<br/>\nDust of Tunare (sewing kit, tailoring trivial 135) <br/>\n*\tCelestial Essence = 1 Celestial Solvent + 1 High End Research<br/>\ncomponent (mortar and pestle, no-fail combine) <br/>\n*\tBlessed Dust of Tunare = 1 Imbued Emerald + 1 Celestial Essence + 1<br/>\nJar of Acid (kiln, pottery trivial &lt;=122) <br/>\n*\tEmbroidery Needle = Needle Mold + water + Metal Bits + Celestial<br/>\nEssence (forge, smithing trivial 122) <br/>\n<br/>\n\tMisty Thicket Picnic Gift<br/>\n*\tMisty Thicket Picnic (miraculous meal, STR 5, STA 5, WIS 5, INT 5,<br/>\nsize: large) = 1 Picnic Basket + 1 Marmalade Sandwich + 1 Jumjum Spiced Beer<br/>\n+ 1 Jumjum Salad + 1 Royal Mints + 1 Mature Cheese + 2 (unstacked) Jumjum<br/>\nCake Slices (oven, baking trivial &gt;250, yield 4 picnics) <br/>\n<br/>\n\tOther combines/items that you will need<br/>\n*\tPicnic Basket = 1 Woven Mandrake + 1 Steel Boning (sewing kit,<br/>\ntailoring trivial 76, yield 10, snack) <br/>\n*\tWoven Mandrake = 2 Mandrake Roots (unstacked) (sewing kit, tailoring<br/>\ntrivial 66) <br/>\n*\tSteel Boning = 1 Small Brick of Ore + 1 File + water (forge,<br/>\nsmithing trivial &lt;44) <br/>\n*\tMarmalade Sandwich = 1 Apricot Marmalade + 1 Loaf of Bread (mixing<br/>\nbow, baking trivial &lt;=111, yield 12 sandwiches) <br/>\n*\tApricot Marmalade = 3 Frosting (unstacked) + 1 Fruit (oven, baking<br/>\ntrivial &lt;=111, yield 6 marmalade) <br/>\n*\tJumjum Spiced Beer = Barley + Hops + Spices + Water + Bottle +<br/>\nJumjum Stalk (brew barrel, brewing trivial 162, yield 10 beer) <br/>\n*\tJumjum Salad = 1 Vegetables + 1 Lettuce + 1 Fennel +1 Jumjum Stalk<br/>\n(mixing bowl, baking trivial 142, yield 10 salads) <br/>\n*\tRoyal Mints = Eucalyptus + Frosting (mixing bowl, baking trivial<br/>\n&lt;=83, yield 10 mints) <br/>\n*\tMature Cheese = Rennet + 2 Milk (unstacked) + Dairy Spoon (mixing<br/>\nbowl, baking trivial 84, yield 10 cheese) <br/>\n*\tDairy Spoon = 2 Metal Bits (unstacked) + Scalar Mold + water (forge,<br/>\nsmithing trivial 86) <br/>\n*\tJumjum Cake Slice = 1 Jumjum Cake (oven/spit, baking trivial &lt;=152,<br/>\nyields 10 slices) <br/>\n*\tJumjum Cake = Jumjum Stalk + Frosting + Clump of Dough + Winter<br/>\nChocolate + Cake Round (spit/oven, baking trivial 166, yield 20 cakes) <br/>\n*\tWinter Chocolate = 1 Brownie Parts + 2 Frosting (unstacked) (mixing<br/>\nbowl, baking trivial 95) <br/>\n*\tbrownie parts drop off pretty much any brownie (Lesser Faydark,<br/>\nGreater Faydark, Steamfont?), as well as from Nillipus in Rivervale <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for making this email so long, but if you have any questions about<br/>\nthis quest or anything else, ask away.<br/>\n<br/>\nSistily <br/>\nGnome Warlord</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
