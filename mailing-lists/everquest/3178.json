Even though it makes fighting at a young age tough, I&#39;m working on all her weapon skills. As a result, they are all fairly low right now. But I feel that later on it will be worth it. My RL boyfriend plays a warrior as his main and at lvl 51, he&#39;s only good at a couple of weapon skills. He&#39;s the one who told me to train in all weapon skills since you find some nice weapons later in the game.\n<p>&nbsp;<b><i>Rob LeBeau </i></b> wrote:\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote style=\"PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#1010ff 2px solid;\"><tt>Ok, I have a level 11 warrior and would like your<br>opinion on the following:<br><br>I started wondering why I was not hitting that much<br>with him even though he has a good weapon.
