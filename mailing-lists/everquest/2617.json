I am still in <br/>\nthe middle of that research.<br/>\n<br/>\nI go to the caster&#39;s site and use the druid equipment list. I grab <br/>\nany info on items which look good to me. Mostly stuff with wisdom and <br/>\nac, and the more positive buffs the better. Once I have collected all <br/>\nof the items for a particular slot into one file, I use Allakhazam to <br/>\nfill in details. This goes farely quickly if I use two windows and <br/>\nmove back and forth. Once all of the data is collected I organize the <br/>\ninfo in the file by level to attain. Tailored and quest items are at <br/>\nthe top of the list, drop items following.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of work, but I have been doing a little every day. I have <br/>\nlearned a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nAllakhazam has a new wish list system for subscribers. If you want <br/>\ntailored info but don&#39;t want to do the work listed above (or any <br/>\nother method with similar results), the subscription is a good value.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
