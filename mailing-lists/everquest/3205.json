They haven&#39;t gotten the boats running, and the <br/>\nshuttles just sit at the dock. However, on the dock is a temporary <br/>\nNPC who will translocate you to Timorous Deep. The one in TD will <br/>\nsend you either way. I went to FV and set my bind point, but then <br/>\nreturned to SK to finish my goals of gathering a full toolbox of <br/>\nPlains Pebbles and completing level 32. Dinged 33 last night, went to <br/>\nRivervale to put my things in order, and put my toon to bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu, I am not sure that a level 33 hanging around KC in DL is a very <br/>\nsurvivable idea. I am more inclined to Frontier Mountains. <br/>\n<br/>\nI tend to approach the game in a semi-role-playing way. The game <br/>\nallows us to go boldly almost anywhere, as death is no very big deal. <br/>\nI prefer avoid game death, planning my moves with care and setting <br/>\nincremental goals. I think Frontier Mountains is a good step.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will keep in mind your advice, however. As I level up I will still <br/>\nneed those Brute hides, and the KC hunting experience will be a good <br/>\nlater step.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
