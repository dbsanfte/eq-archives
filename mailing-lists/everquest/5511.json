You can get to level 7 in steam front killing <br/>\nkobolds.. then go behind the windmills to reach level 10.. at 10 if <br/>\nyour gear is ok.. nothing great... head over to kurns tower till <br/>\naround 16 or 17.. then after that head over to pauladal caverns <br/>\n&lt;sp&gt;  good to level 24 at least.. after that go to the caverns <br/>\nbetween nexus and dawn shroud peaks.&lt;forget the name sorry&gt;  that <br/>\nget you to 27 maybe 28. after that go to marus saru till 30 then <br/>\nhead over to split paw till 34...  thats a good way to solo without <br/>\nbeing PLed.. But if you have LDON  at level 20 try to get groups in <br/>\nthere.. not bad loot and great exp and fun..  Hope that helps some.. <br/>\ngood hunting...  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                               Rickey....<br/>\n56 druid<br/>\n38 beast lord<br/>\n32 mage<br/>\n17 ranger<br/>\n                                                                     <br/>\n                                                                     <br/>\n                                                                     <br/>\n                                                                     <br/>\n                                                                     <br/>\n                                                                     <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;W&quot; &lt;bamafan0971@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I have recently (taday actually) renewed my EQ fascination <br/>\n&gt; (addiction?). In my previous EQ days ( I quit right after PoP came <br/>\n&gt; out) I played strictly melee characters....had a 57th lvl Barb <br/>\n&gt; Warrior, and a 59th lvl Hum Monk. I got tired of the endless <br/>\n&gt; searching for groups, and the seeming HUGE overload of really well <br/>\n&gt; equipped melees on my server (Tunare) so this time around I <br/>\ndecided <br/>\n&gt; to go with a high demand class, and finally, after much <br/>\n&gt; consideration, I decided to play the class I most loved duoing <br/>\nwith <br/>\n&gt; as a monk, the Shaman. I rolled up a Barb Shaman with my new EQ <br/>\n&gt; Evolutions software, and -pop- there I was, back in Halas again <br/>\nafter <br/>\n&gt; nearly a yeas absence. A lot of things came back to me, and within <br/>\na <br/>\n&gt; couple of hours, I hit lvl 5, got my new spells, and then I hit a <br/>\n&gt; brick wall. Non of my old friends seem to be around anymore, so I <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t have them to ask for advice, so I turned to this group for <br/>\n&gt; help. I have been told Steamfront is the best place to go to lvl <br/>\nup a <br/>\n&gt; shammy for the next few cycles anyway...any thoughts on this? I am <br/>\n&gt; not looking to necessarily powerlevel, though I do miss the high <br/>\nend <br/>\n&gt; raiding, pulling in Kael , the 12 hour raids in HoT in ToV, etc <br/>\nand <br/>\n&gt; would like to get back to those, but I am willing to put in the <br/>\ntime <br/>\n&gt; to learn this classes ins and outs, and make myself an integral <br/>\npart <br/>\n&gt; of any group I join. So any help with where to level, etc would be <br/>\n&gt; great, since it has been since early 2001 that I was a newbie the <br/>\n&gt; first time.........and the old haunts seem to be deserted now. I <br/>\ndo <br/>\n&gt; like the new transport systems, made getting out of Halas much <br/>\neasier <br/>\n&gt; than it was with my warrior ( the run to Freeport with a lvl 5 <br/>\n&gt; nightblind warrior in cloth armor was harrowing lol) ...also if <br/>\n&gt; anyone has a main or an alt on Tunare that would like to group <br/>\nwith a <br/>\n&gt; n00b shammy and help him get the hang of it all, send a tell to <br/>\n&gt; Karudore  ..... see you all soon.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Karudore - lvl 5 Barb n00b shammy, Tunare<br/>\n&gt; R.I.P.<br/>\n&gt; Karudor (warrior)<br/>\n&gt; Kerudor (monk)<br/>\n&gt; I miss you guys !!!!!!!! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
