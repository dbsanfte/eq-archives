Group skill are<br/>\npretty important, I&#39;ve been in several &quot;groups&quot; that have just been all over<br/>\nthe place and ended up getting creamed by pretty easy mobs for that group.<br/>\nIt&#39;s mostly due to the group consisting of mostly tanks or casters. The<br/>\nTanks usually end up running all over the place and the casters usually end<br/>\nup running all over the place trying to stay alive. I usually try to form<br/>\ngroups and specify that I need a little of all classes. It&#39;s tough forming<br/>\nthem but usually pays off once I get them formed. <br/>\n<br/>\nLater!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
