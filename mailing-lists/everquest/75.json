I live in sweden and<br/>\n&gt; preordered the game about one week before the end of beta phase 4, now I<br/>\n&gt; have ordered it from 4 places both domestic(one being the largest comp.<br/>\n&gt; game distributor in sweden) and foreign. But I still haven&#39;t received the<br/>\n&gt; game. Now I am active reader on eqvault as well as participate in mailing<br/>\n&gt; lists, and this is REALLY annoying. Let&#39;s just say I&#39;ve had some extra<br/>\n&gt; time thinking about what class/race I will play.. And if I don&#39;t get the<br/>\n&gt; game within 2 weeks from now I&#39;m gonna give up and buy Ultima or<br/>\n&gt; something, but then again, I would have to kill myself.. :p<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Avron - Totally BUMMED right now! :(<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking for the perfect gift for a friend?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Tell them about ONElist&#39;s 115,000 free e-mail communities!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
