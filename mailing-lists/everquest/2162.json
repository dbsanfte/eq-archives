See just how hard hunting my own will be. I might be wise <br/>\nto postpone the visit to Kunark for a few more levels, from what I <br/>\nhave read here. I am sure I can find something useful to do for a few <br/>\nlevels. Any suggestions for possible good zones in Kunark to work <br/>\nthrough those levels? Might be good to do my leveling there after <br/>\nall. Once I have a Kunark bind point I can move back and forth <br/>\nquickly enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Su&quot; &lt;suceress@k...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Any higher level tailors out there?

You<br/>\n&gt; would need a group at your level. Since you are a druid, people <br/>\nwould really<br/>\n&gt; want you in group there. Sow can be cast. And if you have regen and <br/>\nother<br/>\n&gt; beneficial spells they will love you. Especially since you can <br/>\nheal. If you<br/>\n&gt; have coin to spend, go to highkeep and auction to buy high quality <br/>\nore.<br/>\n&gt; There are usually some players who will part with it. I think the <br/>\nsmall<br/>\n&gt; bricks go for around 5pp and the large bricks around 10pp.<br/>\n&gt; You too!<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
