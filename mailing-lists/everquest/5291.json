I play on the Tunare server.  I have a 13<br/>\n&gt; Iksar Monk<br/>\n&gt; but have been playing my 5 Wood Elf Ranger lately.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My ranger has a quiver that he keeps his arrows in.  I saw a tip when<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; logged on that says keeping arrows in a quiver decreases attack time.<br/>\n&gt;  I can<br/>\n&gt; not get him to draw from his quiver.  The only arrows he uses are in<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; ammo slot.  The quiver will not fit in the ammo slot.  If I have no<br/>\n&gt; arrows<br/>\n&gt; in the ammo slot I get a message &quot;Out Of Ammunition&quot; when I try and<br/>\n&gt; use my<br/>\n&gt; bow, even with my quiver full.  I have tried putting the quiver on my<br/>\n&gt; back<br/>\n&gt; and it won&#39;t fit there either.  I have asked a bunch of people in<br/>\n&gt; game with<br/>\n&gt; no luck, searched the web and looked in my hint book.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; While on the subject of archers, my bow and arrows each have a range<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; damage rating.  My bow is Range 75 Damage 8 (I think).  My arrows are<br/>\n&gt; Range<br/>\n&gt; 25 Damage 1.  What is my range and damage?  100 and 9 by adding the<br/>\n&gt; numbers,<br/>\n&gt; 25 and 1 taking the lower of each?  Something else?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks in advance!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ceeso2003@...\">ceeso2003@...</a><br/>\nAIM: DocCHutto<br/>\nICQ: 326580184 (Ceeso)<br/>\nYahoo Messenger: ceeso2003<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree Pop-Up Blocker - Get it now<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://companion.yahoo.com/\">http://companion.yahoo.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
