Do you remember your \n    first GM <br>event?&nbsp; Or even the most memorable.&nbsp; <br><br>Now I \n    know some of you are asking what are those!&nbsp; Back in the olden <br>days \n    of Everquest, before the new planes were revealed, before the <br>Nexus \n    opened and the moon Luclin moved closer to us, before the great <br>ice \n    sheet that is Velious was found there were mythical beings that <br>walked \n    the land called GM&#39;s.&nbsp; On certain occasions they would come <br>down to \n    the lands of Norrath and alter them.&nbsp; Sometimes they played <br>tricks, \n    or reset a zone to their own liking.&nbsp; Some of you may have \n    <br>experienced this over Christmas, or during Halloween.<br><br>When \n    Tuldayen was a young and very inexperienced Ranger roaming the <br>hills \n    around Qeynos he was involved in such an event.&nbsp; He awoke one \n    <br>morning to find himself in the quiet of Surefall Glade.&nbsp; He took up \n    <br>his trusty Hickory Bow and sheathed his now only tarnished long sword \n    <br>and ventured out into the still unfamiliar hills.&nbsp; But when he \n    <br>entered the tunnel he was met by several of the evil undead.&nbsp; He \n    was <br>lucky enough to jump back into the protection of the glade and \n    <br>avoided death.&nbsp; He thought to himself &quot;where are those guards&quot; and \n    <br>ventured out again.<br><br>He was amazed by what he found.&nbsp; The sky \n    was a deep red, blood red.&nbsp; <br>The entire land was filled with all \n    manner of Skeletons.&nbsp; Many were <br>familiar to him, but many more were \n    not and some were 30 feet tall!&nbsp; <br>It was as if the ancient \n    battlefields of Norrath had spilled their <br>dead on the land.&nbsp; Then \n    he heard the wails of Varsoon the undying and <br>saw great magicks near the \n    ruins.&nbsp; He ran for his life toward the <br>City of Qeynos.&nbsp; When \n    he looked back there were a dozen of the evil <br>creatures behind \n    him.&nbsp; He made it to the city and found many like <br>him.&nbsp; Parties \n    were formed and we headed back to the hills to destroy <br>what evil we \n    could.&nbsp; Oh, many of us fell that day.&nbsp; We had the good <br>fortune \n    to have obtained a bind in the city.&nbsp; Experience was gained <br>and \n    lost, many of us found better weapons amongst the shattered bones <br>and \n    plenty of gold was found.<br><br>Eventually the hills filled with powerful \n    adventurers and the Guilds <br>called upon their members to gather for the \n    war.&nbsp; The Undead War <br>raged for days in the hills around Qeynos \n    until at last enough blood <br>had been spilled to satisify any God.&nbsp; \n    Or GM! ;)<br><br>This was a 1-35 event that went for 8 actual hours.&nbsp;
