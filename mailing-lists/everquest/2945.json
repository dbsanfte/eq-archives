(Forgive my","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-572839393\">Hi all, <br/>\nHaving been a fan of computer RPG&#39;s for years I am considering trying <br/>\nEQ. Having never played an online rpg before I have a few questions ?<br/>\n(Forgive my lack of knowledge and feel free to laugh at my questions)<br/>\n1. Being used to playing solo games I could pretty much play at my <br/>\nown pace. How does EQ work? I know you join other online players but <br/>\nseeing as I am a casual gamer i only spend  10-15 hours a week gaming <br/>\nis this enough for EQ ? I am assuming that play occurs with whoever <br/>\nis online at the time and am I not tied into a specific group/times.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Is it easy to find other adventurers to join with? <br/>\n<br/>\n3. I see different EQ&#39;s (Original, Ruins of Kharnak, etc) does it <br/>\nmatter which one I start with or are the later addons geared for <br/>\nhigher level characters.<br/>\n<br/>\n4 Finally system requirements. I have seen the system requirements <br/>\nbut what is recommended ?. I have a P3 866, 128sdram, 32mb ddr nvidia <br/>\ngeforce2 gts card, 56k modem is that suffiecient or should I wait <br/>\ntill I upgrade.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any feedback</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
