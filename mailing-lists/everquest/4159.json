To actually<br/>\n*activate* the account you need to sign up with either a credit card or<br/>\na pre-pay game card. Billing will not occur until 30 days have passed.<br/>\nAs far as I can tell they are pretty good at not billing until after<br/>\nyour 30 day trial runs out.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, you can (as far as I can tell) sign up with your crdit card then<br/>\nimmediately cancel your acount. If you cancel immediately you should<br/>\nthen still have 30 days to try the game out, and if you like it you can<br/>\njust reactivate the account and it will seamlessly continue after the 30<br/>\ndays are up, and billing still won&#39;t start untill the 30 days expire.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd they don&#39;t delete cancelled accounts. You can cancel, come back a<br/>\nyear later and reactivate your account and your characters will all be<br/>\nthere exactly as you left them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHonig Wayfarer<br/>\n55 Ranger<br/>\nCazic Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
