Also you said you used<br/>\ncracked staves, consider switching to 1hs and 2hb, then 1hb if you have<br/>\ntime. At higher levels 1hs is much better for druids then 1hb.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kendan of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n Leader of Knights of Storm Cloud<br/>\n Drunken Druid of Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
