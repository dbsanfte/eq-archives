In","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-287908515\">If you would like to include one example of why, what aspect of the Vah Shir<br/>\nmodel requires DirectX 8.1 I would be happy to accept your line of<br/>\nreasoning.  In fact other then the fact that each model requires a more<br/>\ncapable video card to handle, what aspect of them requires anything other<br/>\nthen DirectX 7.  Sorry don&#39;t buy your argument.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure it&#39;s easy to put some fault on Microsoft. Key is they no longer support<br/>\nWindows 95 at all.  That includes any further DirectX API updates so anyone<br/>\nthat has Windows 95, you no longer own a system that can run any NEW games<br/>\nnow that DX8 has been released.  To say a company need to continue to<br/>\nprovide support for an OS that is no longer supported by its own creator<br/>\n(especially in the gaming world) is somewhat laughable.  If you can come up<br/>\nwith one game out there that supports concurrent multiple version of DirectX<br/>\nother then downward compatibility, list one for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n* there is a section.. A small vocal section of the EQ community that are<br/>\nnot true computer gamers in the sense.  They simply bought a computer one<br/>\nday without the knowledge that some day I will need to buy a new one, or<br/>\nupgrade the one I have now.  They found EQ or someone turn them onto it and<br/>\nbecame addicted.  Now they are tossing their hands in the air and scratching<br/>\ntheir heads.  Anyone that actually is familiar with the gaming community<br/>\nknows the trends and has absolutely no problem with Luclin.*  *funny no-one<br/>\nin my guild (which includes mostly couples, and friends )are complaining<br/>\nabout the requirements* Sure you might have to upgrade your system - but its<br/>\nnot rocket science, nor will it break the bank.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould you sight anywhere that says people don&#39;t want new graphics, and<br/>\nplayer models that update their characters to those comparable, if not<br/>\nbetter then those found in any other graphics based MMORPG.  If you like<br/>\nMUDDs fine stick with them... However everyone here that has Luclin and its<br/>\nnew graphic enhancements by far have been impressed and think their great.<br/>\nSorry I find it hard to believe in your argument.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd your reference to ORIGIN.. Origin started out good.  Then they created a<br/>\nboatload of crappy games, and released a total bomb of a film to the<br/>\ntheater.  They alienated their customers with poor games and bad<br/>\ninvestments.  I don&#39;t know how many millions of dollars they spend on the<br/>\nlast Wing Commander.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I fail to see why loyal customers of up to three years should be punished<br/>\nfor not having an interest in the expansion though.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain.. What aspect of the new cat model requires DX8.  You seem to forget<br/>\nthe whole world engine was updated.  That goes beyond the added looks the<br/>\nplayer models and world landscape.  It&#39;s the underlining graphical<br/>\nprogramming interface.  The engine runs so much faster now ( apart from a<br/>\nhandful of buggy zones atm ).  Aye if ya like MUDDS feel free to enjoy them<br/>\nagain.  I&#39;m a gamer and enjoy innovations/imaginations of those that create<br/>\nthem.  Well, there&#39;s always Ultima Online for you to fall back on ;) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jeff Gaudry [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bgrifter@...\">bgrifter@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Wednesday, December 12, 2001 2:12 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Re: I hate Shadows of Luclin and I don&#39;t even own it<br/>\nyet...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    Date: Tue, 11 Dec 2001 15:29:23 -0500<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Whitmore, Lance&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lwhitmore@...\">lwhitmore@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: Re: I hate Shadows of Luclin and I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t even own it yet...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;It has nothing to do with a low res version of Vah<br/>\n&gt;Shir model.  In fact that is in the game now.  With<br/>\n&gt;the SoL expansion you can set it on a low res version<br/>\n&gt;of the entire game or high if you choose to  that<br/>\n&gt;includes both game world and player models ).  The<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It has everything to do with the lack of an old Vah<br/>\nShir model, which seems to be Verant&#39;s only<br/>\njustification for requiring everyone to update to<br/>\nDirectX 8.1 instead of having a dual standard of &quot;if<br/>\nyou want the new graphics/want to play Luclin,<br/>\nupdate&quot;. There has been no enhancements (at least to<br/>\nmy knowledge) of the pre-luclin graphics aside from<br/>\nthe new character models all of which can be disabled<br/>\nexcept for the Vah Shir model. By allowing users to<br/>\nget by with an older version of DirectX, older video<br/>\ncards are still acceptable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;whole problem here is when Microsoft made a majority<br/>\n&gt;of video cards obsolete with the release of directx<br/>\n&gt;8.. PERIOD...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Argued that one ages ago, not inclined to go back.<br/>\nMicrosoft bashing is easy, Verant chose to push to a<br/>\nhigher hardware/software standard than their customer<br/>\nbase was ready to support, again I point to Origin as<br/>\nan example of what that tends to cause. If anyone<br/>\nrecalls they were among the largest gaming companies<br/>\nin the industry in their heyday, and systematically<br/>\ndestroyed their customer base with increasing hardware requirements. Sure<br/>\nthe games looked great, but only a tenth of the market could play &#39;em. :P<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;problem.  Do you see any other company even<br/>\n&gt;attempting to release a updated DirectX 8 version?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When they have an established customer base, much of<br/>\nwhom are using DX8 incompatable video cards? Nope,<br/>\nVerant appears to be the only one. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;You will, however, never see a DirectX 9 version...<br/>\n&gt;Nor will they be supporting the same program 3 years<br/>\n&gt;from now.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You seem to forget that a significant portion of the<br/>\nEQ community doesn&#39;t want these &quot;improvements&quot;.<br/>\nGraphically the game was just fine, beyond what was<br/>\nnecessary to get the point across. (of course, i&#39;m the<br/>\ntype who still plays MUDs on occasion :) A few pretty<br/>\nnew graphics do not justify alienating a significant<br/>\nchunk of your customer base. (there was already more<br/>\nthan enough worldspace and &quot;phat l00tz&quot; in game,<br/>\n*VERY* few have explored every nook and cranny of<br/>\nVelious and Kunark, nevermind the original worldspace)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Hehe.. Computer technology changes every few<br/>\n&gt;months.. If your still using the same computer you<br/>\n&gt;had 3 years ago, its probably time to upgrade.  Ah<br/>\n&gt;well.. Its Christmas :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>lol, well, I personally don&#39;t have any problems<br/>\nmeeting the reqs aside from the RAM and fortunately<br/>\ni&#39;m in a position to fix that. (well, at least once I<br/>\nget my puter back, damn FedEx :( I fail to see why<br/>\nloyal customers of up to three years should be<br/>\npunished for not having an interest in the expansion<br/>\nthough. This is totally ignoring the astounding and<br/>\nabsolutely brutal bugs that still existed after the<br/>\nrelease date, Luclin is a rather shoddy product from<br/>\nthat perspective, and obviously should have been held<br/>\nback a month or two at least. Amusingly enough, it<br/>\nseems like Verant&#39;s own slogan seems to sum up their<br/>\nattitude &quot;You&#39;re in our world now b*tch.&quot; :P<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________ <br/>\nSend your holiday cheer with <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://greetings.yahoo.ca\">http://greetings.yahoo.ca</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
