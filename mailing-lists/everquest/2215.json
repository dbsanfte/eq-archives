The Necros and Druids<br>immediately leap up and shout \n    &quot;We&#39;re best!&quot; and<br>frankly, they are. Necros and Druids solo better \n    than<br>any other class in EQ. Which is better? It&#39;s largely a<br>matter of \n    personal preferance and where you&#39;re<br>soloing. Then everyone else crowds \n    in on the thread<br>arguing the merits of their pet class. (as \n    in<br>&quot;favorite class&quot;, not Mages ;) Technically really any<br>class can \n    solo, it just involves unmanagable amounts<br>of downtime, picking less than \n    profitable mobs, and<br>unacceptable amounts of risk... unless you&#39;re a \n    Druid<br>or Necro. :)<br><br>Just an afterthought, had to reply to the \n    post<br>questioning Mage&#39;s dominance as &quot;the pet class&quot;, take<br>a look at \n    the message boards on eqvault.ign.com<br>there&#39;s a large thread comparing \n    the Mage Epic pet to<br>the highest level Beastlord \n    pet.<br><br><br>______________________________________________________________________ \n    <br>Web-hosting solutions for home and business! <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://website.yahoo.ca\">http://website.yahoo.ca</a><br><br><br>Visit \n    the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br><br><br>Your \n    use of Yahoo!
