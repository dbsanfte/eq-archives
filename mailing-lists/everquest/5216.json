There is one person <br/>\n&gt; that almost everyone on the Fennin server knows.  Uncledread.  The <br/>\n&gt; other night someone petitioned the GM&#39;s on an unrelated issue and <br/>\n&gt; right after the gm introduced him/her self, he/she asked if the <br/>\n&gt; petition was about Uncledread.  The person went ahead and said <br/>\nyes.  <br/>\n&gt; Uncledread&#39;s account is now banned lol.  That will hopefully teach <br/>\n&gt; him a lesson and change his attitude towards other people.  I <br/>\nguess <br/>\n&gt; he had so many bad flags on his account that the GM&#39;s decided <br/>\nenough <br/>\n&gt; is enough.  Why waste our time on this guy if he keeps ignoring <br/>\nour <br/>\n&gt; warnings.  I&#39;ve only been playing EQ for about 3 months to the day <br/>\n&gt; and despite the negative aspects, I am addicted hehe.  Not so much <br/>\n&gt; addicted as to getting mad about having to do RL stuff but <br/>\naddicted <br/>\n&gt; enough to sometimes say lol in RL speech or to say &quot;group&quot; <br/>\nor &quot;guild&quot; <br/>\n&gt; verbally before saying something to someone lol.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The 41st Iksar Necromancer formally known as Necrosars Corpses.<br/>\n&gt; Now known as Piezie V&#39;rix :(<br/>\n&gt; (My name was changed without my knowledge because the combination <br/>\nI <br/>\n&gt; saw as part Necromancer and part Iksar, someone else saw <br/>\nas &#39;NE&#39;(any)<br/>\n&gt; cro&#39;SARS&#39; &#39;CORPSES&#39;.  I mean come on.  That is just rediculous.  <br/>\nI&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; still trying to get my name back hehe.  One day, one day.  O btw <br/>\nto <br/>\n&gt; edumicate the masses, more people die from the Flu each year than <br/>\n&gt; that stupid SARS thing everyone is so fricken afraid of.  I mean <br/>\ncome <br/>\n&gt; on.  You get more germs on your hands grabbing the door handle of <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt; restroom than you do wiping your self with your hand.  A lot good <br/>\n&gt; washing your hands did before you touched the door handle lol.  <br/>\nWell <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll quit babbleing.   I&#39;m just so bored.  I&#39;m at college and i <br/>\ncan&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; play everquest on the computers there.  I look forward to reading <br/>\n&gt; more chats :D<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also the 19th Iksar Shaman known as Gloknich.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Fennin Ro again btw for those that wanna play hehe.
