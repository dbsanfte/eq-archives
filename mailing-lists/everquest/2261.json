I often go to GFay to buy stacks of<br/>\nSpiderling Silks, usually park myself at newbie lift<br/>\nand give SoW&#39;s and whatnot. Same deal in EC tunnel.<br/>\nWhat&#39;s really starting to bug me is the number of<br/>\nDruids (and other classes for that matter) being<br/>\ndownright stingy with things like SoW. I mean,<br/>\nnobody&#39;s obligated to give them out, but at least for<br/>\nme access to SoW was one of the primary reasons for<br/>\nplaying a Druid, I don&#39;t mind sharing it cause I know<br/>\nhow good it feels to be on the recieving end of one.<br/>\n(playing my rogue is maddening until some kind soul<br/>\ndecides to SoW me, gods I need JBoots :) When<br/>\nsomething as simple as a laughably tiny amount of mana<br/>\nthat will be recovered in two seconds of medding can<br/>\nenhance another person&#39;s gaming experience that much,<br/>\nI see it as a bargain. Plus, more often than not, for<br/>\nevery ten or so SoW&#39;s I give out, I get a Clarity in<br/>\nexchange, or someone cuts me a deal on an item, or<br/>\nsome other nicety. (had one guy give me a HQ Bear Pelt<br/>\nlast night just because I SoWed him :) In a way I also<br/>\nview it as my contribution to the community as a<br/>\nwhole. People have been very generous and helpful so<br/>\nfar, it&#39;s the least I can do to give back a little. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________ <br/>\nWeb-hosting solutions for home and business! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://website.yahoo.ca\">http://website.yahoo.ca</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
