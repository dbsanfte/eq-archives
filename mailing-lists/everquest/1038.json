I constantly take alot longer to<br/>\nget places with my cleric bc I heal everyone in sight and give binds if<br/>\npeople are asking. People don&#39;t even have to ask for the heals. I click on<br/>\neveryone around and if they look injured I heal them.<br/>\nWhen I started a newbie character I helped some other newbies out and they<br/>\nin turn helped me.<br/>\nI&#39;ve made some good friends.<br/>\nIt&#39;s fun.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I&#39;m on Bertoxx......<br/>\n&gt; Anyway....It&#39;s a good thing to help newbie&#39;s when you see one.  Helped a<br/>\n&gt; newbie by explaining the /loc command and showing him around Kelethin.<br/>\n&gt; turns out that that made his level 40 brother very happy...now he wants to<br/>\n&gt; make me happy (hopefully NOT in that way)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; so...the moral of the story is:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Help newbies....you just might be helping them help you in the long run.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sarakan the helpful<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;       Yahoo!
