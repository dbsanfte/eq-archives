I<br/>\ndon&#39;t even know myself if I will move or stick here. Sometimes I feel<br/>\nlike moving, sometimes I want to keep at this version. I seem to be<br/>\nplaying less and less, for various reasons. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be nice to get in on the beginning of the game. Be part of<br/>\nthe discovery, part of a new economy. On the other hand, I have spent<br/>\ntwo years on this game, and there is a lot invested in the original<br/>\nversion. Not to mention that only recently did my son get a computer<br/>\nable to play the full game in all it&#39;s glory.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill a decision for the future. May be that we will have accounts in<br/>\nboth games, though where I will get the time to play on both I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow. I don&#39;t retire for at least seven more years. Now then I shall<br/>\nbecome a full-time gamer. Oh, yeah!<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Wulfric Rennison&quot; &lt;wulftech@e...&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There is the monthly fee of $12.95 for access to the servers in<br/>\n </span></blockquote>order to play.

I bought EQ in july for about 50<br/>\nbucks and a month later they came out with the package deal that had<br/>\nall expansions except LDON and it also had loy in it which i stil<br/>\ndon&#39;t have for 30 bucks.  Of course thats the gaming industry way hehe.   <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     Your use of Yahoo!
