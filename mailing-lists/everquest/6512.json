Euuuuw! My neighborhood has some <br/>\nmajor real estate issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk. Now I&#39;m pisseed off at the gods. How dare they allow my <br/>\nneighborhood to get demolished!? Somebody blew up Luclin while those <br/>\ndivine beurocrates were out taking a lunch break. Don&#39;t they have <br/>\npagers? Oooh the humanity!<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a slightly more serious note, the kitties in Everquest II took a <br/>\nnose dive in their appearence. The character customization features <br/>\nlet you personalize you characters better. That&#39;s welcome. But I <br/>\nstill don&#39;t like the way the Everquest II kitties looks. They just <br/>\ndon&#39;t look good.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomebody decided that having a free public portal system to <br/>\neverywhere was just too easy. That seems to be gone from the game. <br/>\nNow you have to look for ships, portal spells and people who can port <br/>\nyou. Travel is a little bit less easy. I have mixed feeling about <br/>\nthat. On one hand it makes the game feel more realistic if travel <br/>\nisn&#39;t too easy. On the other hand, sometimes I just want to go some <br/>\nplace without a lot of bother about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWill I buy the game? I have mixed feelings about that. The pluses and <br/>\nminuses balance out in both games so that I don&#39;t like Everquest II <br/>\nsignificantly better than Everquest. I also don&#39;t like looking up the <br/>\nthe sky and seeing my home in ruins. The negatives in Everquest II <br/>\nare strong enough that I might buy a short subscription only. I doubt <br/>\nthat I&#39;ll stick with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdward Fox</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
