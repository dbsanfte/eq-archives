I suppose in order to &gt;camp the PGT you just keep killing all the<br/>\ngnolls in the area that Grenix spawns until he does and then you kill &gt;him<br/>\nand get the Tomahawk. I don&#39;t think that is very productive for a level 30<br/>\nranger to do, but it would be &gt;good practice. I suppose you would make some<br/>\nmoney from the items the gnolls dropped as well. Maybe I &gt;will camp the orcs<br/>\non the other side to see if that guy who drops the weight reduction bag<br/>\nshows up.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The PGT isn&#39;t that hard to get. I got it and the cracked darkwood shield a<br/>\nfew times.
