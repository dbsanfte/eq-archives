Just reached lvl 30 last night. I like <br/>\nopen spaces, and for quite some time favored snare/nuke kiting with <br/>\nusing some weapons work at the end. In SK, however, as I began to <br/>\nsolo wandering Aviaks I altered my style to do root/dot/dot with a <br/>\nnuke at the end. If I kited too widely I tended to bump into a <br/>\nhelpful Aviak wanderer, too often big enough to rob me of the kill <br/>\nbecause it forced me to gate.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I am a halfling I have made it my goal to master the skills to <br/>\nmake the imbued leather armor. The Vale leather skills are a <br/>\nchallenge and building toward that has been a goal just as much as <br/>\nleveling. With soloing and foraging in the Karanas for ages I have <br/>\ngotten quite a few plains pebbles for this future use.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe gods of the game are wise. I cannot complete the leather work <br/>\nwithout the special Vale sewing kit. To make the kit I need an ore <br/>\ndropped, I have learned, only from the goblin janitor in Runnyeye. A <br/>\ndungeon. I will have to find a group to help with that one, if I <br/>\ncannot find anyone selling the stuff. Dungeons just don&#39;t work well <br/>\nfor solo druids, in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. Regarding best solo, my druid is my primary and highest alt. I <br/>\nlove soloing this one so much I rarely play my others. I like the <br/>\nindependence of the druid, sowing and binding as needed. The down <br/>\ntime to med is a pain, but I try to take it in a roll-playing spirit. <br/>\nAs to whether or not this is best, I know it is for me right now. <br/>\nLater on I may find I have changed over time, and another class and <br/>\nrace will seem better. For now, however, my halfling druid is just <br/>\nfine.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
