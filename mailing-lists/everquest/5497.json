I had to use the on-board video<br/>\n&gt; from my main<br/>\n&gt; board. Needless to say, the graphics capability lacked a lot.<br/>\n&gt; My character<br/>\n&gt; is a Val Shir. The main board video chip wasn&#39;t capable of<br/>\n&gt; handling the<br/>\n&gt; polygons for clothing. All of the female kitty dancers at the<br/>\n&gt; campfire in<br/>\n&gt; Thicket were completely nude. I sat down in from to the white<br/>\n&gt; tigress for<br/>\n&gt; about 10 minutes and watched her dance. The dances were short<br/>\n&gt; but very<br/>\n&gt; entertaining.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Having played EQ, Asheron&#39;s Call and Dark Age of Camelot I will say that EQ<br/>\nhas the highest learning curve of them all, at least for me.  Part of it is<br/>\nthe ever-changing aspect of the game.  I have a play-guide from 1998 and<br/>\nsome of the stuff in it is flat out wrong now.  I keep finding info on<br/>\nwebsites that does not work.  I do not recall having those problems with AC,<br/>\nand DAOC is to new to be that changed.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
