I didn&#39;t start regretting that until I got to<br/>\naround level 25 or so, and would run out of stamina in longish fights, for<br/>\nexample multi spawns in High Keep basement. I really had to scramble to find<br/>\ndecent stamina gear to get my stamina up over 100, while at the same time<br/>\nnot sacrificing too much in the way of AC, which is also vital for a Ranger.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince Rangers are a chainmail class, they don&#39;t have to worry quite as much<br/>\nabout the weight of their gear as the plate wearing classes do, and nice +<br/>\nstrength gear seems to be a lot more abundant than nice + stamina gear.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say put all 20 pts into stamina, like Castersrealm suggests, or<br/>\nmaybe 15 stamina, 5 strength. If it were not for the fact that Texxas&#39;s<br/>\nfletching skill is at 181, I would re-start him, putting all points into<br/>\nstamina.<br/>\n<br/>\nFroondor Oakenbark, 45 Wood Elf Druid of Tarew Marr.<br/>\nTexxas Rannger, 36 Wood Elf Ranger of Tarew Marr.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Inuyasha&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:liljerseypunk@...\">liljerseypunk@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, October 10, 2002 10:59 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Wood Elf Ranger<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Could someone please let me know where I should put my extra points<br/>\n&gt; for my wood elf ranger that i&#39;m creating.
