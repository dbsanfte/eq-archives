Been tired, so I have actually opted to <br/>\nsleep rather than stay up late/get up early to play. I work twelve <br/>\nhour shifts, so getting an hour a day cuts into my sleep time. Most <br/>\nof the time it is worth while, but this week I have needed the sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe up side of my work schedule is that I get three or four days off <br/>\neach week. If I don&#39;t work overtime, I get lots of hours to game. Not <br/>\na bad deal, most of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if only I could play at work. <br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
