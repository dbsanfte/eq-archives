Yes, the necro was killing quicker than you, but he can&#39;t Port<br/>\nor heal others as effectively, which is supposed to balance effective class<br/>\n&#39;power&#39;. Necro&#39;s are probably the best soloers, with druids close behind.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Matt</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
