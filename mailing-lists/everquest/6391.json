Don&#39;t let distance stop you from making <br/>\nfriends though, because there are some great people who play this game <br/>\nfrom all over the world. I&#39;ve made friends with a bard from Israel and <br/>\na druid from England, and I currently live in NYC. If you or anyone is <br/>\non Stromm and needs some help or is looking to make friends just send <br/>\nan ingame /tell to Karrola 70 beastlord. I also am co-leader of a <br/>\nfriendship based guild on stromm and we can help you learn the game and <br/>\nget some basic gear to start with.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mike Moya&quot; &lt;laffys@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well wanted to say hello to all.
