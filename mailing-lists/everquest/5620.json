Your card is <br/>\nnot that old. It&#39;s part of the GeForce4 series which is one series <br/>\nbefore GeForce FX (in case anyone didn&#39;t know). The 56.64 drivers <br/>\nsupport your card. Also, to reduce headaches, set a restore point <br/>\nbefore upgrading the video drivers. I prefer to uninstall and re-<br/>\ninstall drivers in Safe Mode. In this way, you&#39;re sure the system <br/>\nisn&#39;t using any of the driver files.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you look at SOE&#39;s required specs (forget recommended specs), I <br/>\nbelieve that your system meets or exceeds their requirements.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/tech_support/ts_system_require\">http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/tech_support/ts_system_require</a><br/>\nments.jsp<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, this is SOE&#39;s guide to the DirectX 9.0b upgrade: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=61536\">http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=61536</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJust a thought.<br/>\n-Arthiliel<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, Su &lt;suceress@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve noticed that dx9 isn&#39;t so great.
