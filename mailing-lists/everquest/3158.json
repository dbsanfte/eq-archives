Also, I&#39;m <br/>\nnot playing the game. I can&#39;t get past the account setup.  I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t mention that I had downloaded the full version of the game a <br/>\nfew days ago and got this problem then as well.  one of the things <br/>\nthat I did was remove my unused 56k pci modem, then I moved my <br/>\nnetwork card to a different slot and was able to gett into the new <br/>\naccount screen. I was able to add my name and other registration <br/>\nstuff, but couldn&#39;t go any further as I had no credit card(they are <br/>\nevil) so I went to get a gamecard and when I tried to get into the <br/>\naccount, it kicked me out again!! Back to square one!! I tried <br/>\nbuying the game on cd and got the same issue. <br/>\nBy the way I did defrag(and needed it) but to no avail.<br/>\nMy big question is why can&#39;t I post at the station? I have cookies <br/>\nenabled, I&#39;m signed in and it says &quot;hi muddywag&quot; at the top, but it <br/>\nkeeps telling me that I need to be registered.  AHHH! IWANNA KILL A <br/>\nBAT!!  By the way I CAN play the tutorial.  Which only served to let <br/>\nme know that I&#39;ll REALLY like this game- someday!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;The Mad Macinchaote&quot; &lt;scendera@v...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I had problems with EQ crashing  too...turned out to be a filthy <br/>\nand dying cpu fan.

I have had some <br/>\ninstances in games, DAOC, Warcraft III, where the game would crash <br/>\nor drop to the desktop and defragging the drive helped for a while. <br/>\nI have actually been having problems with EQ dropping unexpectedly <br/>\nlately now that I think about it. I have yet to defrag my HD but I <br/>\nknow I haven&#39;t done it in over a month, so it could be the problem.<br/>\n&gt;     ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;     From: muddywag <br/>\n&gt;     To: EverQuest@y... <br/>\n&gt;     Sent: Sunday, July 07, 2002 2:26 AM<br/>\n&gt;     Subject: [EverQuest] New to EQ and can&#39;t get it started!!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     Hello.  I bought eq today along with a game card.  I installed <br/>\nit, <br/>\n&gt;     went to new account, and when I click it it bounces me to the <br/>\n&gt;     desktop.  i dried disabling my firewall, soundcard, starting <br/>\nwith <br/>\n&gt;     all unnecessary processes disabled.  uninstalled/installed <br/>\nmany <br/>\n&gt;     times.  checked for irq and I found that the cable modem <br/>\nnetwork <br/>\n&gt;     cark was sharing 12 with the onboard sound, tried moving the <br/>\nnetwork <br/>\n&gt;     card and ended up having to reactivate xp!  As it stands, I&#39;ve <br/>\nyet <br/>\n&gt;     to set foot in Norrath.<br/>\n&gt;     I registered at the Station, and tried to use the tech <br/>\nbulliten <br/>\n&gt;     board, but it won&#39;t let me post, says that I need to me a <br/>\nregisered <br/>\n&gt;     user-- I thought I was!!<br/>\n&gt;     anyways, that&#39;s why I&#39;m here.  PLEASE HELP!!  I can&#39;t wait to <br/>\nplay <br/>\n&gt;     my new game!!!<br/>\n&gt;     Thanks<br/>\n&gt;     Dan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     Your use of Yahoo!
