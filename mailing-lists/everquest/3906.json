Yeah, that long ago!  <br/>\nSo I&#39;ve heard all the stories.  A group was acting out D&D and <br/>\nsomeone got injured and died.  A few killed themselves, and probably <br/>\nwould have regardless unfortunately.  It the same thing here. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I&#39;m not encouraging you to tell your parents anything.  If <br/>\nthey&#39;re concerned they can check it out.  Parents need to know what <br/>\ntheir children are doing, bottom line.  They need to find out for <br/>\nthemselves, not what a talking head told them.  To blame a computer <br/>\ngame for your life problems is silly, and typical in our society.  <br/>\nTake responsibility for your life!<br/>\n<br/>\nTul<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Steven R.

We litterally had <br/>\nto <br/>\n&gt; hide our D&D stuff from our parents. This is an age old debate <br/>\n&gt; whenther or not violence in TV, games, movies, ect cause violence. <br/>\n&gt; Personally I believe that no they don&#39;t. The problem is already <br/>\nthere <br/>\n&gt; in the persons mind. Really, think about it. If those mediums did <br/>\n&gt; cause it then why don&#39;t we have more people going around squirting <br/>\n&gt; others with water hoses?

If you watched the program the lady saw the EQ game on <br/>\n&gt; the scren<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and jumped to the conclusion that he killed himself playing the <br/>\n&gt; game.  If<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you listened to the program as well you would find out the man <br/>\nhad <br/>\n&gt; severe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mental illness and he struggled all his liffe with it. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
