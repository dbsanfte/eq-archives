It does <br/>\nnot have an AGP slot, which limited me in selecting a video card. I <br/>\ngot it cheap, two years ago. Not a bad deal, but I have been playing <br/>\na losing game of catch-up with demands by improvements in EQ. The <br/>\nmost critical limitation of my machine was the memory. A large core <br/>\nof memory is the most important factor in getting optimal performance.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven with the $1700 machine, after two years an upgrade to the second <br/>\nfrom the top video card of that time would probably be less than $200.<br/>\nThat is not too bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately, the closer you buy to the bottom of the performance <br/>\nscale, the sooner upgrades will have to be made, and the fewer your <br/>\noptions when you choose to upgrade. This dance can be made to work by <br/>\nthose knowledgable in computer systems and components, but many <br/>\nbuyers will start with a less-than-optimally upgradable system by <br/>\nseeking discounts and package systems. They may not have the <br/>\nknowledge or their systems the option for adequate upgrade.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen again, there come significant changes to fundamental components <br/>\nwhich alter the path of upgrades. For example, Nvidia is getting into <br/>\nthe motherboard market, which may alter standards for performance and <br/>\nthe options for upgrades. Also, some new ideas in video display are <br/>\ncoming forth. One new card allows you to view your game on three <br/>\nmonitors, giving a very wide surrounding view. This is new, and not <br/>\nquite there, but will definitely affect the market and our upgrade <br/>\nchoices.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuite likely I will find a servicable machine next year for less than <br/>\nmy target of $1700. Perhaps I will get lucky and find a real bargain.<br/>\nI am constantly learning, and might be savy enough to buy better next <br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, the game plays well for me, and is very rewarding.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, Rob LeBeau &lt;rlebeau65@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I see your point but I bought a machine for 600.00 a<br/>\n&gt; few months ago and it runs EQ fine.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is only a 1.2 Celeron with 300 and change RAM with<br/>\n&gt; a 64 mb video card.

Generally a console and two games,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; maybe a few more <br/>\n&gt; &gt; items, can be had for $300.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; It is hard to put a decent pc together for gaming<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for under $1000. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; About double that will net a decent machine with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; upgrade potential, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; but without the need to upgrade for some time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The upper end of pc gaming runs around $8000. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Obviously, more people can buy in for $300 than for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the $1000 plus.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Part of me wants to be a pc hotrodder, and build an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ubermachine. Big, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; bad, and hot. With adequate cooling, as well. That<br/>\n&gt; &gt; part of me does <br/>\n&gt; &gt; not have access to the purse. Sadly, real life<br/>\n&gt; &gt; expenses have first <br/>\n&gt; &gt; claim on my wallet.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, I am watching the trends, and encouraging myself<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to adopt the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; philosophy that I am a gamer, and the platform is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; less important than <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the experience. It is within the scope of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; possibility, and probably <br/>\n&gt; &gt; in the path of great profitability for the makers,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that console <br/>\n&gt; &gt; online multiplayer games will be of such game<br/>\n&gt; &gt; quality in the future <br/>\n&gt; &gt; that holding onto the pc platform will be only an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; option, and not a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; necessity.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Alternately, I can see online game manufacturers<br/>\n&gt; &gt; selling systems to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; insure their audience is there. Wouldn&#39;t that be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; grand? Order the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; game and the system all for one monthly payment.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Upgrade components <br/>\n&gt; &gt; will be shipped when software demands require it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your system will <br/>\n&gt; &gt; always be current.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; What will the future hold? I don&#39;t know, but I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sure I cannot be <br/>\n&gt; &gt; shelling out several thousand dollars every other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; year. The cost has <br/>\n&gt; &gt; to be brought in line with the spending capacity of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a large audience, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; or else the hobby will suffer decline.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
