My<br/>\nadivice to that person is, dont get so wrapped up in<br/>\nthe GAME, yes it is a game ya know, that you can&#39;t<br/>\nenjoy it , if you don&#39;t have UBA gear, the best weaps<br/>\nyour PP can buy, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny caster in the game needs to learn skills like Mana<br/>\neffectiveness just like a warrior needs to learn how<br/>\nto pull and when not to pull so casters can med up.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a synergy that makes a good group.  Granted we<br/>\nall make mistakes and most people are forgiving but<br/>\nbecause they took away KEI under 45 and made a few<br/>\nzones harder.  I don&#39;t find that as any substantiated<br/>\nmeans to quit the game.  Yeah the level 30 druid NOW<br/>\nhas to actually do something to gain some levels as<br/>\nopposed to rooting, dot&#39;ng and getting mana back<br/>\nwithin a minute or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike, SU, I remember the times where you only had that<br/>\nshort time to get your corpse.  This game is not as<br/>\nchallenging as it could be.  And with additions like<br/>\nthe bazaar, come on, let&#39;s be real. There are more<br/>\npeople whose main title should be CAPTAIN TWINKIE more<br/>\nnow than ever.  I picked up a shield for my cleric the<br/>\nother night for 700pp and 5 other people were selling<br/>\nthe same shield for 1600-2000pp.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice to you would be, try getting into a GOOD<br/>\nguild, where you meet good people and can enjoy<br/>\ngrouping with them as opposed to the Give me give me<br/>\ngive me syndrome that far too many people seem to<br/>\nhave.<br/>\n<br/>\nSony is making this game more group oriented and I<br/>\nreally can see reasons why they should.  Nothing use<br/>\nto upset me more than some mid level twink going to<br/>\nHigh Keep and just fighting mobs , KS&#39;ng from groups<br/>\nthat were camped there.   Because so many people would<br/>\nsolo, there were more camp fights than I dared to<br/>\ndream about.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings seem a lot calmer now since there are benefits<br/>\nto grouping and not soling. Especially a char like the<br/>\nhalfling druid who now gets more exp in a group at 30<br/>\nthan soloing , since he/she can manage their mana<br/>\nbetter in the group. Yes Soloing still gives more exp,<br/>\nbut the time to med makes grouping a better choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would really love to know what zones are that much<br/>\nharder, cause I can&#39;t find any that are rediculously<br/>\ndifficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you give it another thought and look deeper<br/>\ninto the game for enjoyment.  Heck, I have as much fun<br/>\ntaking an under 10 char to places and getting the snot<br/>\nbeat out of me and I know some people who just love<br/>\ngetting the newbie armor quests, which are a great<br/>\naccomplishment with the # of rare drops.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as far as writing the letter, I think you can see<br/>\nthat the majority of the population are happy with the<br/>\ngames progress and maybe rethinking your letter would<br/>\nsave you time and heartache.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a nice day and Smile, it takes less effort they<br/>\nsay.<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Melanie Johnson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:melanie_6602@...\">melanie_6602@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; --- Su &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  I think that quitting EverQuest over a few<br/>\n&gt; &gt; changes is a bit <br/>\n&gt; &gt; extreme.
