This is also the greatest weakness of monks at<br/>\n&gt; high levels - they have exceptional AC but almost no absorbance,<br/>\n&gt; so get hit for huge amounts when the blow lands.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As an experiment to see the effects, try equipping a full set of cloth<br/>\n&gt; armor ( which as far as I can see has negligible absorbance ) and<br/>\n&gt; attacking a blue monster to get an idea of how much damage it does,<br/>\n&gt; then swap the chest piece for something with good absorbance<br/>\n&gt; such as banded. You will notice that the most of the attacks will do<br/>\n&gt; the same damage, but every so often the monster will hit for much<br/>\n&gt; less - this is when the hit lands on your banded piece.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A full set does not garauntee the lower damage attacks though -<br/>\n&gt; a monster of any level always has a chance to do full damage<br/>\n&gt; with an attack and a monster with a much higher attack than your<br/>\n&gt; defense will almost always bypass your armor when it hits you.<br/>\n&gt; Also, your defense is severely decreased when fighting multiple<br/>\n&gt; oppponents - as an example with a level 15 necromancer in full<br/>\n&gt; woven fighting level 8 skeletons, when fighting one at a time<br/>\n&gt; would rarely get hit for more than 1 point of damage ( the minimum<br/>\n&gt; for a succesfull hit ) but fighting two at once would frequently get<br/>\n&gt; hit<br/>\n&gt; for over 10.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Armor with higher AC values *usually* has a better absorbance,<br/>\n&gt; but this is not always the case - a good example that springs to<br/>\n&gt; mind is the lightweight armors from the innothule swamp/guk area.<br/>\n&gt; Woven armor has the same AC as patchwork, but absorbs<br/>\n&gt; as much damage as leather does, and mesh has the same AC<br/>\n&gt; as leather, but absorbs as much damage as chainmail.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, I am told that Lockjaw&#39;s tunic and snakeskin armor only<br/>\n&gt; absorb damage as well as leather, despite having a much<br/>\n&gt; better AC.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Jason&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:IB_Jason@...\">IB_Jason@...</a>&gt; on 18/06/99 13:21:52<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please respond to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; cc:    (bcc: Michael Wyatt/AU/AMP)<br/>\n&gt; Subject:  Re: [EverQuest] Bronze Armor, a little explanation please?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jason&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:IB_Jason@...\">IB_Jason@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hey,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have heard about absorbtion of armor, but do not understnad the<br/>\n&gt; mechanics/formula/general idea behind it. My deep armor knowledge is<br/>\n&gt; confined to games as primal as UO =) Sooo, if you can do a little<br/>\n&gt; explanation of the general differences between AC and Absorbtion, I<br/>\n&gt; would<br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; most gracious. And also, will I notice a big difference between no<br/>\n&gt; armor<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; my new Bronze (let&#39;s assume it&#39;s a full suit)? I know it should be an<br/>\n&gt; obvious yes, but I have been less than enthralled with armor effects<br/>\n&gt; in the<br/>\n&gt; game so far, and am wondering if I&#39;m going to noticed monsters about<br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt; level that did 20 or so damage suddenly start doing 4 or 5.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks a bunch again,<br/>\n&gt; -Rukkak<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (Just to cover my prospective flame bases, nothin against UO. IT is<br/>\n&gt; just my<br/>\n&gt; personal opinion that EQ is faaaaaar better. =)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael_Wyatt@...\">Michael_Wyatt@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Bronze plate, in addition to being extremely heavy, does not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;absorb damage as well as normal plate.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;On the heaviness side - 86lb may not seem like much, until<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you factor in that you will be carrying at least 10LB of weapons,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;4LB of backpacks, several LB of food and drink, every 40 coins<br/>\n&gt; &gt;weighs 1B.
