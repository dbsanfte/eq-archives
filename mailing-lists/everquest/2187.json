Was there anything different about the gnomes?

Usually im in a group, and as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; happens when fighiting in Oasis, usually one or more of my party<br/>\n&gt; &gt; members gets rabies or is poisoned by whatever mob we are <br/>\nfighting at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the time.  Since as a shaman i have Cure Disease (which cures <br/>\nrabies)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and Cure Poison, i keep them memmed so that if a party member is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; poisoned or becomes rabid, i can cure them (most of the time, it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; works on the first cast, the second one if nothing else).  The <br/>\nother<br/>\n&gt; &gt; day, i was grouped with two gnomes, one a warrior and the <br/>\nother... i<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cant remember, but he was a gnome too, and another barbarian.  We<br/>\n&gt; &gt; were fighting a madman or zombie or something like that, and <br/>\neveryone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but me got rabies.  I healed the barbarian of it no sweat, but i <br/>\nused<br/>\n&gt; &gt; up my entire mana bar trying to heal the gnomes!  For some <br/>\nreason, it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wouldnt work, no matter how many times i cast it!  So i went to <br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dock and there were some other random people that were rabid too, <br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; i healed them without a problem, but i still couldnt heal the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gnomes!! Should i report this as a bug or is this just something <br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is the norm?  Help on this matter would be appreciated!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thank you sooooo much,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lorecie &lt;Vivix Protectorate&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 16th shaman<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Errolisi Marr<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
