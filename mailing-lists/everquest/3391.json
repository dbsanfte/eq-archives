I work 12 hour days, \n  but only <br>three days one week and four the next, on two week pay periods. \n  That <br>means I only have to work 14 days a month.<br><br>The downside is \n  that on work days I have time for work, eating, <br>commuting and sleeping, \n  but for little else. I usually log on for <br>about one hour on those days and \n  work on trade skills. Often too <br>tired to do even that.<br><br>On the days \n  off I am not babysitting my grandchildren I can have nice <br>long sessions. \n  <br><br>As for vacations, I earn vacation at a high rate and often have to \n  <br>take days off just to burn the time. If I don&#39;t use it, I lose \n  it.<br><br>If I take one of my three day weeks off I burn only 36 hrs. and get \n  <br>10 days off. <br><br>I don&#39;t have the stamina to do 10 or 12 hr. sessions, \n  but can do <br>three 3 hr. sessions a day on some days off.<br><br>This is \n  great, but if I retire I can play all of the time. None of <br>that wasted \n  time working. After a great many years of working I can <br>say definitively \n  that work sucks.
