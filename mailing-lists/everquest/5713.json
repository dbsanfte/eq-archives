I see a guard and he does <br/>\nnot like me, how do I know what faction I need to raise to impress <br/>\nhim?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am an Iksar Swiftail Monk (yeah, question 2 comes up a lot) and I <br/>\njust completed a quest.  It told me my faction with the Swiftails <br/>\nincreased.  Is that any good for anything?  They already think of me <br/>\namiably, can it get any better?<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there ever faction changes you are not told about?  When I kill <br/>\nsome creatures there is no message about a faction change, is it <br/>\npossible one happened anyway?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\nIzanagi, Swiftail Monk &quot;I one day hope to master the art of standing <br/>\nwithout moving my tail.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
