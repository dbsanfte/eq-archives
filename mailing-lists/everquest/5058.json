However, since we got the new computer, I have been<br/>\nthinking of someday making the trip.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrouble is, I don&#39;t know how to get there. Granted, I haven&#39;t yet<br/>\ntried, but when I look on some of the EQ sites I visit, I don&#39;t see<br/>\nany way to get there. Is there a boat? From where? Is it even worth<br/>\ngoing there?<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t even gone to Jagged Pines since we got a machine that makes<br/>\nthe zone playable. In fact, I need to visit lots of places. I have<br/>\nonly limited experience on Luclin due to the lag. Been working Crystal<br/>\nCaverns this last week, my first week on the new machine.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
