I<br/>\nthought it seemed like it ran pretty well on my 450 mhz, actually, and was<br/>\none of the most &quot;old world&quot; zones out of any expansion since Luclin. Jagged<br/>\nPine is a bit rougher, think NK on crack, or a hyped version of DSP. The<br/>\ncritters are aggressive and generally powerful. The humanoids in JP are<br/>\nsomewhat easier, in fact my warrior soloed at the poachers at 51 and 52.<br/>\nSome of the various loots from the zone are nice, some weapons and jewelry.<br/>\nThe poachers drop pelts also, never lower than LQ, so for more advanced<br/>\ntailoring, this place is heaven.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: mlockridge01 &lt;MLockridge01@...&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;EverQuest@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 18, 2003 3:34 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Ysheka<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; We bought the expansion for some of the features, rather than any<br/>\n&gt; plans to go there.
