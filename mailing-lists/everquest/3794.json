A lot of the information<br/>\nthat they contain can be found at almost any EQ related website! It&#39;s<br/>\nbasically that I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t pay for any of these guides, it&#39;s really<br/>\nnot worth the money. The only thing I&#39;m truly interested in is making money.<br/>\nMan it sucks trying to get some decent armor when you have no money. I&#39;ve<br/>\nwondered about the &quot;make Plat at any level&quot; guides and I figured that you<br/>\nwould still need to group or partner at some point.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Either way I&#39;m having fun just going along and doing things the old<br/>\n </span></blockquote>fashioned way. I do suggest going and getting these guides because there<br/>\nwere a few things in there that was nice to know about but for any player,<br/>\nespecially noobs, I suggest doing it the old fashioned way and go out there<br/>\nand take the lumps and partner with some others. It&#39;s funner and you&#39;ll feel<br/>\nbetter knowing that you did it on your own.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I got some good info about Unrest so I think I may go and try it out this<br/>\n </span></blockquote>week.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you have Luclin you can do what I did, run to Dawnshroud and then run<br/>\nalong the wall as high as you can to reach Maidens Eye. Confirm there is no<br/>\ntrain on the inside or wait until a train has gone, then zone in and see if<br/>\nthere are any corpses at zone to loot. :-)<br/>\nI got a goranga idol and small brick of acrylia. :-) Those sell for a decent<br/>\nprice.
