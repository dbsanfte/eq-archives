Unfortunately the days of hunting yellows and low reds solo are coming to an end, by 40 you won t be able to do it anymore. (just too many HP) What I did","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1621553954\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; I just hit level 30 last night, and being the Druid<br/>\n&gt; that I am, I had a couple of questions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;First, I&#39;ve been hunting in South Karana since level<br/>\n&gt;25, hunting the Tesch Mas Gnolls around Paw, and <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unfortunately the days of hunting yellows and low reds<br/>\nsolo are coming to an end, by 40 you won&#39;t be able to<br/>\ndo it anymore. (just too many HP) What I did at 30 was<br/>\nI caught a boat to Velious and bound myself at the<br/>\nigloos so I could root and rot Cougars til 34. Once<br/>\nyou hit 34, you can quad kite Cougars til 38 I believe<br/>\nit was, and Ulthorks for several levels after that.<br/>\nAlso if you want to get started on one of the factions<br/>\nin Velious, you could head over to The Great Divide<br/>\nand hunt either Drakkel Wolves or Coldain Wolves. (I<br/>\ntook the easy way out and went Dwarf/Dragon faction<br/>\nand hunted Drakkel, but you can go either way) The<br/>\nloot is pretty bad on Cougars and even worse on<br/>\nWolves, but the XP is good and it&#39;s relatively safe.<br/>\nPlus, at least for me, travelling to Velious for the<br/>\nfirst time was really cool. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Second, Could someone suggest an item for my arm,<br/>\n&gt;back, of legs that gives a decent (around +3) Wisdom<br/>\n&gt;modifer that I could try to track down for myself<br/>\n&gt;either through a quest or through hunting loot?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Inexpensive items for each slot:<br/>\n<br/>\nUlthork Hide Arms - ac8 3wis neg3dex (worth about 75pp<br/>\nif that, most people just sell them to merchants once<br/>\nyou get to velious)<br/>\n<br/>\nGatorscale Leggings - 4wis, I forget the rest of the<br/>\nmods (400pp in EC tunnel, finding a pair is fairly<br/>\nsimple)<br/>\n<br/>\nKunzar Cloak - some AC, 10 sv vs fire, 2wis (75pp and<br/>\ndropping, not great, but the next upgrade is throwing<br/>\ndown 3k for a 10wis tailored cloak :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re a little short on money after hunting KFC<br/>\nfor a while, the best loot you&#39;ll find in your level<br/>\nrange is hunting mammoths in Everfrost. They should be<br/>\ndark blue to you for a couple more levels, and drop<br/>\ntusks worth 8pp each. (7pp to a merchant in Halas<br/>\nunless you have good faction) I only recommend that to<br/>\ndruids though, as it takes two people to kill the<br/>\nMammoths as fast as they spawn, three and the zone is<br/>\novercamped. A druid can both track and leave when the<br/>\nzone gets crowded, nobody else can do that. (well,<br/>\ntrackers can leave but not to anywhere interesting,<br/>\nrunning thru Blackburrow and spending all night to get<br/>\nsomewhere interesting is a pretty bad idea :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________ <br/>\nFind, Connect Date! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://personals.yahoo.ca\">http://personals.yahoo.ca</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
