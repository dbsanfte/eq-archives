Cahlia here, 19th season wood elf druid, who is \n  trying <br>desperately to level to 20 and claim my surname heheh! Oy I hate \n  <br>taking 1 step forward and 2 steps back!!<br><br>Anyhow, I was looking up a \n  quest yesterday and found one I am <br>interested in. Starts in Felwithe \n  talking to the high elf who stands <br>by the water and tells you he is \n  troubled by his son&#39;s disappearance, <br>please talk to someone else. I found \n  that if you go to Befallen and <br>kill a skeletal foreman, it will spawn Sir \n  (something or other starts <br>with an A). I got the directions, etc. He gives \n  you a token you take <br>back and give to the high elf and he gives you his \n  daughter&#39;s token. <br>A pretty cool amulet with 3AC, +3wis, +3int, +3 cha, \n  +3Sta, and +3 <br>agi I do believe. Anyhow....here&#39;s my question...can I make \n  it in <br>Befallen at level 20 ok? I&#39;m scared from what I read to attempt it. \n  <br>Apparently everything aggros terribly. EQAtlas says level 7-25+ mobs, \n  <br>but since they are all necros and thermagists, the damages are much \n  <br>worse than they con. I HATE dying, and I&#39;m too chicken to attempt \n  <br>without some feedback. Any suggestions or \n  stories?<br><br>Thanks!<br>Cahlia<br>Wood Elf Druid of Tunare<br>Morrel Thule \n  Server<br>&lt;Fates of Destiny&gt;<br><br></tt><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest \n  homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
