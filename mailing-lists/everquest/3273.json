The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; game is dull when played safe, the game is actually fun when played<br/>\n&gt; towards<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the limits of what can be done.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -domi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have had Clerics and casters bail on me.  It happens.  People don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; realize that if they unload that big damage DD or DoT or heal for too<br/>\n&gt; much too soon the mob is going to head straight for them.  It can be<br/>\n&gt; hard to hold aggro on a mob when that happens.  My Ranger has had to<br/>\n&gt; become good at peeling the mobs off the casters just to keep them<br/>\n&gt; alive.  They&#39;ll never make it if they run!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have seen and been involved in total party wipeouts, and they are<br/>\n&gt; no fun!  I&#39;d rather the Cleric survive it, maybe we&#39;ll get a Rez?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I play a Cleric from time to time as well.  He fights to the death<br/>\n&gt; and beyond!  So he has a melee mentality!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tul<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nWell, sometimes it&#39;s not even the healing, its sometimes when the tank goes<br/>\nand pulls 10 mobs after the casters have stated they are low mana. And if I<br/>\nthink it will help I will have my cleric beat on things with his hammer.<br/>\nMostly when he can&#39;t med bc he gets aggrod whenever he sits so his option is<br/>\nto stand there and be useless or hit the mob from behind. and yeah, I&#39;ve had<br/>\nthe people pull and dump a bunch of mobs on me and then flee. I generally<br/>\nalways announce that I am going to run just before I run and I tell the<br/>\nother members &quot;I&#39;m oom. RUN!&quot; Sometimes I will stop and wait for the people<br/>\nto run past me. Depends on the pull. If they are not trying to tank the mob<br/>\noff of me and I can&#39;t get it off and will die, I will pull it to the guards.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
