I just heard<br/>\n&gt; about it, learned that the spells were in my home of Rivervale, and<br/>\n&gt; bought all I could use. Just wondered if this was very new, or if I<br/>\n&gt; simply have had my head up my backside. Hadn&#39;t seen the vendor<br/>\n&gt; before. In the back of the druid&#39;s guild in Rivervale.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyone familiar with the Twilight Sea? Since I can port right there,<br/>\n&gt; to the island of the elementals, I was wondering if it would be nuts<br/>\n&gt; to try to solo there at lvl 33? Nice drops from those elementals, but<br/>\n&gt; I may try to get a group up if the solo thing is not workable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
