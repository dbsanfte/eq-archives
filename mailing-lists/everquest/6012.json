Paw is mine it is getting nerfed soon.  I can lvl there <br/>\ntill late 35 or so. You could also goto into Crystal Caverns at 30 <br/>\nfor power lvling. Usualy by the time iam lvl 40 the druid is sick of <br/>\nlvling me and i solo dawn shroud peak has zelnicks thay are cake for <br/>\na power lvled twinked player least it hasnt failed me. <br/>\n<br/>\nfor you who say spells spells spells. have powerlvled warrior, monk, <br/>\ncleric, enchanter, rogue, all to lvl 40. then soloed 40-50 and my <br/>\nskills where maxed from soloing. the coin you get plus the 5 points <br/>\neach lvl you can easly bring skills up spells to comp you at lvl 40 <br/>\nto get by. each class has a main spell class bring it and evocation <br/>\nup.  and the rest come in short order. I have only seen one person <br/>\npower lvled so hard he couldnt cast. But normaly you will work <br/>\nsomething up it does take time. and your melee skills will be maxed, <br/>\nif not close, my rogue i just started not only maxed pierceing but <br/>\n1hs as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n You may not want or like power lvling how ever i see nothing wrong <br/>\nwith pling to 40 soloing to 50 before i begain my grouping career. <br/>\ntodayes game has drop gear cheap to make an old school 65 war on a 40 <br/>\nwar. so grping with people at lvls below 55 are slaying the mobs. its <br/>\nnot like it was when the game came out, and grps realy did need <br/>\nplayers below 55 to play well. even my rouge can tank still at 46. <br/>\ndont sweat lvl 70 because you not going to get there in a day. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    lvl 46 rogue in 4 days played less than two weeks.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
