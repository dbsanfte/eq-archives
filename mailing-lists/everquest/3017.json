Reason I figure is newbs always have<br/>\nquestions, looking for players/friends, what have you<br/>\nand most guilds want High level chars.<br/>\n<br/>\nI formed my Guild to bring newbs into the game to meet<br/>\npeople and grow their chars together.  This way<br/>\neveryone will know the trubulations of making a char<br/>\nand the time that goes into it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had my doubts but with you question, I think it will<br/>\nhave a good response.<br/>\n<br/>\nit just got approved and created last night, tonight<br/>\nis recruit night....lol<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, this just me ranting, hopefully the guild<br/>\nsucceeds.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening.....<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n--- The Mad Macinchaote &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scendera@...\">scendera@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ll be by sometime...I&#39;ve got a 15 Ikky shaman<br/>\n&gt; who&#39;s looking to be quite fun on TP.
