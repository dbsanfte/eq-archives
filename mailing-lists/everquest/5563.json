One of my guildmates said<br/>\nthat they liked the part where my Char is on his Drogmor and raises his epic<br/>\nto point  at  what I would like to imagine  was a mob we were getting ready<br/>\nto attack. In actuality we were getting set up for a Raid in Plane of Sky<br/>\n(air) and I had actually targeted the dwarf in front of me  and used him for<br/>\nthe point reference hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy actual favorite though out of all of that was the very last frame lol<br/>\nwhere you can replay  teh film lol. that is my illustyrious guild leader lol<br/>\nand one of our trade skillers suggested that he dye his armor pink for April<br/>\nFoll&#39;s and  someone took teh screenshot of him dancing in his pink outfit<br/>\nlol  and as soon as I saw it I knew I wanted that one to be at teh end of<br/>\nthe film. At the time I planned this I hadn&#39;t thought about even doing a<br/>\nreplay feature till I was nearly done withteh film and it took me a week to<br/>\nfigure out how to keep the film form ending completely and going back to the<br/>\nstart of the actual film and not to the prelaod portion. Byt the time I was<br/>\ndone with the film I think my brain went LD for a couple of days lol just<br/>\nbefore I posted it for public viewing lol<br/>\n<br/>\nmy next favorite is where i am nekkid in PoK waiting for a rezz and one of<br/>\nour wizzies was there with me and in the movie I just had to make fun of the<br/>\nbeggars  that are so prevalent in the Eq world lol<br/>\n<br/>\nHaly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Su&quot; &lt;suceress@...&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;EverQuest@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, February 15, 2004 01:00<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] Somethign I would like you all to evaluate<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Wow!
