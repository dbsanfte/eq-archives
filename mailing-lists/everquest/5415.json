It is 5X your level + 5.  So<br/>\n&gt; for example, if you are level 15, then the skill cap<br/>\n&gt; is (5X15) + 5 = 80.  The skill cap for level 15 is<br/>\n&gt; 80.  Also some skills don&#39;t progress after a certain<br/>\n&gt; point.  Swimming, for example, doesn&#39;t progress past<br/>\n&gt; 200.  Once you hit 200, that&#39;s it.  Regardless of<br/>\n&gt; midifiers, higher levels or whatever... it never<br/>\n&gt; gets any better.  Also, druids have Specializations<br/>\n&gt; after level 30.  Your first Specialization will<br/>\n&gt; progress up to a certain point, but every other<br/>\n&gt; specialization stops at 50.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I hope that answers yoru question.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wulfric<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;   From: Techpriest <br/>\n&gt;   To: EverQuest (E-mail) <br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Monday, December 22, 2003 9:48 PM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: [EverQuest] Skill Advancement and<br/>\n&gt; Modifier<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   When I go to train with my Guildmaster I sometimes<br/>\n&gt; get the message, &quot;You<br/>\n&gt;   have reached your maximum level in that skill&quot; or<br/>\n&gt; something to that effect.<br/>\n&gt;   At that time I can&#39;t increase that skill any more.<br/>\n&gt;  None of the skills I get<br/>\n&gt;   it on are ever over 100.  Is there a limit to how<br/>\n&gt; high a skill can go based<br/>\n&gt;   on level, or is it based on something else?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I was thinking about my Iksar Monk and my Human<br/>\n&gt; Paladin.  The Iksar has a<br/>\n&gt;   negative modifier to exp, the Human has a positive<br/>\n&gt; one.  Both are at the<br/>\n&gt;   same level now and my Iksar has higher skill<br/>\n&gt; numbers for Offense, Defense<br/>\n&gt;   and his primary fighting skills and could easily<br/>\n&gt; take my Pal in a fight.  I<br/>\n&gt;   was thinking that making the Iksar advance slower<br/>\n&gt; is bad in that it takes<br/>\n&gt;   longer to get access to more powerful skills, but<br/>\n&gt; good in that it takes more<br/>\n&gt;   fighting to get to the same point, and more<br/>\n&gt; fighting means more skills<br/>\n&gt;   advancement.  If those facts are correct, I would<br/>\n&gt; rather have the negative<br/>\n&gt;   modifier.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Visit the EverQuest homepage at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   Yahoo!
