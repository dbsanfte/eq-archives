I don&#39;t know many rl girls who play males.\n<br>Although I find that while people tend to give more stuff to females, people\n<br>listen better to males. ie. as group leader with my female alt I set loot\n<br>order and organize strategy. People tend not to obey loot order nor to they\n<br>listen to strategy. But even when not as group leader playing a male, people\n<br>will listen to my suggestion of loot order as well as strategy.
