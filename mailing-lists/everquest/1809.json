At about 10-18 best places to PL \nare EK and LOIO towards the higher end of it. I got a ranger PLed from 8 to 14 \nwith druid DS, wolf form, SLN and a few other goodies, easily, on gorge hounds \nand crag spiders. There&#39;s a big hill a little to the right and into the zone, \nwhich is where the spiders spawn. Chasm crawlers (they&#39;d be exp too) are PH&#39;s \nfor the spiders, so with druid help you guys should clean up.</font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nakor@...\" title=\"nakor@...\">Richard \n  Ong</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Monday, August 27, 2001 11:29 \n  AM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> [EverQuest] Re: Fighter armor \n  and weapons at low level</div>\n  <div><br></div><tt>Well, I don&#39;t know much about melee myself either but I can \n  say that <br>you can DS (Damage Shield) your hubby to power level him as well \n  as <br>give him Skin Like Rock.&nbsp; Also, buff him up with strength so he \n  can <br>deal more damage.&nbsp; I&#39;m really not sure if fearing is very \n  effective <br>to PL because when I tried doing that, they didn&#39;t seem to get \n  much <br>xp out of it.&nbsp; Well, I can definitely help your hubby get to \n  your <br>level if you&#39;re on Vazaelle.&nbsp; I doubt it though.&nbsp; Not many \n  poeple <br>I&#39;ve seen online post that they&#39;re on vazaelle.&nbsp; Cuz I can \n  definitely <br>help him level.&nbsp; I&#39;m a level 51 druid and I can use my 49 \n  DS and <br>he&#39;ll kill mobs like they were nothing.&nbsp; It deals 24 points of \n  damage <br>each time the mob hits the person with the DS.<br><br>--- In \n  EverQuest@y..., &quot;Laura Buskirk&quot; &lt;wolffe@m...&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; Hi \n  all,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I was wondering if some of you could help me.&nbsp; I \n  got my hubby <br>involved in EQ<br>&gt; so he&#39;d stop bugging me to get off the \n  computer.&nbsp; He&#39;s got a 10th <br>lvl<br>&gt; halfling fighter, and I know \n  next to nothing about the melee <br>classes.<br>&gt; Assuming he&#39;s got about \n  1000pp to spend, what are his best choices <br>for armor<br>&gt; and a decent \n  weapon.&nbsp; He&#39;s got a fine steel longsword right now, <br>which \n  seems<br>&gt; to suck, and leather armor.&nbsp; Should he go to bronze or fine \n  steel <br>armor?<br>&gt; What does a full suit of either of these cost?&nbsp; \n  And what&#39;s the best <br>weapon<br>&gt; for him at this point?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n  Also, I&#39;m trying to powerlevel him just a little so we can go \n  <br>adventuring<br>&gt; together, though I&#39;m not generally a fan of leveling \n  people that <br>don&#39;t know<br>&gt; what they&#39;re doing.&nbsp; They should die \n  plenty and learn like the rest <br>of us<br>&gt; did :P&nbsp; I have a 16 \n  druid and he just needs a couple of levels so <br>we can<br>&gt; hang \n  out.&nbsp; Is there a good place to do this quickly?&nbsp; All I can <br>think \n  of at<br>&gt; the moment is to fear kite lions and bears, oh my, and let him \n  hack <br>them up.<br>&gt; There&#39;s so darn many people in EC these days, \n  though.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thanks for any help!!<br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n  Laura<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit \n  the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
