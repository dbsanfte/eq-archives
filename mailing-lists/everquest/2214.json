Necros and Druids solo better than<br>any other \n  class in EQ. Which is better? It&#39;s largely a<br>matter of personal preferance \n  and where you&#39;re<br>soloing. Then everyone else crowds in on the \n  thread<br>arguing the merits of their pet class. (as in<br>&quot;favorite class&quot;, \n  not Mages ;) Technically really any<br>class can solo, it just involves \n  unmanagable amounts<br>of downtime, picking less than profitable mobs, \n  and<br>unacceptable amounts of risk... unless you&#39;re a Druid<br>or Necro. \n  :)<br><br>Just an afterthought, had to reply to the post<br>questioning Mage&#39;s \n  dominance as &quot;the pet class&quot;, take<br>a look at the message boards on \n  eqvault.ign.com<br>there&#39;s a large thread comparing the Mage Epic pet \n  to<br>the highest level Beastlord \n  pet.<br><br><br>______________________________________________________________________ \n  <br>Web-hosting solutions for home and business! <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://website.yahoo.ca\">http://website.yahoo.ca</a><br><br><br>Visit \n  the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br><br><br>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
