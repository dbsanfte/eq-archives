The spells themselves are no drop.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n======== At 2004-11-08, 07:04:00 you wrote: ========<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re largely in the same boat, but what I do know is that there are 3 types of runes that drop.  Minor Muramite runes, Lesser Muramite Runes, and Greater Muramite Runes.  Minor runes are for levels 66-67, lesser are for 67-68, and greater are for 69-70.  There is an NPC in Draniks Scar you turn the runes into in order to get the spells.  The name escapes me but it&#39;s an Iksar NPC off to the west of the POD zone in in Dranik&#39;s.  Hope that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWulfric</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
