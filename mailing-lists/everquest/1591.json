I would suggest you dont even need to have your account<br/>\n&quot;hacked&quot; anymore to get your account banned.  All someone has to do is find<br/>\nout your account login call verant claim its his and bother them enough<br/>\nabout getting it back and I bet you a dollar to a donut (figure I would<br/>\nthrow in an old saying while someone else was, lol) that your account would<br/>\nbe locked out.

If that was the<br/>\ncase, mind you that&#39;s such a far fetched example of<br/>\nsomeone hacking your system for the mere purpose of<br/>\nstealing your everquest account.  It&#39;s still under the<br/>\nresponsibility of the player.  How could you ever<br/>\nprove to Verant that your account was hacked in such<br/>\nfashion?  I guess they should just recreate objects<br/>\nthat you have deleted accidentally too.  They are<br/>\nresponsible for the program and its integrity itself<br/>\nnot for the inability for its users to properly defend<br/>\nthemselves.  They&#39;ve implemented a lot of changes to<br/>\nhelp protect the player from themselves =) and the<br/>\ncommunity of EQ players at large are happy.  I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t worry about that new statement, GMs can do<br/>\nwhatever they want, its simply path the company would<br/>\nlike to follow for a majority.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonal responsibility sucks sure.. btw.. My free<br/>\nlunch has arrived...=).<br/>\n<br/>\nD.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
