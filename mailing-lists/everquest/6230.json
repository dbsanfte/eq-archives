The band leaders can make the musicians all flourish at the same time. I&#39;m not sure if a squad leader can make the dancers all do the same flourishes but they would have to be doing the same dances. Musicians can only play the song that the first musician started. Dancers can do whatever dance they want.<br/>\n&gt;luv,<br/>\n&gt;-Su<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;======= At 2005-06-09, 05:16:00 you wrote: =======<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I played SWG for a while, and dancers work like other classes.
