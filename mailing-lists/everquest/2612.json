That is the thing \nabout rangers I dont like is having to pull, but sometimes it is fun. Rangers \nare the best outdoor pullers. At 30 I have found that I can still be a main \ntank. I concentrate soley on AC.&nbsp;Riftwind&#39;s protection is a great spell \nthat really helps your AC. I like being a ranger because, they are surprisingly \neffective at helping out in bad situations. Of course, the wizard and enchanter \nare the best at putting down a bad situation, but the ranger isn&#39;t that bad \neither. If you have a full bar of mana and a decent wis, you can cast your 37hp \nnuke like twenty times. I guess I am saying that Rangers have some&nbsp;control \nover how much damage they deal, whereas the&nbsp;other tanks just do consistent \ndamage. If a ranger wants something to die faster they can do that which is \nhelpful in a group and something most people and rangers I played with dont \nrealize. I understand that&nbsp;as you get older you have to be more aware about \nnot&nbsp;drawing agro. I read a post somewhere that says a ranger needs to keep \ntheir AC at 20 times their level. I am at level 30 and with Riftwinds Protection \nand the new thornskin buff,&nbsp;my AC is exactly 600. I don&#39;t know how I am \ngoing to get the money to get it any higher. I am still mostly in banded though, \nso I guess it shouldn&#39;t be that hard. I will try to make some friends to play \nwith, but I have always had a hard time with that for some reason, maybe I \nshould try the friends command. &nbsp;</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Group skills are probably the most important thing \nyou can have in the game.&nbsp; As a Ranger you are sometimes asked to pull, and \nyou need to know how to do that.&nbsp; Otherwise you&#39;re a backup to the \ntank.&nbsp; The roles change several times during the game as you progress in \nlevels.&nbsp; Now I feel how poorly Rangers tank when the Mob puts the smack \ndown on me!&nbsp; Maybe I should change my name to Manasponge! \nLOL<br></font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
