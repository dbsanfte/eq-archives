A few of my friends said that they&#39;d group<br/>\n&gt; in Dawnshroud at the Grieg&#39;s End zone.  from<br/>\n&gt; 1:30-2:30 I made my way from Frontier Mountains to<br/>\n&gt; Dawnshroud Peaks.  It took that long in rogue<br/>\n&gt; sneak/hide to avoid aggro.  I didn&#39;t have a sow.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We met up at Maidens eye zone.  Myself, a ranger, a<br/>\n&gt; mage, another rogue, and a monk.  I said &quot;Now if we<br/>\n&gt; only have a cleric&quot; and miraculously I see &quot;You guys<br/>\n&gt; need a cleric?&quot; appear on my screen.  So the 6 of us<br/>\n&gt; made our way to Grieg&#39;s End zone line and set up<br/>\n&gt; base.  For the next 6 hours we then proceeded to<br/>\n&gt; murder, slaughter, and bring the wrath upon tribals<br/>\n&gt; and anything else that dared cross our paths.  In<br/>\n&gt; the ntire 6 hours we had only 3 deaths.  The monk<br/>\n&gt; had a higher level cleric alt with a 75% rez so we<br/>\n&gt; were golden.  Everyone in the group dinged at least<br/>\n&gt; once.  Our group&#39;s cleric dinged 29 and got his new<br/>\n&gt; rez spell for which he was happy.  It was a good<br/>\n&gt; time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; After the group broke up, I hung around DSP to find<br/>\n&gt; another group.  I was able to do so and we had a<br/>\n&gt; froglok warrior who was busting out the chain pulls.<br/>\n&gt;  In the new group I managed to ding a second time. <br/>\n&gt; By midnight, a mere 9 hours into it, I went from one<br/>\n&gt; 6 blues to 33 to 2 yellows into 34, which is equal<br/>\n&gt; to about a level and a half.  Needless to say I was<br/>\n&gt; pretty pleased with myself, and I realized sometimes<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s not about what you get to look forward to, but<br/>\n&gt; just the fun you have playing the character.  So I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; trying to finish off 34 this weekend and hopefully<br/>\n&gt; make some good headway into 35 - maybe even 36.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wulfric Rennison<br/>\n&gt; 34 Half Elf Rogue<br/>\n&gt; Cazic Thule server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
