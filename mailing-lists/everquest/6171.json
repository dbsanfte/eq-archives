Also<br>think of it this way, do music groups have \n  the same songs on every<br>album? No. They are always changing to appeal to \n  the masses. If they put<br>the same songs on every album you would eventually \n  get bored with it and<br>every time you hear them on the radio it would be \n  basically the same<br>song but with different words.<br><br>EQ2 is a &quot;sequel&quot; \n  to EQ1 just as &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; is a &quot;sequel&quot; to<br>&quot;The Matrix&quot;. I&#39;m \n  sure that SOE would like everyone to move over to EQ2<br>but they know and \n  accept the fact that not everyone has a powerful<br>enough computer to run \n  EQ2. I don&#39;t. Plus I have so many things to do in<br>EQ1 first before I move \n  on to another game. Another thing to consider, I<br>have met players who have \n  been in the game for 5 years or more!
