In general for all things Everquest you only need 3 websites these are castersrealm, alakazam and eqtraders they also have links to the best class websites for specific stuff but on the whole just about everything can be found on those websites.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nuada - Insomnia Reborn<br><br></p></div>\n<div></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> <div></div>&gt;From: &quot;Biltilie Dwimmerlaik&quot; \n<div></div>&gt;Reply-To: EverQuest@yahoogroups.com \n<div></div>&gt;To: EverQuest@yahoogroups.com \n<div></div>&gt;Subject: Re: [EverQuest] Mage Focus Items \n<div></div>&gt;Date: Mon, 25 Nov 2002 18:15:10 +0100 \n<div></div>&gt; \n<div></div>&gt;On 25 Nov 2002 at 6:26, Jack Whaley wrote: \n<div></div>&gt; \n<div></div>&gt; &gt; Where are the goblin mages?
