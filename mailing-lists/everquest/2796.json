I have thought<br/>\n&gt; about it a bit. We <br/>\n&gt; pay less than $200 a year just to play. Not bad. I<br/>\n&gt; spent at least <br/>\n&gt; $500 on GamesWorkshop products each year when I was<br/>\n&gt; more active <br/>\n&gt; there. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t have a problem dropping the monthly fee. It<br/>\n&gt; is quite <br/>\n&gt; reasonable. I might be able to dump another $500 a<br/>\n&gt; year into <br/>\n&gt; upgrades. Unfortunately, my machine is now pretty<br/>\n&gt; much maxed. So I <br/>\n&gt; must hope that I can hold out at the present level<br/>\n&gt; long enough to get <br/>\n&gt; together the funds for a more upgradeable tower.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How much are others willing to pay to play?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
