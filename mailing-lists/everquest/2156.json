They accepted it when I started <br/>\nand have accepted it since. However, the recommendation of the <br/>\nprepaid card is a very good one. I am sure that the gods of gaming <br/>\ncould see the value in such cards, insuring that the customers <br/>\nwithout credit cards could still play the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck in the game, but I wish you no luck in finding someone to <br/>\ngive you the information you want. That you might get from a friend <br/>\nor family, but a stranger who gives that info out would at best soon <br/>\nhave a stripped character. Most of the in-game thefts are from unwise <br/>\nsharing, not clever hacking.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\n--- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;country_boy_21_41465&quot; <br/>\n&lt;country_boy_21_41465@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am in need of help.
