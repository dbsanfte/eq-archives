I tried to tell him that the giants saw thru invis. But he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t listen. Next thing I knew the entire fort was aggrod on us. He went<br/>\ndown and rather than train the fort onto the people outside, I gated out. It<br/>\npretty much sucked.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Its not that hard to solo in the Overthere if you are a ranger.

I agree about Frontier &gt;Moutains, it&#39;s too<br/>\ndangerous to solo there.

What are other player&#39;s attitudes<br/>\n  &gt; toward game death?<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; I play solo most of the time, and haven&#39;t had a guild to depend on<br/>\n  &gt; since Wave of Change faded away. So, death, especially death in<br/>\n  &gt; awkward circumstances, is more serious to my character. I can&#39;t<br/>\n  just<br/>\n  &gt; call on my guild reserector to pull my butt out of the grave, nor<br/>\n  do<br/>\n  &gt; have high level guildies to drag my corpse out from under some big<br/>\n  &gt; nasty.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; My son-in-law plays with abandon. He leaves corpses all over the<br/>\n  &gt; place, joins groups readily, and seems to have great fun doing all<br/>\n  &gt; that.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; My son, on the other hand, is in a powerful guild on our server. He<br/>\n  &gt; is less cautious than me, but still uses sound strategy and tactics<br/>\n  &gt; and utilized his guild to advance on his goals. His guild is the<br/>\n  &gt; Guardian Alliance on Zeb.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; I figure I will have to do the guild and group thing soon, but<br/>\n  enjoy<br/>\n  &gt; my independence enough that I want to do so as late in my career as<br/>\n  &gt; possible.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n  Death is something I try to avoid.  I made Locate and Corpse hotkeys<br/>\n  early on for corpse runs.  But I hate the XP loss.  I died 3 times<br/>\n  last week, which added another 2 days before I reached 38.  I have no<br/>\n  guild or high level friends to depend either, so I go where I know I<br/>\n  can get back to.  But I do have a Druid cousin that jumps me around<br/>\n  when he&#39;s on.  So spend a few minutes scouting before you jump in!<br/>\n  Learn from your mistakes!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Once you get to Kunark your solo career is limited.  There are just<br/>\n  too many mob&#39;s and too big a chance of a bad pull.  I have seen<br/>\n  Druids quadkiting in the OT and I saw one go down on an overpull.  It<br/>\n  helps to group until you get a feel for the area.  And watch out for<br/>\n  the Goons in OT!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Tuldayen Grimblade<br/>\n  38th Season Ranger of Tunare<br/>\n  Terris-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
