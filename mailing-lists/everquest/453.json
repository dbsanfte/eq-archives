Why to people just give things away to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;people. Let them work for it, or at least pay for it.  Especially<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;when the person receiving it has no idea where it came from.  Its<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;funny and sad really, when your in the newbie yard and you see a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;level 2 player chasing a snake around in full bronze armor.  The<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Crude Stein is no big deal, but if someone wants to give &gt;&gt;&gt;you<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;something that is significant don&#39;t accept it.  Add a little<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;character to your character, so to speak. Get down in the trenches<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;with the rest of us, in the long run it will make you a better<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;player.  Some call it twinking, I call them Twinkies.. looks good<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;yet not much substance. :) hehe<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;          Anyways...   have fun... hehe          Duhase - Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Is this guy like rude or what? I just asked for verification of info, or a<br/>\n&gt;possible in game trade/sale which occurs on a regular basis. Does anyone<br/>\n&gt;give merchants a hard time in the game? I think not. Nor do I think players<br/>\n&gt;give other players a hard time when they come upon something they think is<br/>\n&gt;worth selling. He then labels those who do such things as &quot;twinks&quot;. I have<br/>\n&gt;over 22 years of roleplaying (MUD&#39;s, MUCK&#39;s, MUSH&#39;s, RPG&#39;s, CRPG&#39;s), you<br/>\n&gt;name it, I&#39;ve probably played it, and in my books, thems fighting words<br/>\n </span></blockquote>bub!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;His response, to which I replied the following:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;For your information, I&#39;m a level 10 Dark Elf Shadow Knight and am<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;down in the trenches. An item like this doesn&#39;t just grow on trees,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;and I know it. And another thing, just because I know where to find<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;an item, doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ll be able to walk in and just get it. It<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;has to be earned. Name one thing in EQ that doesn&#39;t have to be<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;earned? SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.... before you go calling someone a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;twink and make comments like that, I suggest you get all your facts<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;straight before you offend someone..... like you just did.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;He then replies:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Like i really care if i hurt your feelings..  Big deal  i have 2<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;characters that are lvl 16 and growing. Neither one is twinked.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Maybe the game<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is too hard for you, well some people can handle a little pressure<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;some cant. Big Deal.  Earn it.  Btw are you twinked..  Guess what<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;it still takes the same amount of time to get thru the levels..<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;just dont sweat it and keep playing.  If you read my email i stated<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;that the Stein i hadno problem with..<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Seeya :)  and remember its only a game<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Lance<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you ask me, I&#39;m not the one with the problem here, and I can think of a<br/>\n&gt;billion different ways to rationalize off what you call twinking LANCE. And<br/>\n&gt;if you&#39;re going to start flaming and calling someone something they<br/>\n </span></blockquote>consider<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;rude and offensive LANCE, you better be ready to deal with the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>consequences.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And just for your info, my character is hardly twinked. Every little copper<br/>\n&gt;I have, I earned by starting a level one character with just the basic<br/>\n </span></blockquote>items<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;on his back that you start with. And if you think playing a Dark Elf Shadow<br/>\n&gt;Knight is so easy, I suggest you try doing so. Just about every NPC (except<br/>\n&gt;those in Neriak) attack you on sight or won&#39;t sell equipment to you. As for<br/>\n&gt;handling pressure LANCE, I have 6 years in the military. You don&#39;t get much<br/>\n&gt;more pressure than that. So who needs to learn about pressure here? Not me.<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;d look closer to home. And while you&#39;re at it, next time I suggest using<br/>\n </span></blockquote>a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;thesarus and dictionary. Your spelling and grammar are terrible LANCE.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;For those of you out there who consider this spam, my apologies (but if the<br/>\n&gt;shoe fits, wear it). I just can&#39;t stand people who go off half cocked about<br/>\n&gt;something when they no as to what they&#39;re talking about.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
