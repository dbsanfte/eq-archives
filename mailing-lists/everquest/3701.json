The armor that drops <br/>\nfor the &quot;Giant&quot; quests only drops in West ToV, which <br/>\nmeans you will have to be in a good high level guild to <br/>\nstart questing for it (unless you have the cash to buy <br/>\nMQ pieces).  Meanwhile, with Dorf faction, you can go on <br/>\nKael raids and kill giants in the Arena (which are much <br/>\nlower level) and get armor that way.  Plenty if servers <br/>\nhave people that run &quot;public&quot; Kael raids, so you don&#39;t <br/>\neven have to be in a high level guild to get that armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd eventually, if your guild is good enough, you can <br/>\nstart going into ToV and questing for the Dragon armor <br/>\nquests in the Halls of Testing (which is a bit easier to <br/>\ndo than West ToV).</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
