I have a TERRIBLE lag in Bazaar, and sometimes in PoK. <br/>\nYou guys think I should upgrade my video card? I know Sony doesn&#39;t <br/>\nsupport playing on a laptop, but aside from the lag in those two <br/>\nareas, it&#39;s working quite well.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Wulfric Rennison&quot; &lt;wulftech@e...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So this is just a question to find out what kind of hardware you <br/>\n </span></blockquote>use to run EverQuest.  I suppose a Ps/2 counts as well since you can <br/>\ntechnically run a version of EQ on it, but I was more curious as to <br/>\neveryone&#39;s computers.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Me, personally, I have two accounts.  I have two PCs I run EQ on.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>One PC is a PIII 1.2Ghz with 1GB of PC133 SDRAM, a 128MB ATI Radeon <br/>\n4X AGP card, a SB Live! Gamer audio card with digital audio out, a <br/>\nset of Creative  FPS2000 4 point surround sound speakers, and a 19&quot; <br/>\nflat screen Samsung monitor.  Great sound and great graphics, but <br/>\nlags a little on Luclin and the newer zones. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; the second system is a P4 1.6Ghz with 640MB of PC133 SDRAM, a 64MB <br/>\n </span></blockquote>ATI Radeon 4X AGP card, and using the onboard AC97 sound for the time <br/>\nbeing.  It does do digital audio out, but I only have a set of old <br/>\nLabtec speakers.  Also, the monitor is a 17&quot; Gateway E200 monitor.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I use Roadrunner cable to connect so it all works pretty well.  I <br/>\n </span></blockquote>don&#39;t plan on upgrading the PIII any more, but I will make more <br/>\nchanges to the P4.  I plan on putting it up to a full gig and a half <br/>\nof RAM and upgrading to a 128MB video card and a SoundBlaster Audigy <br/>\ncard.  So when I get the money as they say...  :)  Hopefully next <br/>\nmonth!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, that&#39;s what I use.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wulfric </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
