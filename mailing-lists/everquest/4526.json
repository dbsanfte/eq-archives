I will look into the Clean Sweep :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, joe dirt &lt;gulf_coaster2003@y...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe because it isn&#39;t a Sony Laptop? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just kidding, In the &#39;Update&#39;/Patch that was downloaded, do you <br/>\n </span></blockquote>keep records of such downloads? Such as a Utility program that <br/>\nmonitors Downloads other than WinXP? (that is rather vague, Norton <br/>\nClean Sweep, or something like it)?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have found that when EQ Updates that if I do not monitor it,  the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>PC I use for Games sometimes becomes unstable. Maybe its a Sony <br/>\nthing, could be a OS Fault, just point is to Monitor All Downloads. I <br/>\nalso use CD-RW (external) to create Data files of Registry and <br/>\nCritical Programs on. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I ran the figures and it works out to about $0.25 per Backup CD <br/>\n </span></blockquote>when bought by 50 or 100. That figure includes the cost of internal <br/>\nCD-RW.Nothing is better in Electronic Computing than a reliable <br/>\nBackup, and if one relies on Windows to store said backups, well is <br/>\nkinda tough to Boot a PC if the OS goes flakey, (which happens).<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; In summation, That Sys Restore is a handy little Utility, but I <br/>\n </span></blockquote>don&#39;t trust it with Important Files. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; The reason I mentioned External CD-RW is because you are using a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Laptop, what the heck, is a good thing to have just in case your <br/>\nLaptop ever gets run over by a Fire Truck,Eaten by a Dog, Decides it <br/>\nis Esther Williams, or something. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; John<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On the sunny side of the street.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
