I find the &quot;secret nerfing&quot; to be<br/>\n&gt;very frustrating. I do think, though that perhaps some of what may appear <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;&quot;nerfing&quot; may be the introduction of new bugs as they attempt to fix old<br/>\n&gt;one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I hate to take some issue with your comments - particularly your assertion<br/>\n&gt;(in your second post) that &quot;and Verant chooses to<br/>\n&gt;ignore those suggestions even though they&#39;re easily implementable&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;First of all - your are 1 of 125,000 customers.  To be surprised that <br/>\n&gt;Verant<br/>\n&gt;seems to ignore your suggestion is, to say the least, naive.  How much time<br/>\n&gt;do they have to respond to suggestion vs. implementing their own?  Also -<br/>\n&gt;your suggestions may be in direct contraction to what others are <br/>\n&gt;suggesting.<br/>\n&gt;So it&#39;s not really fair to say you&#39;re being ignored...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also - it&#39;s impossible for anyone who doesn&#39;t have access to the EQ source<br/>\n&gt;code and database definition to know how easy to implement any change is.<br/>\n&gt;Very often what seems (even to the programmer!) to be an easy change can<br/>\n&gt;cause major problems with the code.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As I said, these kinds of posts always raise issues. I also stated in my <br/>\nposting that they&#39;re just not ignoring myself, they&#39;re ignoring the entire <br/>\nEQ gaming population in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I am not &quot;naive&quot; enough to believe (as you put it) that just because I <br/>\nsuggest something, that it&#39;s automatically going to be put into the game. <br/>\nAnd yes, I realize all too well that I&#39;m just 1 out of 250,000+ players and <br/>\nthat my suggestions may contradict someone elses suggestion. The whole point <br/>\nI&#39;m trying to make here is that I feel dis-satisfied with Verant&#39;s rather <br/>\nlame &quot;band-aid&quot; patch policies. Rather than fixing the problem outright, <br/>\nthey&#39;ll come up with something to temporarily fix it (this would not be bad <br/>\nhowever, but they never go back and straighten out the mess).<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point and time, I&#39;d say 80% of the EQ gaming population as a whole <br/>\nfeel dis-satisfied for the same reason - we&#39;d like to see some change for <br/>\nthe better for once.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
