Upon arrival, 4 of<br/>\n&gt; the 6 forgot their Seb keys at the bank. One of them forgot to camp his<br/>\n&gt; Seb key altogether.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3) At a Vox raid, our cleric had to heal his party from the pit while<br/>\n&gt; fending off bears and spiders.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 4) One of our warriors asked and got irate at a shaman&#39;s pet when the pet<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t answer a request for a port.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 5) A group of us asked a Necro&#39;s pet once for a corpse summons.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 6) We constantly make the mistake of &quot;Well SR can do it with 1 group, how<br/>\n&gt; hard can it be?!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 7) One of druids has fallen into the same pit trap in Howling Stones 9<br/>\n&gt; times.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One of our warriors, after receiving a 10 minute lecture about being<br/>\n&gt; careful of where you walk in Sol A, promptly took a nose dive into the<br/>\n&gt; lava 30 seconds after zoning.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 9) The same warrior then proceeded to take 15 more lava baths in Sol A.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 10) We always forget we need to be in the same zone for corpse summoning.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 11) The guides and GMs of Brell know all our names by heart because we<br/>\n&gt; manage to find every single terminal bug in any zone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 12) Our justification for doing Chardok zone when we were all in our late<br/>\n&gt; 40s was &quot;Well we can always just zone out&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 13) Same for Sebelis.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 14) Same for Howling Stones.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 15) One of our druids was so worried about forgetting his Howling Stones<br/>\n&gt; key, he accidently destroyed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 16) We&#39;ve sold an SMR, a Dragoon Dirk, a Mith 2 Hander, a TBB, a Kunzar<br/>\n&gt; Cloak, a Mammoth Cloak, and an Evil Eye Bag (full at the time too) to<br/>\n&gt; various merchants all around Norrath.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 17) Our druids (all of them) always have to ask &quot;Which evac is it for<br/>\n&gt; EJ?&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1 In Sky we killed eachother off for corpse summoning and revives only to<br/>\n&gt; discover that there was no one for corpse summoning and revives left.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 19) Our paladin (cough) looks like an Ewok in Kylong armor.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 20) No single person in our guild quite knows the entire family tree...<br/>\n&gt; even after reading it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 21) We can do Fear in less then 3 hours, but can&#39;t get to any place in<br/>\n&gt; Velious in under 5.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 22) To this day, when someone says &quot;Can we pull something?&quot; 3 people head<br/>\n&gt; out in different directions to pull.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 23) Camping the AC in south ro, we were KSed by a 46th level solo mage<br/>\n&gt; (there were 5 of us, most all 55th levelish, grouped).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 24) When a particular druid of ours attempts to port us, it is truly a<br/>\n&gt; mystery if we will actually port somewhere, port to the desired location,<br/>\n&gt; or watch the druid gate there while we go no where.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 25) While trying to port to Gfay once, we ported to Hate.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 26) Most people power level their alts and lower level guildmembers by<br/>\n&gt; helping to kill a mob they are fighting on a consistant basis. We just<br/>\n&gt; train ours and go conveniently link dead.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 27) We once petitioned that the Noble Dojorn in Sky dropped a Runed Totem<br/>\n&gt; Staff. We later found out that Thorondar gave the Noble Dojorn the staff<br/>\n&gt; so it would have a worse damage/delay.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2 We constantly sell extra loot and then try to buy it back when we<br/>\n&gt; realize that we actually needed that item.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 29) We can kill Trakanon, however most of our members have died to green<br/>\n&gt; cons while trying to cross most of the zones in Kunark and Velious.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 30) One of the criteria for membership is &quot;What&#39;s the largest train you<br/>\n&gt; have ever pulled?&quot;. Well we want to be the best at something /shrug. (P.S.<br/>\n&gt; - Conanb still owns this record /rude).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 31) One of our warriors was killed by the same Avocet 5 times.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 32) One of our paladins (sniff) was killed by Dorn 7 times (each one a<br/>\n&gt; purposeful attack).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 33) One of our druids tried to kite Grim Feather at 20th level.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 34) One of our druids has said the word &quot;ow&quot; approximately 2000 times MORE<br/>\n&gt; then any other person.... ever.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 35) One of our warriors and one of our mages were lost in Lake Rathe for<br/>\n&gt; over 2 hours trying to find the SK zone. They kept swimming around the<br/>\n&gt; zone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 36) Our 60th level shaman still can&#39;t find his way through everfrost to<br/>\n&gt; find Halas.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 37) A raid newbie once asked me &quot;What&#39;s a death touch&quot; to which Cazic<br/>\n&gt; Thule replied &quot;KRUUNCH!&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3 One of our paladins (hurumph) once got a rez and ran off to rejoin the<br/>\n&gt; fight.....forgetting to loot his corpse.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 39) One of our paladins (like we have more then 1) once got rezzed and<br/>\n&gt; proceeded to continue to pull Fear.... naked.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 40) All of our clerics and druids have Sarnak Battle Shields but none of<br/>\n&gt; our melee do.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 41) Cartumandua continually takes most of our phat lewt and just oggles it<br/>\n&gt; an hour out of every day.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 42) One of our clerics continually complains about the crappy BP he has<br/>\n&gt; (he has a Trak BP).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 43) We have one high level enchanter, and he is on heavy medication (he<br/>\n&gt; says it&#39;s for his back).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 44) Our bard seems to go LD only when playing his levitate or EB song.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 45) Our other enchanter goes LD anytime the word &quot;incoming&quot; is said in<br/>\n&gt; guild/group/say/ooc/shout.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 46) Ruut (our troll SK) joined the guild because he heard we got phat lewt<br/>\n&gt; alot and thought we were all pretty skinny compared to him.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 47) None of us day to day can decide what the hell faction we want in<br/>\n&gt; Velious, so we usually wind up at Karnors.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 4 One a few occasions we&#39;ve told a guildmate we&#39;re camping the Hand (in<br/>\n&gt; Karnors) and they proceeded to go to Lguk.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 49) One of our Necros paid 2K for a purchaseable spell.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 50) One of our Necros spent 3 weeks researching a purchaseable spell.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I thought it was pretty funny.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Mu<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
