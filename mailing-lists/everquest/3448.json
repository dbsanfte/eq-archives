I&#39;ve played one \nto level 13 and it is ok. The beastlord himself is about as good of a fighter as \na bard except they can only wear leather armor. His pet is a good tank though \nwith a neat taunt proc and the beastlord has cleric level heals for the pet. He \nalso gets shaman spells too. It&#39;s a lot like a magician except with more of an \nemphasis on healing and buffs. I don&#39;t see why the beastlord pet couldn&#39;t be a \nmain tank in a group. I kind of wish they got a few extra spells though most of \ntheir best spells you don&#39;t get until level 59 or 60. I wish there were weak \nlower level versions of some of their key spells like maybe a spell like the \nenchanter&#39;s augmentation spell that increases attack speed %15 or \nsomething.</font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
