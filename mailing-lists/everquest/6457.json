I average at<br/>\nleast one level per gameplay session and I don&#39;t have to rely on a<br/>\ncleric to heal me or anyone else for that matter.  My wife and I used<br/>\nto exclusively duo/group and I felt myself squelched by others<br/>\n(including her).  I might want to go to a particular zone to get<br/>\nsteady xp or good loot without the hassles, but I would be overruled<br/>\nor pushed into going someplace I really didn&#39;t want to go.  Soloing<br/>\nwas my escape from dealing with that.  I know that EQ is supposed to<br/>\nbe a social game, but sometimes, I just like to be alone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, j.Rigano@... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Soloing dang i have been soloing since i started playing and getting<br/>\ninto a group seems strange at times for me id rather be in a group at<br/>\ntimes makes game more fun i just wish groups would be more but seems<br/>\nto me groups are slim to none. <br/>\n&gt;  -------------- Original message ----------------------<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Wulfric Rennison&quot; &lt;wulftech@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Not me.  I prefer grouping.  It&#39;s faster xp than soloing in my<br/>\nopinion.  As a 65 <br/>\n&gt; &gt; druid, I can solo a lot of things, but it takes too much time to<br/>\nkill them.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Root, snare, dot, dot, dot.  Sit and wait.  Keep that up til the<br/>\nmob is dead.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; In a group, most times I only have to worry about snaring and<br/>\ndotting, and maybe <br/>\n&gt; &gt; back up healing.  It&#39;s not as labor intensive, and the xp moves<br/>\nfaster with <br/>\n&gt; &gt; constant pulls.  Unfortunately, lately, it seems like it&#39;s been<br/>\nincreasingly <br/>\n&gt; &gt; more difficult to find good groups so I end up soloing most of the<br/>\ntime anyway <br/>\n&gt; &gt; with LFG on.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; W<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   From: Just Me <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Sent: Sunday, April 16, 2006 1:04 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: [EverQuest] Does anyone solo anymore?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   After a year and a half of playing, I&#39;ve done a lot of group<br/>\nplay and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   a lot of duoing, but I seem to enjoy soloing more nowdays.
