Many guilds have <br/>\nbanks, some have setup second accounts with just the banker and the <br/>\nmules that the council control.  That way you just camp and open the <br/>\nbank for whoever needs it.  It should be easy to arrange times, <br/>\nbankers hours!  Can they be banned, sure.  Are they, no. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that since they started nerfing a lot of the multi-questing <br/>\nmost guilds have cut back on this.  Many still loan out items but <br/>\nmost that I&#39;ve talked with would rather help you get what you need, <br/>\nso you owe them!<br/>\n<br/>\nVerant should setup guild banks, maybe in conjunction with the <br/>\nregular banks.  I would think that Verant would have setup something <br/>\nlike this a while ago.  As much as they push social interaction and <br/>\nthe high end game this would be a logical step.  I see very few <br/>\nguildless high levels players, there isn&#39;t much you can do alone <br/>\nafter 50.  Sure, you can still hunt but raids are where it&#39;s at.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
