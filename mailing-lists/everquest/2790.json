Got it installed and went for a test \n  drive.<br><br>One area that is a big problem is Rivervale. With the last \n  expansion <br>Rivervale became so laggy that I avoided going home when I \n  could. Now <br>I get a few hiccups when I enter the zone, then it settles down \n  to a <br>playable level. A hitch now and then, but nothing like before the \n  <br>upgrade.<br><br>Checked out a few cities, some zones in between. Made \n  technical <br>adjustments. On the whole quite pleased.<br><br>One thing I \n  noticed was a bit of lag in laggy zones (Luclin was <br>almost unplayable \n  until now)until I had been there a bit. When I went <br>to the Bazaar I just \n  did a slow 360 and the lag went away. Figure <br>enough of the zone loaded \n  into active memory to carry the play from <br>then on. Perhaps someone could \n  explain what was actuall happening to <br>the system when I do this. Anyway, I \n  do a scan of my environment when <br>I zone and things are pretty \n  smooth.<br><br>This is my last upgrade to my present system. Have to replace \n  my <br>tower next, and hope to hold out a while. How much can I spend every \n  <br>year on these things? The family expects me to feed them, and I hate \n  <br>to dissppoint them too often on that account just to play my \n  game.<br><br>Now if DSL comes down a bit in price, I may try that. Could that \n  be <br>the key to absolute smooth-as-butter-on-a-bald-monkey performance on \n  <br>my aging machine? (The thing is just a bit over a year old. How fast \n  <br>they grow old.)<br><br>Barto Proudfoot<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit \n  the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
