Really appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI already have the VM set to max - no problem with all of the <br/>\navailable disk space.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems most of you are pointing to the Video controller as the <br/>\nlikely solution. Could well be - the existing one is only 16MB. But <br/>\nwhy would a slow video cause such a hit on the hard disk, which seems <br/>\nto be viusally where the bottleneck is - i.e. on zoning, the hard <br/>\ndisk is very active until it zones are goes back to the server <br/>\nscreen. The hard disk is performing extremely well and is very fast, <br/>\nso that is not the problemin itself - could the slwo graphics card <br/>\ncause EQ to go to the hard disk more to compensate?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure I could go to a 128MB graphics card - would 64Mb do?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks once again.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Fire on High&quot; &lt;scendera@o...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Yep...it does make a big difference.The VM tweak is just a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>little &quot;freebie&quot; for overall performance, not just EQ. 11 day uptimes <br/>\non my WinME-based EQ box... yup, consider me convinced, fully and <br/>\ntruly. Likewise the amount of sheer ABUSE my LAN server gets, and the <br/>\nstability and speed difference once the VM was fixed to reflect <br/>\nchanges in real ram.Overall, spending $50 for a Geforce 2 will be an <br/>\ninvestment you&#39;re likely to be pleased with. Also, if your power <br/>\nsupply is wimpy, consider invest in a bigger one...300 watts should <br/>\nbe plenty for a Geforce 2 and sufficient cooling for everything, but <br/>\n250 will do the trick with less breathing room...any less, upgrade.<br/>\n 4/9/03</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
