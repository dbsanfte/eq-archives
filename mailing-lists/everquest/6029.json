My internet has been down and I finally was <br/>\nable to get to it. (holidays and all, thank god they are almost over!)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYou are correct there. I have a friend that has joined because of me <br/>\nand we did a little PL&#39;ing of him. However I didn&#39;t go full bore but <br/>\nmore like &quot;helped&quot; him in some areas.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs of late I haven&#39;t had to much trouble finding groups between 20 and <br/>\n40. But this may be a server thing. (I wonder if there are more of a <br/>\ncertain level on some servers than others?) I do run into times when I <br/>\ncan&#39;t find a darn thing and it sucks but then I just go work on <br/>\ntradeskills (Like alcohol tolerance!)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI still say you had to have &quot;some&quot; armor on! LOL j/k and yes Druids do <br/>\nrock. I have one I&#39;m working on myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy Holidays!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Message: 1         <br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sun, 26 Dec 2004 03:19:52 -0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;shadow_4unme&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shadow_4unme@...\">shadow_4unme@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Digest Number 1112<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; some people do get into eq through a friend and thay do power lvl <br/>\n&gt; them. I seen a 65 cleric with epic who couldnt cast before oom. most <br/>\n&gt; the time however power lvling is done by experanced players. I have a <br/>\n&gt; friend who plays to about lvl 30 before deleting and starting <br/>\n&gt; another, he enjoys going from lvl 1 to lvl 30 in a day.  It took all <br/>\n&gt; i  could do to make him play one to 65.  Dont get ripped on power <br/>\n&gt; lvling.  When you have a lvl 70 with everything under the sun, I <br/>\n&gt; doubt you will want to sit lfg for 9 hours with a lvl 25 necro. Iam <br/>\n&gt; know lvl 51 and still see very few groups as the servers have fewer <br/>\n&gt; people on.  As far as doing it naked its all about where you go and <br/>\n&gt; skill in doing it, have done it a few times and i know how. I think <br/>\n&gt; you may enjoy a druid so you will have the power to group power lvl <br/>\n&gt; and solo.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
