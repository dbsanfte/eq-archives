Sorry the alternatives were too b&w<br/>\nthough, if I had not made that survey at 4am in the morning after playing EQ for<br/>\n9 hours straight it might have been better.. hee hee..<br/>\n<br/>\nI think changing the code so that it takes into account the damage dealth to<br/>\nplayers would fix alot of things, not just kill stealing, for example I met a<br/>\nlevel 27 player in Befallen about a week ago that was twinking a level 12 friend<br/>\nby fetching kills and standing and just taunting and taking the damage from the<br/>\nmob while the low level whopped it.. This would not work with fixed code..<br/>\n<br/>\n- Avron -<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Daniel P. Sniderman&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Daniel P.

I think that simply there are<br/>\n&gt; &quot;problems&quot; with the code as it is designed to determine who gets credit for<br/>\n&gt; the kill.  I think that minor not drastic changes are in order.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regardless - you are a bit out of date in that Verant has acknowledged the<br/>\n&gt; problem and will be addressing it.  They stated (and I&#39;m paraphrasing) that<br/>\n&gt; the current system is such that it rewards solo over groups and they want to<br/>\n&gt; change it to tilt towards group - since their philosophy of the game is to<br/>\n&gt; promote grouping.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The way I see it - the main problem is that it only looks at damage against<br/>\n&gt; the mob and doesn&#39;t incorporate the damage that the players receive...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Slyde of Xegony<br/>\n&gt; Level 18 Bard </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
