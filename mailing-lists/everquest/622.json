But more <br/>\n&gt;like things like rubicite, mithril eq etc.. And they HAVE put level caps on <br/>\n&gt;some eq in a way now.. Since you can&#39;t even go into fear plane below level <br/>\n&gt;46 anymore, all that eq is capped at level 46.. AND nodrop.. I just dont <br/>\n&gt;want everything to be nodrop so it hinders the trade economy, I want to be <br/>\n&gt;able to trade away my old weapon for a new one and a shitload of platina, <br/>\n&gt;when I can, instead of just putting the old weapon in the bank to rot away, <br/>\n&gt;or destroying it..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Avron Elselynn - Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Case well stated.
