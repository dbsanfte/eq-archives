I used to be able to<br/>\nteach a language to my group and get better at it.  This is no longer so,<br/>\nand I talked to a GM who told me this was never so.  I was also told that<br/>\nsomething changed in respect to languages and zoning or something.  I am<br/>\nquite curious about this, as I am trying to learn every language I can.  I<br/>\nwas also curious if you could teach over your own knowledge in the language.<br/>\nThank you in advance for your replies.<br/>\n&gt; Adimisha Elvintide<br/>\n&gt; Rodcet Nife server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Paid...
