My friend made it for me<br/>\nand it cost me just about $1600.  I have 1Gigabyte of RAM and THX Surround<br/>\nSound Speakers (I love the subwoofer) and my case is all black alliumun<br/>\n(excuse my spelling) and it has a blue light inside the see-thru case that<br/>\nis sound activated so whenever you make noise or play music it flashes.  The<br/>\nfront of my case has this twin lava lamp sotra thing that goes from blue,<br/>\ngreen, and red.  My mouse is see thru optical with a blue light and my whole<br/>\ncomputer is all black and my moniter is a 15 inch flat screen.  Heh I only<br/>\ngot one of those cheap office chairs that has wheels and spins around but it<br/>\nworks for me.
