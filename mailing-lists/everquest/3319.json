That <br/>\nI&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; not able to use it or more specifically my class doesn&#39;t wield this<br/>\n&gt; weapon as well as others? Heck I seemed to be kicking some butt <br/>\nwith it<br/>\n&gt; as my hits were ranking between 12-16 points each. Any ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you have a Velium weapon.  Those are pretty common <br/>\nanymore.  They come in almost all weapon types and are easy to find.  <br/>\nThey usually go for around 10 plat.  Most people use them because <br/>\nthey are magic and they can hunt magic only mobs.  Their ratios are <br/>\ngood until about 20, then you should be able to get better.<br/>\n<br/>\nTul </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
