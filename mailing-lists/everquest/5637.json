I dont know why they woudl be experiencing<br/>\n&gt; any lag with DX9 with a P4 processor.  I run a P4<br/>\n&gt; 1.8Ghz with 1GB of RAM and a 128MB video card.  I<br/>\n&gt; very rarely lag.  Sometimes int he Bazaar when its<br/>\n&gt; crowded, and sometimes in POK when people are Mass<br/>\n&gt; Group Buffing.  Other than that, it&#39;s quite smooth. <br/>\n&gt; And this is with Spell Particles turned on with full<br/>\n&gt; opacity and clip plane at 100%.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m wondering if the person might be running Windows<br/>\n&gt; ME because I do know that I had a lot more lag when<br/>\n&gt; I ran EQ under WinME, but when I upgraded to Windows<br/>\n&gt; XP it seemed to work miracles for reducing lag. <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s about the only thing I could see that may<br/>\n&gt; make a difference.  I also have a 2nd PC which is<br/>\n&gt; relatively the same specs, except its a 1.6Ghz. <br/>\n&gt; Same thing still applies though.  Very little lag.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe that&#39;s the difference?
