It<br/>\nwas<br/>\n  not more than 4 minutes when I returned.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  No problem. All of us were newbies once.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;Question: Is it possible for someone to Steal or Loot my corpse? The book<br/>\n  says no but I beg to differ.<br/>\n  &gt;Is it possible that I had two corpses out there? Meaning, When I went<br/>\nback<br/>\n  with a dead body I died again?  &gt;Which meant I found the wrong corpse?<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  You must have found the second corpse. It can be tough sometimes getting<br/>\nthe<br/>\n  right corpse if you die more than once. And sometimes if you don&#39;t have<br/>\nany<br/>\n  items other than foraged food, you lose the foraged stuff anyways and just<br/>\n  get back the food you started with. Up to level 5 I think you get your<br/>\n  food/drink and tome of discord back. I think your starting weapon too.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;And to add one last question, &quot;what do I do now? seeing as I have no<br/>\nfood,<br/>\n  no money, no nothing?&quot;  Do I &gt;beg or do I start another char?<br/>\n  &gt;This game is totally fun but with the fact of trying to learn which way<br/>\nto<br/>\n  go all the time and dying, it is starting &gt;to get to me,<br/>\n  &gt;I don&#39;t want to give up just yet and I turned to this board since the<br/>\nChat<br/>\n  from the game options was &gt;USELESS.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  Well, if it bugs you that much, you can start over again. But even if you<br/>\n  lose everything, at that low level you can just keep the character and<br/>\njust<br/>\n  build your items and such back up again. I recommend that you not carry<br/>\n  anything you really don&#39;t want to lose until you get level 6. Keep<br/>\n  everything else in the bank. Especially your money. Oh, and practice<br/>\n  foraging alot. It will help you later on in the game. Trust me. Begging is<br/>\n  not a good idea. Begging tend to piss people off. And you might want to<br/>\n  avoid orc camps at that level. at least stay close to the lift with a good<br/>\n  group and have someone to pull wandering orc cents. I think even some orc<br/>\n  pawns might give you xp at that level.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;Please help and Thanks in advance<br/>\n  &gt;Rob<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  You&#39;re welcome.<br/>\n  luv,<br/>\n  -Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
