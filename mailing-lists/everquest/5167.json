I <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   am a graduate student at the Institute of Design at Illinois <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Institute of <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   Technology in Chicago. For one of my classes, entitled Observing <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Users, we <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   have to study a product and its users. Our group chose Everquest <br/>\n </span></blockquote>because we <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   think that it is very interesting and complex. As a retired <br/>\n </span></blockquote>online gamer I know <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   how much fun and involving the games can be. In fact, I am very <br/>\n </span></blockquote>tempted to <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   jump into Everquest, but I am worried that I may lose <br/>\n </span></blockquote>concentration on my <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   studies. If anyone is willing to devote a little of their time to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>helping us out we <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   would really appreciate it. Unfortunately, we are poor grad <br/>\n </span></blockquote>students and will <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   not be able to compensate anyone who helps us out, but we will <br/>\n </span></blockquote>very very <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   thankful.
