He said that he had the very same<br/>\nproblem, and that if you complain long enough and loud enough they will give<br/>\nyou ALL of the service you are paying for.  If i had this problem i wouldnt<br/>\nrest until they either gave me a full line / bandwidth or reduced my line<br/>\nrental accordingly.  If youre paying the usual line rental charges, Sue,<br/>\nthen dont be a fool - get onto them and say the word Solicitor as often and<br/>\nas loud as you can.  Bottom line - you are being scammed!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I know. I told my mom I was sure we were being scammed. I said to her over<br/>\nand over &quot;Why should we pay full price for lines when we only get partial<br/>\nbandwidth?&quot;<br/>\nThe phone companies always say the same bs thing. They calim they are only<br/>\nrequired to provide about 9K of bandwidth and that they do not have to give<br/>\nany more.<br/>\nI called numerous times to speak to people. Got transferred around and was<br/>\nbasically told to go f*** myself. And they weren&#39;t even that polite about<br/>\nit. I was hoping to find some type of consumer advocates group or some kind<br/>\nof consumer report to back us up. I mean, it&#39;s f***ing nuts that we&#39;re<br/>\npaying $30 a line (NOT including long distance) and can barely hear anyone<br/>\non the phone. the guy who came to fix the line said that it&#39;s our phone. We<br/>\ntried several phones. all of them brand new. The lines are just bad. The box<br/>\nthat has the phonelines which is only 1/2 a mile down the road is knocked<br/>\nover. We lose clarity when it rains. We asked them to check on it and they<br/>\nclaimed they did and that nothing is wrong.<br/>\nIn the very least we want to fight them to get our money back for the 3 days<br/>\nwe didnt get phone service bc they screwed up our line. Not to mention that<br/>\nbc it caused our phone to be constantly ringing  (it was one loud<br/>\nnoninterrupted noise and the digital display thingy said that it was<br/>\nringing) it gave my mom a massive headache, prevented her from sleeping, and<br/>\nruined one of our brand new phones. And they haven&#39;t reinstated our caller<br/>\nID yet. So we shouldn&#39;t have to pay full price for crap service.<br/>\nThey didn&#39;t even set our lines up the way they were supposed to in the first<br/>\nplace. Did you know that the less bandwidth you have, the less phones you<br/>\ncan have on your lines? I&#39;m thinking of making that an issue with them.<br/>\nIf you happen to see anything on the &#39;net about this type of thing can you<br/>\npass along the urls, please?<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Su [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: 15 March 2002 11:28<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EverQuest] Re: MORE then one account?? please explain<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yup.

I told them that I had been informed by<br/>\n&gt; someone who worked on the phone lines that I was and that he even told me<br/>\n&gt; the location of the slick. So I have 10 miles of spliced lines. Hell, when<br/>\n&gt; they worked on my neighbors lines they turned off my caller ID, call<br/>\n&gt; waiting, and disabled my main phone line for 3 days. Well, the line wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; working for 3 days. it kept saying it was busy bc they mixed it up with my<br/>\n&gt; neighbors. the call waiting and caller ID still aren&#39;t working. I&#39;m trying<br/>\n&gt; to find some type of solution to get decent lines. But I can&#39;t even get TV<br/>\n&gt; out where I live-- or get my road paved. so I&#39;m probably out of luck.<br/>\n&gt; Sorry for the rant.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Have you tried replacing your modem wire?
