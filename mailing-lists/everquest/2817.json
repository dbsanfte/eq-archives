He<br/>\nwanted to make sure there was no way back into everdrug. After 4 months he<br/>\nmailed customer service and they restored his char. Seemed to be a small<br/>\nthing, he didnt nag or anything , just asked polietely in a single email and<br/>\nthe responded immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this is just policy, its not enforced at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nRanina<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: erik [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:naslund@...\">naslund@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 02, 2002 8:31 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] Quick question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Whitmore, Lance&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lwhitmore@...\">lwhitmore@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They are kept on the server for 3 months, then deleted there after.
