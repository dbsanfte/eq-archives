You&#39;re never at a loss for things to<br/>\ndo with a Druid, plus the ability to travel is a<br/>\nluxury that&#39;s difficult to give up.

It&#39;s a relatively simple quest for a 10<br/>\nWIS 10 mana secondary weapon slot book.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; One I might be able to do fairly easily on my own? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The only combat portion of the Testament quest is<br/>\nkilling Dyllan Starshine in Highpass. He&#39;s a long<br/>\ncamp, seven hour respawn time, but a fairly easy kill<br/>\nin the high teens to low 20&#39;s. Aside from that, it&#39;s<br/>\njust a quick trip to Qeynos to meet with an NPC<br/>\noutside of Crow&#39;s Tavern. (the erudite in the purple<br/>\nrobe, forget his name) Check allakhazam.com for the<br/>\ncomplete rundown of the quest.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I have got to start learning this game on my own<br/>\n&gt;instead of just doing what HE tells me to do...you<br/>\n&gt;know, AUTO FOLLOW, ASSIST, Here take<br/>\n&gt;this..LOL...LOL...I keep running around Freeport<br/>\n&gt;afraid to go out cause I don&#39;t know if I could find<br/>\n </span></blockquote>my &gt;way back...I sound pathetic don&#39;t I?? :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe quick fix for that is Bind Affinity and Gate, with<br/>\nthose no matter what you can always gate back to your<br/>\nbind spot. Part of why I recommended the druid is that<br/>\nonce you get your first round of teleports, your<br/>\nfreedom to travel greatly increases, you can always<br/>\njust port back to a druid circle you know. (if you&#39;re<br/>\nparked in Freeport you&#39;ve probably seen the circle in<br/>\nWest Commonlands)<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________________________ <br/>\nFind, Connect, Date! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://personals.yahoo.ca\">http://personals.yahoo.ca</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
