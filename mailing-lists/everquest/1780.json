Whether your online or not.  What I might suggest<br/>\nfor the future is to know your surrounds: roads, landmarks, certain shops,<br/>\netc..  Stick to the roads, it might not be the most direct route, however<br/>\nthey will lead you to your destination.  As far as finding your corpse,<br/>\ninvest in a Chipbone Rod or two and place them in the bank (remember that<br/>\nwhen you died your nekid - store them in the bank or they will be useless<br/>\n:).  You can find them normally at a merchant with shaman supplies and<br/>\npotions.  They are a few platinum, however are worth it if you don&#39;t know<br/>\nwhere your corpse is.  Simply target yourself ( or whomever your trying to<br/>\nlocate a corpse for ) in the zone where your target died, and right click.<br/>\nThis will cause you to point in the direction your corpse is located.  It<br/>\nhas a few charges and works quite nicely.<br/>\n<br/>\nElse do a /who bard, or /who necro.  Both of those classes get a corpse<br/>\nlocating song/spell before they reach lvl 6.  In most cases, if not all,<br/>\nthey will be happy to help you find your corpse for little compensation.  I<br/>\nstill keep a rod on me, I never know when a friend of mine will be stuck<br/>\nsomewhere, not knowing where they died.  And its nice to be able to find it<br/>\nfor them.<br/>\n<br/>\nD.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Steven R.

I died once in some place, (Don&#39;t remember know, just finally gave<br/>\nup), Couldn&#39;t find it and basically had to start over. One thing I do is if<br/>\nyou can get a couple of good weapons for your character is to place one in<br/>\nthe bank, that way if you die you can go to the bank and get it out so you<br/>\ncan go get your corpse. At least you&#39;ll have some weaponry to defend<br/>\nyourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso if you died at Orc hill or somewhere like that try to group and see if<br/>\nthey would cover you until you can get all your stuff back.<br/>\n<br/>\n*******************************************************<br/>\nSteven R.
