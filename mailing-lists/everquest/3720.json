Started foraging the tufts of dire <br/>\nwolf<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fur<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I need for advancing my tailoring.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have not been fortunate in hunting. Level 34 puts me low on <br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; food chain in EW. I have tried my standard hunting routine <br/>\nfrom<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; foot of the bridge, but have been beaten back to the zone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; repeatedly.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This last time, I crossed the zone to get away from a mob, <br/>\nand was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instantly killed by some kind of tracking wolf pack. They <br/>\ntook me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; down twice more in the next fifteen minutes. Found someone <br/>\nelse<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; contending with them when I resurrected. He being a higher <br/>\nlevel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; offered to train them away, and did so.

If they <br/>\ncan<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; foraged I think you can forage them in GD and Thurgadin. GD <br/>\nseems<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; less mobs. There are some spots that are safer to hunt. There&#39;s <br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spot where<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you can just get the wolves and if you get into trouble you can <br/>\nrun<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; coldain wolves and guards for help.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
