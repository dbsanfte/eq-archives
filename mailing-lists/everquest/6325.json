I played <br/>\nEQ some time ago, six or seven years and it&#39;s changed quite a bit to <br/>\nsay the least. I do like the Tutorial, which allowed me to create a <br/>\ncharacter and get him to 10-11th level in no time at all. Now being <br/>\n12th level, I play a Troll SK, what&#39;s a good place to hunt. I group <br/>\nwhen I can but the servers not always busy. Looking for good xp and <br/>\ncoin of course. Figured Befallen or the Lava fields.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to all<br/>\n<br/>\nScott</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
