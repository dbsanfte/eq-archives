I have a lvl 26 mage on Rallos, and no matter how hard i try, I cant seem to get past this lvl.  I have been in full groups killing reds in FV for hours and still only gotten like half a bub of xp, and all the others in my group were around teh same lvl.  I have tried soloing and still nothing.  I am curious waht I should do, because I lvled really quick until 24 and it took me about teh same amount of time to get to 24 as it did to get from 24 to 26.  I am about done with it because I cant seem to go anywhere with her.  I started a druid on another server and have been playing that, but if i CAN find a way to lvl up my mage, Id liek to.  Thanks in advance for all your help.\r<br/>\nKittin<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Paid...
