Verant &quot;Doesn&#39;t know&quot; if you are lying or<br/>\nat least that&#39;s what they claim.  I really want to know why there is a<br/>\nmessage every few minutes on my screen telling me that my character is saved<br/>\nif they refuse to use that info to help players who have been destroyed by<br/>\nbugs that should have been squashed in beta.  I&#39;ve been lucky and have not<br/>\nlost items due to bugs, it&#39;s happened to a good friend of mine, he just gave<br/>\nup that character, didn&#39;t want to deal with that crap.  Verant doesn&#39;t seem<br/>\nto understand that we pay money to play this game and we shouldn&#39;t have to<br/>\n&quot;just deal&quot; with these kind of programming mistakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey could have programmed the game with more logging to know what happened<br/>\nwhen a character dies and know what they had when they died so they could be<br/>\nrestored without worry that you really traded your items to a friend before<br/>\ndieing on the boat but they made the decision not to, apparently, or to not<br/>\nuse that data and instead they just have their GM&#39;s give the same line of<br/>\ngarbage every time that they can&#39;t do anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the biggest problems with this game right now is their severe lack of<br/>\ncustomer service and their lack of being responsible for the bugs in the<br/>\ngame.

Or if you&#39;re lucky like me, friends will help you<br/>\nto recoup your loss (Thanks again Natalia, Arith, Lanor).<br/>\n<br/>\nVerant has no way of knowing if you&#39;re lying or not...and frankly, if you<br/>\nmanage to bug them into giving it to you - let me know...I think I lost a<br/>\nshiny metallic robe too....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nCongratulations <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KNICKS@...\">KNICKS@...</a>.
