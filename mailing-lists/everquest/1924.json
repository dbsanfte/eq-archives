The problem in Runnyeye is the shere numbers of <br/>\nmobs at times and in places. Many lower level caster mobs, so you <br/>\ncound get hit with spells often disrupting your own casting. The <br/>\ndeeper in and farther down you go, the harder it gets, as seems to be <br/>\nthe case for most dungeons.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a plus, I think an experience bonus is in place in Runnyeye.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Su&quot; &lt;suceress@k...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Do you think a lvl 32 cleric would do ok in Runnyeye?<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hehe, I don&#39;t know the answer to your question about the ore, but <br/>\nI had to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; respond:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am so happy to find out that I am not the only Druid that hates<br/>\n&gt; dungeons.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Give me the wide open spaces of the Karanas, the Overthere, the<br/>\n&gt; Dreadlands,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or even Rathe Mts. any day.

In fact I <br/>\njust got<br/>\n&gt; &gt; de-leveled back into hell 40 this past weekend because of some <br/>\nnasty<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Pickclaw Casters in the bottom level of Runnyeye. They didn&#39;t <br/>\nlike the<br/>\n&gt; fact<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that I was healing a level 24 warrior that wanted some Blackened <br/>\nAlloy,<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was too proud to desert him to his death to save my own skin.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Froondor<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Wood Elf Druid of 40 seasons, Tarew Marr server.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &lt;MLockridge01@c...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;EverQuest@y...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Sunday, November 11, 2001 10:36 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EverQuest] South Karana<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I took the advice of others here and having finished my goals <br/>\nin EK I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; moved to SK. I have found the gnolls camped heavily, but while <br/>\nthere<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have found Aviak Rooks wandering with sufficient frequency to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; profitable. I solo them, getting about 1.5pp average in cash and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; loot. Not too bad, and I can pick off something else when they <br/>\nare<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; too thin.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone know if the hq ore dropped in Runnyeye is no drop? My <br/>\ndruid<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; does not do that well in dungeons, so hunting up the stuff <br/>\nmyself is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not a happy prospect.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Barto Proudfoot, Halfling Druid<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
