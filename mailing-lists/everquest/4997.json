Then, I have \n  heard people talking about some games where a player <br>could buy corpse \n  insurance: if you die then you get back everything that <br>you were carrying. \n  I don&#39;t like corpse runs either. It takes away from the <br>fun in the game. \n  It might be more fun if you had a chance of coming back as <br>a random \n  race/creature each time that you died and had to stay that way for <br>a \n  number of game days before you returned to normal. That could work for or \n  <br>against you. It would force players to temporarily use characters of other \n  <br>races and learn more about \n  them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would not \n  eliminate rezzes. What would be the point of investing <br>time into building \n  up a character only to lose everything in a single <br>fight? I&#39;d stop playing \n  the game. I wouldn&#39;t even have to think about it. <br>The fun of playing the \n  game wouldn&#39;t be worth the time spent and lost, <br>spent and lost yet again \n  developing a temporary character. For me, the fun <br>of the game is watching \n  my character grow. Without that, the battles and <br>treasure are pointless to \n  me and so is the game.<br><br>Edward Fox<br><br>At 09:23 AM 8/16/2003 -0500, \n  you wrote:<br>&gt;Good point. The only good thing I thought of for corpse runs \n  was that you<br>&gt;can be summoned back to your corpse so you don&#39;t have to \n  make the trek to<br>&gt;wherever you died all over again. But yeah, if you \n  can&#39;t find your corpse<br>&gt;it&#39;s a royal pain.<br>&gt;Would you have it so \n  you have all your gear but can still be rezzed? or<br>&gt;would you just \n  eliminate rezzes?<br>&gt;luv,<br>&gt;-Su<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Or, if you \n  could go back in time and change something about Everquest<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; \n  during<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; it&#39;s creation to have certain features, what would \n  you have done<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; differently?<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; \n  &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Definitely I would get rid of the corpse-hunting. I \n  understand losing exp<br>&gt; &gt; when you die, I think that&#39;s a good thing \n  (well not GOOD but it makes<br>&gt;sense) but<br>&gt; &gt; going back to find \n  your body to get all your stuff back just sucks.<br>&gt;Especially<br>&gt; \n  &gt; when you die somewhere you can&#39;t get back to. WHY can&#39;t you ever find \n  a<br>&gt;necro<br>&gt; &gt; when you need one?<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; \n  &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &quot;Sail to your heart&#39;s desires, and know when to drop \n  anchor.&quot;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Yahoo!
