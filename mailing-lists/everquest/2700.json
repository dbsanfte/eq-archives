Thank you for sharing the link.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sad thing is, you can just sit in GFay and watch the /ooc and /shout<br/>\nchannel and see a lot of the stuff that Lowtax describes humorously in his<br/>\n&quot;newbie guide&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nExample from my own experience on Tarew Marr server.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other night I was playing my level 13 scratch (totally non-twinked) Wood<br/>\nElf Ranger. A level 1 HE enchanter started spamming GFay for 5pp to buy her<br/>\nlevel 1 spells. Another person and I finally replied back in /ooc that you<br/>\ncould buy just about all the useful level 1 spells for a platinum or so. She<br/>\nthen changed her spam to asking for 2pp.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone else jumped in and chided us for &quot;being harsh&quot; so I decided to give<br/>\nthe beggar 2pp just to see what happened. I tracked her down near Felwithe,<br/>\nhailed her, and gave her 2pp. The VERY next thing she says to me is &quot;you got<br/>\nany caster stuff?&quot; Not &quot;Thank You&quot;, not even &quot;ty&quot; or &quot;thx&quot;, just &quot;you got<br/>\nany caster stuff&quot;. I just said &quot;No, I am a Ranger, sorry&quot; and turned and<br/>\nleft.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few minutes later this same person was back spamming the zone for tiny<br/>\ndaggers (ingredient to cast pet) because she &quot;looked everywhere in Felwithe&quot;<br/>\nand &quot;couldn&#39;t find them anywhere&quot;. I have played a HE enchanter, so I KNOW<br/>\nyou can buy them for 1sp each from one of the 4 merchants in the room where<br/>\nthe Enchanter Guildmaster is, so I repeated that information in /ooc. She<br/>\nthen asks for money to buy them because she didn&#39;t have any. I told her in<br/>\n/ooc &quot;An enchanter can get 1 sp for a wasp wing, and that happens to be how<br/>\nmuch a tiny dagger costs. Start killing stuff and stop begging.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I finally deleted my Enchanter at level 10 (I had also played him<br/>\nwithout any help from my higher level characters) he had nearly all his<br/>\nlevel 1, 4, and 8 spells, full (some looted, some bought) cloth armor, as<br/>\nwell as 50pp in the bank, from just killing and looting everything he was<br/>\nable to, and selling it to merchants, so I know it can be done. Sure, he did<br/>\na lot of corpse runs (this was before the patch that eliminated corpse runs<br/>\nunder level 10), but 1sp per wasp wing, 4sp per royal jelly, 3gp per wasp<br/>\npoison sac, 1pp per cracked staff, etc.at the merchants adds up fairly<br/>\nquickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess maybe I was a litte harsh to that newbie chanter, yes, but I have<br/>\nused my Druid&#39;s bank account to equip numerous new druids and rangers in<br/>\nthat zone with full leather armor, a half-way decent newbie weapon, and a<br/>\nlittle buffing (skin like diamond, sow, strength of stone, thorns, regen),<br/>\nbut not because they begged. I did it because they seemed to be players that<br/>\nwanted to have fun and to play the game right, but needed a little boost,<br/>\nand I enjoy helping people. I don&#39;t enjoy beggars, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else have thoughts to share on players who spam the newbie zones<br/>\nasking to be given free money or items? I would be interested to see how the<br/>\nothers on this mailing list feel about the subject.<br/>\n<br/>\n=)<br/>\n<br/>\nFroondor, 41 Wood Elf Druid on Tarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Su&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, April 14, 2002 1:26 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Something Awful.com pokes fun at EQ<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I just found this link from one of the weirdest sources...<br/>\n&gt; Anyways, I found it amusing and figured I&#39;d share it.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.somethingawful.com/eq/\">http://www.somethingawful.com/eq/</a><br/>\n&gt; Keep in mind it&#39;s all for laughs.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
