IMHO this is a technique to be done in off hours (getting harder<br/>\nbecause those times maybe main times for other players). also i have to<br/>\nadd, if some quadder endangers my party or me, or just annoys other<br/>\npeople in the zone, i nuke away her/his tail - without any friendly<br/>\nwarning.<br/>\n<br/>\nok, the basic idea is to maximise experience per time. you need two<br/>\nthings for that: (1) a slow spell and (2) area damage spells. it is<br/>\ngood for (1) to have an area version of this as well. what i also<br/>\nrecommend is some knowledge of the zone you want to kite in, because<br/>\nif the zone has some weird pathing, or you can get other adds, you<br/>\nwon&#39;t have much fun doing it. two additional things make it somewhat<br/>\neasier: (a) something to make you run faster, eg sow, jboots, horse<br/>\nand (b) candy of course, because many of those area damage spells<br/>\nneed some amounts of mana.<br/>\n<br/>\nbecause of (1), (2) and (a) it is easiest for druids because of their<br/>\nnormal spells. wizzies either need jboots or sow potions.<br/>\n<br/>\nan additional nice-to-have-thing for wizzies, is anice stick obtained<br/>\nthrough a quest in the ro-temple: Staff of Temperate Flux. no you don&#39;t<br/>\nneed it for fighting, but it has a very nice effect: Lower Element.<br/>\nthis effect has almost the same range as the damage spells you use when<br/>\nkiting/quadding!<br/>\n<br/>\nso, how does it actually work:<br/>\n  - tag monster(s) with a slow spell up to four<br/>\n  - group them if necessary - you need them close for your area spells<br/>\n    to work<br/>\n  - keep moving and area damaging them, until all of them fall apart<br/>\n  - don&#39;t get killed yourself<br/>\n<br/>\nwhy didn&#39;t i mention the names of the used spells, because druids and<br/>\nwizzies use a different set: druids do their &quot;illness and rotting&quot;<br/>\nspells, and wizzies use their normal raw forces ones.<br/>\n<br/>\na sidenote for wizzies: you need your lvl 29 &quot;Bonds of Force&quot; for this<br/>\ntask, but this one has a special feature (i don&#39;t know if druids do run<br/>\ninto the same problem): you can snare yourself with this spell, if you<br/>\ncast it on a mob being too close !!! yes, i knew of this feature, and i<br/>\nsnared myself on the first attempts.<br/>\n<br/>\ni am not sure if other classes can do this as well, or if it is possible<br/>\nto do reverse quadding (using fear), but this sounds very uncommon,<br/>\nbecause i don&#39;t think you can force a group of critters in one direction<br/>\nusing fear. maybe also some of the druids on this board will give away<br/>\nsome of the tricks of the trade ... :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nbefore i stop, i want to remind you again: people are playing EQ for fun<br/>\nand want to enjoy it. and you can easily spoil someones day even if you<br/>\nhave fun ... think about it !<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ntake care<br/>\nBiltilie Dwimmerlaik<br/>\nlevel 52 female gnome magician (run over by brownie guards)<br/>\nTarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
