But the pottery you would have to do would take SOOO much<br/>\ntime.. It will bore you to death not to mention give your fingers<br/>\ncramps.. ;) I estimate if you do it well you can have full set of steel<br/>\nplate and a wb sword in about 75 realtime hours of pottery.. If you<br/>\nreally want to &quot;cheat&quot; like this, and spend the time required to do it,<br/>\nI feel VERY sorry for you.. ;) But then again there are those that play<br/>\nover 10h per day(I feel sorry for them already;), they can be wearing<br/>\nthis set of nice items in about a week and a half..</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
