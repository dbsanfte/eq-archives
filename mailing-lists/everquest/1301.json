I group<br/>\n&gt; once<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in a while, but prefer to develop solo skills.

I<br/>\n&gt; then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; plan to begin traveling and picking up some of the little quests.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am drawn initially toward the Commons. Any suggestions as to<br/>\n&gt; what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interesting low-level solo quests might be in that area?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Barto of Rivervale.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
