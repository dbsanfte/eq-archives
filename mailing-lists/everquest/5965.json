Now I guess instead of the little \n<br>color ring, you also get icons either above or below the NPC name that \n<br>shows exactly how tough they may be. Also if you have a mob and you \n<br>target one it shows you ALL the others that will come running if you \nattack.<br><br>Happy adventuring!<br>Durgaa; Ranger of the 32nd Season on \nSolusek Ro Server and member of <br>Mystic Crusaders<br></strong></tt></div>\n<div><tt><strong></strong></tt>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><tt><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Yes, I do like that about EQ2.&nbsp; It goes a \nlittle further into detail though.&nbsp; As far as the conning system, you&#39;ve \ngot 7 colors instead of 5 like in eQ1.&nbsp; The colors in EQ2 range as \nfollows:&nbsp; Grey, Green, Blue, White, Yellow, Orange, and Red.&nbsp; On Grey \nmobs there will never be any xp.&nbsp; A further indication of the mob&#39;s \ntoughness are the arrow indicators above its name.&nbsp; The arrows can point \neither up or down.&nbsp; If the arrows point down it means the mob is weaker \nthan its color implies, and if they point up, its tougher than the color \nimplies.&nbsp; So for example, you con a White mob and the message said it&#39;s \nevenly matched with ou, it should be a good fight.&nbsp; If it has two arrows \npointing up, chances are it&#39;s a little tougher than you are and you might need a \nback up heal.&nbsp; this helps when deciding which mobs to take.&nbsp; Another \nthing the conning system has is that it will indicate &quot;Solo&quot; or &quot;Group&quot; when you \ntarget it.&nbsp; Any time you&#39;re soloing and it indicates Group in the target \nwindow, you better not even try it cause you won&#39;t live unless you got plenty of \nfriends to help.&nbsp; Another cool thing is that during combat you actually get \nto see the mana of your caster mobs.&nbsp; When it runs out of mana it can no \nlonger cast spells on you and it can only melee until the end of the \nconfrontation.&nbsp; this comes in as a good strategy during some higher level \nfights.&nbsp; If the mob is focusing only on the tank, then the rest of the \ncasters in your group can cast without being interrupted.&nbsp; \n</font></tt></div>\n<div><tt><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font></tt>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><tt><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font></tt>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><tt><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">As far as gameplay, that&#39;ll be up to individual \npreferences.&nbsp;&nbsp; Me, personally, I think EQ2 is a bit more simlistic \nsince it&#39;s been laid out better and things are explained in more detail.&nbsp; \nthere&#39;s no real guesswork in the quests.&nbsp; But if you only play the game to \nhave fun and not to have to think a lot, then it&#39;s good.&nbsp; If you want \nquests where you have to try to figure out every single detail, then stick with \nEQ1.</font></tt></div>\n<div><tt><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font></tt>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><tt><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font></tt>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><tt><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Wulfric</font></tt></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
