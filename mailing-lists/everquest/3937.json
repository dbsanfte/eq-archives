I was just wondering if anyone <br/>\n&gt; else on this list was going to get it. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ____________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>EQOA is going to be fun.  I got into the betas.  Beta2 is going to start <br/>\nsoon.  Some people may call it &#39;EQ-lite&#39; but it&#39;s not really like that.<br/>\nIt&#39;s just as fun as EQ.<br/>\nAnybody planning to buy it, buy the network adapter as soon as you see <br/>\nit.  They are sometimes hard to find.  Also, buy a USB keyboard or a <br/>\nregular keyboard with a USB adapter, keyboards make it much easier to <br/>\ncommunicate.<br/>\nCan&#39;t really tell any details of the game because of the EULA they make <br/>\nus agree to.<br/>\nSomebody who was in the Disney beta said that was actually much better <br/>\nthan you&#39;d think a &#39;kid-themed MMOG&#39; would be.  Don&#39;t think I&#39;d buy it <br/>\ntho.  Don&#39;t see it making it very long.  May do well at first, but after <br/>\na while the kids will lose interest or grow out of it.<br/>\n-- <br/>\n-----------------------------------------<br/>\n--------------<br/>\nBebinn Maolcataig 39 Woodelf Druid, Disciple of Tunare, Dignatio cum <br/>\nDemori, Bertoxx server<br/>\n<br/>\nLindira  23 Vah Shir Bard,Jharin Apprentice, Bertoxx</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
