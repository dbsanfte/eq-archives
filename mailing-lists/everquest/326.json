I&#39;m a LVL 11 (REAL close to 12) Bard - been spending the last several<br/>\nlevels hitting Orc an Dervish camps.  I&#39;ve been getting killed by these<br/>\ncritters (mostly con blue and white) and of course the obligatory deaths due<br/>\nto Griffins and Sand Giants.  Last night got killed by a Ghoul in befallen<br/>\n(not sure if that is red or yellow)...<br/>\n<br/>\nI am almost to the conclusion that they use a random number generator.<br/>\nSometimes I see a significant loss (close to if not a half-bubble) sometimes<br/>\nit seems that I&#39;ve barely lost any.  Seems like I usually lose a lot when<br/>\ngetting chomped by the super-high-level ones (Griff/SG) and often not a lot<br/>\nwhen its close to level as me (blue/white)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - anecdotally it seems that if you die after dying recently you lose<br/>\nmore for that death than otherwise.  Perhaps some sort of timer?  But of<br/>\ncourse - this could be coincidence - or again the random xp loss theory<br/>\ncould come into play here to...<br/>\n<br/>\nSlyde of Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Chris_Mattos@...\">Chris_Mattos@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shane0009@...\">shane0009@...</a>&gt;; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, May 21, 1999 6:19 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] Loosing exp when dying<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Chris_Mattos@...\">Chris_Mattos@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I brought up this subject on the Stratics EQ chat room (irc.stratics.com<br/>\n#Everquest) and it was pretty much agreed that the level of the MOB that<br/>\nkill you has, at least, some effect on experience loss.  In fact, a couple<br/>\nof the higher level players in the chat room (both of them claimed to be<br/>\n30+) came back with an absolute YES.  The thinking is that at lower levels<br/>\n(say 6-15), the level of MOB that would probably kill you is going to be<br/>\nhigher than you.  At these levels, &quot;blues&quot; are not difficult to defeat.  At<br/>\nhigher levels, MOBS than con blue to you (meaning lower level than you) are<br/>\nfar more dangerous and can easily<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
