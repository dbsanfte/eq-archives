Arrowheads go trivial at 41.  They might be good to <br/>\nraise your skill to that point but are cheaper to buy.  And there&#39;s <br/>\nno failures when you buy.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the new Condensed substance arrowheads are a reason to build your <br/>\nsmithing skill, as are the acrylia shafts.  The problem is all that <br/>\nstuff is on the moon and it is in high level zones, except the <br/>\nacrylia which is on mid-level mobs.  And they are all highly prized <br/>\nthus hard to find.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for money, until the recent patch you could master blacksmithing <br/>\nfor under 100 plat if you had decent int.  Now most of the skill <br/>\nbuilding stuff, like skewers, top out in the 50&#39;s.  So you&#39;re stuck <br/>\nhaving to make armor, and that&#39;s an expensive way to go.  And since I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t seen anyone looking for a smith in months it&#39;s probably <br/>\nunprofitable.  I can&#39;t remember the last time I saw someone in banded <br/>\nor even plate.  Everyone is in drop armor, or now their newbie armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuckily my guys mastered smithing a while ago.  It looks like <br/>\nsmithing will be expensive now, unless you find a lot of dropped <br/>\nstuff to work with.  Good luck<br/>\n<br/>\nTuldayen Grimblade<br/>\n37th Season Ranger of Tunare<br/>\nTerris-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
