Matter of fact, it looks like they only sell the Visiontek cards. If you take a look at the Visiontek site, they only list the Ti as AGP. Or go to PNY, or any other video card manufacturer and you will see the same thing. The Ti versions only come for an AGP slot. If anyone thinks I am in error, please provide me with a link.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I have seen both PCI and AGP cards of the Ti at Babbages.<br/>\n&gt;luv,<br/>\n&gt;-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Is the Ti a pci card?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;J.
