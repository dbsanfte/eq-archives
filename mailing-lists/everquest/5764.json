She is a lvl<br/>\n60 woodelf ranger and only about 30% away from hitting<br/>\nlevel 61.  She resides on the Tunare server and is a<br/>\nmember of the guild Infinite Storm.<br/>\n(working on a character story for her... its a long<br/>\none and consists of close to 4 chapters now.  Can&#39;t<br/>\nseem to condense it very well.  To much of a story<br/>\nteller in me to make anything to short)<br/>\nI have 3 others that I play as often as I can when<br/>\nthere is nothing to do on my main and a few others<br/>\nthat have just seem to be hybernating.  All 8 slots<br/>\nfilled for my server.  Alt mains (as I call them):<br/>\nYissia Hissnpounce - 27 Berserker<br/>\nStarnova Daemonhart - 29 Wizard<br/>\nKairii Ragingfire - 25 monk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nReal self<br/>\nMy name is Celena but friends call me Lena.  I live in<br/>\nVirginia Beach, VA and am a 21 year old female.  Still<br/>\nin college slowly working to my associates for Network<br/>\nEngineering.<br/>\nI have been into gaming since I was about 6 years old.<br/>\n My dad then bought me and my brother (then 3) a<br/>\nNintendo System.  Whoo.. we were so happy but what<br/>\nchild probably wasn&#39;t to have one of those back then. <br/>\nI could never really pass a normal RPG game.  Came<br/>\nclose to beating Mario 3 before but never succeeded. <br/>\nI used to just give up on them.  I have played games<br/>\nfrom many systems including your table-top dice games.<br/>\n When my dad got me my computer at age 14 I became<br/>\nmore glued to PC games.  Never had an online game<br/>\nuntil after high school.  I constantly saw EQ on the<br/>\nshelf in many stores and one of my friends noticed me<br/>\nalways looking at the game everytime we went to<br/>\nstores.  So xmas of 2001 I ended up with EQ trilogy<br/>\nand Luclin.  Been playing since May of 2002 (had to<br/>\nupgrade system before I could play).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I am gonna stop blabbing and again say hello again<br/>\nto allof you out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nLena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n&quot;Yes, I am a ranger&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Good.  I have a task for you&quot; *whispers to the elf*<br/>\n&quot;You want me to be WHAT!!!!&quot;<br/>\n*The Dwarf nods*<br/>\n&quot;Thats suicide!&quot;<br/>\n&quot;No I will not be your bait to that dreadful dragon!  Find someone else.  Like maybe a human monk.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;But we heard Dragons prefer the fear of a ranger.  Especially an elven rangeress.&quot;<br/>\n*Huntress Starnyte storms away from the village muttering foul words in the Feir&#39;Dal language*<br/>\n&quot;Dwarves are only good to be food to the lizardmen, not party members.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
