The language barrier is tuff for the 1st few<br/>\nlvs but you can emote in common. I head to pok and<br/>\nemoted the fact I wish I could speak Human or elvish<br/>\nthe 2 most common tongues and people will group then<br/>\nspam you in no time your a master.  Later in groups<br/>\npeople of other races are more than happy to exchange<br/>\nlessons with ya during med time.  Some will not let me<br/>\nin a group because of your race, that is fine I dont<br/>\nneed the help of the softskins anyway. The roleplay is<br/>\nfun tho.  In general people are pretty nice and<br/>\ndedicated there the trivial thing does bite. <br/>\n              My 2 copper Hogg  <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
