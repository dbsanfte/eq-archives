What sticks out in my mind from then was<br/>\nseeing EC really crowded with lowbies trying to hunt. <br/>\nA 40 char was rare, so when giants and griffs spawned<br/>\nthe whole zone would be running around trying to avoid<br/>\nit, and if it got you you were insta killed.  I<br/>\nremember the first time I saw one go down the whole<br/>\nzone of lowbies were around it hitting it to go down. <br/>\nI was amazed that it could even be killed.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople would fight over orc spawns and stuff.  It was<br/>\nfunny, but bad for a monk because droods and bards<br/>\nalways got to them first.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen it was the same with Oasis, HK, EK/WK.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuilds would race to get the next Naggy spawn.  Naggy<br/>\nraids were fun.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis was also before the time when anyone had figured<br/>\nout &quot;role based&quot; grouping so there was no such thing<br/>\nas the big three (tank/cleric/slower).  I was once in<br/>\na group in Paw with 6 monks.  Now that was fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was also before Sony gimped monks so we were THE<br/>\nsolo class.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember being proud when I could do three digit<br/>\ndamage in a round.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI might dink around on a classic server, but I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink there&#39;s any getting the old days back.  I&#39;m<br/>\nstill enjoying pushing the envelope on my monk (level<br/>\n70, ~100 AA&#39;S) so lots of growth to do there.  I&#39;m<br/>\nalso doing tradeskills and only have 9 points to go to<br/>\nget blacksmithing to 200, and then 42 to get tailoring<br/>\nto 200, and the rest are already 200 or more.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuwi Changkane, 70 monk Fenin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Nick Thompson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:poolsharkbc@...\">poolsharkbc@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have to admit, I&#39;m not as old school as most of<br/>\n&gt; you.<br/>\n&gt;  I&#39;d love to try it to get the feel of what everyone<br/>\n&gt; went through before the expansions.
