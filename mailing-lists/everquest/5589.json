I&#39;ve gotten 30-36 pp per Swatch!? (15-20pp per silk, 300-400 per stack) The inflation was over the past 2-3 weeks. I can see it coming down a little as the bazaar fills with silk now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother place is to farm the tribal gatherers in Dawnshroud Peaks for their Blocks, Small Bricks and Large Bricks of Acrylia for bazaar and sell weapons to the merchants (1-5pp ea).<br/>\n<br/>\nCiao,<br/>\nMiracht Riversfriend<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Message: 3<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 9 Mar 2004 05:41:00 -0800 (PST)<br/>\n&gt;    From: Angel Ocasio &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:d4bidden2000@...\">d4bidden2000@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Re: Gargoyle Island in Ocean of Tears<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The boats are really slow and awkward to use.

Spider silks sell for around<br/>\n&gt; 20-30pp per stack. Spiderling silks for around the<br/>\n&gt; same. Animal pelts sell pretty good too. For spider<br/>\n&gt; silks hunt crag spiders in east karana. Kill<br/>\n&gt; spiderlings in everfrost or innothule swamp. For pelts<br/>\n&gt; my favorite place is the karanas and stonebrunt<br/>\n&gt; mountains.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hope this helps.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
