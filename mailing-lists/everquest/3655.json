And it&#39;s finely<br/>\n&gt;correct on the character selection screen! However, my inventory picture<br/>\n&gt;is still black!? I guess I&#39;ll just go to tech support chat...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Remove head gear/masks. Pick your desired features<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; using the /face command. Force a character save.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Zone into another area, still without head gear.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Check yourself, you should be &quot;yourself&quot;. If<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not...start over and try again. If you are okay,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then you should be okay and can put back on head<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gear/masks.
