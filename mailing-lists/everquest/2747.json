The 4MX was able to run in full clip plane, with perfect frame rate in \nFirionia Vi at 800x600 with 4X AA. It looks reasonably good with Anti-aliasing \nalthough the text is a little blurry. I tried a 3 TI which looked better and got \nthe same results. The 4 TI runs perfectly at 1024x768(Probably would run \nperfectly at 1600x1200, lol)&nbsp;at full clip plane and looks great even \nwithout AA. I just thought that the game looked better with the 4 TI, but if you \nget a 4MX you should be able to achieve excellent frame rates, but it may be \nobsolete when the next big MMORPG(Shadowbane, Starwars Galaxies)&nbsp;comes out. \nI don&#39;t think Everquest supports any features that you will miss out on if you \nget the 4MX. The 4MX is just a faster 2MX with better AA features. The bottom \nline for me is that the 4TI is a good investment that should last for quite \nsometime and should work well even on a 2-3Ghz platform. The 4MX&nbsp;may be \nobsolete on future games, but is good for playing EQ. &nbsp;</font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"MLockridge01@...\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MLockridge01@...\">mlockridge01</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Saturday, April 20, 2002 2:01 \n  PM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> [EverQuest] Re: Geforce 4 MX vs \n  Geforce 4 Ti</div>\n  <div><br></div><tt>Thanks to everyone for their responses.
