I kept getting a message saying something like my<br/>\n&gt; will isn&#39;t right to command this weapon. What does that mean? That I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; not able to use it or more specifically my class doesn&#39;t wield this<br/>\n&gt; weapon as well as others? Heck I seemed to be kicking some butt with it<br/>\n&gt; as my hits were ranking between 12-16 points each. Any ideas?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
