I am in AWE of you people even though I don&#39;t \n<br>understand half of what you say. I long for the day when I can talk \n<br>about the finer ponts of EQ like you guys. <br></font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; That won&#39;t be too long. Even \nthough the zones might be different, the mobs are pretty much the same.&nbsp; \nOnce you learn how to deal with one mob, it pretty much applies to all \nmobs.&nbsp; A little trepidation and common sense.&nbsp; Con before you \nattack.&nbsp; If it&#39;s red, stay away from it.&nbsp; If you&#39;re in a zone and \nEVERYTHING is red, invisible is a good thing.&nbsp; You never know just which \nmobs will aggro, and what idiot will traint he zone just for fun.&nbsp; Next \nthing you know you&#39;re caught in the crossfire of soemthign you didn&#39;t start and \ndie for no reason whatsoever.&nbsp; That sucks!</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">&nbsp;</font></div>\n<div><br>For the moment I have a love/hate relationship with EQ after playing \n<br>for about two months or so. Its a type of game I have never <br>experienced \nbefore - I am totally fascinated and mildly (well, at the <br>moment!) addicted. \nThe game boths thrills and scares me. I find <br>myself nervously approaching \nthe PC every night mentally preparing <br>myself for the dangers ahead. Once I&#39;m \nin, I am immersed. GET THAT <br>LEVEL UP is my only goal.<br></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> <div>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; I was the same way when I started out.&nbsp; But EQ \n </div></span></blockquote>has gone through a lot of changes since I started.&nbsp; Now it&#39;s a heck of a \nlot easier than it was before.&nbsp; Not because I&#39;m experience but just because \nthey&#39;ve made so many changes that now it&#39;s just easier for newbies.\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><br>When I levelled 10 I knew that I was going to have to deal with REAL \n<br>dying and corpse retrieval. Boy, that was - and still is&nbsp; - a \n<br>learning experience. The first few times I got so depressed that I <br>vowed \nto give up and cancel my subscription. But I crawled to lvl 11 <br>and am much \nmore careful about conning.<br></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> <div>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; The better you know a zone, the easier it is \n </div></span></blockquote>to retrieve a corpse.&nbsp; 3 words:&nbsp;&nbsp; eqatlas.com\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><br>By nature I am not a team player so grouping is still a bit alien to \n<br>me although I realise its the only fast way to get xp. But too often <br>I \nfind myself in groups that just gung ho for everything in sight <br>hitting \nanything that moves (= Excelsis having to retrive his corpse <br>ONCE more in \nsome weird, out of the way loc).<br></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> <div>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; Each character has very defined roles in terms of \n </div></span></blockquote>grouping.&nbsp; How you solo is up to you but there are strategies and tactics \nto make it more effective.&nbsp; But in my experience, when you&#39;re in a group, \npeople expect you to play a certain way, and those that don&#39;t, get kicked from \nthe group.&nbsp; For example, you very rarely see a melee druid in a \ngroup.&nbsp; Unfortunately, druids are expected to just sit there and cast - \nbuffs, heals, nukes, DOTs, whatever.&nbsp; Therefore, it&#39;s very hard for a druid \nto raise melee skills.&nbsp; What&#39;s the point of having 1HB and 1HS if you never \nhave to use it?&nbsp;&nbsp; The sooner you learn your role in a group, the \neasier it&#39;ll be to group in a long run.&nbsp; The best groups are the ones where \neverybody knows what their job is.&nbsp; You can amass great amounts of xp in \nshort periods of time in groups like that.&nbsp; You can even go up several \nlevels in a few hours.\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><br>Can I ask you guys some questions? I reckon a 1/5 bub a night is \n<br>pretty average to aim for. That would lvl me up once a week. Is that <br>the \nnorm? How long did it take you in the beginning?<br></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> <div>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; On my own I can do levels 1- 10 in one night.&nbsp; \n </div></span></blockquote>Being power leveled I can do it in less than 3 hours.&nbsp; At level 12 I \nreccomend going to Paludal Caverns on Luclin.&nbsp; I leveled 12-20 in 4 hours \nbeing PL&#39;d by a 52 druid.&nbsp; After level 20 xp will slow down somewhat.&nbsp; \nYou might be able to gain one level in a night, two if you&#39;re rockin.&nbsp; \nOtherwise be happy with 2 yellows if you get it.&nbsp; After level 40 xp moves \nmuch slower.&nbsp; It took me awhile to go from 45-47.&nbsp; At 50+ you&#39;ll \nprobably be working on AA points so xp will creep.\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><br>I have tried to solo in Black Burrow but that is well nigh impossible \n<br>on your own. Grouping is the only way but I HATE that place so much <br>it \nmakes me so nervous to go there. I am soloing in West Kerana but <br>grizzly and \ngiant spider spawns are pretty rare so I spend a lot of <br>time hanging around \nand trying to avoid the bandits (by the way, they <br>seem to be walking all \nover WK recently,&nbsp; not just around their huts. <br>Is this new?)<br></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> <div>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; Get a port to West Commons&nbsp;and hunt \n </div></span></blockquote>there.&nbsp; Or go to Paludal. &nbsp; XP will move faster.\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><br>Any advice and encouragement you can give me is greatly appreciated. \n<br>I know I&#39;m not alone, but sometimes it feels as though I am! I use <br>the \nEnglish server Venril Sathir (I live in Amsterdam) and sometimes <br>the zones \nare completely deserted. Is it like that on the US servers <br>as \nwell?<br></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> <div>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Depends ont he time of day.&nbsp; I&#39;ve played various \n </div></span></blockquote>servers and it really depends on the time.&nbsp; On Cazic Thule server that I \nnormally play on, prime time seems to be after midnight EST.&nbsp; In the \nafternoons though, it&#39;s pretty empty.\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><br>Hope to hear from some of you anyway, especially your experiences and \n<br>feelings about EQ when you first started.
