If a completely unrelated third party<br/>\nwere to obtain username and passwords to accounts on Verants systems, I<br/>\nwould think it to be difficult for the owner of a compromised account to<br/>\nprove that they didn&#39;t give out any account information.  It seems to have<br/>\nbeen turned into a case of guilty until proven innocent.  Although this in<br/>\nno way benefits the victim (owner of compromised account), Verant is a<br/>\nbusiness and businesses are in it to make money.  This probably seemed<br/>\nlike the most economical solution for them with little work on their end<br/>\nand  &quot;should&quot; not have negative effects on the largest portion of the user<br/>\nbase.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nmac</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
