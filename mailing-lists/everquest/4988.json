What do people hunt in hollowshade for smithing?<br/>\n&gt; Do you mean Dawnshroud Peaks? I know if hoppers are up and someone wants<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; gorangas up they kill the age old hopper...<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; -Su<br/>\nSo I take it you never heard of the smithing quest out of Shar Vahl.  There<br/>\nis a smithing quest there that you can use to get to 250 for little money,<br/>\njust need to do a lot of farming.  There are two mobs there that drop the<br/>\nitems needed for smithing.  The owlbears and sonic wolves drop different<br/>\nsubstances that are used together with metal rings to make humming<br/>\norbs...these triv around 180 making it easy to get smithing up for just the<br/>\ncost of making the rings...no water needed.  The only problem is these<br/>\nsubstances drop the most often when the mobs control the islands in the<br/>\nsouth of the Hollowshade zone.  That being the case most people trigger the<br/>\nwar to get the owlbears or sonic wolves to overrun the grimling there and<br/>\nmake the islands their home.  once you reach 180 or so in smithing you can<br/>\nstart making Shadowscream armor.  Forgot what piece it was, but one part<br/>\ntrivs at 208, another around 225, and the boots triv at 250+.  For just the<br/>\ncost of the mold, the cost of making the humming orbs, and the swirling<br/>\nshadows...you can get your smithing to GM.  Is that not reason enough to<br/>\ncamp the mobs in Hollowshade? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
