If you have tried Star Wars Galaxies<br/>\nyou will know what I mean.  There is a strong emphasis<br/>\non Player economy as well as a SIM CITY feel.  You can<br/>\nnow create players cities, run businesses ,etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf EQII takes on this style of play, I am sure there<br/>\nwill be a BUY in time to this new style of game. <br/>\nGranted they can&#39;t lose the traditional Fantasy<br/>\nDungeon personae of an RPG but they can enhance it to<br/>\nmake the game more Role Playing with the ability to<br/>\nhelp write a storyline, as well as make typical<br/>\ndungeon crawls.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried SWG for 2 months when it was released and<br/>\nloved it.  I prefer Fantasy genre material so I ended<br/>\nup back in EQ for a few reasons.  However, for those<br/>\nof you who have tried SWG, I can say that some new<br/>\nfeatures in EQ have been derived from the SWG<br/>\ninterface.  For example, the new targetting feature. <br/>\nIt is not identical but is similar in the objective.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the LDoN expansion is very similar to taking<br/>\nmissions in SWG.  You can enter an area where only<br/>\nyour group is in the Dungeon.  This is typical to a<br/>\nTraditional D&D adventure with a small party.  In SWG,<br/>\nyou can take missions based upon the groups abilites<br/>\nand skills (levels).  Then you venture out to complete<br/>\nthe mission givin to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn summary, I think EQII will be the next generation<br/>\nof MMORPG&quot;s that will bring a more Role playing<br/>\nability to a game along with a player controlled<br/>\neconomy.  Sim city meets D&D, maybe , but if you have<br/>\ntried SWG and play EQ as well, I think you will agree<br/>\nwith most of what I said.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also see some of these new features recently<br/>\nimplemented is a test-bed, if you will, of ideas they<br/>\nhave for EQII to see how the population reacts to the<br/>\nchanges.  Hence, LDoN, Targetting screen, Journal<br/>\nstorylines, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nwell, nuff spam , hope you enjoy<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n--- Wulfric Rennison &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wulftech@...\">wulftech@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Me, personally, I plan on getting EQ2 as soon as it<br/>\n&gt; comes out, for as you said, I&#39;d like to be there<br/>\n&gt; from the start.

I<br/>\n&gt;   don&#39;t even know myself if I will move or stick<br/>\n&gt; here. Sometimes I feel<br/>\n&gt;   like moving, sometimes I want to keep at this<br/>\n&gt; version. I seem to be<br/>\n&gt;   playing less and less, for various reasons. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   It would be nice to get in on the beginning of the<br/>\n&gt; game. Be part of<br/>\n&gt;   the discovery, part of a new economy. On the other<br/>\n&gt; hand, I have spent<br/>\n&gt;   two years on this game, and there is a lot<br/>\n&gt; invested in the original<br/>\n&gt;   version. Not to mention that only recently did my<br/>\n&gt; son get a computer<br/>\n&gt;   able to play the full game in all it&#39;s glory.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Still a decision for the future. May be that we<br/>\n&gt; will have accounts in<br/>\n&gt;   both games, though where I will get the time to<br/>\n&gt; play on both I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;   know. I don&#39;t retire for at least seven more<br/>\n&gt; years. Now then I shall<br/>\n&gt;   become a full-time gamer.
