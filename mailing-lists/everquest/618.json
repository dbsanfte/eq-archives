I suppose the other planes will be equally hard and have equally good equipment, or maybe they should make a plane for a little lower level players but with good class only equipment like fear plane, but not as good as fear plane though hehe.. Or maybe they are saving the other planes for the expansion so they can have something to throw in the face of the level 75 players.. :P<br/>\n<br/>\n- Avron Elselynn - Solusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
