And I wasn&#39;t going to give up a spanw point bc he was a jerk. I was<br/>\ntough enough that I wouldn&#39;t be killed easily. I didn&#39;t die even once<br/>\ndespite the lack of healing. I needed the practice for being in group with<br/>\nno healers. Besides, until it was just me and him in group it was fun. Then<br/>\nI ditched him to group with my guildmate and we took the camp together<br/>\n(since the jerk was dead).<br/>\nIt was worth it.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, Su, I would *never* have stayed in that group.  If you&#39;re there<br/>\nfor exp, how good is the exp if you keep dying because the main healer won&#39;t<br/>\nheal you (I know you didn&#39;t die but you very easily could have)?  I would<br/>\nnever stay if I wasn&#39;t absolutely sure the healer wouldn&#39;t do everything in<br/>\nhis power to keep me alive, tank or not.  I&#39;m sure there were other open<br/>\nspots at camps nearby you could have gone to.  That guy sounds like a<br/>\n5-yr-old brat, and I&#39;d put him on ignore -- someday he&#39;ll need something<br/>\nfrom you!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNymue<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Su<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, May 23, 2001 8:31 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] money problem<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis reminds me.. Recently I was in a group and they refused to do alpha<br/>\nloot. But I needed the xp and faction so I stayed. I was getting to loot a<br/>\nlittle bit but then one of the members looked at my gear and suddenly<br/>\ndecided that I didn&#39;t &quot;need&quot; money or items bc I already had &quot;good stuff&quot;.<br/>\nNevermind that I had to work my ass off to get the money to buy the stuff<br/>\nand had no money left to buy spells or better items. I don&#39;t know where he<br/>\ngot off. I mean, I wasn&#39;t even getting xp from most of the stuff while he<br/>\nwas and he would&#39;ve been dead 10 times over if I hadn&#39;t saved him by using<br/>\nDDs to kill stuff before it could kill him. So he expected me to gain<br/>\nnothing but faction? Such a jerk. And the worst part was, he was main healer<br/>\nyet he refused to heal me when I had 1 bub of life left. He had 3 bubs of<br/>\nlife yet and started healing HIMSELF while I was near death. He wasn&#39;t even<br/>\ngetting aggrod on at the time. I was only injured so much bc I pulled some<br/>\norcs off of him so they wouldn&#39;t kill him. When I asked him nicely for a<br/>\nheal he said &quot;I heal the tanks first-- and I&#39;m the only one injured&quot;. I<br/>\nresponded with &quot;I think I did a pretty good job of tanking&quot;. I didn&#39;t get<br/>\nhealed til another person who wasn&#39;t in a group ran by and stopped to heal<br/>\nme.<br/>\nLuckily a guildmate of mine showed up and invited me to join his group. The<br/>\njerk was left on his own and he stupidly tried to attack the entire large<br/>\norc camp (in EC) on his own. I watched him die (nothing I could do about it<br/>\nreally).<br/>\nOh well.. don&#39;t mind me. just rambling.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
