You&#39;re&nbsp;probably still around level 17&nbsp;to mid 20&#39;s so if you have some plat to spend, you can get some descent to good gear in the bazaar for pretty cheap.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>First things first, <strong>HP</strong> and <strong>AC</strong> are Gods to an SK.&nbsp; All other stats can take a flying leap backwards if it means&nbsp;sacrificing either of these all important stats.&nbsp; But if you wish to look for gear with a &quot;<u>tanking</u>&quot; SK in mind, look for&nbsp;AGI, STA, STR,&nbsp;DEX items in that order.&nbsp; Here&#39;s why</div>\n<div><em>Agility = Raises Armor class and the ability to dodge incoming attacks all together.&nbsp; 30 AGI may&nbsp;allow you to avoid a 90hp attack all together so this helps emensely.</em></div>\n<div><em>Stamina = Increases hitpoints and the ability to mitigate damage.&nbsp; It won&#39;t do either well until higher levels but 4hp for every 1 sta does add up and getting hit for 89hp instead of 92 does add up after a while.</em></div>\n<div><em>Strength = Raises attack power and&nbsp;the cap to hit.&nbsp; instead of hitting for 54, a higher strength will allow you to hit for 57. its not much but every little bit counts.</em></div>\n<div><em>Dexterity = At low levels, increasing this stat means you will learn Weapon skills faster (2HB, 1HS etc) so getting some gear that has some high Dex wouldn&#39;t hurt in the least.&nbsp; This skill should be the least of your worries but that doesn&#39;t mean ignore it</em></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>As for Weapons,</div>\n<div>Let me first stress to you the UBER importance of practicing on all of your weapon skills.&nbsp; </div>\n<div>1HS, 1HB, 2HS, 2HB and Piercing</div>\n<div>There are good weapons for each of these types for SK&#39;s so it would be a shame if you won the Plane of Time SK 1HB weapon only to find you have 13 skill in it.&nbsp; Since you&#39;re still at a low level (which is a good thing btw), you can still correct any mistakes you&#39;ve made in gear/weapons/quests/faction.&nbsp; If you are still in your high teens and low/mid 20&#39;s in terms of levels, look for weapons in the bazaar that have mediocre damage but high delay.&nbsp; I&#39;ll explain why.&nbsp; Getting a 50 damage 40 delay weapon is going to do crap for you since you&#39;re weapons cap in damage output until you reach certain levels.&nbsp; Did you notice that the sporiali defender suddenly hit(s) harder at level 20 than it did at level 18 and 19?&nbsp; Thats because you &quot;dinged&quot; into your new level cap which I believe is around 100-110hp.&nbsp; </div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>If you are confused, just look at it this way.&nbsp; Look for all types of weapons with VERY fast delay (between 20-30) and damage of no more than about 25-35.&nbsp; These weapons are only temporary as once you &quot;ding&quot; into your next damage cap at around level 28 or so, you&#39;ll want to upgrade your weapons again to slightly higher damage output.&nbsp; Whats the point of having a 50 damage weapon if the damage cap makes it only a 25 damage weapon.&nbsp; Makes sense?</div>\n<div>You&#39;ll have 5 or so Damage caps (lvl 10, 20, 28, 35ish, and 45) until you reach level 51 when you&#39;re damage cap is removed and you can hit for full damage.&nbsp; This is far down the road but something to look forward too.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>BTW, if you can afford it, there is a very nice 1HS sword that drops in Walls of Slaughter that if you can afford it (12K on my server last I checked back in August), it would serve you VERY well even at lower levels.&nbsp; The damage/delay ratios even when level capped make it a surprizingly excellent weapon at all levels of play.&nbsp; Sorry, don&#39;t know the name of it off hand.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Good luck to you Lisa, </div>\n<div>SK&#39;s are a fun class to be.&nbsp; I LOVED my Iksar SK until I recently retired.</div>&nbsp;<br>-----Original Message-----<br>From: Lisa &lt;lisab38@...&gt;<br>To: EverQuest@yahoogroups.com<br>Sent: Thu, 10 Nov 2005 18:52:35 -0000<br>Subject: [EverQuest] Re: SK Help ????<br><br>\n<style>\n#ygrps-yiv-247440706 .ygrps-yiv-247440706AOLPlainTextBody {\nmargin:0px;font-family:Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Sans-Serif;font-size:12px;\ncolor:#000;\nbackground-color:#fff;\n}\n\n#ygrps-yiv-247440706 .ygrps-yiv-247440706AOLPlainTextBody pre {\nfont-size:9pt;}\n\n#ygrps-yiv-247440706 .ygrps-yiv-247440706AOLInlineAttachment {\nmargin:10px;}\n\n#ygrps-yiv-247440706 .ygrps-yiv-247440706AOLAttachmentHeader {\nborder-bottom:2px solid #E9EAEB;background:#F9F9F9;}\n\n#ygrps-yiv-247440706 .ygrps-yiv-247440706AOLAttachmentHeader .ygrps-yiv-247440706Title {\nfont:11px Tahoma;font-weight:bold;color:#666666;background:#E9EAEB;\npadding:3px 0px 1px 10px;}\n\n#ygrps-yiv-247440706 .ygrps-yiv-247440706AOLAttachmentHeader .ygrps-yiv-247440706FieldLabel {\nfont:11px Tahoma;\nfont-weight:bold;color:#666666;padding:1px 10px 1px 9px;}\n\n#ygrps-yiv-247440706 .ygrps-yiv-247440706AOLAttachmentHeader .ygrps-yiv-247440706FieldValue {\nfont:11px Tahoma;\ncolor:#333333;}\n\n</style>\n\n<div class=\"ygrps-yiv-247440706AOLPlainTextBody\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-247440706AOLMsgPart_0_2f90750d-3f45-418c-a573-3fad53b4b72e\"><pre><tt>--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest%40yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;STG2(SW) Pierce&quot;
