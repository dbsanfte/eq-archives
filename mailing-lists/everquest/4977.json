I like how in<br/>\nMorrowind there are user created mods to make armor look different if you<br/>\nwant. It would be cool if users could submit new designs for armor and<br/>\nclothes to the game creators<br/>\nso they could decide whether or not to add it. Only thing is, it would<br/>\nrequire more system resources to label what design is available for what<br/>\npiece of armor.<br/>\nI saw a rainbow colored robe/dress in a catalog and thought it would be<br/>\nhilarious to see that on a player in game.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; A game feature I&#39;d like to see is customer service *grin*  but since EQ is<br/>\n&gt; all about making the game fair and equal as possible (nerfing items and so<br/>\n&gt; on) I&#39;d like to see some equality in the races..I mean the evil races get<br/>\n&gt; the 2 biggest and baddest races in the game while the good races get the<br/>\n&gt; smartest..why not make them all equal?  Another thing I&#39;d think would be<br/>\n&gt; cool is a feature that relates to the armor dyes..molding, and tailoring<br/>\n </span></blockquote>any<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; piece of gear you own to your own liking.
