I have a minor healing spell and a spell that raises hit points.<br/>\n&gt; I have a shaman so I can&#39;t use my club. I tried to equip it with no<br/>\n&gt; success. I have no money. No one wants to buy mushrooms (must be a<br/>\n&gt; drug free town). I think that I need to somehow come up with some<br/>\n&gt; money so that I can buy a scroll with a spell that can do damage. I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t seem to be able to kill anything bare handed. I just keep<br/>\n&gt; getting killed. Does anybody have any suggestions?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I could delete the character, start over, maybe sell one or both of<br/>\n&gt; my spell scrolls and buy an attack spell scroll. But do I really<br/>\n&gt; need to? Is there still hope for my character?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Edward<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at http://www.everquest.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
