Not sure<br/>\nwhat it is  but certain zones brutal, ,especially<br/>\nEmerald Jungle.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBe patient I sense we will see this improve with the<br/>\nnext few patches.  Regardless of what Sony says or<br/>\ndoes not say, there is something broke.  I even<br/>\npreload the zones, THANK GOD, and it still is slow.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can only hope<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n--- Melanie Johnson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:melanie_6602@...\">melanie_6602@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Well, I don&#39;t know about Feerrott, but I seem to get<br/>\n&gt; lag issues after I&#39;ve had my computer running<br/>\n&gt; without<br/>\n&gt; a reboot for a while. And it can happen in zones<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; had no lag before. I&#39;ve not really tried to fix it<br/>\n&gt; (other than rebooting).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- Wulfric Rennison &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wulftech@...\">wulftech@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m just wondering if anyone else has been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; experiencing an inordinate amount of lag lately? <br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mean more than you usually get, even in zones that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are unpopulated.  For example, whenever I port to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the Feerrott, I start lagging immediately, and<br/>\n&gt; then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; if I port out, the lag gets even worse, as if I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt; carrying it with me.  But I had absolutely no lag<br/>\n&gt; &gt; before I zoned itno Feerrott.  So I&#39;m wondering if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s something about that zone?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; And before you say it&#39;s my computer system, I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; running a Pentium 4 1.8Ghz with 1 GB of RAM, and a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 128MB ATI Radeon 9200 video card.  I also have a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cable modem connection.  And as I said, there&#39;s no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lag until I zone into Feerrott.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Before you ask if I have anything running in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; background, I use this system for nothing but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Everquest, so I have already gone ahead and shut<br/>\n&gt; &gt; down all the background programs.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Before you ask if I have checked EQ&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; knowledgebase,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve already done everythign they&#39;ve reccomended<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it hasn&#39;t solved the problem.  One thing I did<br/>\n&gt; find<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out was that certain zones will lag becasue on ATI<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cards there&#39;s an option for Wait For Vertical<br/>\n&gt; Sync,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and they reccomend setting it to Off.  So I did<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this, but now I&#39;m getting lag in EVERY zone so I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; really don&#39;t think that&#39;s it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; And before you ask if I have updated to the latest<br/>\n&gt; &gt; video drivers, I did that when I found out about<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Vertical Sync issue.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; As you can probably tell, I&#39;m not without some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; troubleshooting knowledge, but I&#39;ve done<br/>\n&gt; everything<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I can think of, and the problem is still<br/>\n&gt; persisting.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  The one clue I have is that the problem didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; start happening until after last patch.  So I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; know if that has anything to do with it.  I<br/>\n&gt; thought<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would check and see if anyone else is having<br/>\n&gt; this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; problem.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Wulfric<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cazic Thule server<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; PS, I can duplicate this problem on any server<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; any character.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; PPS Yes I have already filled out several bug<br/>\n&gt; reports.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; =====<br/>\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And on the eighth day God said, &quot;O.K.
