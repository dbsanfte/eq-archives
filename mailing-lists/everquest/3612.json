It only happens to your character or to everyone else you see as well? If it&#39;s only happening to you try this:<br/>\n<br/>\nRemove head gear/masks. Pick your desired features using the /face command. Force a character save. Zone into another area, still without head gear. Check yourself, you should be &quot;yourself&quot;. If not...start over and try again. If you are okay, then you should be okay and can put back on head gear/masks. Remember, this is if it&#39;s happening to you only.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet us know if this works.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I&#39;m totally misunderstanding what you meant, smack me upside the head and speak slowly. :p<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso a Rob :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Hey Everybody,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m new to the list! I have a general question<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; hasen&#39;t been<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; answered for a few months now. I&#39;m hoping one of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; you<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; might know what<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the heck is going on! Ok, so this is what&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; happening;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Whenever I zone my characters face will<br/>\n&gt;&gt; change!?!?!<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m thinking it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; has something to do with low memory but I have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; about<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 500mb of ram.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; And I&#39;m not too keen on computers so if there is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; another form of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; memory that could be lacking please enlighten<br/>\n&gt;&gt; me!<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; This stupid problem<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; has coused me to quit playing for awhile. It<br/>\n&gt;&gt; makes<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; me sooo mad!!!!<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Sincerely,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Deidre<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________________________<br/>\nYour favorite stores, helpful shopping tools and great gift ideas.
