This <br/>\nis my first experience with cell shading in games, and I was <br/>\nsurprised by how immersive the game is with this style of animation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a cell shaded version of EQ would be just as immersive as the <br/>\ncurrent game, and allow a broader range of computers to keep up with <br/>\ngame advancements. My machine was adequate for everything up to <br/>\nVelious. I have not been able to get good performance on other <br/>\nexpansions. In a cell shaded EQ, I should be fine with my machine.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeeping low-end machines in the game can keep those playing who <br/>\notherwise cannot afford the upgrades for optimal performance. Plus, <br/>\npeople who upgrade their systems could keep their old systems in the <br/>\ngame, and run two accounts. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow many of you have had experience with cell shaded games? Do you <br/>\nthink EQ could become cell shaded and retain all of its quality of <br/>\ngame play?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
