Level caps and LORE that is..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Avron Elselynn -<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Jonathan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jp1234@...\">jp1234@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Twinking is okay to a certain extent, but a level 1 should not have full<br/>\n&gt; &gt;steel and a ghoulbane.  What&#39;s the point of even playing the character?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Isnt half the fun getting some of the items yourself?  I can understand<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and have no problem with some twinking.. maybe some bronze and a pretty<br/>\n&gt; &gt;good weapon and shield, but that&#39;s just dumb.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
