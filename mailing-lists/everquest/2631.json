That&#39;s why you make friends. Group with some people. \n  Make sure to play<br>nice. Ask others for advice. Find some people you really \n  like hanging with<br>and put them on friends list.

Find out<br>if you can hang out with people who seem to get \n  along with you really well.<br>No stalking though. :-)<br>I have friends that \n  I met in the game who like to group with me or help me<br>out.

I obviously enjoy<br>&nbsp; playing. :-) I&#39;m not sure exactly what kind of \n  advice you&#39;re asking for<br>&nbsp; here. Anything specific you need to know \n  about?<br>&nbsp; luv,<br>&nbsp; -Su<br><br>&nbsp; Hi, I bought Everquest the \n  first day it came out. I am not a very good EQ<br>&nbsp; player. I would \n  consider myself ultra competent in group battles, but in<br>&nbsp; other \n  aspects of the game I am decidedly mediocre. I have never gotten a<br>&nbsp; \n  character past level 40. My first character was an Erudite Enchanter \n  by<br>the<br>&nbsp; name of Helion Blightermind. I eventually got to level 40 \n  after two years<br>or<br>&nbsp; so. I also have a level 40 Gnome Wizard which \n  was my friends character but<br>I<br>&nbsp; own it. I just started playing \n  again after giving up on the game and<br>playing<br>&nbsp; DAOC. Eventually I \n  gave up all MMORPGS deciding they were a waste of time.<br>&nbsp; About a week \n  ago, I decided to give EQ another chance and have decided<br>that<br>&nbsp; it \n  has improved a great deal. I am now playing a Human Ranger who is \n  level<br>&nbsp; 30. I really like the character. His buffs and damage spells \n  are great. I<br>&nbsp; guess I could use some help on how to be a good EQ \n  player. I have been<br>&nbsp; playing for about two years and I feel like I \n  know absolutely nothing<br>about<br>&nbsp; the game. I have never belonged to \n  a good guild or anything. I play on the<br>&nbsp; Xegony \n  server.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yahoo! \n  Groups \n  Sponsor<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  ADVERTISEMENT<br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br><br><br>&nbsp; \n  Your use of Yahoo!
