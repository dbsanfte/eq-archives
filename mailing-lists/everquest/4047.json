We<br>are not doing a hit piece on EQ at all. We are just interested in having someone<br>come on who can explain what the game is all about, describe how one gets<br>involved and talk about the so-called addictive nature of it. I think I found<br>someone who will do all of those things. We have no intention of grilling<br>anybody about suicides. Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you. I am happy you<br>like our network and we&#39;ll keep trying to get better. There&#39;s actually a lot of<br>really cool show ideas in the pipeline right now.

I am sure that<br>whatever package they are producing will be fair and informative to both players<br>and non-players of Everquest. Call for help is, as you might guess from the<br>title, is a call-in show where the host help people out with their computer<br>questions. I hardly think they will be grilling interview-ees about EQ suicides<br>or any other hot button issues. They may mention the addictive nature of EQ, but<br>I doubt it will turn into any sort of an inquisition. TechTv has always been<br>cool about covering computer games and the culture of computer gamers.
