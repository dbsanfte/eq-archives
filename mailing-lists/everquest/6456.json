I prefer grouping.  It&#39;s faster xp than soloing in my opinion.  As a 65 <br/>\n&gt; druid, I can solo a lot of things, but it takes too much time to kill them.  <br/>\n&gt; Root, snare, dot, dot, dot.  Sit and wait.  Keep that up til the mob is dead.  <br/>\n&gt; In a group, most times I only have to worry about snaring and dotting, and maybe <br/>\n&gt; back up healing.  It&#39;s not as labor intensive, and the xp moves faster with <br/>\n&gt; constant pulls.  Unfortunately, lately, it seems like it&#39;s been increasingly <br/>\n&gt; more difficult to find good groups so I end up soloing most of the time anyway <br/>\n&gt; with LFG on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; W<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;   From: Just Me <br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Sunday, April 16, 2006 1:04 PM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: [EverQuest] Does anyone solo anymore?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   After a year and a half of playing, I&#39;ve done a lot of group play and<br/>\n&gt;   a lot of duoing, but I seem to enjoy soloing more nowdays.  I can go<br/>\n&gt;   where I want, do what I want and keep the loot and xp for myself. <br/>\n&gt;   Don&#39;t get me wrong, I still like to group, but sometimes, for my own<br/>\n&gt;   peace of mind, I much prefer soloing.
