Gamer audio card with digital audio \nout, a set of Creative&nbsp; FPS2000 4 point surround sound speakers, and a 19&quot; \nflat screen Samsung monitor.&nbsp; Great sound and great graphics, but lags a \nlittle on Luclin and the newer zones. </font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">the second system is a P4 1.6Ghz with 640MB of \nPC133 SDRAM, a 64MB ATI Radeon 4X AGP card, and using the onboard AC97 sound for \nthe time being.&nbsp; It does do digital audio out, but I only have a set of old \nLabtec speakers.&nbsp; Also, the monitor is a 17&quot; Gateway E200 monitor.&nbsp; \n</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">I use Roadrunner cable to connect so it all works \npretty well.&nbsp; I don&#39;t plan on upgrading the PIII any more, but I will make \nmore changes to the P4.&nbsp; I plan on putting it up to a full gig and a half \nof RAM and upgrading to a 128MB video card and a SoundBlaster Audigy card.&nbsp; \nSo when I get the money as they say...&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Hopefully next \nmonth!</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Anyway, that&#39;s what I use.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Wulfric</font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
