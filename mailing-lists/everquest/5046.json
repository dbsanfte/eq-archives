I logged into Everquest <br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt;   opted to purchase LDoN online. One suggestion, DON&#39;T do it if you<br/>\n&gt;   have a 56K dial-up connection LOL. It started to download and <br/>\nsaid it<br/>\n&gt;   would take 22 hours and 26 minutes! I guess I will take my laptop <br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt;   work and download it on the T1 LOL.
