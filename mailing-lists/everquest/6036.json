I managed <br>to \n  <br>&gt; force my hef rgr to lvl 18/19--18 is where I spend most of my time, \n  <br>&gt; but sometimes I lvl to 19. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; I have been recently \n  been building my fletching skills(104). I <br>spent <br>&gt; about 4hrs a day \n  hunting in front of Qeynos killing green mobs for <br>&gt; about 3wks. All I \n  make is about 150plat in the 4 hrs with no exp, <br>but <br>&gt; when I go \n  hunting elswere--like bb--I only get about 5 plat for 4 <br>hrs <br>&gt; and \n  some exp. I seem to go up about 2 skill points in that time in <br>&gt; front \n  of Qeynos. <br>&gt; <br>&gt; I don&#39;t mean to complain, but I am starting to \n  feel sorry for all <br>&gt; knolls and gopher snakes I&#39;ve killed. Plus I would \n  like to be able <br>to <br>&gt; do more quests.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I do want to \n  earn everything myself, but would like to know where I <br>&gt; can earn some \n  serious plat? I have heard of people lvl 12 earning 4-<br>&gt; 5000 plat/hr. \n  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; How do they do that?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Anyone have any \n  suggestions?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thanks<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Visit the \n  EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; ---------------------------------<br>&gt; Yahoo! \n  Groups Links<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To visit your group on the \n  web, go to:<br>&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EverQuest/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EverQuest/</a><br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email \n  to:<br>&gt; EverQuest-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your use of Yahoo!
