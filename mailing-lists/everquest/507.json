Sometimes you will see a goblin swimming<br/>\nat the mouth of the cave.  The cave itself is inside the mountain, so as you<br/>\nswim it will eventauly open up above the surface of the water.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that the NPC Necro&#39;s con was aggressive and he was red at lvl 16.<br/>\nBe careful when approaching him.  BTW there is very little light, and it is<br/>\na maze ( oh what fun... hehe)<br/>\n<br/>\nI never zoned so i dont believe its a new zone, just undiscovered..  the<br/>\ncave itself is quite large (or it seemed that way) but was relativly empty.<br/>\nThis is what i saw:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.. House with 4 icebone skeletons<br/>\n2.. Shrine ( zone point )structure protected by 2 icebones skeletons<br/>\n3.. Human NPC Necromancer with pet  - red at lvl 16<br/>\n4.. Possible Giant.. (type unknown) - I never saw one myself<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, there could be more to the cave that went unexplored, because i had no<br/>\nway of passing the Necro at the time.
