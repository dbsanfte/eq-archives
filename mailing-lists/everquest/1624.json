They don&#39;t know I&#39;m a female. Even when I&#39;m playing a<br/>\nfemale character. Kinda funny. Especially when I&#39;m playing a male character<br/>\nand someone who knows me in rl refers to me as &quot;she&quot;.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m one of the very few females in my guild. Everyone always seems to figure<br/>\nout I&#39;m a rl female too...not sure why!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LeSamLam@...\">LeSamLam@...</a><br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Sent: Friday, June 15, 2001 10:23 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [EverQuest] As the Everquest Turns<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Do things ever happen on your server and you want to tell someone but no<br/>\none<br/>\n  you know will care?  Does that make sense?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maybe it&#39;s just because I&#39;m a female and feel the need to gossip.  I don&#39;t<br/>\n  know any females in RL that play the game.  Only my husband and his<br/>\nfriends.<br/>\n  They don&#39;t care about the gossip of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The funniest things I see go on between males and females.  Jealously<br/>\nmainly.<br/>\n   Female A gets jealous when Female B is flirting with Male A who &quot;belongs&quot;<br/>\nto<br/>\n  Female A.  Male C is married to Female C.  Female C&#39;s alt is engaged to<br/>\nMale<br/>\n  D.  Male C doesn&#39;t like that Female C&#39;s alt is engaged to someone else.<br/>\n  Stuff like that...I find it amusing.  Everquest could turn into this huge<br/>\n  soap opera.  Who cares about loot, who&#39;s &quot;cheating&quot; on who?  It&#39;s just a<br/>\ngame<br/>\n  and sometimes people really take it seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And since we have a former guide (or where you a GM) on here I have a<br/>\n  question.  When you get married and you take the surname of your<br/>\n  husband...can you hypenate???  I don&#39;t like his last name (my RL husband&#39;s<br/>\n  character that is).  It doesn&#39;t sound &quot;catchy&quot; with my first name.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ok and I didn&#39;t know you could get divorced in Norrath.  I just find that<br/>\n  funny too.  I might want to marry my RL husband&#39;s character just to<br/>\ndivorce<br/>\n  him.  He doesn&#39;t take out the trash one night...I divorce him in EQ.  LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ok so anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Also, I wonder how many of Norrath marriages have one person being a young<br/>\n14<br/>\n  to 16 year old male and the other either an old guy pretending to be a<br/>\nfemale<br/>\n  or an older female.<br/>\n<br/>\n  What do you think the percentage of actual female players versus actual<br/>\nmale<br/>\n  players are in the game?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Lena<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
