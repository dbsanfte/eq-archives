I just haven&#39;t had a chance<br/>\nto reply yet. LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nLike you I do not believe that SOE will get rid of their biggest cash<br/>\ncow, (And still is) I still meet people on a weekly basis (average of at<br/>\nleast 10) who are brand new to the game. (EQ1 +/- any scam artists in<br/>\nthat bunch)<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ1 is still alive and strong, there are no plans for EQ1 to &quot;catch up&quot;<br/>\nwith EQ2, thats up to you the individual player to use your imagination<br/>\nand &quot;fill in the gaps&quot; so to speak when you make the switch to EQ2.<br/>\n From the start SOE said that EQ2 is a complete change from EQ1. Also<br/>\nthink of it this way, do music groups have the same songs on every<br/>\nalbum? No. They are always changing to appeal to the masses. If they put<br/>\nthe same songs on every album you would eventually get bored with it and<br/>\nevery time you hear them on the radio it would be basically the same<br/>\nsong but with different words.<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ2 is a &quot;sequel&quot; to EQ1 just as &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; is a &quot;sequel&quot; to<br/>\n&quot;The Matrix&quot;. I&#39;m sure that SOE would like everyone to move over to EQ2<br/>\nbut they know and accept the fact that not everyone has a powerful<br/>\nenough computer to run EQ2. I don&#39;t. Plus I have so many things to do in<br/>\nEQ1 first before I move on to another game. Another thing to consider, I<br/>\nhave met players who have been in the game for 5 years or more! Imagine<br/>\nthe cash SOE has made off these people!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will always be new games on the market. Look at WoW, The Matrix,<br/>\nthe new D&D game coming out. and one I saw that just looks awesome<br/>\nLineage II, The graphics are amazing. Honestly if I &quot;had&quot; to switch,<br/>\nthats the one I would go to. Also if you look at MMORPG.com they list<br/>\nGuild Wars as the top game right now plus they list all the MMORPG games<br/>\nout there. (There are more than you think!) So take all those into<br/>\nconsideration and then look at how well EQ1 has done compared to all of<br/>\nthose others out there. EQ1 is still the giant and will always be a<br/>\nmajor contender.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents<br/>\nDurgaa<br/>\nRanger of Bristlebane<br/>\nGuild Leader of Mystic Crusaders EQ1 Chapter<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway thats just my 2 cents.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 4<br/>\n   Date: Fri, 29 Apr 2005 20:05:47 -0400<br/>\n   From: &quot;Wulfric Rennison&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wulftech@...\">wulftech@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Re: EQ math<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I suppose someone had to step up and be the naysayer in the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if I agree with most of this or not.

Even as SOEs major flagship game, SOE is seeing<br/>\n  the darkness at the end of the tunnel.  They will be spending more<br/>\n  money to maintain the game than they are bringing in with<br/>\n  subscriptions dropping more and more each month.  I think SOE &quot;may&quot;<br/>\n  try to revitilize EQ by releasing a completely new graphics engine<br/>\n  and serious upgrade for the game, but this would be optional and only<br/>\n  be window dressing since there is not too much they can do with the<br/>\n  backend servers without a complete game overhaul, which they just are<br/>\n  not going to do.  EQ2 was a serious disapointment to them, as the<br/>\n  players were already use to EQ1 and the social structure there.  It<br/>\n  does sadden me a bit that EQ will come to a close, but we all knew it<br/>\n  would happen eventually.  I doubt SOE will ever cancel EQ completely<br/>\n  (at least not for another 5 or so years), but I would imagine the day<br/>\n  when new expansion are no longer released, patches are no longer<br/>\n  made, and maybe one or two servers are all that are left is not too<br/>\n  far around the corner.... like I said, maybe 2 years.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I doubt there will ever be another game that has the same appeal and<br/>\n  drive that SOE captured with EQ1... however I think we might find<br/>\n  that another game may come close only after SOE &quot;pulls the plug&quot; on<br/>\n  EQ1 and forces everyone to find another game.  We may see a game in<br/>\n  the future released from SOE along the same genre of EverQuest, but<br/>\n  with a completely different story line and perhaps even the same<br/>\n  stayability of EverQuest, but I rather doubt it.  I think SOE will<br/>\n  end up making their bread and butter with shoot-offs of the Star Wars<br/>\n  Universe and maybe some other games like they offer on the station<br/>\n  website (jeopardy, wheel of fortune, etc), while another game company<br/>\n  with the same spirit that SOE had long ago steps up to take the<br/>\n  lead.  I would say the next big game will be Vanguard : Saga of<br/>\n  Heros.  I think that Brad and Jeff have both learned a lot from their<br/>\n  experience helping shape EverQuest, and Microsoft (one of the biggest<br/>\n  backers of Sigil) has learned from its mistakes in the online game<br/>\n  field and won&#39;t make the same mistakes again.  SOE has started<br/>\n  loosing its grip on the market and Microsoft has a habit of stepping<br/>\n  in and taking over when something like that happens.  I mean look at<br/>\n  Nintendo, Sega, and even Sony.  They started slipping in the console<br/>\n  game industry and Microsoft stepped in with the X-Box and dominated<br/>\n  the market by throwing money at the market till they owned it.  Now<br/>\n  the best graphics for console games out there are on X-Box, even if<br/>\n  content is still split evenly but leaning more towards X-Box as time<br/>\n  goes on.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Matt<br/>\n  aka Dragowulf Bowcraft (Ranger of The Tribunal)<br/>\n  Dulcere the Furryfooted Ranger (Retired Guide of Erollisi Marr)<br/>\n<br/>\n  --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, Su &lt;suceress@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; Oh cool!!<br/>\n  &gt; I don&#39;t know if EQ1 will still be around then though.
