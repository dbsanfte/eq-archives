Mostly solo Tesh Mas Gnolls and <br/>\nAviaks that wander around the hermit&#39;s house. Once in a while I find <br/>\nan item through my research I can go for. Just got my Testament of <br/>\nVainer (sp?) and am considering the Qeynos badge series. Stats aren&#39;t <br/>\nbad and doesn&#39;t look too time consuming.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am spending time looking over various web sites to select new <br/>\nprospective pieces of equipment to hunt for or do quests for. <br/>\nLeveling a bit over time. So many fine pieces will have to wait. Yet <br/>\nthere are many good items I can aquire in my 30&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe research is, for me, part of the game. A challenge, finding <br/>\nsomething I can go for. I am most thankful for the many great sites I <br/>\ncan use in my research.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\nHalfling Druid<br/>\nZeb Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
