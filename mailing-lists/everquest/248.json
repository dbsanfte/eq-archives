Would I expect to carry my Ear Ring or wear it?<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point in my Players history, I&#39;m now running 3 characters <br/>\non Test and 2 on Veeshan.  I&#39;ve had multiple problems and I am <br/>\nstill trying to work those issues out.  Truth has been non-human <br/>\nat other than Freeport doesn&#39;t Freeze.  <br/>\nAny others still having this type of problem?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first, has aquired 2 large sacks and a backpack.  <br/>\nPlenty of places to stash, but he&#39;s established and can afford <br/>\nthe items.  My others are still trying to break their 2nd level.<br/>\nIt seems hunting is only feesible way to get coin and advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would BUG them, but it seems well past Beta, this is <br/>\nthe acceptable norm.   My point here, if I&#39;m taking up vaulable<br/>\nHold spots and I can not stack containers ie Wrist pouch in my<br/>\nlarge bag.   WHY purchase anything less?   I have not tried boxes, <br/>\nplease enlighten me.   None of mine are smithers yet and from<br/>\nthe look, making a box is not a simple task.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nCleric Taven</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
