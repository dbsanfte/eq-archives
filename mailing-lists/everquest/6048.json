If you are invisible alot of mobs cannot see you, but you should still consider them to see if they will attack you. Another thing to do is to approach any area that could conceal a mob with caution and start conning mobs to see if they will attack you. If possible try to route your way around them.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n===============<br/>\nThanks everyone I recovered my corpse. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried to travel, but seems my character is loved by low level <br/>\nnpc&#39;s and hated by the high npc&#39;s everywhere with no middle ground. I <br/>\ncan count on being killed 1 in 3x&#39;s I visit Qeynos--where I have high <br/>\nfaction with gaurds and merchants. I am only marginally liked in <br/>\nSurefall Glade--my spawn point. I get killed everywhere I go--even by <br/>\nsingle dark blue monsters. How do I correct this? Or is this normal? <br/>\n<br/>\nI leveled twice yesterday! Back to lvl 19. I love playing this guy, <br/>\nbut I want to be able to roam a little. I think I will build another <br/>\ncharacter using the knowledge I have aquired over the last couple of <br/>\nweeks. I have been reading and asking a lot of questions. Any advice <br/>\nyou guys have on a new hef rgr for me will be greatly appreciated. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am also thinking of building a gnome...well maybe later.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>\nVersion: 7.0.300 / Virus Database: 265.6.12 - Release Date: 1/14/2005</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
