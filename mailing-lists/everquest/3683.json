I also map senseheading to all the <br/>\nhotkey pages that I use to the same location for all my characters, <br/>\nthat way if you change hotkey pages, then it will still be set right, <br/>\nand it will remind you not to place a hotkey in that spot later.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps some.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Su&quot; &lt;suceress@k...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t keep a hotkey for senseheading up though.I have my hotkeys <br/>\nfilled<br/>\n&gt; with other stuff.
