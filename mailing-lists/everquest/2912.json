Druids are always in demand -- &quot;sow please.&quot;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  Heh. You&#39;ll be lucky if you get a &quot;please&quot;. I&#39;ve found people just say<br/>\n&quot;can<br/>\n  I have sow&quot;. (now that my druid is able to sow). I had one guy come up and<br/>\n  bug me when I was turning in CB belts in Kaladim yesterday. He said &quot;can I<br/>\n  have sow.&quot; I said &quot;I can&#39;t cast that spell indoors&quot;. guy says &quot;What are<br/>\nyou<br/>\n  giving him?&quot; me: &quot;Crushbone belts&quot; guy &quot;Can I have sow.&quot;<br/>\n  So I tried to cast it on him just to show it wouldn&#39;t work. then I told<br/>\nhim<br/>\n  the message. I was just about to camp. He&#39;s like &quot;ok. tell me when you&#39;re<br/>\n  leaving so you can sow me.&quot;<br/>\n  I was thinking &quot;would it kill the person to ask if I could go out and sow<br/>\n  him? or to say please?&quot; That has been bothering me lately. Lack of<br/>\nmanners.<br/>\n  I&#39;ve been casting sow on people before they can ask for it lately. they<br/>\nhail<br/>\n  me and I cast it. Just so I won&#39;t have to be angry if they don&#39;t say<br/>\nplease.<br/>\n  Most of them say thanks at least.<br/>\n  anyhoo, I just camped right there and never said another word to the<br/>\nperson.<br/>\n  I was too tired to deal with it.<br/>\n  luv,<br/>\n  -Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
