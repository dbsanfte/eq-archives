I will be needing Brute hides, and so was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ready to go and hunt<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them. However, the shuttles in Butcherblock never<br/>\n&gt; &gt; met the boat. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tried three times, three different shuttles, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they went out to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Timerous Deep, got close to the boat, then the boat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; left. The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shuttles just went back to BB.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That avenue being out, I returned to SK to pick off<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gnolls, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; forage Plains Pebbles. I almost have my bank tool<br/>\n&gt; &gt; box full of them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have about eight to go. So, decided to stay there<br/>\n&gt; &gt; until I get the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rest.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Plus I have been getting fs weapons from the gnolls,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; which I have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tried to make into another Vale Sewing Kit to sell.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hope they get the boat fixed.
