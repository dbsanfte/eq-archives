Since the merger, we&#39;ve been working hard behind the scenes to<br/>\n&gt; ensure a smooth integration of the two services.  Part of this process<br/>\n&gt; requires that all communities have unique names<br/>\n&gt; (i.e., <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:communityname@onelist.com\">communityname@onelist.com</a>).  We are contacting you because your<br/>\n&gt; community, EverQuest, has the same name as another community<br/>\n&gt; on the new service.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ve been working closely with our moderators to develop a system for<br/>\n&gt; determining which communities will need a new name.  This system takes<br/>\n&gt; into account the following criteria:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. How long the community has been in existence<br/>\n&gt; 2. The size of the community<br/>\n&gt; 3. The activity level of the community<br/>\n&gt; 4. Whether the community is an announcement community or a discussion<br/>\n&gt; community<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Over the next few days, we&#39;ll use this system to identify which communities<br/>\n&gt; will need to be renamed.  If your community does need to be renamed, you<br/>\n&gt; will receive an email from us on or before February 22, 2000.  If you do<br/>\n&gt; not receive an email from us, then your community will not need to be<br/>\n&gt; renamed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thank you for your patience and cooperation throughout this process.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sincerely,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The ONElist Team<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
