I pull with <br/>\nthe &quot;Darkness&quot; spell lots. Slows the incoming mob down, gives ya a <br/>\nchance to cast again with another DOT or now use the &quot;Spear&quot; spell <br/>\nto gain some more agro. Also allows others that maybe have a bow to <br/>\nplink a few arrows or for other casters to cast a spell such as slow <br/>\nor whatever.<br/>\nAs far as weapons, practice them all. I personnaly think for a SK, <br/>\nthat a 1HB or a 1HS and a shield work great. But are some nice 2H <br/>\nalso, just a bit to slow for my tastes, but nice dmage on the 2H.<br/>\nI practice my weapon skills if I&#39;m not in group, but am near a full <br/>\ngroup. Send one in the group a tell and ask if its ok if you help <br/>\nkill outta group. Usually they will more than welcome your help. You <br/>\nwont get XP, and you sure won&#39;t gain agro agaisnt the whole group if <br/>\nyou let them beat on it for a second. Use your worst weapon skill <br/>\nand smack that sucker. Usually sooner or later someone leaves the <br/>\ngroup and you will get right in 99 times out of a 100.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;lisa b&quot; &lt;lisab38@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello All:<br/>\n&gt; I started an alt SK and wanted to know what is a good focus effect <br/>\nfor them <br/>\n&gt; if that makes sense.
