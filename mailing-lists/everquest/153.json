Some people like to role-play, some people are powergamners & some people simple enjoy playing the game for what it is.  If a person wishes to get a walkthrough for a quest, let him have his fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  Spoilers are unavoidable.  There is nothing Verant or anybody can do to eliminate them.  They are there for those that want/need them.<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  If the polls are saying that people want walkthroughs, then it seems you are in the minority.  :)  Seriously, the polls may be a bit weighted towards powergamers but it is apparent that enough people want the spoilers to warrent their existance.<br/>\n<br/>\nMunk<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shane0009@...\">shane0009@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shane0009@...\">shane0009@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, April 27, 1999 1:58 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Role Playing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Shane Bole&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shane0009@...\">shane0009@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nthis is pretty lame... this is an RPG, but on all the polls, people want<br/>\nwalkthroughs on quests? where is the fun in that? maybe a hint or 2, but its<br/>\nno fun walking around following a guide telling you to avoid so and so<br/>\nwhatever to not get killed.<br/>\njust wondering if anyone aggrees with this...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShop.theglobe.com * One-Stop Shopping * Free Shipping in U.S.!<br/>\nLive Personal Shopper * Satisfaction Guaranteed * No Hassle Returns!<br/>\nAccessories, Apparel, Jewelry, Kids, Sporting Goods, Apparel, More!!<br/>\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/shoptheglobe0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/shoptheglobe0</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
