Just plan out her levels when she<br/>\nneeds to train and take trips back for training purposes.  Since most skills<br/>\nrequire only 1 point normally it works out just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI once tried that on a PVP Team server.   Ran my lvl one troll through the<br/>\nswamp - sro - oasis - nro - ecommons - nek forest to find out nobody would<br/>\ntrain me =(.  Oh well..  There might be some way to train it up, or gain<br/>\nenough faction to.  However most of those factions require quest - from<br/>\nthose that dont like you in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Knight [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:knight@...\">knight@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 11, 2000 4:52 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:everquest@egroups.com\">everquest@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Ogre faction and training near freeport?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi all,<br/>\n <br/>\n  I just got a friend into EQ (Is it just me or does anyone else seem to <br/>\npicture that Truth tobacco commercial ads with body bags whenever you <br/>\nintroduce a new victu...er, player to EQ? &gt;:-) ).  She&#39;s decided to start<br/>\nan Ogre warrioress with green hair (She liked the green hair for some<br/>\nreason),<br/>\nand I brought her all the way to freeport.  <br/>\n <br/>\n  Since i&#39;ve never played an evil factioned race before, i have no idea<br/>\nwhere<br/>\nshe should go to train her skills.  We found she can get into Neriak to<br/>\nbuy/sell<br/>\nand bank, but the warriors guild there won&#39;t train her.  We also tried that<br/>\n<br/>\nbarbarian warrior under east freeport.  <br/>\n <br/>\n  Does any know where she can train near Neriak or freeport? Or does she<br/>\nhave<br/>\nto travel all the way back to Ogguk?  Also any tips on what she can do to<br/>\nhelp<br/>\nher faction so she can get into the freeport city would be appreciated! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n -Sceadu<br/>\n  Lvl 6 (Human) Shadow Knight<br/>\n  Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
