EQ Atlas is a good<br/>\n&gt; &gt; resource, however their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; maps aren&#39;t the best IMHO. One, they need to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; consistence and have one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; map that they update off the other maps they have.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Two, No cartoony<br/>\n&gt; &gt; maps. It makes things a little too confusing; And<br/>\n&gt; &gt; three, Add a legend to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the maps and include a N S E W compass. I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; saying they suck, just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would like to see some improvements. Hopefully<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Verant&#39;s will be more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; consistent. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; As for the dual monitor, It&#39;s easy, just have a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; second video card<br/>\n&gt; &gt; installed and run EQ on one and your other info on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the other. You may<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have to tweak the settings a little but that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shouldn&#39;t be hard to do.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The monitors can be mapped to do this. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; C-ya!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Steve<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Message: 1<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Date: Mon, 26 Aug 2002 14:00:51 -0000<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    From: &quot;mlockridge01&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MLockridge01@...\">MLockridge01@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Forthcoming Atlas<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I will probably buy the forthcoming atlas, once it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is out. It will be <br/>\n&gt; &gt; cheaper than printing up the rest of the maps I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t have, since I <br/>\n&gt; &gt; have been only printing maps as I need them. Plus,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we ran out of ink <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and nobody in my household wants to be the one to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spring for the new <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ink. Probably because they know a large number of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; maps will be <br/>\n&gt; &gt; printed as soon as the ink is loaded. ;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; What I would really like is to have eq in a<br/>\n&gt; window,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with a second <br/>\n&gt; &gt; monitor to hold my data; maps, charts, lists, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; recipes. I know <br/>\n&gt; &gt; there is a hack to allow this, but I would prefer<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sanctioned <br/>\n&gt; &gt; window. Plus I don&#39;t have the horsepower on this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; system to carry such <br/>\n&gt; &gt; a load. My game would suffer.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Twenty bucks for the atlas sounds cheaper all<br/>\n&gt; round.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
