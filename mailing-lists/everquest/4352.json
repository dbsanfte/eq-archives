The map on page15 in the Everquest Shadow of<br/>\n&gt; Luclin Game Manual was confusing me. Usually North is at the top of<br/>\n&gt; the map instead of at the right hand side. G. I&#39;ve located the maps<br/>\n&gt; now. How do I get into the crater and out of it without having to<br/>\n&gt; fall in and get killed to return tothe city? I&#39;m starting my hunt for<br/>\n&gt; the three requested bare skinned rock hoppers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Edward<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\nOh, the maps that came with the game were some of my biggest pet peeves.<br/>\nThey made no sense to me. I asked /ooc if they looked even remotely like the<br/>\ncity (to people who had been exploring) and was told &quot;No&quot;. And then they<br/>\nsold that map booklet that is almost useless. Especially with some of the<br/>\nerrors. Like having A B C D E listed on the map but only A B C D defined. So<br/>\nthere&#39;s this zone that&#39;s marked but not defined... The person who did EQ<br/>\nAtlas did a MUCH better job at maps. His maps are much much more useful. I<br/>\nreally wish he hadn&#39;t gotten screwed on the map book thingy. I would&#39;ve<br/>\npayed for a book with his maps over the one Sony put out. I still think it<br/>\nwould be cool if he made a book and had fold out maps and such. Ones that<br/>\nare large enough to mark things on as notes to yourself. So you can look at<br/>\nthem ingame and out of game.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
