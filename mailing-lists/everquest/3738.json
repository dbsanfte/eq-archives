Reason I ask this is I was<br/>\ntaught by a friend to have the Hotkey for sense heading to be in the  first<br/>\nspace next to  my combat key like taunt or kick or bash depending on  my<br/>\ncharacter that way I can increase sense heading skill while in combat.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What my son and I did was to map the hot key to the right turn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; button. Every time we turn right, we sense heading. Builds skill<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quickly. Can be done for foraging, as well, but you end up with<br/>\n&gt; stuff<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on your cursor as you run around. Not always a good thing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Barto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.386 / Virus Database: 218 - Release Date: 9/9/02 </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
