No need to fight, especially over a little<br/>\n&gt; misunderstanding. I can, however, see how many of you would jump to your<br/>\n&gt; defenses...

Oh, and thanks for fixing<br/>\n&gt; that little problem with the auto. messages, Su. It was getting annoying,<br/>\n&gt; LOL. To whoever it was that is seeking platnum... although it&#39;s very hard,<br/>\n&gt; you could kill giants in the Frontier Mountains. Some of them drop Forest<br/>\n&gt; Loops that sell for 300 platnum. However, like I said, it&#39;s rare that they<br/>\n&gt; drop them, but I have looted one from before. It just takes patience,<br/>\n&gt; although the experience sucks... it did for me anyway.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -= Mippon - 40 Halfling Druid =-<br/>\n&gt; -= Nevfalath - 8 Dark Elf Necromancer =-<br/>\n&gt; -= Areznia - 6 Vah Shir Beastlord =-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Tired of spam?
