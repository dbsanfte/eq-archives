I<br/>\nnever advise anyone to go there.  Eastern Karana has another exit than<br/>\nHighPass.  That is to the Beholder&#39;s maze.  It&#39;s terrible too, but you get a<br/>\nrunning chance.  It brings you to RunneyEye.  A bit better than HighPass.<br/>\nThat brings you to Misty Thicket, then to Rivervale.  From there go to<br/>\nKithicor Forest, which is where HighPass would have led you, if it were not<br/>\nso terrible.<br/>\n<br/>\nTravis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MFerrulo@...\">MFerrulo@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MFerrulo@...\">MFerrulo@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, April 26, 1999 1:01 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] High Pass Hold<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MFerrulo@...\">MFerrulo@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, I&#39;&#39;m a 9th Level Barbarian Warrior and last night I decided to make the <br/>\ntreacherous run from Queynos to Freeport.  I got as far as High Pass Hold <br/>\nwhen I was waylaid and killed by a gnoll soothsayer.  I retrieved my corpse <br/>\nand then spent an hour running around trying to find the way out of High<br/>\nPass <br/>\nHold towards Freeport.  IT WAS SO FRUSTRATING!!!  It was also scary as hell <br/>\nseeing how I was practically naked and the only player character in the <br/>\nentire zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould someone please give me some advice or direction in how to get the hell<br/>\n<br/>\nout of High Pass Hold and through to Freeport?<br/>\n<br/>\nMcBanus of Halas<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nNew hobbies?
