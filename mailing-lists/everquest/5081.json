It&#39;s not too hard to <br/>\nget 6 guildies together, but not all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the main idea of all these adventures is to get to the named mob, <br/>\nbecause that is where the big drop is.  Rangers and Druids have <br/>\ntrack, so once again we have a use.  And that snare helps too when <br/>\nthey go for friends!<br/>\n<br/>\nTuldayen Grimblade<br/>\nPathfinder of Tunare<br/>\nSummoners of the Realm, Terris-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Lyles&quot; &lt;dwlyles@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m a level 41 Half Elf Druid.  Like you, I have soloed most of my <br/>\nlife.  What I have found about LDoN is, true you have to group.  But <br/>\nthe organization is there, so that the groups constantly change.  <br/>\nMost often I am asked to join by putting my LFG flag up.  The <br/>\nadventures are short, 2 hrs and have a specific goal to obtain.  The <br/>\nexp is great, typically half a level per adventure.  We druids are <br/>\npopular for our regen buff and healing, and have counteract poison up <br/>\nif someone&#39;s gonna play with the crates.  You can save yourself in <br/>\ntime if your fast.  Then, after 2 hrs, you split the loot, typically <br/>\n50 - 80 plat your share, and go back to soloing.  I thought it was <br/>\nmore for guilds as well, but have yet to see a group of all one <br/>\nguild.  I am typically quiet (I type slow, hehe) but so much goes on <br/>\nso fast, that nobody seems to mind.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tokool Espirit<br/>\n&gt; Lany&#39;s server<br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;   From: mlockridge01 <br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Sunday, September 21, 2003 1:03 AM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: [EverQuest] Re: Hello All<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I am a lvl 41 Halfling Druid.
