Ofcourse none of<br/>\nus can guess how the development team decided to code<br/>\neach part. Maybe it transfers all info about<br/>\neverything in the zone. Maybe just a little tiny bit<br/>\nof info. I wonder if any of the developers has read<br/>\nany of these posting. <br/>\nWhat you say abou the modem lights is interesting. As<br/>\nthat would seem to discount the Line Speed theory if<br/>\nyour Send and Recieve lights never flicker during<br/>\nzoning. Hmmm. I may have to try this and reconsider my<br/>\nposition. Ofcourse I dont own an external modem so I<br/>\nwill have to hunt one down. <br/>\nMaybe we all just experience time differently and<br/>\nzoning is really equal in all cases just our<br/>\npreceptions of it are different. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Whitmore, Lance&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lwhitmore@...\">lwhitmore@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What i dont understand is why people believe that<br/>\n&gt; the information about what<br/>\n&gt; NPC and PC carries makes any difference on load<br/>\n&gt; times... its nothing but a<br/>\n&gt; few digits..  there is no item that is new every<br/>\n&gt; item has a tag and the<br/>\n&gt; approprite information is already contained on your<br/>\n&gt; system.
