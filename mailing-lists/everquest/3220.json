That dot gets his attention, and begins <br/>\n&gt; doing <br/>\n&gt; &gt; damage. I then begin running away from the Spires, to get some <br/>\n&gt; &gt; distance from any possible gnoll back-up. Once I have the <br/>\ndistance <br/>\n&gt; I <br/>\n&gt; &gt; want, I root him and hit him with another dot, Incinerate in this <br/>\n&gt; &gt; case. I then rest to regain mana. I will run, root, and dot him <br/>\n&gt; until <br/>\n&gt; &gt; dead. With luck I have enough mana left to rest only a short time <br/>\n&gt; &gt; before I go get another.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was talking with my son-in-law while taking one gnoll, and <br/>\nrooted <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the thing at the spire rather than pulling him away. I guess I <br/>\nwas <br/>\n&gt; &gt; distracted. A second gnoll came along and agroed on me, driving <br/>\nme <br/>\n&gt; &gt; away. I knew I did not have the mana to manage both, so ran south <br/>\n&gt; for <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Lake Raithtear. I reached the zone well ahead of them. I rested <br/>\nto <br/>\n&gt; &gt; full capacity, with no gnolls in sight. Didn&#39;t even zone.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I went back to get some more gnolls, but found someone camping <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt; &gt; spire I had been working. I started to leave, honoring his claim <br/>\nto <br/>\n&gt; &gt; an abandoned camp, when a gnoll hit me from behind. I lead him on <br/>\na <br/>\n&gt; &gt; fatal chase. The camper sent a tell regarding a perceived <br/>\nviolation <br/>\n&gt; &gt; of camp courtesy, for which I appologized.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; It seems that the gnolls will abandon a chase after some time and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; distance, but remember you well. The second gnoll I had been <br/>\n&gt; involved <br/>\n&gt; &gt; with agroed on me from a considerable distance from the Spires. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, gnoll hunters, keep in mind that an injured gnoll has a long <br/>\n&gt; &gt; memory, and even longer agro range.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes, I&#39;ve had the same thing happen to me.  As long as you are the <br/>\n&gt; only one to do damage to them you are still their primary target.  <br/>\n&gt; Just wait until you get to Kunark, the place is crawling with <br/>\nmobs!  <br/>\n&gt; It looks like a newbie zone on Anatonica.  I&#39;ve run through FM and <br/>\n&gt; seen giants, brutes, goblins and Burnayi all within aggro range of <br/>\n&gt; each other.  So be careful!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As for DoT&#39;in them I prefer to DD or shoot them, snare them, root <br/>\n&gt; them then DoT them.  I read somewhere that DoT&#39;s work better if the <br/>\n&gt; mob isn&#39;t moving.  As a Ranger I then pile on the arrows (Can&#39;t <br/>\nwait <br/>\n&gt; for Tolans Bracer!) and wade in when the root breaks.  If you get 2 <br/>\n&gt; park one one, snare him and blast the other one.  You can even <br/>\n&gt; Harmony him to break his aggro!  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Let&#39;s be safe out there!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tuldayen Grimblade<br/>\n&gt; 38th Season Ranger of Tunare<br/>\n&gt; Terris-Thule </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
