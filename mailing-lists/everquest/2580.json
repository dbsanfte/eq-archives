For instance, my cleric has to be much higher<br/>\nthan the level to attain generally. Unless he is in a group with higher<br/>\nlevels and then he can do it below or at the level. Clerics are not good at<br/>\nsoloing-- at least mine isn&#39;t. But my brother&#39;s paladin could probably do<br/>\nthings while below the level to attain. So I think it&#39;s averaged. I sort of<br/>\nthink they have the level set at the level of whatever mob is involved.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; For those who use Alahkhazam, what is your take on the &quot;Level to<br/>\n&gt; attain&quot; recommendation? Is it a recommendation for a group quest, or<br/>\n&gt; solo? If it is a group recommendation, how much do you think it<br/>\n&gt; should be bumped up for a solo quest?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt; lvl 31 Halfling Druid<br/>\n&gt; Zeb server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
