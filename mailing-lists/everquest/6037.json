I managed to <br/>\n&gt; force my hef rgr to lvl 18/19--18 is where I spend<br/>\n&gt; most of my time, <br/>\n&gt; but sometimes I lvl to 19. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have been recently been building my fletching<br/>\n&gt; skills(104). I spent <br/>\n&gt; about 4hrs a day hunting in front of Qeynos killing<br/>\n&gt; green mobs for <br/>\n&gt; about 3wks. All I make is about 150plat in the 4 hrs<br/>\n&gt; with no exp, but <br/>\n&gt; when I go hunting elswere--like bb--I only get about<br/>\n&gt; 5 plat for 4 hrs <br/>\n&gt; and some exp. I seem to go up about 2 skill points<br/>\n&gt; in that time in <br/>\n&gt; front of Qeynos. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t mean to complain, but I am starting to feel<br/>\n&gt; sorry for all <br/>\n&gt; knolls and gopher snakes I&#39;ve killed. Plus I would<br/>\n&gt; like to be able to <br/>\n&gt; do more quests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I do want to earn everything myself, but would like<br/>\n&gt; to know where I <br/>\n&gt; can earn some serious plat? I have heard of people<br/>\n&gt; lvl 12 earning 4-<br/>\n&gt; 5000 plat/hr. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How do they do that?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyone have any suggestions?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
