I know they have had problems with EQ in the past but they cost<br/>\nmuch less than pentiums. I used to be loyal to pentiums but even though my<br/>\nmother has more RAM in her computer and a 1.7GHz P4, my system with a 1.4GHz<br/>\nAMD (both have same OS and both are HPs) runs faster. It cost $119 for 256M<br/>\nof RAM for the P4. I&#39;d have to ask my dad how much he payed for my upcoming<br/>\nRAM, but for xmas he&#39;s getting me 1.2GHz of RAM. I also read some articles<br/>\non building new computers and Pentiums run hotter and require special<br/>\nsockets and special RAM that all cost more than it costs for AMDs. For a<br/>\nmodem, you could try a V92 Zoom. I got one for about $21 (not including<br/>\nshipping) online. But that&#39;s for phone line modem. Once you figure out what<br/>\nyou want, look up pricegrabber.com, epinions.com, pricewatch.com, and<br/>\ncnet.com. You can compare them and see which one has the lowest price and<br/>\nbest review.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I bought my machine last year for Christmas. A gift for the family.<br/>\n&gt; It was a mid-range system at that time, though I did not know that<br/>\n&gt; the 256k memory limit would make it low-end so quickly. I added a 3d<br/>\n&gt; card at about six months, not knowing that the standard was moving<br/>\n&gt; ahead so fast. With the knowledge I now have, I may have scraped up a<br/>\n&gt; bit more and bought higher end, but it was not then a good economic<br/>\n&gt; move.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I will be adding enough memory in a few weeks to bring my system up<br/>\n&gt; to it&#39;s 256k max. I ordered sol in the summer, with the expectation<br/>\n&gt; that the 128k minimum would be in place when released. I found that<br/>\n&gt; my max would now be the new minimum.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As is the system is nominally playable. With the new memory and<br/>\n&gt; possibly a new graphics card (fortunately the cost of a gforce 2 has<br/>\n&gt; dropped to an easily reachable level) the machine will serve. I<br/>\n&gt; expect Sony/V will make improvements in the game to keep lower end<br/>\n&gt; players viable for some time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now I must plan to upgrade hardware and catch up, perhaps pull ahead<br/>\n&gt; of the curve a bit so I am not always catching up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately, I am not able to scrape up the $4k bucks for a real<br/>\n&gt; kick-ass system like I see in the magazines. I will probably see what<br/>\n&gt; a new tower with lots of memory, a gforce 3 and a good sized hard<br/>\n&gt; drive will cost me, and begin saving in hopes of getting it online<br/>\n&gt; before this system gets too old to play.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For those of us on the lower end, we must hope Sony/V wants our bucks<br/>\n&gt; enough to keep us alive a bit longer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
