I<br/>\nhave only been playing since January and have 4 chars,<br/>\nnothing above 20 level, yet close.  18 Druid, 18 Mage,<br/>\n17 Ranger, and 13 Rogue.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am 37 years old and understand what it takes to form<br/>\na gaming group, since I have in the past.  Here are my<br/>\nquestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut first the Goal of the guild and its purpose would<br/>\nbe as follows.:<br/>\n &quot;To promote a good gaming experience, meet fellow<br/>\nplayers to build relationships/friendships, help<br/>\nothers when possible, and most important, to have fun<br/>\nat what we do.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said,:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. You mention having GOOD funding.  Well, certainly<br/>\nwith no chars over 20 you can imagine I have like 300<br/>\nPP combined if lucky. I would be looking to find new<br/>\nplayers to EQ which would entice them to join my guild<br/>\nfor friendships and not freebies nor to promote<br/>\ntwinkies.  In fact, I would rather oppose twinkies for<br/>\nthis guild since there are plenty of others that<br/>\napprove of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Loot would be ALWAYS keep split on, even on a<br/>\nraid, and randomize anything worth while.  I would not<br/>\nexpect a char who earns some good PP on his own to<br/>\nstash it in the guild vault, per se, but I might<br/>\ndecide to have them pay dues, or even after a raid,<br/>\ndonate something to the guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell to keep this short, what do you think?<br/>\nAm I not at all high enough to even consider this or<br/>\ncan this work?<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts are appreciated, criticize away.<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:alexander.jones@...\">alexander.jones@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What is the goal with the guild? There are many<br/>\n&gt; without a set goal just<br/>\n&gt; inviting people randomly for no apparent reason.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The most important things that needs to be adressed<br/>\n&gt; by a guild is:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Handling of loot (this is a central driving force<br/>\n&gt; for many playing eq, like<br/>\n&gt; it or not)<br/>\n&gt; Leading events/Raids<br/>\n&gt; Handling of recruiting<br/>\n&gt; Selling off uneeded loot to finance guild<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The most common misconception (in my opinion) is<br/>\n&gt; that cause youre a part of<br/>\n&gt; a guild you get groups and items for free. You dont.<br/>\n&gt; You work for them and<br/>\n&gt; sometimes group within guild sometimes outside. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also running a guild costs in game money. Make sure<br/>\n&gt; guild is well on<br/>\n&gt; finances so you can give<br/>\n&gt; clerics/chanters/wizards/magicians reagents for<br/>\n&gt; raiding and not worry about beeing broke all the<br/>\n&gt; time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Structure and leadership organization. How many<br/>\n&gt; officers, what do they do,<br/>\n&gt; is there a set chain of command. Democracy is good,<br/>\n&gt; but not in all<br/>\n&gt; questions. The larger you get the more likely that<br/>\n&gt; one person doesnt like<br/>\n&gt; another, this happens but they still need to be able<br/>\n&gt; to respect each other.<br/>\n&gt; Differences in opinions and personality exists, deal<br/>\n&gt; with it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To simplify these tasks its much easier to have<br/>\n&gt; offline boards that can<br/>\n&gt; handle organizational tasks apart from the online<br/>\n&gt; enjoyment. This is pretty<br/>\n&gt; much the same as playing for a team in any sport<br/>\n&gt; that requires 10+ people.<br/>\n&gt; How well everyone understands and likes the goal of<br/>\n&gt; the guild will determine<br/>\n&gt; how successful you are. Its a bit harder here cause<br/>\n&gt; things that are written<br/>\n&gt; can easily be misunderstood cause of age and<br/>\n&gt; language differences. Be very<br/>\n&gt; clear, try to print a set of rules or guildelines. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Encourage people to be a part of the team...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just some small tips from the top of my head.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ranina Fyrecurls<br/>\n&gt; 60 Virtuoso<br/>\n&gt; Guildleader of Landslide on Ayonae Ro<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.landslide-guild.com\">http://www.landslide-guild.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://forum.landslide-guild.com\">http://forum.landslide-guild.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: jcpatrick [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcpatrick@...\">jcpatrick@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, June 07, 2002 6:49 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EverQuest] Guild Leaders Guide.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hail and well met.
