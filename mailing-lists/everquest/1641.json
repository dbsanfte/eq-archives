Some people are just too dense to listen to anyone. I had some people\n<br>who were ninja-looters in my group. One guy in particular. He kept looting\n<br>while we were still fighting. I told him to stop it. (with my female alt).\n<br>He tried to claim he had only looted once corpse but I watched him loot 3 in\n<br>a row. I told him to stop looting and let others have a chance. Still he\n<br>kept hogging loot. We killed a Lego. He sat back and didn&#39;t do much while we\n<br>killed it but he ran up and looted. He looted a bronze weapon. I said I\n<br>wanted to roll for it. Everyone rolled, I got the highest roll. Not only did\n<br>he not roll, but he refused to give the brozne weapon up. So he got df\n<br>shoulderpads AND the bronze weapon. Finally, we killed the orc weaponsmith.\n<br>I said his name and &quot;Do NOT loot the weaponsmith&quot;. He looted it. I\n<br>immediately disbanded him. He stood around for awhile and didn&#39;t seem to\n<br>realize he wasn&#39;t in group until he tried to loot something. Then he asked\n<br>to be allowed back into group. I said &quot;no&quot;. I think he was shocked that a\n<br>female character was so &quot;harsh&quot;. I only wish I had disbanded him before he\n<br>could loot the Lego.\n<br>luv,\n<br>-Su</blockquote></span></blockquote></font><font COLOR=\"#000000\" SIZE=\"3\" FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\">\n<br></font><font COLOR=\"#000000\" SIZE=\"2\" FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\">\n<br>\n<br></font><font COLOR=\"#000000\" SIZE=\"3\" FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\"><b><i>\n<br></i></b></font></font></html>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
