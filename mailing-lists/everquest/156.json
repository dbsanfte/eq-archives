They disrespect necromancers, not through the character, but in their own words. that is not right and I believe its called necrobashing..? its hard to play them now with everyone giving you bs dueling you all the time<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Whitmore, Lance <br/>\n  To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a>&#39; <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, April 27, 1999 3:01 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [EverQuest] Re: Role Playing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  You just have to face it.. everybody wants everything today. Its just a representation of soceity and the culture we live in.  I myself look at them sometimes when i feel im stuck.  The problem is though is.. during the game people /ooc or /shout out for solutions and people are so quick to give them the answer to any question. Unfortutely the answer is right there i cant block it out I can remove it from my mind.  I just wish that people would try to keep some mystery to the game, and i know i can just filter out Shouts and Out of Characters but... i shouldnt have to do that to enjoy the game.  Everyone just wants a hand out.. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n  -----Original Message----- <br/>\n  From: Shane Bole [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shane0009@...\">shane0009@...</a>] <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, April 27, 1999 2:03 PM <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Subject: [EverQuest] Role Playing <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  From: &quot;Shane Bole&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shane0009@...\">shane0009@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n  this is pretty lame... this is an RPG, but on all the polls, people want <br/>\n  walkthroughs on quests? where is the fun in that? maybe a hint or 2, but its <br/>\n  no fun walking around following a guide telling you to avoid so and so <br/>\n  whatever to not get killed. <br/>\n  just wondering if anyone aggrees with this... <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>\n  Shop.theglobe.com * One-Stop Shopping * Free Shipping in U.S.! <br/>\n  Live Personal Shopper * Satisfaction Guaranteed * No Hassle Returns! <br/>\n  Accessories, Apparel, Jewelry, Kids, Sporting Goods, Apparel, More!! <br/>\n            <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/shoptheglobe0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/shoptheglobe0</a> <br/>\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>\n  Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
