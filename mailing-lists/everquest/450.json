NO. Just play the game as its meant, if &gt;you do it <br/>\n&gt;any other way...why its just a glorified irc chat room.  &gt;You still cant <br/>\n&gt;fight anything beyond your level, you just stand out &gt;someone whos trying <br/>\n&gt;to bypass the system, and most people will look &gt;down on you as someone who <br/>\n&gt;cant handle the game.  Nothing personal i &gt;just put all twinkies in the <br/>\n&gt;same catogery.  The game is just not &gt;that hard, but as in real life <br/>\n&gt;everyone is looking for a<br/>\n&gt;handout.  Later...
