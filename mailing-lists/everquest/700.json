I believe the classes are pretty much balanced, each<br/>\none needs time to develop.

They&#39;re constantly nerfing everything ingame <br/>\nthat&#39;s worth while, or ignoring classes that need to be balanced or <br/>\nupgraded! So in retrospect, I&#39;m looking to find greener pastures elsewhere. <br/>\nPerhaps someone out there knows of another game (other than AC and UO) or <br/>\nperhaps a group who&#39;s programming their own game similar to EQ? If so, <br/>\nplease don&#39;t hesistate to drop me a line or two via email.
