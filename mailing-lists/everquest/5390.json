This way the aggro stays on<br/>\nthem. The strategy I usually use when forming a group is tanks at point, one<br/>\npuller (Either tank or archer otherwise it gets to confusing), nukers to the<br/>\nleft, healers to the right. Seems to work pretty good, occasionally we will<br/>\nget some nasties going after the healers and nukers but then we just have to<br/>\npull the aggros off them is all. And of course this is providing I can get<br/>\nan even group!

Who cares if lull <br/>\n&gt; fails, if we can fade. Faster then trying to split the pull. <br/>\n&gt; If you are pulling aggro off of a tank, well, you are doing <br/>\n&gt; it wrong. It is not thier job to keep aggro off you, but your <br/>\n&gt; job to not pull it off the tank. Try FD every 30 seconds. <br/>\n&gt; Then you can do max damage.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
