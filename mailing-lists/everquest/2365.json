I created a Woodelf Ranger yesterday <br/>\nand planned to focus on this skill, but a friend has just told me <br/>\nthat Archery is broken and serves no purpose but to pull albeit from <br/>\ngreat distances.  I was hoping that a well developed archer, along <br/>\nwith snare could do most damage to mobs before its arrival.  If this <br/>\nnot true I find it staggering.  Its fine for casters to snare, DD and <br/>\nDoT - ie fighting from a distance, but not bow-wielders?  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Any advice and general observations would be kindly met<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Legless, 8 Ranger<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Aka Rykk Bloodfang,  52 Monk<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, I guess 33 seasons has given me a little experience with the <br/>\nbow.  First, the procedure is called bow kiting.  You snare your <br/>\nprey, DoT it and run backwards sticking arrows in it until the snare <br/>\nbreaks.  Then hopefully you&#39;ve done enough damage to finish it off <br/>\nwith your sword(s).  I still do this, though only with blue&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd your friend was sorta right.  It&#39;s not bugged so much as it&#39;s not <br/>\nvery effective.  Arrows cost, even if you make them yourself.  And <br/>\nwhat self-respecting Ranger doesn&#39;t fletch his own bows and arrows?  <br/>\nEven with a quiver to speed up your recovery time you really can&#39;t <br/>\nstick a lot of arrows into your prey.  I can get them down to about <br/>\n60% on a good day.  Now if you can get one of the high damage bows <br/>\nearly you may have a better time at this.  The Trueshot is attainable <br/>\nto low levels, and you may get lucky!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other problem is running backwards sometimes get&#39;s you into more <br/>\ntrouble!  Especially if your prey is prone to having like creatures <br/>\njoin in.  Or Grimfeather comes along!  And Rangers can&#39;t quad kite! <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you&#39;ll find pulling with a bow to be risky in some places.  It&#39;s <br/>\ntoo easy to get a train started.  Not that I&#39;m speaking from prior <br/>\nexperience here!<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I would have liked Rangers to be the preeminent Archery class.  <br/>\nWe share crits with Warriors, and have a few specials once we hit 50, <br/>\nbut that&#39;s it.  Yes, we have dual wield, double attack lightning <br/>\nswords of death!  Gotta watch that too.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood hunting!<br/>\n<br/>\nTul</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
