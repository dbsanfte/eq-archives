I can tell you this,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; though.  It is admirable that your mother plays the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; game.  Most parents wont play the game and consider<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it evil.  I am one of the few lucky parents that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like to play the game with my family.  LOL in fact<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we have a family friday night.  My family is big<br/>\n&gt; &gt; enough that we can have two groups.  Yet we enjoy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, basically what I am saying is Kudos to your mom<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for playing and like you said at least trying.  But<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I dont think fat ass was necessary LOL.  Yet it did<br/>\n&gt; &gt; provide a funny mental picture.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cerasmuerto Ahora<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your Rogue in Hiding<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Su &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:suceress@...\">suceress@...</a>&gt; wrote: Ick. That sucks.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yeah, it&#39;s always wise to choose your groups<br/>\n&gt; &gt; carefully. If you notice a bad<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pattern-- like the main puller pulling nonstop and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not giving you time to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; med, make sure you tell them to stop pulling. If<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they don&#39;t listen, that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when you leave.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I had trouble in group last night bc after my bro<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (the main tank) logged<br/>\n&gt; &gt; off, our new tank went and pulled when I said I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; AFK and not to pull. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was the main healer. When I came back my mother was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sitting in my chair<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shrieking about how she couldn&#39;t heal people. She<br/>\n&gt; &gt; blocked my keyboard with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; her hands and I couldnt&#39; see the screen. Turned out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was still sitting. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; managed to reach over and stand up but she swatted<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my hands away and started<br/>\n&gt; &gt; casting heal-- on the mobs. Wasted most of my mana.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I finally got her to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; move her fat ass out of my chair and got to my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; keyboard but it was too late.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I managed to get off a couple heals on the druid but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; then went oom and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t save myself. I should have gated but I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t want to ditch the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; others. I didn&#39;t realize they said it was ok to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; zone. Big mistake. I ended<br/>\n&gt; &gt; up dead. Fortunately they found a high lvl cleric to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rez me and I got back<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more xp than I&#39;d remembered having.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t mind me. Just felt like sharing. I was mad at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my mom at first but she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was only trying to help. It&#39;s kinda funny in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; retrospect.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Appreciate the response but I was hunting with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; others, no one I know<br/>\n&gt; &gt; personally, and when I died I figured to just go<br/>\n&gt; &gt; back, but when I got back<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my corspe was gone.  I had 2 orc centurions on me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and none of  them helped<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at that point,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, I learnt a good lesson, don&#39;t go with others if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you can&#39;t handle the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stuff yourself.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   From: mlockridge01<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Sent: Sunday, January 06, 2002 11:49 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: [EverQuest] Re: Serious Everquest<br/>\n&gt; &gt; question, please help<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   If you die at levels below 5 you should resurrect<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with five days of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   food and water. If your corpse had nothing on it,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it may have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   disappeared, but your own anwswer is most likely.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You misplaced your<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   corpse. Dying at levels below five is set to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; low-penalty (you lose<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   very little and get food and water when you come<br/>\n&gt; &gt; back) to make the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   early learning a bit easier.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   There are tools to find corpses, sold by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; merchants. However, it is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   best to learn to die with finding your corpse in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mind. Try to look<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   around at landmarks when death is clearly coming.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Try to be near some<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   object you can find easily when you come back. And<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unless you don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   mind having to do this often, learn to fight in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; such a way as to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   seldom die. Some gamers like to take the risks<br/>\n&gt; &gt; leading to frequent<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   deaths, but I prefer to hunt with care and die<br/>\n&gt; &gt; seldom. Seems more in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   the spirit of the game to me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Good hunting to you.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   If --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Minigamer&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;rlebeau65@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Forgive my ignorance but I am a newbie had a 4th<br/>\n&gt; &gt; level Druid in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   city of Elves and while out at the Orc Camp, with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; others, I got<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   killed by an Orc Centurian and when I returned to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get my corpse,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   nothing was there.  It was not more than 4 minutes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when I returned.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Question: Is it possible for someone to Steal or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Loot my corpse?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   The book says no but I beg to differ.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Is it possible that I had two corpses out there?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Meaning, When I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   went back with a dead body I died again?  Which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; meant I found the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   wrong corpse?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; And to add one last question, &quot;what do I do now?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; seeing as I have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   no food, no money, no nothing?&quot;  Do I beg or do I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; start another char?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; This game is totally fun but with the fact of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; trying to learn which<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   way to go all the time and dying, it is starting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to get to me,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; I don&#39;t want to give up just yet and I turned to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this board since<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   the Chat from the game options was USELESS.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Please help and Thanks in advance<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Rob<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         Yahoo!
