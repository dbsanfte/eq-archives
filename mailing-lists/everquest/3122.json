I was literally lvl 45 before I even got over 800pp. That was about<br/>\nwhen I hit GD and started raking in money and levelling up. My cleric dinged<br/>\n52 the other day. :-)<br/>\nI was able to buy some rygor armor too. :-)<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, for the most part, money does not really start to get easier until<br/>\nyou hit the low to mid 20&#39;s, as at that point, depending upon where you<br/>\nhunt, mobs start to drop fine steel and bronze weapons, not to mention<br/>\nchainmail and bronze armor.  There are certain areas, and mobs you can camp<br/>\nat most levels, from about 6 on, that drops a bit better gear than others.<br/>\nThe only other way to gain much in the way of pp at the lower levels is to<br/>\ndrop every cp earned into a tradeskill such as smithing, or tailoring, to<br/>\nget it up to over 100, where you can sell stuff to other players, such as<br/>\nplayer made backpacks, and banded armor.  All it takes to find the right<br/>\nmobs is experimentation, and research, eventually you will find what you are<br/>\nlooking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nRich<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: Nuada Armat&#39;gh<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, June 18, 2002 11:14 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [EverQuest] Hello and a Money making question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I to thought that there were quick fix ways of getting money, but all it<br/>\ncomes down to is killing the right mobs, i.e farming giants etc, selling<br/>\nyour wares from tradeskills and farming items such as centi weapons etc. a<br/>\nlot of ppl tend to use a high lvl char to fund thier twinks, which is most<br/>\nlikely the reason for the excessive amounts of money players buy/sell things<br/>\nfor - sometimes it feels like im trading in russian rouble&#39;s as in pp being<br/>\nnear worthless :(<br/>\n<br/>\n  i have seen some of these guides but havn&#39;t bought one yet so i have no<br/>\nidea as to there real value or content.Most likely they are like other<br/>\nofficial Game Guides for other games i.e a waste of time and money, anything<br/>\nin the guides you can probably find out just by asking the right questions<br/>\nor checking out sites such as alakazam and casters realm, i would ask around<br/>\nsee if anyone has bought one before paying for information.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Nuada - KIA<br/>\n<br/>\n  Druzil Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;From: &quot;dnelle74&quot;<br/>\n  &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  &gt;Subject: [EverQuest] Hello and a Money making question<br/>\n  &gt;Date: Tue, 18 Jun 2002 15:01:53 -0000<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;Does anyone know a good way to make money in Everquest.
