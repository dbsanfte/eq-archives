My<br/>\nwizard spent a good 3 hours medding and fizzling just trying to get her<br/>\nfamiliar back. I&#39;ve never noticed any change in my fizzles or anything after<br/>\na successful summoning. And sometimes it runs off and I can&#39;t find it. But<br/>\nit&#39;s fun to have it just following around and flapping it&#39;s little wings.<br/>\nWhen I&#39;m bored I just talk to my familiar and emote I&#39;m feeding it cookies.<br/>\nToo bad you can&#39;t name your familiars. I call mine Flappy.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFamiliar is a wizard&#39;s pet. It can&#39;t fight, it&#39;s more like a visible  buff.<br/>\nYou have to resummon it each time you die, but it zones with you.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: Steven R.

How do<br/>\n  these differ from Pets? Also when you die and have a &quot;familiar&quot; do you<br/>\n  have to reconjure them up like you do a pet or do they come back when<br/>\n  you do? And finally who all can have a &quot;familiar&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
