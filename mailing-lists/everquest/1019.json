One of them forgot \nto camp his Seb key altogether.<br><br>3) At a Vox raid, our cleric had to heal \nhis party from the pit while fending off bears and spiders.<br><br>4) One of our \nwarriors asked and got irate at a shaman&#39;s pet when the pet wouldn&#39;t answer a \nrequest for a port.<br><br>5) A group of us asked a Necro&#39;s pet once for a \ncorpse summons.<br><br>6) We constantly make the mistake of &quot;Well SR can do it \nwith 1 group, how hard can it be?!&quot;<br><br>7) One of druids has fallen into the \nsame pit trap in Howling Stones 9 times.<br><br>One of our warriors, after \nreceiving a 10 minute lecture about being careful of where you walk in Sol A, \npromptly took a nose dive into the lava 30 seconds after zoning.<br><br>9) The \nsame warrior then proceeded to take 15 more lava baths in Sol A.<br><br>10) We \nalways forget we need to be in the same zone for corpse summoning.<br><br>11) \nThe guides and GMs of Brell know all our names by heart because we manage to \nfind every single terminal bug in any zone.<br><br>12) Our justification for \ndoing Chardok zone when we were all in our late 40s was &quot;Well we can always just \nzone out&quot;.<br><br>13) Same for Sebelis.<br><br>14) Same for Howling \nStones.<br><br>15) One of our druids was so worried about forgetting his Howling \nStones key, he accidently destroyed.<br><br>16) We&#39;ve sold an SMR, a Dragoon \nDirk, a Mith 2 Hander, a TBB, a Kunzar Cloak, a Mammoth Cloak, and an Evil Eye \nBag (full at the time too) to various merchants all around Norrath.<br><br>17) \nOur druids (all of them) always have to ask &quot;Which evac is it for EJ?&quot;.<br><br>1 \nIn Sky we killed eachother off for corpse summoning and revives only to discover \nthat there was no one for corpse summoning and revives left.<br><br>19) Our \npaladin (cough) looks like an Ewok in Kylong armor.<br><br>20) No single person \nin our guild quite knows the entire family tree... even after reading \nit.<br><br>21) We can do Fear in less then 3 hours, but can&#39;t get to any place \nin Velious in under 5.<br><br>22) To this day, when someone says &quot;Can we pull \nsomething?&quot; 3 people head out in different directions to pull.<br><br>23) \nCamping the AC in south ro, we were KSed by a 46th level solo mage (there were 5 \nof us, most all 55th levelish, grouped).<br><br>24) When a particular druid of \nours attempts to port us, it is truly a mystery if we will actually port \nsomewhere, port to the desired location, or watch the druid gate there while we \ngo no where.<br><br>25) While trying to port to Gfay once, we ported to \nHate.<br><br>26) Most people power level their alts and lower level guildmembers \nby helping to kill a mob they are fighting on a consistant basis. We just train \nours and go conveniently link dead.<br><br>27) We once petitioned that the Noble \nDojorn in Sky dropped a Runed Totem Staff. We later found out that Thorondar \ngave the Noble Dojorn the staff so it would have a worse damage/delay.<br><br>2 \nWe constantly sell extra loot and then try to buy it back when we realize that \nwe actually needed that item.<br><br>29) We can kill Trakanon, however most of \nour members have died to green cons while trying to cross most of the zones in \nKunark and Velious.<br><br>30) One of the criteria for membership is &quot;What&#39;s the \nlargest train you have ever pulled?&quot;. Well we want to be the best at something \n/shrug. (P.S. - Conanb still owns this record /rude).<br><br>31) One of our \nwarriors was killed by the same Avocet 5 times.<br><br>32) One of our paladins \n(sniff) was killed by Dorn 7 times (each one a purposeful attack).<br><br>33) \nOne of our druids tried to kite Grim Feather at 20th level.<br><br>34) One of \nour druids has said the word &quot;ow&quot; approximately 2000 times MORE then any other \nperson.... ever.<br><br>35) One of our warriors and one of our mages were lost \nin Lake Rathe for over 2 hours trying to find the SK zone. They kept swimming \naround the zone.<br><br>36) Our 60th level shaman still can&#39;t find his way \nthrough everfrost to find Halas.<br><br>37) A raid newbie once asked me &quot;What&#39;s \na death touch&quot; to which Cazic Thule replied &quot;KRUUNCH!&quot;.<br><br>3 One of our \npaladins (hurumph) once got a rez and ran off to rejoin the fight.....forgetting \nto loot his corpse.<br><br>39) One of our paladins (like we have more then 1) \nonce got rezzed and proceeded to continue to pull Fear.... naked.<br><br>40) All \nof our clerics and druids have Sarnak Battle Shields but none of our melee \ndo.<br><br>41) Cartumandua continually takes most of our phat lewt and just \noggles it an hour out of every day.<br><br>42) One of our clerics continually \ncomplains about the crappy BP he has (he has a Trak BP).<br><br>43) We have one \nhigh level enchanter, and he is on heavy medication (he says it&#39;s for his \nback).<br><br>44) Our bard seems to go LD only when playing his levitate or EB \nsong.<br><br>45) Our other enchanter goes LD anytime the word &quot;incoming&quot; is said \nin guild/group/say/ooc/shout.<br><br>46) Ruut (our troll SK) joined the guild \nbecause he heard we got phat lewt alot and thought we were all pretty skinny \ncompared to him.<br><br>47) None of us day to day can decide what the hell \nfaction we want in Velious, so we usually wind up at Karnors.<br><br>4 One a few \noccasions we&#39;ve told a guildmate we&#39;re camping the Hand (in Karnors) and they \nproceeded to go to Lguk.<br><br>49) One of our Necros paid 2K for a purchaseable \nspell.<br><br>50) One of our Necros spent 3 weeks researching a purchaseable \nspell.<br></span></font></div>\n<div><font color=\"#0000ff\" face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><span\n class=\"ygrps-yiv-2003161397238080519-14032001\"></span></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font color=\"#0000ff\" face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-2003161397238080519-14032001\">I \nthought it was pretty funny.</span></font></div>\n<div><font color=\"#0000ff\" face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><span\n class=\"ygrps-yiv-2003161397238080519-14032001\"></span></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font color=\"#0000ff\" face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><span\n class=\"ygrps-yiv-2003161397238080519-14032001\">Mu</span></font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
