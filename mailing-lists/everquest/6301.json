I saw a systemwide message ing ame today that \n    said<br>&gt; the beta was now open.&nbsp; the registration for it \n    only<br>&gt; lasted for about 15 minutes though so you had to<br>&gt; \n    register in that time.&nbsp; I imagine they will announce<br>&gt; open \n    testing registration periodically as the time<br>&gt; draws near for its \n    live release.&nbsp; I did get<br>&gt; registered and spent a pretty good \n    hour plus<br>&gt; downloading the beta files.&nbsp; I have yet to play \n    it,<br>&gt; but I copied the email I received so people can see<br>&gt; what \n    it says.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Wulfric<br>&gt; <br>&gt; PS&nbsp; Dont \n    ask me for the FTP site address.&nbsp; I wont<br>&gt; give it to \n    you.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Welcome to the EverQuest(R) \n    Depths of Darkhollow(TM)<br>&gt; (DoD) beta!&nbsp; Please read this entire \n    email<br>&gt; carefully. It contains all the information you will<br>&gt; \n    need to hit the ground running and make the most of<br>&gt; your time in \n    beta. Remember, you accepted the<br>&gt; EverQuest Terms of Use, License and \n    Non-Disclosure<br>&gt; Agreement as a condition for acceptance into \n    the<br>&gt; beta program, and everything included here as well<br>&gt; as \n    what you see on the beta server, in beta-related<br>&gt; communications and \n    beta forums and message boards<br>&gt; are covered by that agreement. \n    <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; HOW DO I GET ON THE BETA SERVER?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n    In order to access the Depths of Darkhollow beta<br>&gt; server, you will \n    need to download the Beta patcher.<br>&gt; The FTP site for downloading the \n    patcher is listed<br>&gt; below. There may be a lot of data to download, \n    so<br>&gt; please be patient.&nbsp; You should run this patcher<br>&gt; \n    before you log in, every time.&nbsp; Failing to do so may<br>&gt; cause you \n    to experience crashes or gameplay issues<br>&gt; that could be fixed just by \n    patching.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; You may download the Depths of \n    Darkhollow beta<br>&gt; patcher at the following FTP site<br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n    <br>&gt; FTP Site omitted due to NDA.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; To get to \n    the ftp site:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Enter the ftp address into your Internet \n    Explorer<br>&gt; web browser.&nbsp; It will bring you to the ftp site. \n    The<br>&gt; file you need is called EQBetaPatcher.zip.&nbsp; Just<br>&gt; \n    right click on the file and copy it to your desktop.<br>&gt;&nbsp; Unzip the \n    file and copy betaeverquest.exe into your<br>&gt; root EverQuest directory \n    (Should be in C:&#92;Program<br>&gt; Files&#92;Sony&#92;EverQuest unless you changed \n    your default<br>&gt; installation.)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Run this every time \n    prior to logging in to the beta<br>&gt; server. You will see the Beta Server \n    on the server<br>&gt; list, choose that server and log in.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n    <br>&gt; HOW LONG IS BETA?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The beta test is scheduled to \n    begin on July 20th,<br>&gt; 2005 and is scheduled to end on September \n    13th,<br>&gt; 2005, unless we decide to change these dates.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n    <br>&gt; HOW DO I GET TO THE DoD ZONES?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; When you get onto \n    the beta server, create your<br>&gt; character and head to the Plane of \n    Knowledge. Find<br>&gt; Old Man Thorren and he can teleport you to \n    Corathus<br>&gt; Creep.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; HOW DO I COPY MY CHARACTER \n    ONTO BETA?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; For us to copy your favorite EverQuest character \n    to<br>&gt; the beta server, please indicate which character you<br>&gt; want \n    us to copy by logging into your play server as<br>&gt; your favorite \n    character. You indicate that you want<br>&gt; us to copy an individual \n    character by typing the<br>&gt; command /beta in your chat window. \n    Periodically we<br>&gt; will run scripts that will copy characters to \n    the<br>&gt; beta server. Keep in mind that we will be running<br>&gt; the \n    character copies on an as-needed basis - not<br>&gt; necessarily at regular \n    intervals. It may take<br>&gt; several days for us to copy your \n    character.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; THE /betabuff COMMAND<br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n    The level range needed to test all of the variations<br>&gt; of dungeons \n    for&nbsp; DoD is huge.&nbsp; In order to give you<br>&gt; that ability to \n    test as much of the expansion as<br>&gt; possible, we have created a \n    /betabuff command. <br>&gt; Here&#39;s how you use it.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 1. \n    Create a first level character on the beta server<br>&gt; and log in with \n    that character (this command will<br>&gt; only work on 1st level \n    characters).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 2. Type /betabuff CLASS LEVEL - where CLASS is \n    the<br>&gt; class of the character you would like to create, and<br>&gt; \n    LEVEL is the level that you want that character to<br>&gt; be.&nbsp; LEVEL \n    can only be numbers divisible by 5,<br>&gt; starting at 20.&nbsp; So 20, 25, \n    30, etc.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; That&#39;s it.&nbsp; The character you created will \n    be<br>&gt; transformed into a character of the level and class<br>&gt; you \n    have chosen.&nbsp; Your race and even gender may<br>&gt; change as \n    well.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; BETA FEEDBACK<br>&gt; <br>&gt; There are two \n    methods for passing information to us<br>&gt; about what you experience \n    during the beta.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; /bug should be used to report bugs.&nbsp; \n    Bugs are<br>&gt; gameplay features that do not work, spelling \n    errors,<br>&gt; and anything that just does not work as intended. <br>&gt; \n    Please give us as much detail about the bug as you<br>&gt; can think of when \n    reporting it.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; /feedback should be used to send in comments \n    about<br>&gt; parts of the expansion that work properly, but that<br>&gt; \n    you would like to see changed.&nbsp; If you discover an<br>&gt; item that \n    you think should have less Wis and more<br>&gt; Int, then use \n    /feedback.&nbsp; If you think a certain<br>&gt; encounter is too easy or too \n    hard, use /feedback to<br>&gt; report it.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; It is important \n    that you distinguish between these<br>&gt; two options, as one is read \n    primarily by our testing<br>&gt; team and the other is read mostly by our \n    game<br>&gt; designers.&nbsp; Sending a bug through /feedback can<br>&gt; \n    delay our ability to fix it, since we&#39;ll have to<br>&gt; route that to our \n    testers for verification.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Please use this command to \n    explore as many of the<br>&gt; adventures as you can and report your \n    findings to<br>&gt; us.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If you find yourself in dire need \n    of assistance, you<br>&gt; can use /petition to contact us for help.&nbsp; \n    Please<br>&gt; only petition if the situation is one that you can&#39;t<br>&gt; \n    correct yourself.&nbsp; For example, if you used<br>&gt; /betabuff to create \n    a character and you have lost<br>&gt; the corpse, there is no need to \n    /petition.&nbsp; You can<br>&gt; just log out, create a new character and \n    use the<br>&gt; /betabuff command again.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Please remember \n    that your participation in the beta<br>&gt; program is subject to the Terms \n    of Use, License and<br>&gt; Non-Disclosure Agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) which \n    you<br>&gt; have already agreed to. Your access in and to the<br>&gt; beta \n    program, including the patcher, is for your<br>&gt; personal, non-commercial \n    use only, in accordance<br>&gt; with the Agreement, and any feedback you \n    provide is<br>&gt; confidential.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Thank you for your time \n    and effort; we appreciate<br>&gt; your help testing this expansion.<br>&gt; \n    <br>&gt; Sincerely,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; The EverQuest Depths of \n    Darkhollow Development Team<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n    <br><br><br>__________________________________________________<br>Do You \n    Yahoo!?<br>Tired of spam?&nbsp; Yahoo!
