Do you remember your first GM <br>event?&nbsp; Or even the most memorable.&nbsp; <br><br>Now I know some of you are asking what are those!&nbsp; Back in the olden <br>days of Everquest, before the new planes were revealed, before the <br>Nexus opened and the moon Luclin moved closer to us, before the great <br>ice sheet that is Velious was found there were mythical beings that <br>walked the land called GM&#39;s.&nbsp; On certain occasions they would come <br>down to the lands of Norrath and alter them.&nbsp; Sometimes they played <br>tricks, or reset a zone to their own liking.&nbsp; Some of you may have <br>experienced this over Christmas, or during Halloween.<br><br>When Tuldayen was a young and very inexperienced Ranger roaming the <br>hills around Qeynos he was involved in\n such an event.&nbsp; He awoke one <br>morning to find himself in the quiet of Surefall Glade.&nbsp; He took up <br>his trusty Hickory Bow and sheathed his now only tarnished long sword <br>and ventured out into the still unfamiliar hills.&nbsp; But when he <br>entered the tunnel he was met by several of the evil undead.&nbsp; He was <br>lucky enough to jump back into the protection of the glade and <br>avoided death.&nbsp; He thought to himself &quot;where are those guards&quot; and <br>ventured out again.<br><br>He was amazed by what he found.&nbsp; The sky was a deep red, blood red.&nbsp; <br>The entire land was filled with all manner of Skeletons.&nbsp; Many were <br>familiar to him, but many more were not and some were 30 feet tall!&nbsp; <br>It was as if the ancient battlefields of Norrath had spilled their <br>dead on the land.&nbsp; Then he heard the wails of Varsoon the undying and <br>saw great magicks near the ruins.&nbsp; He ran for his life toward the <br>City of Qeynos.&nbsp;\n When he looked back there were a dozen of the evil <br>creatures behind him.&nbsp; He made it to the city and found many like <br>him.&nbsp; Parties were formed and we headed back to the hills to destroy <br>what evil we could.&nbsp; Oh, many of us fell that day.&nbsp; We had the good <br>fortune to have obtained a bind in the city.&nbsp; Experience was gained <br>and lost, many of us found better weapons amongst the shattered bones <br>and plenty of gold was found.<br><br>Eventually the hills filled with powerful adventurers and the Guilds <br>called upon their members to gather for the war.&nbsp; The Undead War <br>raged for days in the hills around Qeynos until at last enough blood <br>had been spilled to satisify any God.&nbsp; Or GM! ;)<br><br>This was a 1-35 event that went for 8 actual hours.&nbsp;
