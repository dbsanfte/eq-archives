The game is much different <br/>\nfrom PC EQ.  I had a lot of fun but alot of other long time EQ players <br/>\ndidn&#39;t like it.  The &#39;feel&#39; of the game is totally different.  The game <br/>\nmechanics are different.  It&#39;s a totally different game.  Don&#39;t buy EQOA <br/>\nfor it to be a clone of EQ.<br/>\nThe people who were the most blown away by EQ were the console gamers. <br/>\nThey really had a blast.  It was fun showing them some of the basics <br/>\nabout the EQ world and making them so happy.<br/>\nIn order to play EQOA you need an network adapter.  Some people have <br/>\ntrouble finding this so buy that before EQOA comes out if you are <br/>\nplanning to buy it. I bought mine off Ebay, make sure the person you buy <br/>\nfrom has a high rating and it&#39;s new in box.<br/>\n  It is also recommended that you have a USB capable keyboard.  They do <br/>\nprovide a menu system for the most common phrases but  it&#39;s clunky to <br/>\nuse all the time.  I recommend you play for at least a day without the <br/>\nkeyboard to familiarize yourself with the controller.  The point of <br/>\nconsole gaming is so you don&#39;t have to sit at a desk, lay on the couch <br/>\nand use the controller for a while.<br/>\nOne thing I don&#39;t like is you are limited to 4 people in a group.  I <br/>\nalso don&#39;t like that they fixed my 200 damage quested weapon, I was the <br/>\nBattle Druid for a while there, hehe.  You get used to the small group <br/>\ntho, there&#39;s a nice bonus for big groups.  Best way to get levels is in <br/>\na full group.<br/>\nCrgaming has a nice site up about EQOA, has info on each of the races <br/>\nand classes.  They posted a dev chat today.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
