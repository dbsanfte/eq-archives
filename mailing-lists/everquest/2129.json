Sometimes lag spikes hit and I go almost LD \n  5 times<br>before the lag stops and I can continue. But that usually coincides \n  with a<br>couple of my group members actually going LD so I&#39;m pretty sure it \n  is a<br>server side problem. I will take a character to Rivervale later and \n  check it<br>out.<br>luv,<br>-Su<br><br>&gt; I just added the necessary memory \n  to max out my system.<br>&gt; Unfortunately, that max is 256. I would love to \n  go to 512 or more,<br>&gt; but that would require a new \n  system.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Things have improved with the added memory, but I \n  still get lots of<br>&gt; lag in Rivervale, and similar town type zones. My \n  graphics card is an<br>&gt; Nvidia TNT 64 (don&#39;t know what the 64 means, it is \n  32meg). It is the<br>&gt; best I could find last year for the money I had, and \n  more than<br>&gt; adequate for the game at that time. I needed pci, so my \n  choices were<br>&gt; a bit limited. More than that, my knowledge was much less \n  in those<br>&gt; days.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I am curious as to what kinds of \n  graphics cards people use, and<br>&gt; whether or not they are experiencing \n  lag in zones like Rivervale in<br>&gt; spite of having a pretty good \n  system.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Anyone have a killer rig, and still find lag or other \n  problems? I<br>&gt; just wonder how much is the game, how much my now low end \n  system.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Visit \n  the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; \n  Your use of Yahoo!
