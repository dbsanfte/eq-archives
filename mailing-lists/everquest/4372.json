I can&#39;t<br/>\nremember how much to charisma though. It&#39;s No Drop. I helped a guy by going<br/>\nand selling the spears he looted and giving him all the plat back from it so<br/>\nhe let me loot the ring with a couple of my alts.<br/>\nI still think that horsies and dinos should have inventory space to carry<br/>\nthings. Like pack mules and stuff in D&D.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Yup, I couldn&#39;t agree more. I bought my druid two Opal Encrusted Steins a<br/>\n&gt; long time ago. They hike his charisma up to 105 when I carry them both and<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s definitely very helpful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -= Mippon - Level 40 Druid Halfling =-<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
