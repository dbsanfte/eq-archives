We <br/>\npay less than $200 a year just to play. Not bad. I spent at least <br/>\n$500 on GamesWorkshop products each year when I was more active <br/>\nthere. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have a problem dropping the monthly fee. It is quite <br/>\nreasonable. I might be able to dump another $500 a year into <br/>\nupgrades. Unfortunately, my machine is now pretty much maxed. So I <br/>\nmust hope that I can hold out at the present level long enough to get <br/>\ntogether the funds for a more upgradeable tower.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow much are others willing to pay to play?<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
