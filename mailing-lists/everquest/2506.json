Didn&#39;t resolve for two days, then <br/>\nI was suddenly back in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nTried to go through tech support. They were willing to help, and had <br/>\nme upload some info from my system. The problem was resolved before <br/>\nthey got to analysing the info, so they said they were happy all <br/>\nworked out well and said goodbye.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think maybe the customer base is expanding faster than the servers <br/>\ncan handle. Some of us are getting locked out because the game is <br/>\njust plain full.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot<br/>\nZeb server<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Su&quot; &lt;suceress@k...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I was on EQ and got booted.
