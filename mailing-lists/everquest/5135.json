So one day \nI asked them what is EQ?&nbsp; All they told me was its a game where you can go \nanywhere, do anything.&nbsp; I thought cool!&nbsp; So one day I went out with my \nfriend (who was my room mate at the time) to watch him play EQ and the game \nlooked boring.&nbsp; All he did was run around, buy things, and kill a few \nthings here and there.&nbsp; Well as soon as we got a computer he installed EQ \nand so I thought why not give EQ a chance?&nbsp; So I played a little..then a \nlittle more..and alot more lol.&nbsp; On Fridays thru Sundays I would play \naround 4pm (when I got off work) and stay up until 7-8am playing, sleep for like \n6 hours or so and do it again.&nbsp; I&#39;ve played for about 2 years now and my \nhighest lvl character is lvl 29.&nbsp; My character would be alot higher but due \nto my job (US Navy) I don&#39;t get to play as often as I&#39;d like.&nbsp; Ever since \nwe left for westpac on March 3rd EQ is all I can think about.&nbsp; I brought \nwith me the following EQ books:&nbsp; Ruins of Kunark, EQ Atlas, EQ Spellbook, \nShadows of Luclin, EQ Players Guide and 2 smaller paperback versions of Ruins of \nKunark and Shadows of Luclin.&nbsp; All I do in my spare time is think of what \ncharacters to make when I get back (middle of November-ish).&nbsp; My room mate \n(who doesn&#39;t play anymore) was kind enought to give me his 2 accounts so right \nnow I have 3 accounts..I&#39;ll most likely sell one of them with a 65 Veteran \nBarbarian Warrior and keep the 60 Shamen account.&nbsp; When I get back I&#39;m \ngonna buy me a laptop so I can play my 2 accounts and P/L myself (and anyone \nelse) with the Shamen heh heh.&nbsp; Needless to say I am a EQ addict.&nbsp; \nOnce in a while I&#39;ll go out to the mall which is 5 minutes away, or hang out \nwith my buddies but most of my time is spent in my room playing EQ.&nbsp; When \nwe&#39;re in homeport at work I look up EQ websites.&nbsp; Pretty bad huh?&nbsp; \nI&#39;ve been playing a little Diablo II onboard to keep myself busy until I get \nback.&nbsp; When I get back I&#39;m gonna buy me a few cases of Red Bull and have a \nEQ marathon =)&nbsp; Happy Hunting!</font></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1723075476270442511-01102003\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\"\n size=\"2\"></font></span>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1723075476270442511-01102003\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\"\n size=\"2\">Dabruiser Troll</font></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1723075476270442511-01102003\"><font face=\"Arial\" color=\"#0000ff\"\n size=\"2\">Warrior of the 29th Season</font></span></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote>\n  <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1723075476OutlookMessageHeader\" dir=\"ltr\" align=\"left\"><font face=\"Tahoma\"\n size=\"2\">-----Original Message-----<br><b>From:</b> Wulfric Rennison \n  [mailto:wulftech@...]<br><b>Sent:</b> Wednesday, October 01, 2003 \n  5:06 AM<br><b>To:</b> EverQuest@yahoogroups.com<br><b>Subject:</b> Re: \n  [EverQuest] Looking 4: Hardcore gamers that live the life of \n  EQ<br><br></font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">I find it would be very hard to determine the \n  &quot;ideal&quot; candidate becuase everyone has their own story.&nbsp; Some are unique, \n  some are not.&nbsp; Me, for example, I&#39;ve been on EverQuest over 2 years and I \n  also have two accounts.&nbsp; The difference is that I started EverQuest \n  BECAUSE of my job.&nbsp; Most of the people I worked with also played \n  EverQuest and it&#39;s all they ever talked about.&nbsp; I began playing EQ at a \n  time in my life when my job was all I had.&nbsp; No social life, no \n  nothing.&nbsp; Just Work and EQ.&nbsp; I slept very little and played up to 16 \n  hours a day.&nbsp; Needless to say, I becamse very burned out, and I quit my \n  job.&nbsp; I moved and got a new job and put myself in a position where I had \n  a nice balance between EQ, social life, and work.&nbsp; I would have \n  considered myself an addict.&nbsp; EQ was all I thought about.&nbsp; I \n  couldn&#39;t wait to get home from work so I could play.&nbsp; But now, I&#39;ve been \n  able to refocus my attention on other things.&nbsp; Now I go to school full \n  time, work part time, and play EQ when I have no other social plans.&nbsp; \n  Even though I still play, it&#39;s no longer the first thing I think of when I&#39;m \n  bored and need something to do.&nbsp; I still love the game and I have no \n  intentions of quitting.&nbsp; Especially now that after 2 years my main \n  character is JUST NOW hitting level 50 and going to start working on his epic \n  and AA points.&nbsp; </font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">It&#39;s always interesting and entertaining for me \n  to hear other people&#39;s stories.&nbsp; Although I wouldn&#39;t mind appearing on \n  the VH-1 show, I wouldn&#39;t consider myself the &quot;ideal&quot; candidate since my \n  addiction days are over and I&#39;ve found a comfortable niche, but I think \n  whoever does get on the show is gonna have a great time.&nbsp; I know I did \n  when I went to San Francisco for the episode of Call For Help on Tech \n  TV.&nbsp; Good luck to anyone who&#39;s interested, and congrats to whomever they \n  choose - even if it&#39;s me.&nbsp;
