I think it&#39;s actually safer<br/>\n&gt; With a Camo and not travelling thru Kithicor at night<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s not too bad a run, but pestering a druid for a<br/>\n&gt; camo and hoping it doesn&#39;t wear off is a hassle. The<br/>\n&gt; boat is probabl a better plan. The other option is<br/>\n&gt; shelling the ten plat to get a port from a Druid or<br/>\n&gt; Wizzy to WC. Much faster. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Or find a kind druid or wizzy who will do it for free or small donation.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
