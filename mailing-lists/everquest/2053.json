This would allow them to enhance<br/>\ntheir character with equipment either passed on or purchased with funds earn<br/>\nas another character.  This would allow them to pretty much solo through a<br/>\nnumber of characters.  Experience helps as well.. A majority of them can<br/>\npretty much solo to at least level 20.  However after about level 12 or so<br/>\nmost players begin to group up.  A Druid like yourself will be able to solo<br/>\nwell after you reach level 14.  However this is not to say you cant group at<br/>\nany time.  Grouping IMHO is a fun aspect of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re a druid my friend :) Spells will always be more important then your<br/>\nmelee skills.  See if you can purchase a nice FS (Fine Steel) 1hs or<br/>\nsomething that is rated at least 5 dmg and you will be fine.  You have a<br/>\nnumber off nice spells that you will begin to rely on much more every level.<br/>\nAt the moment you probably have a Snare ( which slows down a target so its<br/>\neasier to stay a distance from them and still cast ) a Burst of Flame ( is a<br/>\ndirect damage spell ) and a flame lick ( it&#39;s a low level dot spell that<br/>\ndamages a character over a period of time.  Not to mention you can heal<br/>\nyourself :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people play the warrior for its simplicity, however, I think that its<br/>\nbetter to first play a caster.  Afterwards when you create a Warrior you&#39;ll<br/>\nunderstand the weaknesses of a caster class and know how and when to support<br/>\nthem.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I always get confused on where I am going. I think I venture too far <br/>\nout of the city area.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCherish that feeling while you can. :) it would be great to have that<br/>\nfeeling of mystery towards the world of EQ.  That&#39;s when its most exciting.<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nDuhase.. <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: rlebeau65 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rlebeau65@...\">rlebeau65@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Monday, December 31, 2001 10:07 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EverQuest] Newbie has questions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI have just bought the Everquest trilogy box and have played a few <br/>\ntimes.  I have found a few helpful people out there but it seems most <br/>\nare playing solo. Is this normal?  They suggest grouping so that is <br/>\nmy first question.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext, I am having trouble getting money to get decent weapons. I am a level<br/>\n3 Druid and only have a club.  One guy gave me some <br/>\nmoney but it wasn&#39;t much.  He suggested buying more spells, but I <br/>\nreally would like a good weapon.  Dealing 1-3 points of damage just <br/>\nisn&#39;t cutting it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly for now, should I be starting with a fighter type until I <br/>\nreally get use the the game and interface.  I really love wizards and <br/>\nthose type of characters but understand if playing a warrior makes it <br/>\neasier.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always get confused on where I am going. I think I venture too far <br/>\nout of the city area.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for letting the newbie post?  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
