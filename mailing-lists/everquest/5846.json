Unfortunately there isn&#39;t much my ISP can do for me because of my phonelines sucking so bad. The dialup ISP I have is nice (I use it as backup when satellite goes down-- but it is extremely slow) but they can&#39;t do anything about the phone company. Bell South just sucks.<br/>\nI do have friends who are looking for dialup ISPs so I can probably refer them to that site.<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n======== At 2004-10-02, 06:02:00 you wrote: ========<br/>\n<br/>\nWow!
