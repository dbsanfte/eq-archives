I do havfe a question. No th Trade skills, Im understand most<br/>\nof them, they&#39;re pretty straitforward...but I do have a question bout<br/>\nthe cooking one. Why? I understand smithing...get ore, make bars, make<br/>\nweapons/armour...I know in EQ, every so many time units, you<br/>\nautomaticlly eat food. Since rations and milk will fill this funcion,<br/>\n what is the purpose of cookin and brewing? Do you get more food value<br/>\nout of something you&#39;ve made, as oppoised to the rations and bisquits?<br/>\nCan you eat the food and get boosts from it? Same thing for the<br/>\nbrewing? Or is it just a vanity thing to be walking around with<br/>\nsomething you cooked as opposed to the iron raions and milk thing...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe short answer is that higher level baked goods (e.g. Misty Thicket<br/>\nPicnics) and brewed items (e.g. Qeynos Afternoon Tea) boost stats<br/>\nsignificantly when consumed. <br/>\n<br/>\nTrade skills get complicated at higher levels.... they are<br/>\ninterconnected. For example, in order to make a Misty Thicket Picnic,<br/>\nwhich is baking, you need to be able to brew at a decent level to make<br/>\njumjum beer and also be able to tailor and do blacksmithing -- to make<br/>\nthe basket -- in addition to baking. Brewing also benefits fletching,<br/>\nyou need to brew oak bark tannin in order to *brew* light mithril<br/>\nstring, a component in high level wood elf cultural bows. And so forth.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, yes, if you get to Level 250 and want to make your trophy, you<br/>\nwill also need a fairly good Jewelcrafting and Blacksmithing skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nFroon</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
