At level 66 I still have trouble<br/>\nkilling level 30s. Mostly because of the damage<br/>\nmisreporting related to the lag. Although I haven&#39;t<br/>\nplayed in months. My connection has gotten so bad that<br/>\nI really can&#39;t play anymore. I tried doing an LDON a<br/>\nfew months ago but the lag got so bad that I was stuck<br/>\nfor 15 minutes unable to do anything. Zoning takes at<br/>\nleast 5 minutes. If I die it will take me 20 minutes<br/>\nat the very least to get back to my corpse. Sometimes<br/>\nan hour if I have to zone a lot.<br/>\nI really don&#39;t think the game is designed for<br/>\ncharacters of my class and level to be able to solo. <br/>\nI&#39;ve pretty much switched to World of Warcraft now<br/>\nbecause it doesn&#39;t do damage misreporting and death<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t take too much time.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Just Me &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eeyore_95682@...\">eeyore_95682@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; After a year and a half of playing, I&#39;ve done a lot<br/>\n&gt; of group play and<br/>\n&gt; a lot of duoing, but I seem to enjoy soloing more<br/>\n&gt; nowdays.  I can go<br/>\n&gt; where I want, do what I want and keep the loot and<br/>\n&gt; xp for myself. <br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t get me wrong, I still like to group, but<br/>\n&gt; sometimes, for my own<br/>\n&gt; peace of mind, I much prefer soloing.
