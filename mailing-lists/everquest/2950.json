Just foraged vegetables and purchased <br/>\nwater. No containers, just water to buy. Everytime I have a load of <br/>\nveggies I stop and brew some. Still don&#39;t know what vegetable oil is <br/>\nfor.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor smithing the best advance with little cost is metal bits. When <br/>\nmetal bits no longer gains advance, make toolboxes. Use the tool <br/>\nboxes as bank containers.When toolboxes no longer advance, make <br/>\nskewers. This seems to be the lowest cost and least involved product <br/>\nto get you up to lvl 85.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt lvl 85 you can begin cranking out banded armor with reasonable <br/>\nsuccess. Haven&#39;t yet looked past that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBaking is easy to advance if you forage. Fish rolls. Hunt a stack of <br/>\nbat wings, fish a mess of fish. Combine in oven, one and one. The <br/>\nlevel to trivial is around 100. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am based in Rivervale, so I can do all of this mostly in that zone. <br/>\nHave to pop over o misty for the batwings.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaven&#39;t found a quick and easy way to advance pottery, yet. Tailoring <br/>\nhas been my primary skill, advancing with my main experience as I <br/>\nmade my own armor. Hope one day to make Misty armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
