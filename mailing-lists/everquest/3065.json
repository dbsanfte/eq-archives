I don&#39;t think they get the spell &quot;gate&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; The bonuses: You make a decent tank, you can summon a pet to tank <br/>\nfor you<br/>\n&gt; while you med, you can lifetap to heal yourself, and you get a <br/>\nspell that<br/>\n&gt; snares and dots a mob at the same time. You can solo alot and are a <br/>\ngood<br/>\n&gt; asset to a group. Way later in the game you get to summon your own <br/>\nhorse<br/>\n&gt; called an Unholy Steed.<br/>\n&gt; My brother started a shadowknight and got him to lvl 35 in 8 days.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
