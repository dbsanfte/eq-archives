Give one to Edvard Tommels near the bank<br/>\noutside Office of the People. You may need to collect 4 different ones but<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure. The reward is Karana&#39;s Tear a Sta +5 earring. Lore.<br/>\nand  the other quest is for Gem Inlaid Gauntlets.  Here&#39;s the info from<br/>\neqdb.allakhazam.com<br/>\nThis quest starts out in North Qeynos at Crow&#39;s Tavern. Inside, an Erudite<br/>\nlibrarian named Umvera Dekash wants you to return to him 4 different LORE<br/>\nTanned Split Paw Skins, which are dropped randomly off Gnolls in Infected<br/>\nPaw and look like scrolls (not the old style tanned split paw hides that<br/>\nlooked like spells). The skins can be identified even if you cannot read<br/>\nGnoll, as the number of the scroll will always appear near the beginning of<br/>\nthe first sentence (1-4), not to mention that you will not be able to have<br/>\nmore than one of each in your inventory.<br/>\nAfter returning the 4 skins to the librarian in Crow&#39;s tavern you will<br/>\nreceive a book of the translated split paw skins. Umvera will then tell you<br/>\nthat you need to have the book bound by Jheron Felkis, who can be located in<br/>\na spare room upstairs at Velith & Bardo&#39;s bar in East Freeport. Once bound<br/>\nthe book magically rewrites itself into a series of letters written by Ishva<br/>\nVerishe Val to his subjects called &quot;A Paw Book&quot;.<br/>\nReturn the bound book to Umvera in Crow&#39;s and he will give you a sealed<br/>\nletter to take to Durkis Battlemore in Butcherblock Mountains. Durkis can be<br/>\nfound in the guard hut just before Kaladim, on he path from the docks. In<br/>\nreturn for the letter Durkis gives you a set of Gem Inlaid Gauntlets.<br/>\n<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Anyone know what these are for?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
