While this isn&#39;t as<br/>\nannoying as the ones where people ask for real money for their account, I am<br/>\nnow requesting that no further account trades/sales be advertised on this<br/>\nlist.<br/>\nWhy am I against the trading? I have heard of people who bought accounts and<br/>\nthen got screwed by the account holder. Maybe I&#39;m just paranoid, but it is<br/>\nstill not a safe thing to do for the person who wants to get the account.<br/>\nSo no more of this.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, I am not selling this account for money.<br/>\nBut I have a 40 shaman account (on the nameless server) and am done<br/>\nwith it. I do not want to keep paying for it, as I never use it, but<br/>\nI feel funny about just letting it.die. So, I&#39;d like someone that<br/>\ncould use it to take it over. Now, I am looking for some sort of<br/>\ncompensation. NO real money, but a donation to my guild in the way of<br/>\nplatinum or gear would be well considered. Do not ask me how much or<br/>\nwhat items - I don&#39;t know.
