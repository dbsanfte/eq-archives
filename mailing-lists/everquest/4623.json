There are two good Derv camps there<br/>\nwhich give good exp.  You can then head to Oasis 12+<br/>\nbut some roaming mobs are a bit nasty, like IceBone or<br/>\nDrybone Skelies, for got the exact name now, and not<br/>\nto mention the Sand GIant here or there but the Orc<br/>\nHighway is a great place to learn how to group<br/>\neffectively.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would not recommend Paludal Caverns before 16.  Most<br/>\nwon&#39;t want you and soloing will be rough.  However, at<br/>\n16, this is the best place by far for exp up until 25.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter 25 you could get a partner or small group and do<br/>\nUnrest or Aviaks in South Karana.  From 25-35 the High<br/>\nKeep is a good place but gets rather full fast. <br/>\nAround 33+ you can go to the Overthere and get into a<br/>\ngroup at either the Sky zone or the Ledge which is at<br/>\nthe FM zone.  (Please see Eqatlas.com for<br/>\nabbreviations)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can fight in the Overthere till 38-40 and after<br/>\nthat you can go to Dreadlands.<br/>\n<br/>\ngood luck<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nThe New Yahoo!
