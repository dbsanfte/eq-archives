We put the bonus point the same and we didn&#39;t kill anything or gained any exp or levels.. Simple level 1 characters wearing nothing and wielding the newbie sword.. We dueled about 5 times and EVERY time I beat the crap out of him by far, I didn&#39;t even loose half my hitpoints in any of the duels.. It COULD however be just a fluke.. Btw the characters were the same gender..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Avron - </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
