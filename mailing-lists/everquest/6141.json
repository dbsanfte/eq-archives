My brother actually logged in the other day and was 55 still. I think they had a mistake with the credit card again like they did with his account previously. I wanted to just do the renew thing again but I don&#39;t have that option as it says I don&#39;t have an account. So I&#39;ll have to wait til they open to renew. As it is, I already had renewed a few monthsa go for a 2 year subscription. But they keep doing a monthly thing and I think the credit card company is being retarded and refusing to pay bc they think we are being triple billed for one thing.<br/>\nSo frustrating.<br/>\nJust 4 more hours til they open I think. I hope anyways..<br/>\nThanks Scott. *hugs*<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\nps. Btw, has anyone here played World of Warcraft?<br/>\n<br/>\n======= At 2005-04-25, 12:21:00 you wrote: =======<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;m glad you brought that up Su, I&#39;m worried that your account was<br/>\n&gt;hacked or something because your cleric is showing up as level 34 ( I<br/>\n&gt;think ) and your brothers SK is showing up as level 19 ( I think ) and<br/>\n&gt;that really freaked me out.

I went to login to check my email and<br/>\n&gt;apparently for no reason my account was shut off.

So, I have to decide whether or not I want<br/>\n&gt;to bother renewing because they will probably charge me a higher price.<br/>\n&gt;I had a 3 year subscription dammit. It just pisses me off that they<br/>\n&gt;pulled this with me. I&#39;m thinking of writing them an angry letter of<br/>\n&gt;complaint. I should wait til I&#39;m less angry though.<br/>\n&gt;ARG.
