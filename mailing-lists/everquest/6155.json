Plus EQ2 could be considered a parrallel universe. <br/>\nI didn&#39;t know Luclin had exploded in EQ2. Did they say the story behind why? What happened to the poor Vah Shir?<br/>\nI imagine in 25 years the game interfaces will be much more advanced. Maybe there will be EQ 1.5 or 1.9A or something. :-D<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\n======= At 2005-04-28, 01:44:00 you wrote: =======<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Check this out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;72 minutes real time = 1 day game time<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You can check it if you want, I haven&#39;t verified it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Soooooooo......<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;72 X 365 = 26280 minutes real time<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;26280 /  60 =  438 hours<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;438  /  24 =  18.25 days<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;18.25 days real time = 1 year on Norrath<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;or roughly two and a half weeks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Current game date as of this writing is March 11, 3200.
