I <br/>\nasked what it was and she said &quot;You can use it, or sell it and get <br/>\ngood money&quot;. I thanked the lady to death! Later when I went to the <br/>\nbank to put the brand in there, I also noticed that she had given me <br/>\n600PP! Another Dark Elf asked me if I&#39;d go into the Herb Jar in S. <br/>\nQeynos and buy a spell for her. When I did, she gave me a Runed <br/>\nCirclet. A Warrior asked me to do the same thing, and he gave me <br/>\nbuffs and 5PP. I have been pretty lucky in that aspect.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the money, I have been trying to buy items to boost my <br/>\nintelligence, and I&#39;ve been trying to buy things to help my sister, a <br/>\nLevel 10 Mage out too. Can anyone give me suggestion on what to buy? <br/>\nLast night I ran across a Karana&#39;s Tear Earring for 91PP and a Polar <br/>\nBear Robe for 6GP for myself; and a Magi&#39;??? Earring for 50PP for my <br/>\nsister. Where these good prices for these items? And what else do <br/>\ny&#39;all suggest might help me gain intelligence?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks a bunch<br/>\nDawn (Enie)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
