I <br/>\nthink they were craig spiders. Whatever their names, they were large <br/>\nand red and black. Dropped lots of silk. Made lots of silk stuff. I <br/>\nwas gaining experience at the time as well, so found it all the more <br/>\nsatisfying. Plus, the weight of spider silk and the silk stuff I made <br/>\nwas not all that much, so I did a lot of tailoring in the field. Not <br/>\nso easy to do that with heavy hides.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
