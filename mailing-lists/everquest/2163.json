Frontier Mountains is fine at<br/>\nyour level, particularly by the giant fortress, but you will need to be<br/>\ngrouped.

I will run by Highpass and purchase a bit of ore<br/>\n&gt; to try out. See just how hard hunting my own will be. I might be wise<br/>\n&gt; to postpone the visit to Kunark for a few more levels, from what I<br/>\n&gt; have read here. I am sure I can find something useful to do for a few<br/>\n&gt; levels. Any suggestions for possible good zones in Kunark to work<br/>\n&gt; through those levels? Might be good to do my leveling there after<br/>\n&gt; all. Once I have a Kunark bind point I can move back and forth<br/>\n&gt; quickly enough.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Su&quot; &lt;suceress@k...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Any higher level tailors out there?

You<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would need a group at your level. Since you are a druid, people<br/>\n&gt; would really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; want you in group there. Sow can be cast. And if you have regen and<br/>\n&gt; other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; beneficial spells they will love you. Especially since you can<br/>\n&gt; heal. If you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have coin to spend, go to highkeep and auction to buy high quality<br/>\n&gt; ore.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; There are usually some players who will part with it. I think the<br/>\n&gt; small<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bricks go for around 5pp and the large bricks around 10pp.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You too!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; luv,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Su<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
