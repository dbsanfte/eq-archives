Although I&#39;m not sure because I haven&#39;t got through the whole thing yet.&nbsp; In chapter 2,&nbsp; if you are a male character,&nbsp; you can start up a romance with Aribeth,&nbsp; or if you are female,&nbsp; you can start one up with Arrin Gend (Lord Nasher&#39;s head spy).&nbsp; It is pretty interesting,&nbsp; &amp; adds an element of well,&nbsp; it just adds an extra element to the game.\n<p>Kat\n<p>&nbsp; <b><i>Su &lt;suceress@...&gt;</i></b> wrote: \n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote style=\"PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#1010ff 2px solid;\"><tt>I&#39;m still in the first or second one-- the one where you go to Castle Helm.<br>The book I got said you&#39;re supposed to find Fenthick in an alcove in the<br>east-- but I haven&#39;t found him.
