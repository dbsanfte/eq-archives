The machine i&#39;m on at the moment is a boat<br/>\n&gt; anchor, barely met the min reqs for EQ in the first<br/>\n&gt; place (loaner while mine gets repaired after the<br/>\n&gt; rather thorough trashing it recieved from FedEx) but<br/>\n&gt; post-Luclin patch the game refuses to recognize my<br/>\n&gt; video card. Got DirectX 8.1 installed, but the video<br/>\n&gt; card manufacturer stopped putting out video cards (and<br/>\n&gt; new drivers) uh... three years ago from what I can<br/>\n&gt; gather on websites. I don&#39;t mind not being able to run<br/>\n&gt; Luclin on here, it&#39;ll run fine on my machine once I<br/>\n&gt; get it fixed, but this has to be maddening for<br/>\n&gt; customers on low end machines who just want to be left<br/>\n&gt; alone to play EQ Classic.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Send your holiday cheer with <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://greetings.yahoo.ca\">http://greetings.yahoo.ca</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
