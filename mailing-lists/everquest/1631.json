I have seen them do it at tech chats!<br/>\n&gt; Alot of people don&#39;t know that they are at risk. Maybe if Verant warned<br/>\nthem<br/>\n&gt; it could happen they would know and understand how to protect themselves.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not their faults if they are ignorant of malicious hackers. Verant is<br/>\n&gt; NOT ignorant of it.<br/>\n&gt; luv,<br/>\n<br/>\nYes! I called Verant Tech Support to try to solve my problem of excessive<br/>\nLDs. The VERY first question they asked me was if I had a firewall<br/>\ninstalled. When I told them I was using  ZoneAlarm, they not only told me to<br/>\ndisable it while playing EQ, they told me to totally un-install it. In<br/>\naddition, they told me to disable Norton Anti-Virus Auto-Protect while<br/>\nplaying the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose two steps did seem to reduce the incidence of LDs, but it didn&#39;t<br/>\nentirely eliminate them. I feel pretty uncomfortable about invasion, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nFroondor, 36 Wood Elf Druid<br/>\nFroontor, 26 Barbarian Warrior<br/>\nFroondoc, 16 Dwarf Cleric<br/>\nTexxas, 16 Wood Elf Ranger<br/>\nXennasserax, 8 Iksar Shaman<br/>\nAll on Tarew Marr </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
