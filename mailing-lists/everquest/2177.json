Not only do you get XP for killing the<br/>\n&gt; dratted things, but you learn pulling, group work --<br/>\n&gt; if you happen to find a good group -- and you can get<br/>\n&gt; XP from the dwarves for turning in CB belts,<br/>\n&gt; shoulderpads and bracers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; With my new Vah Shir rogue, I&#39;m finding the best way<br/>\n&gt; to level quickly is to work on my throwing skill and<br/>\n&gt; break camps. The Loda Kai camp near the mountains is<br/>\n&gt; proving a great place to do both -- I throw, get a<br/>\n&gt; couple skeletal brigands, kill them, heal for two<br/>\n&gt; minutes, and then repeat.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was levelling my dwarf in about...maybe not an hour<br/>\n&gt; but certainly two if I put my mind to it and I was<br/>\n&gt; levelling my rogue in at least two. It&#39;s  bit harder<br/>\n&gt; now because I&#39;m level 12 working on 13, so it simply<br/>\n&gt; takes longer.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Hanna<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (Vah Shir Rogue Karrah on Sol Ro)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; =====<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Bury my lovely, bury the lies, bury me under a thousand <br/>\ngoodbyes...&quot; - October Project </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
