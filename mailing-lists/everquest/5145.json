I have him hunting Orcs in<br/>\nCC. I may stay there one more level, as it is profitable to hunt<br/>\nminers and sell the Velium. However, I am beginning to cast about for<br/>\nmy next adventure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI go solo most of the time, and prefer that style of play. Not that I<br/>\ndon&#39;t enjoy the social elements of the game. Just don&#39;t want to depend<br/>\non groups. Kind of a loner, even in a game world. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would be a good next step, seeking modest to good leveling, and<br/>\ngood to great cash? I hunt mostly blues, as I can take one easily, and<br/>\ntwo with care, and three if I must (and none of them are casters). Any<br/>\nsuggestions as to where I go next?<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot0</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
