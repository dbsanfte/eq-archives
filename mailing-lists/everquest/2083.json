That sucks.<br/>\nYeah, it&#39;s always wise to choose your groups carefully. If you notice a bad<br/>\npattern-- like the main puller pulling nonstop and not giving you time to<br/>\nmed, make sure you tell them to stop pulling. If they don&#39;t listen, that&#39;s<br/>\nwhen you leave.<br/>\nI had trouble in group last night bc after my bro (the main tank) logged<br/>\noff, our new tank went and pulled when I said I was AFK and not to pull. I<br/>\nwas the main healer. When I came back my mother was sitting in my chair<br/>\nshrieking about how she couldn&#39;t heal people. She blocked my keyboard with<br/>\nher hands and I couldnt&#39; see the screen. Turned out I was still sitting. I<br/>\nmanaged to reach over and stand up but she swatted my hands away and started<br/>\ncasting heal-- on the mobs. Wasted most of my mana. I finally got her to<br/>\nmove her fat ass out of my chair and got to my keyboard but it was too late.<br/>\nI managed to get off a couple heals on the druid but then went oom and<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t save myself. I should have gated but I didn&#39;t want to ditch the<br/>\nothers. I didn&#39;t realize they said it was ok to zone. Big mistake. I ended<br/>\nup dead. Fortunately they found a high lvl cleric to rez me and I got back<br/>\nmore xp than I&#39;d remembered having.<br/>\nDon&#39;t mind me. Just felt like sharing. I was mad at my mom at first but she<br/>\nwas only trying to help. It&#39;s kinda funny in retrospect.<br/>\nluv,<br/>\n-Su<br/>\n<br/>\nAppreciate the response but I was hunting with others, no one I know<br/>\npersonally, and when I died I figured to just go back, but when I got back<br/>\nmy corspe was gone.  I had 2 orc centurions on me and none of  them helped<br/>\nat that point,<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I learnt a good lesson, don&#39;t go with others if you can&#39;t handle the<br/>\nstuff yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: mlockridge01<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, January 06, 2002 11:49 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [EverQuest] Re: Serious Everquest question, please help<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you die at levels below 5 you should resurrect with five days of<br/>\n  food and water. If your corpse had nothing on it, it may have<br/>\n  disappeared, but your own anwswer is most likely. You misplaced your<br/>\n  corpse. Dying at levels below five is set to be low-penalty (you lose<br/>\n  very little and get food and water when you come back) to make the<br/>\n  early learning a bit easier.<br/>\n<br/>\n  There are tools to find corpses, sold by merchants. However, it is<br/>\n  best to learn to die with finding your corpse in mind. Try to look<br/>\n  around at landmarks when death is clearly coming. Try to be near some<br/>\n  object you can find easily when you come back. And unless you don&#39;t<br/>\n  mind having to do this often, learn to fight in such a way as to<br/>\n  seldom die. Some gamers like to take the risks leading to frequent<br/>\n  deaths, but I prefer to hunt with care and die seldom. Seems more in<br/>\n  the spirit of the game to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Good hunting to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n  If --- In EverQuest@y..., &quot;Minigamer&quot; &lt;rlebeau65@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; Hi all,<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Forgive my ignorance but I am a newbie had a 4th level Druid in the<br/>\n  city of Elves and while out at the Orc Camp, with others, I got<br/>\n  killed by an Orc Centurian and when I returned to get my corpse,<br/>\n  nothing was there.  It was not more than 4 minutes when I returned.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Question: Is it possible for someone to Steal or Loot my corpse?<br/>\n  The book says no but I beg to differ.<br/>\n  &gt; Is it possible that I had two corpses out there?

Which meant I found the<br/>\n  wrong corpse?<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; And to add one last question, &quot;what do I do now? seeing as I have<br/>\n  no food, no money, no nothing?&quot;  Do I beg or do I start another char?<br/>\n  &gt; This game is totally fun but with the fact of trying to learn which<br/>\n  way to go all the time and dying, it is starting to get to me,<br/>\n  &gt; I don&#39;t want to give up just yet and I turned to this board since<br/>\n  the Chat from the game options was USELESS.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Please help and Thanks in advance<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Rob<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
