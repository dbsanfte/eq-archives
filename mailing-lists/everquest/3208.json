I guess I was <br/>\n&gt; distracted. A second gnoll came along and agroed on me, driving me <br/>\n&gt; away.

I rested to <br/>\n&gt; full capacity, with no gnolls in sight. Didn&#39;t even zone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I went back to get some more gnolls, but found someone camping the <br/>\n&gt; spire I had been working. I started to leave, honoring his claim to <br/>\n&gt; an abandoned camp, when a gnoll hit me from behind. I lead him on a <br/>\n&gt; fatal chase. The camper sent a tell regarding a perceived violation <br/>\n&gt; of camp courtesy, for which I appologized.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It seems that the gnolls will abandon a chase after some time and <br/>\n&gt; distance, but remember you well. The second gnoll I had been <br/>\n </span></blockquote>involved <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; with agroed on me from a considerable distance from the Spires. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, gnoll hunters, keep in mind that an injured gnoll has a long <br/>\n&gt; memory, and even longer agro range.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Barto Proudfoot<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, I&#39;ve had the same thing happen to me.  As long as you are the <br/>\nonly one to do damage to them you are still their primary target.  <br/>\nJust wait until you get to Kunark, the place is crawling with mobs!  <br/>\nIt looks like a newbie zone on Anatonica.  I&#39;ve run through FM and <br/>\nseen giants, brutes, goblins and Burnayi all within aggro range of <br/>\neach other.  So be careful!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for DoT&#39;in them I prefer to DD or shoot them, snare them, root <br/>\nthem then DoT them.  I read somewhere that DoT&#39;s work better if the <br/>\nmob isn&#39;t moving.  As a Ranger I then pile on the arrows (Can&#39;t wait <br/>\nfor Tolans Bracer!) and wade in when the root breaks.  If you get 2 <br/>\npark one one, snare him and blast the other one.  You can even <br/>\nHarmony him to break his aggro!  <br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s be safe out there!<br/>\n<br/>\nTuldayen Grimblade<br/>\n38th Season Ranger of Tunare<br/>\nTerris-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
