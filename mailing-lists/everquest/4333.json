","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1022435590\">&quot;Expect the servers to be very unstable for at least a day, sometimes takes <br/>\na week to get the servers to stay up more than a few hours after a launch <br/>\nday...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat would explain why I was repeatedly disconnected last night. It was <br/>\ngetting extremely annoying. It didn&#39;t even occur to me that not only were <br/>\nthe servers unstable after the new expansion, but that there were probably a <br/>\nmillion people playing with their new Froglok characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of Frogloks, I have seen many that were already in their 20s, and <br/>\nit was the first day. I can only imagine how long those people have been <br/>\nplaying yesterday... probably hours and hours on end. It&#39;s amazing that they <br/>\ndon&#39;t have anything to do on a Monday of all days.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not have the expansion yet. I might have mentioned this, but I am <br/>\nunfortunately using dial up, and the download would have taken more than 6 <br/>\nhours. Therefore, I am waiting until the expansion hits stores in a week or <br/>\nso and purchasing it that way. I can&#39;t wait to use the new features, such as <br/>\nthe map. That was an excellent idea and will definitely make traveling much <br/>\neasier.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note, does anyone know anything about the new creatures that you <br/>\nmay purchase for riding, such as a horse? Are they more expensive than <br/>\nhorses? I have wanted a horse for the longest time, but I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s <br/>\ntough to make money... especially being a caster. When grouped, the melee <br/>\ntypes loot the corpses before I can get to them usually.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s all from me for now. Take care everyone and enjoy the new expansion!<br/>\n<br/>\n-= Mippon - Level 40 Halfling Druid =-<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nTired of spam?
