I&#39;ve been playing Everquest on line for one night and part of a <br/>\n&gt; day now. I fell off of the bridge once. I got killed by a young rock <br/>\n&gt; hopper. I&#39;m having fun but I&#39;m still looking for Registrar Bindarah. <br/>\n&gt; Will somebody please give me more detailed directions that the npcs <br/>\n&gt; in the game are providing? The velvet on my poor feet is wearing <br/>\n&gt; out. ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m running a female tiger-like Shaman. I&#39;ve also noticed that some <br/>\n&gt; of the characters seem to be walking through walls. That&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; interesting but it&#39;s very puzzling. G.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Edward<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Due to launch of a new expansion on Feb 24th, don&#39;t even try to play on <br/>\nMonday until evening at least.  Expect the servers to be very unstable <br/>\nfor at least a day, sometimes takes a week to get the servers to stay up <br/>\nmore than a few hours after a launch day.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring your extended downtime, check out eqtraders.com look for the <br/>\nquests link on the left side of the page.  You need info on the Vah Shir <br/>\ncitizen quest, the Vah Shir Shaman quest and what ever progressive <br/>\ntradeskill quest that shaman do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you got the new expansion, it&#39;s a downloadable thing, you&#39;ll have a <br/>\nmap available of Shar Vahl on the map icon.  If not, or if you find that <br/>\na bit confusing, eqatlas.com has excellent maps for many zones including <br/>\nShar Vahl.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll find that you are very poor, Shar Vahl and Shadeweaver is not a <br/>\nvery good place to make money. Go to the Bazaar, buy a traders satchel <br/>\nfrom Merchant Tekrema and set up as a trader. Some things to keep and <br/>\nsell to players instead of merchants:  High Quality rockhopper hides- <br/>\nsell them for no less than 20 platinum(pp), don&#39;t worry about price <br/>\ngouging the tailors you sell to WILL make money on buying from you for <br/>\n20, sometimes the tailors will pay more.  Other quality Rockhopper <br/>\nhides- check if others are for sale and price accordingly. Shadeling <br/>\nsilks or Shade silks - check price on these, sometimes can go as much as <br/>\n5pp each.  Bone chips from the annoying grimling skeletons in the pit <br/>\ncan be sold to players too, might not move as fast as other stuff, I <br/>\nusually ask 1pp each for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t have Planes of Power to get you to the Bazaar easily, you <br/>\ncan sneak through Paludal Caverns, all Vah Shir get Sneak skill at <br/>\nbirth, it&#39;s possible but hard, I&#39;ll give more detailed instructions on <br/>\nthat if you really need it.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
