Xp there<br/>\nis good up till at least 51. At about I think say 48 or 49 you could<br/>\nprobably solo the HG pretty well.  My 53 Shammy was there not long ago and<br/>\nthe HG were more green than Light Blue by then but the Cash is great and you<br/>\ncan go to the inn and there is a short guy in the hut closest toward HG<br/>\nvalley who is on the left as you enter the hut that if you buy a stack of or<br/>\n2 or three of amber  (cost about 42pp pr stack with a Charisma of 140) and<br/>\nresell back to him will get rid of the smaller coins tremendously and yield<br/>\nyou a return of around 39 to 40pp per stack..  I&#39;ve done this many a time<br/>\nwhen ever I needed to get cash up for my tradeskills supplies.<br/>\n<br/>\nKwasi<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Wulfric Rennison&quot; &lt;wulftech@...&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I&#39;ve been playing my rogue consistently now since last Thursday.  I&#39;ve<br/>\ngone up 4 levels.  I&#39;m almost to level 37 now.  Still in Dawnshroud Peaks.<br/>\nBut I guess I&#39;m getting too impatient.  XP isn&#39;t coming nearly as fast as<br/>\nI&#39;d like.  I can pretty much solo lightcrawlers and some shrooms now. The<br/>\ntribals I can take if I have buffs, but that&#39;s about it.  I&#39;m getting really<br/>\ntired of Dawnshroud.  Anybody have any suggestions on where I can go next<br/>\nthat the xp might come a little faster?  I was told Dreadlands, but I should<br/>\nwait until I&#39;m about level 38.  A place with some nice plat would be good<br/>\ntoo as I need to start upgrading my weapons and armor.  I need a better bow<br/>\nand some + stamina gear.  Any suggestions on what gear I could get or where<br/>\nI could hunt?<br/>\n<br/>\nWulfric Rennison<br/>\n36 Half Elf Rogue<br/>\nCazic Thule server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.463 / Virus Database: 262 - Release Date: 3/17/2003 </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
