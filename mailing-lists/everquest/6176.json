Once you do that if you left-click (?) on the spellbook icon it will bring up a little window where you can save your spellsets. I had to redo all of mine as well. The same goes for hotbuttons, you will have to recreate all of those as well. <br><br>The servers are bieng merged mostly due to the amount of players on each one. I was originally on Sol Ro and now on Bristlebane and on Sol Ro there were very few players there before the merge.
