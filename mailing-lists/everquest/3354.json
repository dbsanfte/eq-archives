In case you thought the auto download should have grabbed it <br/>\nwith last patch, no such luck. Had to use advanced and do a thorough <br/>\nsearch to get the files. Took only 1.5 hrs., but that was with nobody <br/>\ndisturbing the machine during download.<br/>\n<br/>\nI liked the look of the entry area of the zone. Judging by the number <br/>\nof various bodies around the entrance portal marker, I would <br/>\nrecommend invisible for any travelers with even the sleightest doubt <br/>\nabout faction.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe zone looked nice, and a quick track scan indicated a nice variety <br/>\nof quarry ranging from dark blue to red for level 33. Rolling hills, <br/>\nsparse woods, lots of big boulders which may hide mobs. Looked open <br/>\nenough for kiting, but even near the entry point the mobs were <br/>\nvisible and fairly thick. <br/>\n<br/>\nI got a bit of lag, but I need to defrag and tune a bit before I know <br/>\njust how to handle the zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarto Proudfoot</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
