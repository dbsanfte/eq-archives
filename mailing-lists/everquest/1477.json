I do not like to twink my characters I think the\n<br>fun is in earning what you get not being given to you by others. So I was\n<br>just interested in how others made $ in EQ(i.e.. selling things, helping\n<br>higher level PC, etc...) &nbsp;It has been nice to see others in the same\n<br>position thanks for &nbsp;the responses</blockquote></span></blockquote></font><font COLOR=\"#000000\" SIZE=\"3\" FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\">\n<br></font><font COLOR=\"#000000\" SIZE=\"2\" FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\">\n<br>\n<br></font><font COLOR=\"#000000\" SIZE=\"3\" FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\"><b><i>\n<br></i></b></font></font></html>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
