Some people are thick \nheaded and enjoy invincible ignorance.&nbsp; EQ2 was in development for a LONG \ntime.&nbsp; And even the OPEN beta that most of us were in on was in the very \nlast 3 months of the testing.&nbsp; It was in beta for much longer before \nthat.&nbsp; A lot of the things you mentioned were in the beta test when I tried \nit - the instanced zones, the quest system, the class system, the spells.&nbsp; \nNone of that stuff came along a week before it went live as you say.&nbsp; That \nstuff was around and in development even before I started playing the \nbeta.&nbsp; So if you liked EQ before the Luclin expansion, I suggest you \nuninstall all the expansion packs and just keep Kunark and Velious.&nbsp; Go \nback to the old way and see how much you&#39;re missing out on.&nbsp; Or hey, even \nbetter idea, develop your own damn game the way you want it and stop wasting \nyour time with EQ.&nbsp; No, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re here because you enjoy hearing \nother people&#39;s opinions of the game; I think you are here to feed trolls.&nbsp; \n</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Wulfric</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"PADDING-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"naslund19@...\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:naslund19@...\">ej</a> \n  </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Wednesday, December 08, 2004 12:59 \n  PM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> Re: [EverQuest] Re: Regular \n  EQ</div>\n  <div><br></div><tt>Wulfric Rennison wrote:<br>&gt;

It&#39;s not like there is a ton a mail that \n  clogs my inbox.<br><br>&gt; I don&#39;t believe your argument that EQ2 was rushed \n  either. <br><br>Whether you want to believe it or not, it was \n  rushed.&nbsp;&nbsp; WoW beta was <br>twice as long as the EQ2 beta and EQ came \n  out 2 weeks earlier.<br><br>&gt; Considering<br>&gt; there was word of EQ2 in \n  development long before there was ever a <br>&gt; release date set, \n  considering the game was in closed beta for months <br>&gt; before we ever got \n  a peek at it, considering it was in open beta for <br>&gt; several months \n  BEFORE it went live, AND considering the release date was <br>&gt; even pushed \n  back so tha tit came out later than it was supposed to, I <br>&gt; seriously \n  have a hard time believing it ws a rush job.<br><br>They didn&#39;t even put in \n  class spells until a week before release.&nbsp; How <br>on earth do you \n  balance and test the classes with only a week of <br>testing, after the game \n  has already gone Gold?&nbsp; They basically reworked <br>the entire class \n  system a week before the game went live without any <br>player testing.&nbsp; \n  That doesn&#39;t sound rushed to you?<br><br>Instancing zones was rushed because \n  they suddenly realized that they <br>couldn&#39;t handle player traffic in their \n  zones.<br><br>The quest system was added later in development, almost as an \n  <br>afterthought because, I guess, WoW had one that people were fawning over \n  <br>so SoE needed one.<br><br>They still haven&#39;t figured out how to make nice \n  graphics that don&#39;t need <br>a supercomputer to run.&nbsp; Guild Wars has \n  great graphics (just as good, if <br>not better than EQ2), and well made \n  player models that don&#39;t take high <br>end video cards to run well.&nbsp; And \n  GW is still in Beta.<br><br>They continue to run with the model that slow \n  leveling equals a challenge.<br><br>&gt; And apparently you don&#39;t know \n  anything about business.&nbsp; It would seem to <br>&gt; me that to be \n  competitive in the market place you have to take into <br>&gt; account things \n  like the release of other games and holidays and so on.&nbsp; <br>&gt; Let&#39;s \n  face it, Sony Online Entertainment is a profiteering company.&nbsp; <br>&gt; \n  they want to make money just like the rest of us.&nbsp; If they have to cut a \n  <br>&gt; few edges to get the product out in manner to be more competitive \n  with <br>&gt; other companies, then that&#39;s what they have to do.&nbsp; Since \n  the game is an <br>&gt; ongoing development, they can always add the stuff \n  after the fact. <br><br>No, they did it because they were worried that no one \n  would buy their <br>product after playing WoW.<br><br>&gt; As far as I&#39;m \n  concerned they did a damn good job with EQ2 and I think <br>&gt; they will \n  continue to do a damn good job with it.&nbsp; EQ2 had far more <br>&gt; \n  content to it than Lineage II did when L2 was released. <br><br>Lineage 2 was \n  a piece of garbage.&nbsp; If that is your benchmark, then there <br>isn&#39;t a \n  MMORPG around that doesn&#39;t get high marks.&nbsp; Hell, the Knight <br>Online \n  beta was better than Lineage 2 retail and KO was pretty crappy.<br><br>&gt; \n  Besides, SOE is only adding the stuff that people are asking for anyway, \n  <br>&gt; so if we don&#39;t like it, we can&#39;t complain cause we&#39;re the ones who \n  asked <br>&gt; for it. <br><br>Maybe you want some of this stuff, but there \n  are a lot more people out <br>there playing games that don&#39;t want pulls handed \n  to them or knowing that <br>a mob is underconned or overconned.&nbsp; Or don&#39;t \n  want flagging for <br>mid-level content.&nbsp; Or don&#39;t want to have to buy a \n  $300 video card to <br>have decent graphics.<br><br>&gt; If you really don&#39;t \n  enjoy the game, then why are you here?&nbsp; <br><br>Because I&#39;m interested in \n  hearing people&#39;s opinions about games.&nbsp; I&#39;m <br>sorry if you can&#39;t accept \n  the fact that some/many people don&#39;t have <br>ultra glowing reviews of \n  EQ2.<br><br>&gt; This list is <br>&gt; supposed to be for people that like \n  EverQuest and want to see it grow, <br>&gt; not for people who are going to \n  argue every single little nitpicky thing <br>&gt; wrong with the game or SOE. \n  <br><br>If you think the problems that people have with the game are \n  &quot;nitpicky&quot;, <br>you are mistaken.<br><br>EQ was a great game, until probably \n  Luclin (which was, I believe, the <br>first &quot;SoE expansion&quot;).&nbsp;&nbsp; The \n  &quot;moon&quot; was always buggy and most of the <br>features never really worked \n  well.&nbsp; Was the Hollowshade Moor &quot;war&quot; ever <br>fixed to work \n  correctly?&nbsp; The high end Luclin game was poorly <br>implemented into a \n  massive timesink.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From there it just went downhill <br>(LDON \n  was good for casual players for a time, but it was far too little <br>and too \n  late to save most server populations and guilds after PoP came <br>out.)&nbsp; \n  It doesn&#39;t seem to be that SoE has learned much from their <br>previous \n  titles.<br></tt><br><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><br></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
