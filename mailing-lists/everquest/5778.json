But there are some great <br/>\nbenefits if you start getting really serious about the game.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I love the forums there!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, Su &lt;suceress@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I personally have found that getting a premium account with <br/>\nAllakhazam has been far more useful than any guides.<br/>\n&gt; If you&#39;re going to spend money, why not spend it on allakhazam <br/>\ninstead of buying a guide.<br/>\n&gt; Although free guides would be ideal.<br/>\n&gt; Oh, if any new members have messages pending, I apologize as yahoo <br/>\nwill not let me approve or reject them at the moment.
