It&#39;s not like there is a ton a mail that clogs my inbox.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t believe your argument that EQ2 was rushed either. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Whether you want to believe it or not, it was rushed.   WoW beta was <br/>\ntwice as long as the EQ2 beta and EQ came out 2 weeks earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; Considering<br/>\n&gt; there was word of EQ2 in development long before there was ever a <br/>\n&gt; release date set, considering the game was in closed beta for months <br/>\n&gt; before we ever got a peek at it, considering it was in open beta for <br/>\n&gt; several months BEFORE it went live, AND considering the release date was <br/>\n&gt; even pushed back so tha tit came out later than it was supposed to, I <br/>\n&gt; seriously have a hard time believing it ws a rush job.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They didn&#39;t even put in class spells until a week before release.  How <br/>\non earth do you balance and test the classes with only a week of <br/>\ntesting, after the game has already gone Gold?  They basically reworked <br/>\nthe entire class system a week before the game went live without any <br/>\nplayer testing.  That doesn&#39;t sound rushed to you?<br/>\n<br/>\nInstancing zones was rushed because they suddenly realized that they <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t handle player traffic in their zones.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe quest system was added later in development, almost as an <br/>\nafterthought because, I guess, WoW had one that people were fawning over <br/>\nso SoE needed one.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey still haven&#39;t figured out how to make nice graphics that don&#39;t need <br/>\na supercomputer to run.  Guild Wars has great graphics (just as good, if <br/>\nnot better than EQ2), and well made player models that don&#39;t take high <br/>\nend video cards to run well.  And GW is still in Beta.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey continue to run with the model that slow leveling equals a challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And apparently you don&#39;t know anything about business.  It would seem to <br/>\n&gt; me that to be competitive in the market place you have to take into <br/>\n&gt; account things like the release of other games and holidays and so on.  <br/>\n&gt; Let&#39;s face it, Sony Online Entertainment is a profiteering company.  <br/>\n&gt; they want to make money just like the rest of us.  If they have to cut a <br/>\n&gt; few edges to get the product out in manner to be more competitive with <br/>\n&gt; other companies, then that&#39;s what they have to do.  Since the game is an <br/>\n&gt; ongoing development, they can always add the stuff after the fact. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, they did it because they were worried that no one would buy their <br/>\nproduct after playing WoW.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As far as I&#39;m concerned they did a damn good job with EQ2 and I think <br/>\n&gt; they will continue to do a damn good job with it.  EQ2 had far more <br/>\n&gt; content to it than Lineage II did when L2 was released. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lineage 2 was a piece of garbage.  If that is your benchmark, then there <br/>\nisn&#39;t a MMORPG around that doesn&#39;t get high marks.  Hell, the Knight <br/>\nOnline beta was better than Lineage 2 retail and KO was pretty crappy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Besides, SOE is only adding the stuff that people are asking for anyway, <br/>\n&gt; so if we don&#39;t like it, we can&#39;t complain cause we&#39;re the ones who asked <br/>\n&gt; for it. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe you want some of this stuff, but there are a lot more people out <br/>\nthere playing games that don&#39;t want pulls handed to them or knowing that <br/>\na mob is underconned or overconned.  Or don&#39;t want flagging for <br/>\nmid-level content.  Or don&#39;t want to have to buy a $300 video card to <br/>\nhave decent graphics.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you really don&#39;t enjoy the game, then why are you here?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Because I&#39;m interested in hearing people&#39;s opinions about games.  I&#39;m <br/>\nsorry if you can&#39;t accept the fact that some/many people don&#39;t have <br/>\nultra glowing reviews of EQ2.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This list is <br/>\n&gt; supposed to be for people that like EverQuest and want to see it grow, <br/>\n&gt; not for people who are going to argue every single little nitpicky thing <br/>\n&gt; wrong with the game or SOE. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you think the problems that people have with the game are &quot;nitpicky&quot;, <br/>\nyou are mistaken.<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ was a great game, until probably Luclin (which was, I believe, the <br/>\nfirst &quot;SoE expansion&quot;).   The &quot;moon&quot; was always buggy and most of the <br/>\nfeatures never really worked well.  Was the Hollowshade Moor &quot;war&quot; ever <br/>\nfixed to work correctly?  The high end Luclin game was poorly <br/>\nimplemented into a massive timesink.    From there it just went downhill <br/>\n(LDON was good for casual players for a time, but it was far too little <br/>\nand too late to save most server populations and guilds after PoP came <br/>\nout.)  It doesn&#39;t seem to be that SoE has learned much from their <br/>\nprevious titles.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
