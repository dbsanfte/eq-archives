A few days ago, my hubby was having fun<br/>\nwith some guildmates when POOF! the guild was no more.  Took some<br/>\nfiguring out but apparently the person that originally started the<br/>\nguild and was tagged as the &#39;owner&#39; wanted to make a new guild but was<br/>\nunable because she was still listed as owning Circle of Majik.  She<br/>\nhad been forced out of the guild about a year ago because of her<br/>\nthievery and lying.  She was unwelcome with the current leadership of<br/>\nGawabiwa and could not get control except by force.  She went to<br/>\nVerant and had her leader powers reinstated then promptly dropped<br/>\neveryone out of the guild without any kind of warning.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a dirty underhanded thing to do!  She didn&#39;t have to drop<br/>\neveryone! or even anyone!  She could have come in and told everyone<br/>\nbefore hand, instead she had to yank it out from under us.  It hurt us<br/>\nto the core, but Gawabiwa has built a close knit guild and we are not<br/>\nour name.  We will rebuild our guild and get ourselves back on track.<br/>\n We won&#39;t be having anything to do with whatever guild she has whether<br/>\ncalled Circle of Majik or not.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have lots of support too.
