I&#39;m having some trouble and need advice on the following:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1.) I am &quot;solo&quot;-ing bandits in Western Karana for the xp and<br/>\n&gt; sashes.  I am pulling one or two at time and most con white or dark<br/>\n&gt; blue to me.  The problem is the bandit casters that con dark blue<br/>\n&gt; are kicking my butt.  Any Advice?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2.) I am trying to procure a perfect quality bear skin for the cape<br/>\n&gt; quest.  I took about 25 brown and grizzly bears last night, and<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t get a single one.  Any advice on which drops them more<br/>\n&gt; frequently or how rare they are?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3.) Finally, what are there yellow and red cons that I may be able<br/>\n&gt; to take down at this level?  I am extremely anxious to reach the<br/>\n&gt; 15th season and get my dual wield.  I have pretty decent gear<br/>\n&gt; courtesy of my guild-mates.  Any pointers would be great.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; P.S.  I am particularly interested in taking down the werewolf that<br/>\n&gt; roams WK.  He&#39;s snuck up on me and offed me 3 times now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you in advance,<br/>\n&gt; Jaxun<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at http://www.everquest.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
