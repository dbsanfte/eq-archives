That&#39;s where I got both of mine.  There is a bandit camp in G-Fay and I killed exactly two bandits and got the golden bandit tooth.  So now it&#39;s down to the Orc Fibulas.  I need 2 of them.  One of the legplates, one for the tunic.  From what I hear these drop off Orc Slavers in the cave in Crushbone.  My ranger is level 10 and I&#39;ve had no trouble acquiring any of these items.  The Orc Slavers con yellow to me at 10.  I can kill them with help.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Airbourne Ranger<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n__________________________________________________________\r<br/>\nSign-up for your own FREE Personalized E-mail at Mail.com\r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\">http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
