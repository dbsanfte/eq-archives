He was seeking a tailor to make the new 100% weight \n  reduction <br>bags.<br><br>I told him I was a level 80 tailor, and level 70 \n  smith. After not <br>finding anyone better, he and I went to the Vale Forge to \n  try to make <br>the Vale Sewing Kit I would need. As getting parts for this \n  kit <br>happens to be my present goal, I was delighted.<br><br>He had parts \n  for five tries. In five tries I failed five times, but <br>gained three \n  levels. Not bad for me, but unfortunate for my new <br>friend.<br><br>I gained \n  also in learning how to get my hq metal bits. I have been <br>seeking the ore, \n  but he suggested reverse-engineering fine steel <br>weapons. He said a fs \n  weapon, flask of water, and chisel can break <br>down the fs weapon to the \n  component parts. <br><br>He suggested Hill Giants in Raith Mountains as a good \n  source of fs <br>weapons to work with. I am nearly leveled enough for that \n  adventure, <br>and so I may direct my efforts to leveling a bit so I may \n  follow this <br>advice.<br><br>Anyone know of other good hunting which nets \n  fine steel drops? I <br>expect that my quest to make my Vale Sewing Kit will \n  raise my <br>experience and my smithing levels quite nicely.<br><br>And about \n  reverse engineering. Anyone know much about this? For <br>example, I looted a \n  chainmail tunic in Permafrost, but it was too <br>large for my alts to use. \n  However, if I could break it down into <br>parts and remake it with the \n  correct pattern for a small character, I <br>could come out ahead. Any idea if \n  this works?<br><br>Barto Proudfoot<br><br></tt><br><tt>Visit the EverQuest \n  homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!
