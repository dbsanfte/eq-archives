(If you don&#39;t know <br/>\nthe joke, you soon will!) Anyway, As mentioned before, definitely go <br/>\nthrough the tutorial. You will get a nice little charm that has some <br/>\ndecent stats for new toons. Also depending on your class you can get a <br/>\nspell. I know that Rangers get Salve (which as far as I know is the ONLY <br/>\nplace to get it.) Since you are new and Mel you&#39;ve came back and are <br/>\nfairly new, I would avoid messing with LDoN, LoK, & OOW for right now. <br/>\nAs also mentioned those are for higher levels plus they have new <br/>\nfeatures and advancements that only higher levels can use. Don&#39;t worry, <br/>\nyou will have PLENTY of time to learn all about that stuff! They did add <br/>\nsome cool stuff however such as armor and weapons that you can get <br/>\nthrough places like the Bazaar and really nice people giving you things! <br/>\nIf you missed the Halloween fun I&#39;m sorry, it was kind of fun. They had <br/>\na skeletal army appear after dark. They dropped some decent stuff, <br/>\n(great newbie twink gear!), and the opportunity to lvl up some of your <br/>\ntoons was good too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing former D&D players then you will have a decent understanding of <br/>\nhow the stats work. They are pretty similar from what I can tell. <br/>\nResearch your class and race preferably before you create your toon. <br/>\nPlacing your bonus points correctly will really help. If you already <br/>\ncreated a toon, don&#39;t worry, you can always make up for it with gear. I <br/>\nhad to do that with my first. LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally just keep in mind that there is so much to do and learn in this <br/>\ngame that you will be kept busy for a very long time! Ignore the rude <br/>\njerks and just have fun! I play on Solusek Ro server so if you happen to <br/>\nbe on there look up either Durgaa, Pistashio, Boarr, or Shizney. That&#39;s <br/>\nme and I would be glad to help you guys out in any way!<br/>\n<br/>\nLater!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
