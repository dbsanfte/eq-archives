I&#39;m totally confused?  Some starnger sees you on the street - he can <br/>\nsee<br/>\nyour Boots, your Cloak, your jewelry, your hat.  Do you run away from<br/>\neveryone who looks at you in the real world?  Someone walking into my house<br/>\nand checking out my CD collection would be rude as hell I agree, but in EQ <br/>\nwe<br/>\nhave no homes, so we keep all our possessions in the bank and in item slots<br/>\nand containers.  NO ONE CAN SEE THESE!!! As it should be.  I am dumfounded<br/>\nthat people in EQ are upset that people can see what they have ON THIER<br/>\nBODIES.<br/>\n<br/>\nWizaro Wrathcaster<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
