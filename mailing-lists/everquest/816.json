It is totally an issue of realism<br/>\n&gt; to me.  Is it not realistic <br/>\n&gt; that when someone looks at you, they can see<br/>\n&gt; what type of boots you have, <br/>\n&gt; what necklace you are wearing, what rings are<br/>\n&gt; on your fingers?  WHAT&quot;S THE <br/>\n&gt; BIG DEAL!!!!!!!!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Because EQ&#39;s graphic design does not make any<br/>\n&gt; distinguishing differences <br/>\n&gt; visually for most items, including almost ALL<br/>\n&gt; jewelry - the inspect command <br/>\n&gt; just seems to me to be a less than perfect way<br/>\n&gt; of looking at people.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just like in the real world, you may meet<br/>\n&gt; someone, they see an interesting <br/>\n&gt; looking item on your neck, they simply ask<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Wow, nice necklace - where did <br/>\n&gt; you get it?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You can choose to ignore them, lie, or tell the<br/>\n&gt; truth.  JUST like in EQ.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now in real life, no one can see what&#39;s in your<br/>\n&gt; pockets, or your backpack, or <br/>\n&gt; other container items, and NEITHER can they in<br/>\n&gt; EQ.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The fact that they only get a name of an item<br/>\n&gt; and not it&#39;s stats is also <br/>\n&gt; realistic.  Just like in real life they can see<br/>\n&gt; your clothes and jewelry and <br/>\n&gt; not see the brand name.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lighten up folks :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wizaro Wrathcaster<br/>\n&gt; 40th level Follower of the Wizard Fire God<br/>\n&gt; Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====<br/>\n* Selene *<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n&quot;All my life I&#39;ve told people that they can live without the gods...
