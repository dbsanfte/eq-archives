I get<br/>\n&gt; inspected constantly by lowbies<br/>\n&gt; and I inspect/am inspected by people my level<br/>\n&gt; all the time.  It in no way<br/>\n&gt; bothers me, and if it does, it just shows<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re getting into the game a<br/>\n&gt; little too much.  The only time this should<br/>\n&gt; ever make you feel uneasy is if<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re on a PvP server because they&#39;re scoping<br/>\n&gt; for your items to see if they<br/>\n&gt; should kill you usually.  If this honestly<br/>\n&gt; bothers you, I would imagine you<br/>\n&gt; the type of person who is claustrophobic or who<br/>\n&gt; gets upset if someone bumps<br/>\n&gt; into you in the subway or something along those<br/>\n&gt; lines.  Eventually, you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; take it with an air of pride must likely,<br/>\n&gt; because it&#39;s usually just newbies<br/>\n&gt; gawking over your equipment.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I find it kind of rude for people to be<br/>\n&gt; snooping<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in other peoples stuff! Is &#39;inspect&#39; a<br/>\n&gt; totally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; accepted thing, or is there some sort of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ettiquette that goes along with it? I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; mind<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so much if I&#39;ve been chatting with someone<br/>\n&gt; for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; little while and they take a peek [it&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have anything good to hide!] but when<br/>\n&gt; people<br/>\n&gt; &gt; come right up to you, snoop, and then don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; even<br/>\n&gt; &gt; respond when you say &#39;Hail&#39; , I find that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; extremely annoying.
