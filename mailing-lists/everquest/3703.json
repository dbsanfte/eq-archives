My <br/>\n </span></blockquote>guild is quickly growing,  and starting to do Higher <br/>\nlevel raids.  Many of our members have not had much <br/>\nexperience raiding, so we have been doing &quot;training&quot; <br/>\nraids.  We are still having people not listening, and <br/>\nending up causing TPW&#39;s.  If any of you have any Guids <br/>\nto raiding,  and/or rules that your guild has,  please <br/>\nsend them to me so I can design something tailored to my <br/>\nguild.<br/>\n-----------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would help a bit knowing what you are trying to raid <br/>\nand what rules you have nw to begin with.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, it helps to have clearly defined goals and <br/>\nloot rules for each raid you are going to do.  There is <br/>\nnothing more frustrating than going on a raid with a <br/>\ngroup that doesn&#39;t know what they are doing or doesn&#39;t <br/>\nlook like they know what they are doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also important to have a raid channel set up for <br/>\njust the Raid Leader, officers, and any group leaders.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also important that you stress that raiding ISN&#39;T <br/>\nabout getting XP, it&#39;s about accomplishing a goal <br/>\n(whether that is killing one single mob, farming for <br/>\narmor and weapons, etc..)  No one should expect to get <br/>\nany XP during a raid (in fact, some people should expect <br/>\nto lose it) and groups shouldn&#39;t be created to allow <br/>\npeople to get XP (I lost a full yellow of XP on my first <br/>\nFear raid after we had trouble breaking the zone).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the actual fighting, NOONE should attack any mob <br/>\nuntil your Main Tank calls for an assist.  Make sure you <br/>\nMT has a very clear assist call.  This is probably the <br/>\nsingle most important point you can stress on any raid.  <br/>\nThe MT should be the only person that shouold be taking <br/>\nany direct damage from the mobs on the raid (except for <br/>\nenc while they are mezzing or charming any adds)....that <br/>\nincludes casters too.  The only exceptions would be <br/>\nshammys and enc debuffing and slowing the mobs while the <br/>\nMT is gaining aggro (and even then, it&#39;s the RL call <br/>\nwhen those groups should be doing their stuff.....you <br/>\ndon&#39;t want a mob &quot;ping ponging&quot; between those casters <br/>\nwhile the MT is getting aggro).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest reason why raids fail is people not <br/>\nlistening.  One person can kill a raid very quickly.  <br/>\nPeople need to have defined roles on a raid and know <br/>\nwhen to use them.  And the RL needs to tell each player <br/>\nwhat is role is.  Dont expect people to know what you <br/>\nwant them to do, tell them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSulamwen<br/>\nOutrider of &lt;Fate&#39;s Forge&gt;<br/>\nE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
