You won&#39;t have to med/sit to 50% just to get in<br/>\none kill.<br/>\nLearn the right time to die. Remember, after death you come back full health<br/>\nand mana. Very little if any exp lost on death from level 1-5. Your supplied<br/>\nfood and water on death the first few levels, atleast you use to.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you played the game a while, you get bored at times and do different<br/>\nthings. I have raced when new servers come up to see who could get to level<br/>\n10 the fastest. I have power leveled and have been power leveled a lot.<br/>\nRecently took my brothers Iksar monk from level 1 - 46 just out boredom over<br/>\nthe past holidays. ( it is really unbelievable how much Iksar can regen with<br/>\nthe right gear and regrowth ). If you have played the game, and know how it<br/>\nworks, I see nothing wrong with PLing. Mater of fact, I can find it very<br/>\ngratifying, exciting and fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh well, if this is your first character, strongly urge you not to some of<br/>\nthe things listed above, but that&#39;s not you asked.<br/>\n<br/>\nSistily<br/>\n60 Gnome Warlord<br/>\nand many other characters<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\tFrom:\tRob LeBeau [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rlebeau65@...\">rlebeau65@...</a>]<br/>\n\tSent:\tTuesday, January 15, 2002 10:53 AM<br/>\n\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n\tSubject:\t[EverQuest] Leveling when new<br/>\n<br/>\n\tTrying to keep discussions alive........<br/>\n\tWhat is a good way to level up fast.   Meaning, I see<br/>\n\tpeople say things like I can get from level 3-6 in<br/>\n\taround an hour.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWell, the other day, I was on 5 hours and just leveled<br/>\n\tonce.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs a Newbie should we venture to more hostile grounds<br/>\n\twith others to level?  Should we go to the same types<br/>\n\tof places as a group but not form a group so I can<br/>\n\tlevel faster?  Or just stay in the newbie area until<br/>\n\twe get there?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEnough for now<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLater all helpfuls.....<br/>\n<br/>\n\t__________________________________________________<br/>\n\tDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\n\tSend FREE video emails in Yahoo!
