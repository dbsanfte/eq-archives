I am currently in the cable company.. they are doing <br/>\n1-10mb per minute.. manage to download WHOLE EQ, took up 2.741gig <br/>\n(somehow eq resize most sounds from GoD from a bigger files to <br/>\nsmaller ones, perhaps to ease the lag).. EQ full install with patch, <br/>\ngoes down from 2.79 to 2.74gig..<br/>\n<br/>\nAll&#39;s well but this time not ends well.. as those files downloaded <br/>\nusing patch, didnt shown the date.. I mean the eqfeartintros.pak <br/>\nshown it as a feb 2004 files, some like ldonequip file shown as a <br/>\n2003 files.. so, our initial plan to JUST copy the 76/150mb file to <br/>\nONE cd has become moot, as we do NOT know which files had been d/led <br/>\nby the patch (GRR should had just carry my PC with my harddisk along, <br/>\nbut the cable staff was saying that my pc might not have network lan <br/>\ncard)..<br/>\n<br/>\nShort version is.. from network pc no 12 to transfer to pc no 1 that <br/>\nhas burning cd drive.. I had to separate the EQ folder that has <br/>\n2.74gig files into 5/6 separate folders and then transfer EACH of <br/>\nthat folder to pc no 1 so that Nero could read and then burn every <br/>\none of that disc. Currently transferring folder no 1 to pc no 1 and <br/>\nit took roughly 30min for 600+mb.. estimation time of finish would be <br/>\n3-6 hours and the thought of going back to my home and bringing my pc <br/>\nback to the cable center then do the 2 hours round trip, not counting <br/>\nthe downloading time that might took 4 hours then.. then..<br/>\n<br/>\nGRR another frustated hobbit..</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
