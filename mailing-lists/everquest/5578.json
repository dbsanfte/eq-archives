All I can suggest to<br/>\nyou is to keep more on top of your statements. If you were strapped<br/>\nfor cash, you can&#39;t afford not to.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways - a suggestion for others to avoid this situation with their<br/>\naccounts:<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can always check the station about your account status. Any time<br/>\nyou make any changes in the game regarding billing I would go right<br/>\nthere to be sure the changes are taking place.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also print out that you have successfully cancelled your<br/>\naccount.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that, the first month they continue to bill you call customer<br/>\nservice and tell them that you had cancelled your account, you have a<br/>\nprintout of confirmation, and that you were charged again. And that<br/>\nyou would like a refund of your money.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso some billing systems are a little slow, if you plan on<br/>\ncancelling your account I would suggest doing it right after your<br/>\nlast payment - that way you have one month to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion if you want to cancel EQ - or any recurring charge to<br/>\nyour credit card:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Cancel the account online as normal.<br/>\n2. If there is another option online to verify - go there and verify<br/>\nyour account has cancelled.<br/>\n3. Wait approximately 3 buisness days and then call the customer<br/>\nservice and ask for confirmation that your account has been<br/>\ncancelled. If not tell them what you did and that it did not work and<br/>\nyou want your account cancelled.<br/>\n4. Past that you may need to contact the better buisness beauru if<br/>\nyou continue to have problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wordless_wolf&quot; <br/>\n&lt;wordless_wolf@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I subscribed to Everquest for a while, but had to cancel because I <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t have enough money to continue. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; After I cancelled my subscription, I continued to get charged for 6 <br/>\n&gt; months afterwards.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just thought I should let people know what they&#39;re dealing with. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
