Hulse] I guess AC was a bad term to use,<br/>\n&gt; Mostly I was wanting<br/>\n&gt; to know about clothing other than the cheap crap,<br/>\n&gt; cloth stuff. I was<br/>\n&gt; wondering mostly about leather goods. For example, I<br/>\n&gt; found soft wicker<br/>\n&gt; legging in Ak&#39;anon but I&#39;m afraid to buy them<br/>\n&gt; because I&#39;ll just waste<br/>\n&gt; money I can use on other things like spells. I was<br/>\n&gt; just hoping for a<br/>\n&gt; little better protection other than cloth. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks though! ;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message: 14<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 18 Jul 2002 21:13:29 -0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;bigmaca3&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bigmaca3@...\">bigmaca3@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Clothing or armor for a Mage<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There a lot of newbie armor quests out there now.  I<br/>\n&gt; heard the <br/>\n&gt; Gnomes armor were going to be in the next patch. <br/>\n&gt; You might check the <br/>\n&gt; Arcane Order Armor quests in Qeynos, or the similar<br/>\n&gt; ones in <br/>\n&gt; Freeport.  These all have minor stats on them, but<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re better <br/>\n&gt; than cloth and sometimes even raw silk.  You are<br/>\n&gt; well above the level <br/>\n&gt; range for them so they should be easy to get.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tuldayen Grimblade<br/>\n&gt; 38th Season Ranger of Tunare<br/>\n&gt; Terris-Thule<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Steven R.

I found the Orcs<br/>\n&gt; love to pick on the little guys! Yesterday I was<br/>\n&gt; playing my new warrior<br/>\n&gt; Gnome and went to Orc hill and man I was even there<br/>\n&gt; yet and already had<br/>\n&gt; 3 of them on my butt! I got creamed but it was fun<br/>\n&gt; though!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message: 15<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 18 Jul 2002 21:15:55 -0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;bigmaca3&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bigmaca3@...\">bigmaca3@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Magician stuff<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; /help pet will bring up all the pet commands.
