Labyrinth  Prolly the first<br/>\nfloor or the pit there will be good at 52.  I was in a group at the tent<br/>\nthere with my then 50 SK but it was only cause the guy leading the group<br/>\nwanted me to level up higher and we had a 60 pally, 59 Cleric and 60 chanter<br/>\nin group.  If you have Luclin then try getting a group in Maiden&#39;s Eye<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: Su<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ok now that my cleric is lvl 52, I&#39;m trying to find a good place to hunt<br/>\nto<br/>\n  get xp. Also, are there any parts of my epic that I can do out of order.<br/>\n  Like can I kill some mob in nagafen&#39;s lair or such without doing the other<br/>\n  parts first? Or does the king something or other.. whatever it is there..<br/>\n  does it have to be triggered by the quest to spawn? I&#39;m worried that I<br/>\nwill<br/>\n  hit one of those zones where if you are over 52 you will be banished to<br/>\nzone<br/>\n  beginning so I want to do what I can while lower lvl and then do the<br/>\nhigher<br/>\n  lvl stuff once I&#39;ve gone up more.<br/>\n  Any suggestions?<br/>\n  luv,<br/>\n  -Su </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
