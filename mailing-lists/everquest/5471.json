I&#39;m one<br/>\nof those newbies.  Started about three weeks ago, role playing as<br/>\nQaidyanye, (still a 1st level High Elf-Paly) on the Brell Serilis<br/>\nserver.<br/>\n<br/>\nHey there Peg,<br/>\nThat mail quest you found is a quick way to get some money in the game, its<br/>\nnot much, but every gold helps when your just starting out.  You should have<br/>\nrecieved a letter when you told him you would deliever the mail, but if it<br/>\nhad vanished then my question would be did you put it in your inventory or<br/>\ndid you forget and had it in hand (on the cursor) when you got to the ZL<br/>\n(zoneline) from Felwithe to GFay (Greater Faydark.)  If so then thats where<br/>\nyou lost it as things you have not put in the inventory tend to vanish after<br/>\nzoning (going from one zone to another.)  That book thing you clicked on was<br/>\na portal to the Planes of Knowledge, a zone where the people who reside<br/>\nthere gather knowledge and focus on learning.  Its also an area where lots<br/>\nof people gather to get information, buffs (spells cast on them that greatly<br/>\nimprove their fighting and survival abilities,) and do some selling or<br/>\nbuying.  Once you enter the Plane of Knowledge (often referred to as PoK)<br/>\nyou should be facing the port stone that leads back where you cam from.<br/>\nOften the name of the town nearest the stone is written on it.  As there are<br/>\nusually around 100+ (on Saryn at least) people in this zone the talking can<br/>\nbe fast so you need to be fast at reading, as for the abbreviations, that<br/>\ntakes a while to get used to them all.  As for backpacks to open them you<br/>\nright-click on them once to open them, easy enough.  If you had no room for<br/>\nthe items then they fell to the ground and you&#39;d have to pick them up before<br/>\nanyone else does.  I&#39;ve seen people lose items to a nearby guard whe grabbed<br/>\nit when it dropped.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that all i can say is keep playing and try to watch what goes on<br/>\naround you, lots of people will be glad to help you understand these things<br/>\nand welcome to EQ(Everquest.)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
