I never saw any<br/>\n&gt; lag on my system <br/>\n&gt; pre-Luclin.  It&#39;s only when they souped up the game<br/>\n&gt; engine for better <br/>\n&gt; graphics that my system started lagging.  Thus the<br/>\n&gt; upgrade to more <br/>\n&gt; RAM and a better video card.  Now I run on a cable<br/>\n&gt; modem.  There&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; virtually no lag on zones that existed prior to<br/>\n&gt; Luclin.  There is <br/>\n&gt; still lag on Luclin, but I can turn the clip plane<br/>\n&gt; down to nil and <br/>\n&gt; turn off spell effects (which are annoying anyway)<br/>\n&gt; and get almost no <br/>\n&gt; lag at all.   However, same system specs with a 64MB<br/>\n&gt; video card and  <br/>\n&gt; was getting major lag in Bazaar.  Now it&#39;s pretty<br/>\n&gt; smoothe.  I plan on <br/>\n&gt; upgrading the processor to a 1Ghz or better next<br/>\n&gt; month so I am sure <br/>\n&gt; even Bazaar will be fine.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I still contend that a higher end video card can<br/>\n&gt; compensate for a <br/>\n&gt; low end processor.  But when you&#39;ve got both<br/>\n&gt; together, EQ should be <br/>\n&gt; flawless.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Wulfric/Raido/Celric/Shifu/Sandahl/Savawulf/Ramsen<br/>\n&gt;         Cazic <br/>\n&gt; Thule Server<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Pseudowulf        The Seventh Hammer Server<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kenjite/Petrus        Tunare Server<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Airbourne            E&#39;ci Server<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   From: Melanie Johnson <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Sent: Wednesday, January 08, 2003 11:34 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: Re: [EverQuest] Re: video cards<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I&#39;m also running Win ME with 384 megs of ram.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s slowing down <br/>\n&gt; now, due to the fact that my processor is just a<br/>\n&gt; Celeron 400 and is 3 <br/>\n&gt; years old (time for an upgrade) but ME has done<br/>\n&gt; fine.
