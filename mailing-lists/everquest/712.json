I hate the standing in line for a camp shit, what&#39;s the adventure about that? Although new zones are coming and the update that is due in march will HOPEFULLY boost this game to new levels, I am hoping for an entirely new continent, a few new races/classes, perhaps a better graphics engine, enhanced quest system etc etc, and a bundle of new features, perhaps even mounts for traveling etc.. They have alot of time to work on this upgrade and since they aren&#39;t doing a really great job at keeping the running game up to date I pray that they are spending all efforts on the upgrade.. We shall wait and see.. Meanwhile I am going to play my character slow and easy like I have from the start, I might not reach level 50 until it&#39;s time for the upgrade but all the better, I won&#39;t be bored with the game too soon.. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Avron -<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: William Orent &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:will8155@...\">will8155@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, October 27, 1999 9:39 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EverQuest] Fed up with EQ - any ideas??<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: William Orent &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:will8155@...\">will8155@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When you&#39;re looking at EQ you have to realize something, its part of the first<br/>\n&gt; in a long line of games to come. EQ, AC, and UO were pretty much the first in<br/>\n&gt; this genre, and like that will very soon not fit the players needs. As the<br/>\n&gt; people play more and more, they expect more and more from the game. Coney Island<br/>\n&gt; was originally a huge attraction because of its many many lights, however, the<br/>\n&gt; people began demanding more and more. EQ, UO, and AC in this genre you could<br/>\n&gt; relate pretty much to doom in the 1st person shooter genre. Things will only<br/>\n&gt; build from here, as the players demand more and more, the companies will produce<br/>\n&gt; bigger and better games trying to fit the players demands. Am I saying that EQ<br/>\n&gt; is no longer worth playing, no. EQ is a really great game, and despite the<br/>\n&gt; debate as to whether the changes within it are good or bad, it still attracts<br/>\n&gt; many people. However, EQ is a dying game, I personally do not intend to give up<br/>\n&gt; on it because it satisfies my needs in gaming for now, however the companies,<br/>\n&gt; seeing that this is a very good market will keep releasing bigger and better<br/>\n&gt; games. I imagine there to be a flood of titles coming in, and within a year or<br/>\n&gt; so, one of them will fight its way to the top, such as half life, or unreal in<br/>\n&gt; the 1st person shooter genre. EQ isn&#39;t any worse then when people first started<br/>\n&gt; playing and loved it. The thing is that the players demands are increasing more<br/>\n&gt; and more, and EQ is striving to keep up. The only question is, how long can it<br/>\n&gt; last?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
