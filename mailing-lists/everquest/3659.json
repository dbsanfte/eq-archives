The maps are free to view, download, or print out. They are not in a zip file or anything like that, you will need to download/print them page by page.  It&#39;s been around for quite awhile and the maps are very well done. You can find it at www.eqatlas.com <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVerant has now released a new atlas in book form. It is called EverQuest Atlas. I&#39;ve heard some people aren&#39;t happy with the name, but what else would they call it? It&#39;s an atlas.....for EQ. &lt;shrug&gt; I havn&#39;t seen it so don&#39;t have a clue to how detailed it is, nor will I probably buy it, as I have pretty much printed out every single map from the above website. Not to mention the fact that after being in a zone a few times, I pretty much have the entire general layout in my head.<br/>\nAnyway, that is the one that is available for purchase. You can find out more info about it at the Sony Station store: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://store.station.sony.com/hardgood.jsp?SKU=EQ1RE-HG-SG1002-EQATLS-MPCD1\">https://store.station.sony.com/hardgood.jsp?SKU=EQ1RE-HG-SG1002-EQATLS-MPCD1</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRob C.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;m a little confused. Is there a website where you<br/>\n&gt; can buy the Muse EQ<br/>\n&gt; Atlas? Or is it free to download? I only want the<br/>\n&gt; best!<br/>\n&gt; Sincerely,<br/>\n&gt; Deidre<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________________________<br/>\nYour favorite stores, helpful shopping tools and great gift ideas.
