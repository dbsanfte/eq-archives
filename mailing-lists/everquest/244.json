Areas with complex buildings seem to chop the system till it places it into memory and from then on it seems slick.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I love this game..  hehe <br/>\n<br/>\n    -----Original Message----- <br/>\n    From: Lary, William [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WLary@...\">WLary@...</a>] <br/>\n    Sent: Friday, May 07, 1999 2:11 PM <br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@onelist.com\">EverQuest@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n    Subject: Re: [EverQuest] zoning <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    From: &quot;Lary, William&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WLary@...\">WLary@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    here is another interesting part, after i zone i usually notice <br/>\n    that my HD is stiill processing info, i have control of my character <br/>\n    but for about 10-15 additional seconds, sometimes as little as 5 seconds <br/>\n    after i regain control of my character after a zone, <br/>\n      when i turn or start to move there is this &quot;processing lag&quot; dont know <br/>\n    what else to call it but i think THIS is when you receive the info   <br/>\n    regarding <br/>\n    other players etc in the zone. for it does seem to take longer to get <br/>\n    out of this post zone (processing lag)-jerky movents etc when there <br/>\n    are lots of players)pcs) etc as opposed when their are very few.  PCs <br/>\n    creating more lag  would seem logical for most NPCs dont have lots of   <br/>\n    items with various stats, and or skills, etc speech trade skills etc to   <br/>\n    have to load into memory as PCs do, unless someone can pretty much prove   <br/>\n    to me that NPCs and PCs should have no effect, i will have to conclude   <br/>\n    that my observation is correct, <br/>\n    Doublestar <br/>\n<br/>\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>\n    Join the Star Wars craze! <br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> <br/>\n    Set up your Star Wars list at ONElist. <br/>\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>\n    Visit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
