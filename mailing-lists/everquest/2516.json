Karana worshippers get<br/>\n&gt; access to cheap crafted WIS earrings (4wis, 2sta,<br/>\n&gt; some<br/>\n&gt; AC and neg STR if I remeber correct) but followers<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; Tunare get access to an easy quest that provides a<br/>\n&gt; necklace with unlimited charges of the lowest level<br/>\n&gt; root spell. (clickable effect, very sweet)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; (even a last name should i EVER get that far..lol)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve got the last name dillema with my main and<br/>\n&gt; alt...<br/>\n&gt; ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Not sure what server i will play on yet but....my<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; KARANA!!! (30 seconds of server pride :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;question is, is there anywhere i can read about<br/>\n&gt; what<br/>\n&gt; &gt;should do first as a new character and yadda,<br/>\n&gt; yadda,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, for someone just getting used to the game, as<br/>\n&gt; much fun as it can be to stray a little, the obvious<br/>\n&gt; path is usually the best bet. For the first ten<br/>\n&gt; levels<br/>\n&gt; or so it doesn&#39;t really matter where you start, GFay<br/>\n&gt; is fine, most of my characters grew up there.<br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; a lot of idiots to deal with, but it&#39;s good practice<br/>\n&gt; for zones like LOIO and Unrest later. ;) Aside from<br/>\n&gt; that i&#39;ve grown to quite like the Commonlands.<br/>\n&gt; Catching a TP to WC and running to Freeport is<br/>\n&gt; pretty<br/>\n&gt; easily done, in EC/WC you&#39;ll be hunting bears and<br/>\n&gt; spiders. Both of which drop tailoring components<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; sell relatively well. (Hiqh Quality Bear Skins sell<br/>\n&gt; for 30pp, and stacks of 20 Spider Silks about 15pp)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;yadda....See the problem with my boyfriend being<br/>\n&gt; &gt;experienced in the game is that he did it ALL for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;me, or led me around by the collar doing it all for<br/>\n&gt; me<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s the basics for you. For the first few levels,<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ll mostly just run around and whack bugs with a<br/>\n&gt; club. Try to raise your One Hand Blunt and One Hand<br/>\n&gt; Slashing skills (using scimitars for the latter).<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; a very long term consideration, but if you ever do<br/>\n&gt; reach lvl 50+, you&#39;ll want to quest for your Epic, a<br/>\n&gt; scimitar.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Once you start getting a little more mana to work<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; and a few more spells, you can start practicing a<br/>\n&gt; technique called Kiting. (you can start doing it<br/>\n&gt; really effectively as soon as you can cast Spirit of<br/>\n&gt; the Wolf) Kiting is casting Snare on a single<br/>\n&gt; monster,<br/>\n&gt; having SoW on yourself already, then running away a<br/>\n&gt; distance, cast a DD spell, run a little more, cast a<br/>\n&gt; spell, repeat until the monster is dead. Ideally you<br/>\n&gt; want to keep the MOB at the very edge of your<br/>\n&gt; casting<br/>\n&gt; range, at very least far enough that they can&#39;t hit<br/>\n&gt; you. Using that technique you can kill yellows and<br/>\n&gt; even in some cases monsters that barely con red. (do<br/>\n&gt; your research on eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com before<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; even DREAM of attacking a red conning monster)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; :-P...i want to do this on my own and have no idea<br/>\n&gt; &gt; where to start...Do i just jump out there and<br/>\n&gt; start<br/>\n&gt; &gt; killing critters or run around and hope i can find<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my way back from wherever i leave??  i know i<br/>\n&gt; sound<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Very early on (lvl 4 if memory serves) you get a<br/>\n&gt; spell<br/>\n&gt; called Gate. Once you have that, you can always<br/>\n&gt; teleport back to where you&#39;re bound. (the spot where<br/>\n&gt; you go to when you die) If you&#39;re a Wood Elf, that<br/>\n&gt; will be near Newbie Lift in Kelethin, if you travel<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; Freeport try to get a bind near the Eastern Gate.<br/>\n&gt; (pretty common request) Once you get your next round<br/>\n&gt; of spells (again memory is foggy but I believe level<br/>\n&gt; 9) you get a spell called Bind Affinity, which<br/>\n&gt; allows<br/>\n&gt; you to change your bind point to wherever you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; standing. It&#39;s your best friend to keep from getting<br/>\n&gt; lost, you can just wander at random and gate back to<br/>\n&gt; safety whenever you need. Plus Gate is your panic<br/>\n&gt; button, when you see MOBs you can&#39;t handle, you can<br/>\n&gt; always run away a bit and gate. (preferably with<br/>\n&gt; snare<br/>\n&gt; on them and SoW on you to buy a bit more time)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; foolish but it is really important to do this on<br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; own..how else can one really learn??  Help is<br/>\n&gt; great<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Read. Constantly. Try these sites:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; allakhazam.com<br/>\n&gt; eqvault.ign.com<br/>\n&gt; eq.castersrealm.com<br/>\n&gt; eqatlas.com<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are plenty of other sites, those are the best<br/>\n&gt; ones i&#39;ve come across though. (thesafehouse.org is<br/>\n&gt; amazing for rogues, but not a lot of general<br/>\n&gt; information there)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you want to travel to a new zone, do a little<br/>\n&gt; research. EQ Atlas is great for that, you can get a<br/>\n&gt; map of any zone in the game, and there&#39;s a link to<br/>\n&gt; allakhazam.com&#39;s beastiary, so you can find out what<br/>\n&gt; mobs you will find there and what to avoid.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;and i really do appreciate it but i also want to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;feel like i have accomplished something<br/>\n&gt; &gt;personally...Does that make sense...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Totally, got several friends who were in similar<br/>\n&gt; positions. I just hope your BF isn&#39;t the controlling<br/>\n&gt; type. :/ Seen a few nasty situations where BF&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; start<br/>\n&gt; getting jealous of their GF&#39;s achievements...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Find, Connect, Date! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://personals.yahoo.ca\">http://personals.yahoo.ca</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
