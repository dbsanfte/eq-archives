To make it easy for you you&#39;ll probably want to choose a good race that&#39;s accepted pretty much everywhere and start in a central city like Freeport and Qeynos so it&#39;ll be easy to find your way around at first. It could easily be debated which is better to start... a caster or non-caster, that&#39;s entirely up to you. I like casters. And pretty much all servers are the same. If you have friends who play find out what server they are on so they can help you in game. Otherwise, look up anybody on this mailing list online and we&#39;ll be happy to help you I think. Good luck.
