It is totally an issue of realism to me.  Is it not realistic <br/>\nthat when someone looks at you, they can see what type of boots you have, <br/>\nwhat necklace you are wearing, what rings are on your fingers?  WHAT&quot;S THE <br/>\nBIG DEAL!!!!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause EQ&#39;s graphic design does not make any distinguishing differences <br/>\nvisually for most items, including almost ALL jewelry - the inspect command <br/>\njust seems to me to be a less than perfect way of looking at people.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust like in the real world, you may meet someone, they see an interesting <br/>\nlooking item on your neck, they simply ask &quot;Wow, nice necklace - where did <br/>\nyou get it?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can choose to ignore them, lie, or tell the truth.  JUST like in EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow in real life, no one can see what&#39;s in your pockets, or your backpack, or <br/>\nother container items, and NEITHER can they in EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that they only get a name of an item and not it&#39;s stats is also <br/>\nrealistic.  Just like in real life they can see your clothes and jewelry and <br/>\nnot see the brand name.<br/>\n<br/>\nLighten up folks :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWizaro Wrathcaster<br/>\n40th level Follower of the Wizard Fire God Solusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
