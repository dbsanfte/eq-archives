Just like the previous poster<br/>\nsaid, pretend this low level character has a rich uncle. Usually when you<br/>\nsee a low level character in level 50 gear, they have already played this<br/>\ngame to level 50+ when one of their other characters and then outfit their<br/>\nnew character with equipment they received with their main character. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go around inspecting lower level players, you are going to find A LOT<br/>\nof people with great gear better than yours. I guess you&#39;re in for a sad EQ<br/>\nlife, or atleast until you understand this and get over your sadness or you<br/>\nobtain some great gear for yourself. <br/>\n<br/>\nBuy low, sell high and go buy your own uber gear.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n\tFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LeSamLam@...\">LeSamLam@...</a> [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LeSamLam@...\">LeSamLam@...</a>]<br/>\n\tSent:\tWednesday, May 23, 2001 9:23 AM<br/>\n\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EverQuest@yahoogroups.com\">EverQuest@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n\tSubject:\tRe: [EverQuest] money problem<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI&#39;m not a core roleplayer.  And it&#39;s still sad to me to see a lower<br/>\nlevel <br/>\n\twith better stuff than me.  I&#39;ll get it one day so I&#39;m not envious.<br/>\nI just <br/>\n\thate to see it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLena<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&lt;&lt; It isnt sad, its real life. These things happen every day, both<br/>\nin-game and<br/>\n\t outside. If you are a core roleplayer just think of it as he had a<br/>\nrich<br/>\n\t uncle. If not well, you would do it yourself if you had a chance.<br/>\nSimply<br/>\n\t nothing to moan about.<br/>\n\t <br/>\n\t Envy wont help you one bit. Most likely hes gone through the &quot;i<br/>\nkilled 2000<br/>\n\t rats and then 2000 orc pawns&quot; with another character and its not<br/>\nappealing<br/>\n\t to do it again.<br/>\n\t <br/>\n\t /Alex &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tVisit the EverQuest homepage at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everquest.com\">http://www.everquest.com</a><br/>\n\t <br/>\n<br/>\n\tYour use of Yahoo!
