I grouped for the first time ever in the <br/>\ncamp in the Northern end of Paludal Caverns. I had no idea what to <br/>\ndo so I kept everybody healed. My character is a level 23 shaman. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen I was told that I should be giving everybody dex buffs instead. <br/>\nSo I did. I told everyone that to tell me when they needed more <br/>\nbuffing. Then, after a while, I was told about something called a <br/>\ngropu channel and that I ought to click &quot;say&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that I gathered that while watching text scroll up and off my <br/>\nscreen faster than I could read it. Everytime that a mob bealched, I <br/>\ngot a line of text. Things were very lively.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m level 24 now. I figured out that right clicking the dialog bar <br/>\nwill pull a box that will let me filter out everything but group <br/>\nchat using group-say.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow is a shaman important to a group? What does the group need most <br/>\nfrom the shaman? What is a shaman expected to know?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy character is Gunli on the Luclin server.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
