She<br/>\nshould hit 34 today!  Joined a great guild, Mithril Empire, and am<br/>\nhaving a blast with what I hope becomes a new in-game romance (just<br/>\nstarting, but he DID kiss me).  I&#39;ve been at odds since my partner of 4<br/>\nmos. left EQ entirely and had a bad spate with my DE necromancer.  I<br/>\nthink I&#39;m going to kill her and take all her good int stuff and twink a<br/>\nnewbie enchantress with it someday.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy primary alt at the moment is a young Bard who I&#39;m having fun making<br/>\nlambent armor for (though the wood elf helm looks like a bright blue<br/>\nbucket with ears).  She has a twin brother cleric who has to work hard<br/>\nto keep her in line because she&#39;s basically a brat &lt;giggles&gt;.  I&#39;m<br/>\nloving bard though and it may be the next class I commit to.  I have<br/>\nplayed all classes now except monk, enchanter, and rogue.  No desire for<br/>\nmonk and rogue, actually.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best part of hitting the 30s is that it&#39;s as high as I&#39;ve ever been<br/>\nso I&#39;m getting to explore new areas.  Note:  do not attempt Kedge Keep<br/>\nusing enduring breath until you don&#39;t have to look at your book to<br/>\nmeditate.  Boy we drown FAST!  My favorite prey at the moment are<br/>\ngiants.  I can&#39;t solo them but with a small group when the zones aren&#39;t<br/>\ncrowded, they are a blast.  I joke about breaking their toes with my<br/>\ntiny hammer making it harder for them to run because I do insignifant<br/>\ndamage compred to my high 30s groupmates.  Still, something about<br/>\nkilling that Sand Giant that ate you for breakfast every morning in the<br/>\noasis is SOOOOO satisfying.<br/>\n<br/>\nIceiallana Forestfury<br/>\nDruid of the 33rd circle<br/>\nBrell Serilis<br/>\n<br/>\nChristina Norman wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Christina Norman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tina@...\">tina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This list has grown pretty quiet, and that&#39;s ok.  I thought I&#39;d send<br/>\n&gt; an<br/>\n&gt; innocent &#39;hi&#39; to the list though and see what everyone has been up to<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; EQ lately?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I recently became an apprentice guide and I&#39;ve been having a lot of<br/>\n&gt; fun<br/>\n&gt; with that.

In a way I miss the simpler dungeons, since plane and dragon<br/>\n&gt; raids are usually always lengthy undertakings, and 90% of the time you<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; just sit around waiting for the next fight to happen.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I started a baby magician on Luclin mostly to visit a close friend who<br/>\n&gt; has<br/>\n&gt; moved there.
