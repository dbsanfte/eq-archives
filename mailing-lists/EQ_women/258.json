That would seem to be the sensible server on which to try this, so<br/>\nno one is directly advantaged from previous connections on an old server.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of a city, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary to have an official guild<br/>\ncity.  It may be useful however to have an unofficial city, so that those<br/>\nof us who wish to group while newbies can choose to group in that city.<br/>\nI&#39;d personally recommend Kelethin/Felwithe.  My experience has been this<br/>\nis one of the best newbie zones, and one of the best social zones.<br/>\nButcherblock, Lesser Faydark, Unrest, and Crushbone also offer a great<br/>\nrange of close by zones to adventure in.  Really I think almost any newbie<br/>\nzone would suffice, there are great places to adventure everywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally plan on playing either a High Elf or Human Cleric or<br/>\nEnchanter (can&#39;t quite choose!)  I also plan on being either a blacksmith<br/>\nor a jeweler, and will do my best to provide either armor or jewlery at a<br/>\nlow cost to my guildmates.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, 20 Jul 1999, Beth wrote:<br/>\n&gt; From: Beth &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jaguar@...\">jaguar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Me too. But that is the question, we need to decide server and city.<br/>\n&gt; Perhaps the server with the highest levels could watch out over the<br/>\n&gt; people joining that server?
