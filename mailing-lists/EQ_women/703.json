They have new rules: trivial loot, race/class/deity alignments<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; prohibit grouping and guilding with non aligned players, language barriers<br/>\n&gt; (no<br/>\n&gt; common tongue at all), everyone is ROLEPLAY ON, and only one character is<br/>\n&gt; allowed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I played it the last two nights and had a BLAST!  Everyone in Everfrost<br/>\n&gt; (never<br/>\n&gt; did play Shaman past 9 before) was roleplaying.  I hear that wasn&#39;t the<br/>\ncase<br/>\n&gt; in GFay and Qeynos but that the RP&#39;ers were pretty strong and insistent<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; the spam quieted down.  The chars will be wiped out once the server goes<br/>\n&gt; live,<br/>\n&gt; but I kind of like Katrice and will probably keep her.  I love the Shaman<br/>\n&gt; potions they can make now :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A few powergamers have decided to come to FV to see how the new rules<br/>\naffect<br/>\n&gt; people, and as long as they don&#39;t uber guild the server and camp the<br/>\ndragons<br/>\n&gt; and make the high end game SUCK I don&#39;t mind.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, the rumor is the server goes live the day DAoC is released.  I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; planning on getting DAoC, but I may just not cancel my EQ account quite<br/>\nyet.<br/>\n&gt; AO, on the other hand, BIG YAWN!  Made it to 10 and quitting.  Good try,<br/>\nbut<br/>\n&gt; the game is just too buggy *sigh*.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ice<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get free e-mail and a permanent address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amexmail.com/?A=1\">http://www.amexmail.com/?A=1</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
