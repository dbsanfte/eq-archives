I spent 18 levels being a Cleric<br/>\nand 5 being a Shaman so far. I was always frustrated with my<br/>\nlimitations as a Cleric and took on way too much responsibility for<br/>\nother people&#39;s lives, which made grouping a very un-fun experience. I<br/>\nlove being a Shaman so far. ( I&#39;ve made 2 new characters in Quellios.<br/>\nBloodless and Blacksatin) Go ahead and laugh at the names, it&#39;s the<br/>\nbest I can do on such short notice! I agonized believe me. Someone even<br/>\ncalled me &quot;campy&quot;!- whatever that means. I&#39;m only 25, that term&#39;s<br/>\nbefore my time. <br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;ve played on that server for a total of 3 days and have<br/>\nnoticed, not just me - also complete strangers, that most people on<br/>\nthat server are really helpfull and nice. Or maybe just the people in<br/>\nHalas as that&#39;s the only town I&#39;ve been in. I encourage you guys to try<br/>\nit out as I have been so happy. I don&#39;t die constantly and I don&#39;t have<br/>\nto sit out the action all the time. I get to actually participate as a<br/>\npart of the group instead of staring at my spellbook all the time with<br/>\nnothing to do but chat. Not that chatting is at all bad, but I want to<br/>\nhave some fun too!<br/>\nI have noticed that a lot of us have said that we play clerics, it<br/>\nseems more than any other class. (Or maybe I only notice the clerics<br/>\nbecause I play one.)I hope this doesn&#39;t offend you all, but I wonder if<br/>\nwe have chosen to play one because we are by nature nurturing and<br/>\nhelpfull, or because we have been raised in our society to act servile<br/>\nto men. (I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve raised a few hackles-sorry!) It bothered me that<br/>\nI would be one of the only women in rl playing a female character in<br/>\nany given group and I would be forced to sit and heal all the male<br/>\nwarriors. I grew resentfull. I&#39;m wondering if many of you have done the<br/>\nsame thing, or if this just says a lot about me. <br/>\nThanks! :)<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
