Rather anyone else solve the<br/>\nproblem of being dropped from the game? I am often dropped from the game to<br/>\nmy desktop, still connected to the internet. Sometimes it&#39;s easier to play<br/>\nearly in the morning, but anything after 10 am has gotten impossible. I<br/>\nreally want to play too. :-(  I&#39;ve been through all the customer service<br/>\nfolks and their last suggestion is maybe a new modem.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else solved this problem? I have been playing on the pvp server<br/>\nand now that I have a few things, this problem makes it too dangerous to<br/>\nplay. I hope someone can help.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
