I thought <br/>\nI might ask if you would welcome a man, such as myself, to participate. <br/>\nIn my travels of the lands of Norrath, it often seems the women I <br/>\nencounter are much more likely to have the wit and intelligence for a <br/>\ngood conversation. So, ladies, might I participate, or am I invading your <br/>\nsanctuary away from us uncouth men? I certainly would not be offended if <br/>\nyou would prefer that I depart.<br/>\n<br/>\nI await your decision, ladies.<br/>\n<br/>\nIustus<br/>\nKnight of the Holy Order of Mithaniel Marr<br/>\nTarrew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n[ooc: just let me know and I will remove myself from this list]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
