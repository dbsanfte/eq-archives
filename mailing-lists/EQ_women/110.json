I am a 24 year old female from New Jersey who will be married in Oct.  I am a Everquest addict.  I was wondering how many here also play on Xeqony?  Also, I play a druid her name is Renaya, I just leveled to 12.  Does anyone here have helpful hints for where there is good hunting for druids?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMelly</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
