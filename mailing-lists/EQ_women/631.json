It was a<br/>\nvery exciting moment for me. I am still to this day<br/>\namazed at the lands I&#39;m just beginning to explore and<br/>\nthe creatures that I&#39;m just now &quot;old&quot; enough to kill.<br/>\nI never have a difficult time finding a group nor does<br/>\nmy level 50 Ranger fiancee. The game is really a lot<br/>\nabout networking. Very much like the real world. At<br/>\nhigher levels you will go into a zone and say &quot;Hello<br/>\nKarnors Castle&quot; (for example) and half the castle will<br/>\nholler back &quot;Hello Lily!&quot;. I never thought I would<br/>\nhave so many friends and acquaintances. To me that&#39;s<br/>\nwhat EQ is about. The people I&#39;ve met and the good<br/>\ntimes I&#39;ve had with them. I don&#39;t see EQ ending for me<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s not only a game. These folks are my<br/>\nfriends. Just to let you know I am able to balance EQ<br/>\nand RL. I have a full time job and a family that lives<br/>\nclose by and I even clean my house! :-) I&#39;m 38 years<br/>\nold and I&#39;ve found something that keeps me young at<br/>\nheart.

Life as I<br/>\n&gt; knew it is over;  My time is now divided into EQ,<br/>\n&gt; and all that other stuff I have to take care of<br/>\n&gt; before I get back to EQ.  ^_^   This will wear off<br/>\n&gt; as the snow melts I hope, but now I understand why<br/>\n&gt; they call it &quot;Evercrack.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m so new I squeak (just hit 5th level with my<br/>\n&gt; druid and monk last night), but one of the main<br/>\n&gt; attractions to me right now is exploration.  (I<br/>\n&gt; guess I&#39;m still in the gee whiz stage ^_^)  I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know how the game will appear to me once I run out<br/>\n&gt; of places to explore.  I&#39;m going to try trades as<br/>\n&gt; well, and that will add another dimension, but I<br/>\n&gt; think at some point Verant may have to offer<br/>\n&gt; something new to keep the longer term players<br/>\n&gt; involved.  Expansion packs will fill the need for<br/>\n&gt; now, but eventually an overhaul of the graphics and<br/>\n&gt; terrain of the original world should be considered. <br/>\n&gt; That might refresh things for people a bit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; All this is, of course, in my extremely humble,<br/>\n&gt; low-level, can&#39;t-even-run-my-scared<br/>\n&gt; little-newbie-past-West Commons opinion.  ^_^  Who<br/>\n&gt; know what I&#39;ll be thinking when I&#39;m a veteran.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; cheers!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Patti<br/>\n&gt; Wuvian - level 5 (!)

At what point do your non-eq women friends<br/>\n&gt; start rebelling now that conversations invariably<br/>\n&gt; turn to the interesting and new way you found to die<br/>\n&gt; last night?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have been playing EQ since the day it came out.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Still addicted. hehehe.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Got Diablo2 and that swayed me a little but not for<br/>\n&gt; long<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Rosalind<br/>\n&gt; Soril level 33 Druid Tunare server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Elizabeth Adams wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I just wondered how long the shelf life of EQ is?<br/>\n&gt; I have played since <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 24 August 2000, and I tend to feel that I could<br/>\n&gt; carry on playing for <br/>\n&gt; &gt; around a year, so long as I could get groups. EQ<br/>\n&gt; does not strike me <br/>\n&gt; &gt; as a game I could easily play casually though, so<br/>\n&gt; I probably wouldn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; &gt; play fewer hours per week over a longer period.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think the decisive factor would be in-game; it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; a miserable <br/>\n&gt; &gt; occupation if you can&#39;t play as part of a group,<br/>\n&gt; so if it comes to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the point where my ranger cannot get into groups,<br/>\n&gt; it will probably be <br/>\n&gt; &gt; time to move on. I suppose I might try another<br/>\n&gt; class, but I am not <br/>\n&gt; &gt; that interested in doing so.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Liz xx<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; aka Gyngermynx, ranger of the 32nd season,<br/>\n&gt; Quellious<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; ATTACHMENT part 2 application/ms-tnef <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
