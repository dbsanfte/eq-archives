My husband<br/>\nand oldest daughter (12) also play.  We love to play to together, and since<br/>\nwe do have two computers, at least two of us play every day.  Now that<br/>\nschool is out my daughter is doing great and making some wonderful friends<br/>\nin Norrath. My main character is a level 15 dark elf Cleric named Kilanna on<br/>\nVeeshan. I also have  a high elf, wood elf, human, and I want to make a<br/>\ngnome.<br/>\nAs far as the on line romance thing, I tend to concentrate more on having<br/>\nfun and being as helpful to as many people as I can.  I have made wonderful<br/>\nfriends.  I am not a huge flirt but it happens &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>\nI love to group with all kinds of people and see where it leads me.<br/>\nI love reading the list and look forward to it now everyday!

I am fairly<br/>\n&gt; new to online roleplaying but I&#39;ve been addicted to many computer RPGs in<br/>\n&gt; the past. So, I&#39;m still working on developing Ardynn as a character. (It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; been tough, with all those orcs chasing me all the time!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have a question for those of you who are getting &quot;married&quot; online, or<br/>\n&gt; have gotten married online in the past. Do any of you have offline<br/>\n&gt; boyfriends (or husbands)? If so, do they mind if you have an online<br/>\n&gt; significant other?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Alison<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; p.s.
