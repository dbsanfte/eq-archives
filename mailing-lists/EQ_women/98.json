I lost more good stuff (sentimental, usually) and had my house<br/>\ncompletely trashed to bugs twice.  That was what I thought I had to look forward to when I started playing on the PvP EQ server.  Not so!  Races seem to stick together, and usually you only PK your mortal enemies (okay, so we dark elves make an exception for those filthy humans). I also have never been killed in my own zone, as higher levels have come running to rescue<br/>\nme.  AND in the ooc comments, anyone who talks about missing the fun of pkilling low levels gets strongly castigated and/or ostracized.<br/>\n<br/>\nI DO think it would be fun to start an all-woman army.............any takersa? =P<br/>\nSara, Povar<br/>\nValdaya, Rallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:truffle@...\">truffle@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:truffle@...\">truffle@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve never played PvP on EQ.  I have too many sad memories of having my character on Ultima Online killed by dweebs who were just doing it to be mean.  When EQ came out, I was very glad there was a non PvP option.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve head little snippets about PvP in the game that suggest that it isn&#39;t just a killing spree.  I&#39;d be interested in knowing from people who are actually there, how mature and how restrained is player killing in PvP? Do people go like jackles after anyone who is weak? Is it impossible to build up any decent equipment because people will try and kill you to take it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You all may have heard that a Race Wars server is in development.  This will basicly be a PvP server with four teams:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Team 1:<br/>\n&gt;   Humans, Barbarians, Erudites<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Team 2:<br/>\n&gt;   Dark Elves, Trolls, Ogres<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Team 3:<br/>\n&gt;   Gnomes, Halflings, Dwarves<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Team 4:<br/>\n&gt;   High Elves, Wood Elves, Half Elves<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyone may PvP anyone who is not on their team.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This seems like an interestign approach to me, since it gives some structure to PvP, and allows you to identify people who will not PvP you.  I wish there fewer, larger, teams though 8)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve considered playing on this server when it comes out.  I suspect I&#39;ll play a cleric because I haven&#39;t played a cleric seriously yet, and a cleric seem to be very useful potentially in healing the group in a PvP situation.  Another possibility would be a Shaman (another class I haven&#39;t played).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any insight from you PvP girls out there would be appreciated 8)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Christina<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Get free personalized email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.iname.com\">http://www.iname.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking for a new hobby?
