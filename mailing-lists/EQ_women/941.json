I assumed you had found something durring your <br/>\nsearch..  i have an eq friend...  his wife played as well...  she ended up <br/>\nmeeting men on the game and it led to affairs irl and eventually a <br/>\ndivorce...  he got the best revenge of course...  guessed her password and <br/>\nstole her beloved main character lol...  i think she deserved it.  if you <br/>\nfind your &quot;snooping&quot; to be disturbing i&#39;m not going to argue with you.  <br/>\ncertainly after the revalation that she had done nothing wrong.  now about <br/>\ngame talk being &quot;insipid dribble&quot;...  what would you prefer people to talk <br/>\nabout while playing the game?  sex???  you didnt seem happy when she was <br/>\nshowing concern for your happiness to her &quot;guildies&quot;.  OH by the way, those <br/>\nblips and flickering lights on the screen represent real living people.  we <br/>\nare the people they represent...  WE are everquest.  dont expect a <br/>\nsympathetic ear from me when you complain to me about the effect people like <br/>\nme have had on your life.  if i feel badly about anything, i feel for your <br/>\nfinancial situation, although it&#39;s not my fault (and dont blame everquest... <br/>\n  your WIFE made the decision to quit her job (and a poor decision it was) <br/>\nguns dont kill people, criminals with guns kill people)  i really pity you.  <br/>\nyou say she&#39;s getting better?  GOOD!!!!  Quit making your daughter cry by <br/>\nobsessing over &quot;mommy&#39;s eq&quot;.  Go on with your life and try as hard as she <br/>\nis!!!  If i were your wife i would have left you for a sane man a long time <br/>\nago...  of course if i were your wife i would probably be just as insane and <br/>\ndo things like quitting jobs to play video games and sleeping on the couch <br/>\nuntil noon...  there&#39;s plenty more opinions where this came from if you care <br/>\nto take offense instead of advice from what i&#39;ve said.  just dont expect to <br/>\nchange my mind by repeating yourself.  i&#39;ve heard how bad your life was.  <br/>\nlife tends to suck from time to time.  that&#39;s what makes these happy times <br/>\nso darn good.  you say life is good now.
