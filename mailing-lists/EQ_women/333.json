(got married July 1st) and<br/>\n&gt; my husband and I met on meridian59 two years ago and are extremely<br/>\n&gt; happy! Only problem is that we only have one computer, so we don&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt; a chance to explore and play together =((<br/>\n&gt; But we still watch each other play and we both love EQ!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; anyways just wanted to introduce myself to y&#39;all!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jaxy (Jennifer)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _____________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Bid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;              Free Games & Cash Prizes!<br/>\n&gt; Gamesville - The World&#39;s Biggest & Best Game Show Site!<br/>\n&gt;         <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
