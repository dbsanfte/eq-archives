We were married<br/>\n&gt; in game  at the little dock in nro at sunset that<br/>\n&gt; takes you to IC when we   <br/>\n&gt; made lvl 20  and that was about a 1 1/2 ago. We<br/>\n&gt; spent almost every night eather grped or we would<br/>\n&gt; talk in game, after about a month we started talking<br/>\n&gt; over the phone, slowly our friendship grew in the<br/>\n&gt; real world. <br/>\n&gt; The only problem was he was on the other side of the<br/>\n&gt; US from me so it was limited to just talking on the<br/>\n&gt; phone, the feelings for each other grew and we found<br/>\n&gt; we had we had fell in love for real. we wanted to<br/>\n&gt; meet  but at that time it wasnt a thing we could do.<br/>\n&gt; we continued to talk daily on eq and on the phone<br/>\n&gt; for about a year. We then started to talk using<br/>\n&gt; netmeeting and did that for a few months. We started<br/>\n&gt; both feeling<br/>\n&gt; of wanting to be togeather very strongly. we then<br/>\n&gt; started making plans for him to come down so we<br/>\n&gt; could meet for real. This last July he spent 3 weeks<br/>\n&gt; here wiht me. we had so much fun and both of us<br/>\n&gt; realized how much we  loved being with each other.<br/>\n&gt; We both realized how hard it was going to be for him<br/>\n&gt; to go back home. We talked about him moving here.<br/>\n&gt; At the end of aug he moved him self down here to<br/>\n&gt; move in with me.<br/>\n&gt; We are very happy togeather and cant imagine what it<br/>\n&gt; would be to be wiht one an other now. He is a very<br/>\n&gt; loving person and im very happy and feel very luck<br/>\n&gt; to have found him. The odds of us meeting in game<br/>\n&gt; are huge and the odds of us grping in the same grp<br/>\n&gt; that night are even bigger. So we  feel it was<br/>\n&gt; totally ment to be. <br/>\n&gt; So see wonderful things can happen from playing a<br/>\n&gt; game and ingame marrage.<br/>\n&gt; so i guess that is my answer about getting married<br/>\n&gt; in the game.<br/>\n&gt; Tyhana Storm<br/>\n&gt; 55 cleric<br/>\n&gt; Bertoxx <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ps my cleric as preformed a few marrages now also<br/>\n&gt; and those ppl are still very happy with there<br/>\n&gt; partner in the game.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Brangvyne&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brangvyne7@...\">brangvyne7@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Wed, 06 Nov 2002 22:24:26 -0000<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@yahoogroups.com\">EQ_women@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [EQ_women] Question Me This . . .<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;tt&gt;<br/>\n&gt; :o)&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi!&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I sent a long post the other day and hoped on the<br/>\n&gt; list today only to &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; realize that it had not made it to this list at all.<br/>\n&gt; In fact, &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; apparently my last couple of posts didn&#39;t make it to<br/>\n&gt; the list.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes I can be so dumb . . . but I can&#39;t help<br/>\n&gt; but wonder where I &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; sent the crazy things.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; :o)&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, a little question for anyone who might think<br/>\n&gt; about &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; answering . . .&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is there a level limit you need to be to get married<br/>\n&gt; in EQ?
