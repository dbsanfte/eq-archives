In game we RP brother and <br/>\nsister.  The main reason that came about was (no lectures please ::chuckles) <br/>\nwe fought so much initially about the game.  He would die...and get upset <br/>\nwith me.  I would level past him...he would get upset with me.  Basically <br/>\nwhat Im saying is that, though we love each other deeply, we are also <br/>\nentirely too competitive with each other.  Another reason was, we have <br/>\ncomplete opposite styles of RP (personality wise) and if i spend too long <br/>\nwith him in game i want to do something (like give him the biggest wedgie of <br/>\nhis life) to make him lighten up.  He can be a bit stuffy.  Needless to say, <br/>\nit makes me want to pull my hair out.  So we determined a very long time ago <br/>\nthat our characters were not meant to be together in &quot;that&quot; way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt actually works very well for us.  And, from the brother and sister <br/>\nstandpoint, we actually work very well.  We can also climb in bed at night <br/>\nwithout the danger of a &quot;game&quot; sending us off to sleep angry with each other. <br/>\n And we DO get together from time to time to help each other out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Light,<br/>\n<br/>\nThe player behind Mystyrain</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
