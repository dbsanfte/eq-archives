I played it for a little while but <br/>\nreally hated some of the major gameplay (fighting) interface issues.  <br/>\nNamely, when you go to loot you have to pick up each item <br/>\nindividually.  As well, there isn&#39;t an easy way to target or auto-<br/>\nattack.  As well, corpse deterioration was VERY (far too) quick and <br/>\npeople would take your items (limited left on corpse).  It is just <br/>\nfrustrating dealing with scavengers.  Finally, their skills system is <br/>\nvery complex, it offers some nice options, but it is mostly just <br/>\nconfusing.  I have since deleted my account.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, they had some really nice things that play balance well.  In <br/>\nparticular, the economy seems stable and self-sustaining.  Each <br/>\nvendor has a base of items and the only &quot;enhanced&quot; items they sell <br/>\nhave been sold to them by players.  I really like the &quot;note&quot; system <br/>\nwhere you pay a little extra money and get a note instead of carrying <br/>\naround tons of money.  Their trade skills offer experience!!! And <br/>\ntrades like cooking actually have rewards such as mana or hp gain.  <br/>\nThis unto itself was fantastic for RP value!  I believe it is open <br/>\nended leveling.  You continue to get experience even off the level 1 <br/>\ncreatures, although it would take you a RL year to level on them <br/>\n*grin* but this means there are always things to kill, however <br/>\nsmall.  As well, exp is granted based on damage done.  Loot rights <br/>\nare given to the individual who did the most overall damage.  Because <br/>\neach person who does damage gets exp, this alleviates KS and <br/>\ncontention between spawn camping, but sometimes leaves healers at a <br/>\ndisadvantage.  As I mentioned, they have a complex skill system where <br/>\neven a warrior can learn to use magic over time.  This is nice for <br/>\nthe really high level folks I imagine.  I also like the way equipment <br/>\nis handled, but it could be simplified.  If you don&#39;t have the game, <br/>\ncheck out the ebay auctions because many have pictures of the details <br/>\non the equipment they offer.  The rest I have explained, but you may <br/>\nwish to check it out yourself for the purposes of market study.<br/>\n<br/>\nI, too, have noticed so many folks THING oriented.  It really got <br/>\nnasty for a while on Veeshan with KS and people being generally <br/>\nnasty.  The server split not long after Kunark came out and things <br/>\nhave been FAR better there.  We used to have an average of 2600 <br/>\npeople online during prime time and now it is down to 1800 or so with <br/>\nmany more zones to explore. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I have done to keep my interest high is play multiple <br/>\ncharacters.  I have several characters in their 20s and none that are <br/>\nany higher because I spend time exploring, mastering trade skills or <br/>\ngenerally hanging out with my fantastic guild.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of... for anyone interested, I am the Guild Elder and <br/>\nAssistant Guildmaster of the Storm of Blades Guild on Veeshan.  We <br/>\nare a small, close-knit guild that values friendship above all else.  <br/>\nwe welcome new members who seek the same values as we do.  Please let <br/>\nme know if you have interest in joining.  I realize that for most it <br/>\nwould mean starting over, but we will be happy to help out with gear <br/>\nand leveling (not necessarily power leveling) if anyone transitioned.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
