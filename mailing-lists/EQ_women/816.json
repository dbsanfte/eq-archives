I thought<br/>\nI was supposed to give it back to him. &quot;Sigh&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; This should result in some specially named piece of<br/>\ncloth you place the fabric and the pattern inside a<br/>\nloom/sewing kit and combine to get the armor. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this mean I can&#39;t make the armor until I get high<br/>\nenough in my tailoring skill? How high should I be to<br/>\ndo that. I think my current level is about 17?<br/>\nI have the same problem with my bow quest. I have<br/>\neverything I need, but someone told me I needed to be<br/>\nabout 150 in fletching before I can be pretty sure of<br/>\nmaking a bow. So, I just put everything in the bank to<br/>\nawait that day, if or when it arrives.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; The only ingredients that you hand back to the guy<br/>\ngiving out the quests are the ones for the weapon<br/>\nwhich is normally given after you ask for the<br/>\ntunic/breastplate. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI got the weapon quest (sword), or at least was told<br/>\nwhat I needed. Two Orc eyes and a Master Key. I&#39;ve got<br/>\nall this. Do I need to put in a special bag or just<br/>\nhand them all to the guy and then get my sword?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; As for getting ripped off on the Forest Drakling<br/>\nScale, I know how that goes. Those silly things out<br/>\nnot to be selling for more than 2-3pp, however, the<br/>\npristine are so rare and in such demand still that<br/>\npeople are selling them for as high as 50pp. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be honest after several hours of game time and lots<br/>\nof dead FD&#39;s I would not have minded that much if I<br/>\nhad at least managed not to turn around and throw it<br/>\nall away.<br/>\n:o/<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Personally I wouldn&#39;t pay more than 5pp for a<br/>\nregular or ruined FDS, or over 10pp for the Pristine<br/>\nFDS. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLive and learn, and they did offer to trade, but I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have what they wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Scales in Misty Thicket are a different story.....<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Haven&#39;t even heard of Misty Thicket.<br/>\n<br/>\n:o)<br/>\nBrangvyne<br/>\n13th lvl Wood Elf Ranger<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
