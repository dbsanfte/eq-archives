But I play doing the weekday<br/>\nmornings and really don&#39;t see that much.  Well beside folks camping the<br/>\nOrc&#39;s in EC for the belts.  Not just the levels they where made for but<br/>\nhigher levels wanting to twink here low level char.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut when the find out that someone who the orcs where made for they have<br/>\nhelped me to get a few belts and watch out over me. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; At any rate, my disatisfaction toward EQ of late has been profound.<br/>\n&gt; Profound enough that I can&#39;t bring myself to log back in.  And I really<br/>\n&gt; think it is that they tweaked the game for the worse, starting with the<br/>\n&gt; addition of class specific armor and weaponry.  Suddenly it&#39;s all about<br/>\n&gt; &quot;stuff&quot;.  Or was it always and I just missed the point?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well Crushbone is like that, everyone wants that shiny shield or the<br/>\nscreaming mace.  And I guess Highpass is like that too, for that shield<br/>\nthe gnoll drops.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; More importantly, if there were an RP style game tweaked more toward<br/>\n&gt; people than things, would you play it?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sure would.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If the game gave points for  storyline and sometimes favored the underdog (letting the least equipped defeat the most equipped like a David and Goliath kind of story) and promoted group dynamics with more &quot;realistic&quot; story effects - would that be of any interest?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would have to see what the plot was about, but sure if it caught my<br/>\neye I would give it a try.<br/>\n<br/>\nRanalla, The Lost Druid</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
