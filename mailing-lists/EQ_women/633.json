But, it seems<br/>\n&gt; like I have a barrier<br/>\n&gt; that prevents me from playing there. I just know if<br/>\n&gt; I play there that<br/>\n&gt; server politics will rear its ugly head again.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So for now I will power level my little enchanter on<br/>\n&gt; Tholuxe, and see what<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s like playing there. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Christina<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; ATTACHMENT part 2 application/ms-tnef <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
