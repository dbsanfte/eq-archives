Unfortunately, wicked<br/>\nthings like work get in the way and prevent me from playing as much as I&#39;d<br/>\nlike!  I started because one of my roommates played, and I used to be<br/>\nan avid MUD&#39;der.  So it was natural for me to fall into EQ.  And I&#39;m<br/>\naddicted to starting newbies as well. Currently I have:<br/>\n<br/>\nRixte, level 42 monk - human<br/>\nEreen, level 24 magician - human<br/>\nMeika, level 24 druid - um, wolf?<br/>\nJaxiana, level 15 paladin, high elf<br/>\nIrdith, level 10 necromancer - erudite<br/>\nSarizy, level 9 shaman - leezard<br/>\nHeike, level 8 warrior - barbarian fisher and baker<br/>\nMegany, level 5 bard - wood elf<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI love my Rixte the best.  There is nothing like the sheer glory of a<br/>\nmonk.  And all three of my higher levels now live in<br/>\nKunark - only Meika ever touches home soil, and that&#39;s usually to run<br/>\nerrands for everybody else.   <br/>\n<br/>\nRixte and Ereen are both in the same guild, Caer Sidi.  Rixte usually<br/>\nplays with guildmates.  Meika (and sometimes Ereen) are really for playing<br/>\nwith RL friends who also EQ.  I&#39;m an officer in Caer Sidi, and it really<br/>\nis a great guild - it&#39;s quite small and closeknit.  Because of differences<br/>\nin levels we often don&#39;t get to group together anymore (when we started<br/>\nthe guild, everybody was about the same level) but it&#39;s always nice to<br/>\ntalk to everybody on /guild.  When it comes to guilds, there are so many<br/>\ndifferent choices in what kind of guild to go with.  For me, it&#39;s about<br/>\nthe people in the guild.  Not about twinking, camping, raiding, but just<br/>\nabout people who really care when you hit that next level.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRixte is an adventurer and explorer.  Camping mobs just isn&#39;t as much fun<br/>\nas exploring new dungeons!  Although mind you, there&#39;s nothing like<br/>\nspending 2 hours and 20 real life minutes feigned on the floor of Kaesora<br/>\nwhile your group attempts to mount a rescue party...all because you got<br/>\nimpatient with waiting and, um, fell down a big hole with lots of nasty<br/>\nspiders who wanted monk for dinner.   That was a great day!   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*waves hello to everybody*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the idea of a topic of the week.  We all have our favorite things<br/>\nand our pet peeves about the game.  It&#39;d be nice to have a forum to<br/>\ndiscuss such things!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
