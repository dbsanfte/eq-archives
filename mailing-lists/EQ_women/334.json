My dad&#39;s birthday is today, and I totally forgot (I swear, I think I<br/>\ngot thrown by that whole 7th/8th Saturday/Sunday thing too).  Dnaice, I wanted so<br/>\nbadly to be at your festivities, but there isn&#39;t a way possible.  I hope you will<br/>\nforgive me and appreciate the sentiment that I wanted to be there.  I hope your big<br/>\nday is as wondrous as a girl could wish for, and that you are surrounded by your<br/>\nfriends and chosen family, and feel truly loved, respected, and cherished.  I wish<br/>\nyou the best of adventures and most glorious of hunts, and I hope Corellon<br/>\nappreciates the treasure he is being gifted with--your love and companionship.<br/>\n<br/>\nSara, Povar<br/>\nIshtarre, Quellios<br/>\nValdaya, Rallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\nJudy Tyrer wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Judy Tyrer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:judy3t@...\">judy3t@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dnaice, Trisango, Troxfo<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (RP doesn&#39;t escape any of the complexities of RL, does it &lt;well other than the<br/>\n&gt; toilet thing&gt;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
