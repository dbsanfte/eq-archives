Off hand I<br/>\ncan think of excellent 1h blunt, 2h blunt, 1h slashing, and 2h slashing<br/>\nweapons.  Accordingly, I&#39;d suggest trying to train them all to some<br/>\nextent.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t want to train them all, I think one handed slashing is<br/>\nprobably your most defining weapon type.  Paladins are skilled shield<br/>\nbashers.  Ghoulbane, a relatively easy to obtain Paladin weapon is one<br/>\nhanded slashing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever without an exceptional one handed slashing weapon like Ghoulbane,<br/>\nmost of the time you will benefit from using a two handed slashing<br/>\nweapons.  They are more commonly available, and generally do far more<br/>\ndamage, then normal one handed slashing weapons.  Exceptional one handed<br/>\nslashing weapons are usually paladin only.<br/>\n<br/>\nA good lower-priced two handed slashing weapon is an axe of the iron<br/>\nblack.  They are easily found Kunark weapons.  BBCs are common Antonica<br/>\n2-handed slashing weapons as are shiny brass halberds, and should be<br/>\ncheaper than an axe.  GZs are also good.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor one handed slashing, until you obtain ghoulbane, there really aren&#39;t a<br/>\nlot of great one handed slashers.  I&#39;d suggest keep your bash and slash<br/>\nmaxed with a fine steel longsword and a shield, then switch back to your<br/>\ntwo-hander once both skills are maxed.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps =)<br/>\n<br/>\nTina<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, 13 Jun 2000, Karranza F&#39;aebourne wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; You know, I&#39;m one of the few women too in groups.
