I have a friend<br/>\nwho roleplays a rogue with a sense of morality.

The swamp was a new experience alright, and so<br/>\n&gt; was the famed troll regeneration (watch those HPs zoooom up!). But the<br/>\n&gt; funniest thing was when I flirted with an ogre warrior in Grobb (some big<br/>\n&gt; bad &#39;un with a last name). After all the recent discussion here on flirting<br/>\n&gt; and females getting items, I decided to try out my trollie charms on this<br/>\n&gt; ogre. All I did was to comment (in my well spoken troll dialect) on what a<br/>\n&gt; fine basher he seemed to be and emote &quot;:bats her eyelashes at [player]&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; all of a sudden I received 1 platinum! For a lvl 2 trollie SK, this was<br/>\n&gt; indeed a fine gift... I guess trollie women have something to teach my<br/>\n&gt; dwarven cleric when it comes to turning mens heads because my cleric never<br/>\n&gt; received such a fine gift... :)<br/>\n&gt; After this encounter, my trollie character is convinced she is indeed<br/>\n&gt; attractive, but I doubt she will carry her flirting further than the<br/>\n&gt; eyelashes at the moment. Still it&#39;s proof that it&#39;s not just the wood elves<br/>\n&gt; that can make a killing by flirting... :) /em smiles fiercely<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Gobba, alias Disa, alias me<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Congratulations to &quot;PAFind,&quot; our latest ONElist of the Week.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; How is ONElist changing YOUR life?
