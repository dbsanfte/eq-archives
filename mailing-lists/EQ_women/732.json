I love to roleplay and have gotten my character into an engagement<br/>\n&gt; to a Minstrel .  Well, the problem is the Minstrel is always on and as soon as<br/>\n&gt; I log in he comes and spend the whole game with me, I never get to solo<br/>\n&gt; anymore, I never get to group, and he&#39;s a horrible player so I end up doing<br/>\n&gt; more dying than I can stand.  It&#39;s made me kind of not want to play, but I am<br/>\n&gt; so bad at hurting people&#39;s feelings I don&#39;t know how to just say &quot;Um, mind if<br/>\n&gt; I solo tonight?&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Suggestions?  He started an alt so he wouldn&#39;t level without me and his alt is<br/>\n&gt; now level 28.  I&#39;m feeling REALLY guilty.
