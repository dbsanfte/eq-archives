The good news is I FINALLY got all the way through to getting to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;hold at the 800 number.

They have no record of my order.  However, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;cannot order again because I&#39;ve already ordered and no, the shipping<br/>\n&gt; &gt;company people can&#39;t do anything, I have to call Sony.  But, of course,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sony can&#39;t do anything I have to call the shipping company.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sorry, this IS a rant.  I have had a lot of respect for Verant in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;past, but the way they have handled Kunark is totally and completely<br/>\n&gt; &gt;unacceptable.
