They are the characters that strengthen the groups<br/>\nabilities,  especially by removing downtime.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had two bards in our group last night in Cazic Thule and had ZERO<br/>\ndowntime between huge MoB battles.  I kept Embrace Death up which<br/>\nconverts my health to manna, having a similar effect to Clarity.  But<br/>\nwith the Bards healing songs I never lost enough health to have to Drain<br/>\nLife so could use my far more potent &quot;Shock of Poison&quot; spell.  That was<br/>\nthe plus side.  The down side was that fighting for me was REALLY BORING<br/>\nsince I required none of my special skills.  /assist 2 2 2 /assist 2 2 2<br/>\n/assist 2 2 2 2 all night long (2 is my poison hotkey).   And with no<br/>\ndowntime, there was not roleplay or chat.  &lt;sighs grimly&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy next two newbie characters are going to be Bard and Enchanter.  The<br/>\nenchanter will replace my 11 mage - didn&#39;t like mage that much.  But<br/>\nfirst I want to get my Druid on Brell to the same level as my Druid on<br/>\nQuellious ( 12 on Brell, 20 on Quellious).<br/>\n<br/>\nEverquest has taken over my life *grins*.  I use the writing of the<br/>\nroleplay as an excuse since I&#39;m changing careers to writing and the<br/>\nshort scenes I post on the boards do help me in my novel.  Now where was<br/>\nI... oh yes...<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Damian was an incredible specimen of a man.  Blue eyes looked out from<br/>\nhis tan chiseled face, darting about as though he was a trapped animal.<br/>\nHe had a dancers body and grace.  Tall as he was, he was able to fold<br/>\nhimself into the small space of the tent without looking awkward or<br/>\nuncomfortable&quot;...<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, couldn&#39;t resist *smiles*<br/>\n<br/>\nDnaisha [27] Necromancer (Dark Elf)<br/>\n<br/>\nSuzanne J.
