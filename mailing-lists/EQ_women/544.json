In other words, you<br/>\nneed five black sapphires on average to make one.  I can try it for you<br/>\nfor sure, but can&#39;t guarantee success.<br/>\n<br/>\nEboots, eboots, eboots.  Why not just camp them? I guess I don&#39;t know how<br/>\nhard it is to camp eboots these days.  If you want I&#39;d be happy to help<br/>\nyou camp them some time.  I am not playing EQ much right now, but basicly<br/>\nif you wanted to set up a time in email I can dutifully log in and help<br/>\nout.  I&#39;m pretty sure one full group of level 50+ people would be<br/>\nsufficient.  You + me + sylvanar would be a good start.  Ideally bring<br/>\nalong as few people as possible who actually need boots, you know how it<br/>\ngoes =) <br/>\n<br/>\nTina/Luna<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 5 Jul 2000, Judy Tyrer wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Oh, Luna - thanks for the reminder...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Look me up in game if you have a few million spare moments please.

However, if you want to continue on to high end stuff<br/>\n&gt;   (reinforced leather, 10-slot bags) it requires considerable time and money<br/>\n&gt;   investment.  You can make good newbie-level money doing tailoring in<br/>\n&gt;   greater faydark.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Smithing requires about a 200pp investment to master (less if you are<br/>\n&gt;   optimal).  Smithing I found to be very rewarding early on in my server&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;   life, there were lots of tanks who wanted armor.  For various reasons<br/>\n&gt;   though, it can get boring.  To make small or large armor you have to<br/>\n&gt;   travel a lot to get your molds and metals and such.  To make medium armor,<br/>\n&gt;   you can do it in freeport, where all the materials are fairly available.<br/>\n&gt;   Smithing is quite enjoyable I found though eventually it becomes tedious.<br/>\n&gt;   You can make good low level money smithing in freeport or greater fay.<br/>\n&gt;   This will probably work best if you are level 20 or under as you will be<br/>\n&gt;   able to hunt in the near vicinity to freeport where people who will want<br/>\n&gt;   your wares will hang out.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Oh I almost forgot, smiths can make weapons now.  They couldn&#39;t when I<br/>\n&gt;   smithed.  I don&#39;t get the impression that forged weapons are a<br/>\n&gt;   very competitive business though.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Baking and brewing are both more &#39;fun&#39; trades.  All the skilled bakers and<br/>\n&gt;   brewers I know are druids, which makes sense because getting your goods<br/>\n&gt;   requires a lot of travel.  These two skills require little investment to<br/>\n&gt;   start, but a lot of work and travel to master.  These are nice because you<br/>\n&gt;   can give people alcohol or food, I still remember with joy the day my<br/>\n&gt;   druid friend gave me chocolate! You won&#39;t make money doing this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Jewlery is one of the few trades you can make serious money in but it is<br/>\n&gt;   also fairly competitive.  In order to make money in jewelcraft you usually<br/>\n&gt;   need a sizible investment.  Maxing your jewelcraft to 200 will cost<br/>\n&gt;   several thousand plat.  On the other hand, 50pp will get you able to make<br/>\n&gt;   some jewelry.  If you are not an enchanter you will have to pay to get<br/>\n&gt;   your metal bars enchanted which is a pain.  If you have a close enchanter<br/>\n&gt;   friend you could do ok though =)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Alchemy is shaman only and you have to be fairly high level to do it.<br/>\n&gt;   Shrink and SOW potions are pretty cool though, but they require a sizible<br/>\n&gt;   investment (thus the high level).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Meow meow<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Tina/Luna<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   On Wed, 5 Jul 2000, Sandy Wright wrote:<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Do any of you do a trade?
