I play EQ with my<br/>\nboyfriend (separate computers, different cities, hehe) about two hours a night.<br/>\nI put the kids to bed, and the time is mine.  I do not play during the day on<br/>\nweekends unless my kids are with their dad.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have brought one character to 15, and one character to 21, and I have a couple<br/>\nof other newbies that I grew tired of.  I play essentially one character, and<br/>\nit&#39;s enough for me.  Before my boyfriend and I started dating, we both played<br/>\nALOT more than we do now (my kids were usually asleep by the time I got home)...<br/>\nfancy that! &lt;grin&gt; I know for a fact it was a nice little escape world for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not care that I have been playing this game for almost a year now (more if<br/>\nyou count beta) and I am still at level 21.  But then, I have competition in<br/>\nalot of other areas in my life, and it&#39;s nice that this is one place I don&#39;t<br/>\nhave to worry about refreshing my house every day or keeping up with my MUD<br/>\nmail.  My boyfriend and I usually find someone to hunt with, or we meet new<br/>\npeople and make new friends, or if we really CAN&#39;T find anyone (very rare), we<br/>\ndo a quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT we also do not play when the kids are awake, during work hours, or on<br/>\nweekends when we have special plans.  And if he had ever told me to come to<br/>\nNorrath if I wanted to see him, I would probably not be dating him.  Bit<br/>\ndifferent when you&#39;re married, though. =(</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
