The role-playing, the building up of <br/>\ncharacters, <br/>\n&gt; the economy of the game, the way people interact online, etc... We <br/>\n&gt; hope to explore all these areas of the game by interviewing <br/>\nplayers, <br/>\n&gt; spouses, children, parents and even the EQ developers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We plan on shooting over the next couple of months.
