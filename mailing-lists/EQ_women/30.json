I&#39;m sure it will happen someday, but it <br/>\nhasn&#39;t so far. (Crosses fingers).<br/>\n<br/>\n  As far as flirting goes, I am a notorious flirt and I&#39;ll flirt with anyone <br/>\nat any time. That&#39;s the way I am in real life, so I guess I can&#39;t help it in <br/>\nEQ. I think human interaction is one of the best parts of the game, and <br/>\nflirtation is one of the oldest of human interactions &lt;grin&gt;. If you and <br/>\nthose you do it with enjoy it, by all means have fun with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The thing that irks me to no end (and I&#39;ll be honest here and admit that I <br/>\nbelieve most of these &quot;women&quot; to be played by men)is the female characters <br/>\nthat you see once in awhile that shout something to the effect of &quot;I&#39;m a <br/>\ncute, helpless, sexy, level four wood elf and I want someone to give me, for <br/>\nfree, an item or ten obtainable only by a full-group of level 40+ people. <br/>\n*bats eyelashes*.&quot; I&#39;m not saying its wrong or that they should be shunned <br/>\non site. I&#39;m not even sure exactly why it bothers me, but its incredibly <br/>\nannoying. Maybe it&#39;s because I feel like they are taking advantage of male <br/>\nhormones, and I don&#39;t feel right doing that so I&#39;m jealous &lt;G&gt;. Dandara did <br/>\nask someone of higher level once to bring her back an ice goblin from <br/>\nPermafrost, but I don&#39;t exactly see that as being the same thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nDanette<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
