I know of one other on Fennin Ro who is older than I am<br/>\n&gt;and a women in RL.  Mature people have a love of gaming, too.  I get a lot<br/>\n&gt;of pleasure from playing any game, puzzle, or challenge.  I work off<br/>\n&gt;aggression with my slashing and hacking, get satisfaction in achieving<br/>\n&gt;small goals like acquiring items, making skill or experience levels and in<br/>\n&gt;discovering and exploring the EQ environment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Us old geezers have the time and the patience (and the money) for many<br/>\n&gt;on-line activities, as well as having highly developed computer-related<br/>\n&gt;skills.  I have found that women have done very well in information<br/>\n&gt;management/computer science careers and I have been involved since the<br/>\n&gt;middle 1960&#39;s with large corporations on the west and east coasts.<br/>\n&gt;I am retired now and only do a little consulting to keep my skills and<br/>\n&gt;marketability up.  This leaves me much time for day playing and all night<br/>\n&gt;sessions, if I want.  I am a borderline compulsive when I play this game.<br/>\n&gt;  It is so immersive and addicting.  When a good group forms, I like to <br/>\n&gt;stay<br/>\n&gt;together as long as I can for the session and the companionship.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I played Realm before EQ.  But a family member was a beta tester for EQ and<br/>\n&gt;showed it to me last year.  So I was on the distribution list for the<br/>\n&gt;production software by New Years of this year and started playing the first<br/>\n&gt;day of production.  I have found that my knowledge of the game is only now<br/>\n&gt;beginning to surpass the beta testers and I am considering volunteering for<br/>\n&gt;guide duty.  I think older women would make excellent guides.  If anything,<br/>\n&gt;age teaches patience, wit, skin thickening and a little teaching skills,<br/>\n&gt;which I think are essential attributes for a good guide.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I can always spot the youngest players.  They are the ones always shouting<br/>\n&gt;for help with corpse retrieval, free food, free items, screaming &#39;gimme,<br/>\n&gt;gimme, gimme&#39;.  They can&#39;t seem to stand still.......ever.  They never<br/>\n&gt;bother with Sense Heading skill development, never learned the value of<br/>\n&gt;saving up their coins for something they want, and seem very self-centered<br/>\n&gt;in every thing they do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So, here is a new mail list thread idea:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You can always spot the kids when they<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1) Beg for favors all over the zone<br/>\n&gt;2) twink<br/>\n&gt;3) solo power game<br/>\n&gt;4) are on most people&#39;s ignore list<br/>\n&gt;5) bully other players with their own greediness<br/>\n&gt;6) brag too much about their race, class, level, wealth or items<br/>\n&gt;7) answer every question about game secrets with shouts across the zone to<br/>\n&gt;show off what they know (and don&#39;t know, hehe)<br/>\n&gt;8) chatter incessantly about inanities<br/>\n&gt;9) complain the loudest about others not helping them<br/>\n&gt;10) ..................[you fill in your favorite here]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Dornar and Dornita<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From:\tBeth Moursund [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scrybsprite@...\">scrybsprite@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent:\tSunday, June 20, 1999 1:29 PM<br/>\n&gt;To:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_women@onelist.com\">eq_women@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt;Subject:\tRe: [EQ_women] fun after 40<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: Beth Moursund &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scrybsprite@...\">scrybsprite@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Janice writes:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;By the way, regarding the subject of &quot;older women&quot; playing EQ, I bet I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt;one of oldest.
