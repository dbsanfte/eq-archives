I also am a working mother, I put in alot of hours at work and<br/>\nthen come home to take care of two children (12 and 9) not that they take<br/>\nalot of babysitting, but it does get hetic at times.  I usually get settled<br/>\ndown around 9 or 10 to play.  I have had nights where I got off the game<br/>\njust in time to jump in the shower for work (very long days). But the game<br/>\nis so much fun I just can not help myself.  I am usually up by 4 in the<br/>\nmorning and that is the time I check my email and surf a bit for new<br/>\ninformation on whatever.  I would not change it though because I have so<br/>\nmuch fun on this game!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Suzanne Johnson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katannah@...\">katannah@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@onelist.com\">EQ_women@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, June 18, 1999 10:29 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_women] Hullo!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Suzanne Johnson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katannah@...\">katannah@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I play Sara, a 13th level ranger, on Povar.
