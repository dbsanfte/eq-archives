I think half of bryn&#39;s<br/>\nproblem is that he can&#39;t refuse the games.  You ever see a man who<br/>\nwalks into the room when a TV is on?  It captivates his vision,<br/>\nthose flickering images.  Bryn needs to give up gaming in order to<br/>\nsucceed at college.  He was turned down for Drexel because of his<br/>\ngrades.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut who am I to talk?  I made level 34 yesterday and chatted with a<br/>\nwoman in a potentially abusive relationship for almost an hour.  My<br/>\npaperwork is piling up.<br/>\n<br/>\nBryn plays Diablo most nights now.
