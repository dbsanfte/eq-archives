Then I<br/>\njoined a expedition to take on Nagafen (first try on the server).  We got<br/>\nthrough the first fire giants ok.  Then we got through King Tranix the<br/>\nfire giant SK ok.  Next we got to Nagafen herself.  She had a unique fire<br/>\ngiant wizard guarding her.  In the first attack, we took down the wizard,<br/>\nbut Nagafen killed everyone.  We then sent several more waves attacking<br/>\nNagafen.  We unfortunately never got her below 60% health.  I lost about 5<br/>\nbars of xp dying about 10 times.  Some people lost up to twice that much.<br/>\nIt was a really exciting fun experience though.  The scariest thing about<br/>\nthe whole thing was that many big players had their corpses sitting right<br/>\nunder Nagafen and it was possible we&#39;d never get their corpses back (mine<br/>\nwas there too).  But, brave warriors through themselves at Nagafen while<br/>\nwe dragged our corpses away so they could be looted.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
