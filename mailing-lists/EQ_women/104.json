That is really cool.  Yah, I have decided that if my opinion<br/>\nis ever solicited, the one thing I would want changed above all else is my<br/>\n&quot;friends&quot; list.  After all, the purpose of EQ is to meet new people and enjoy<br/>\nnew adventures, right? Heck, I started keeping my own &quot;friends&quot; list on paper.<br/>\nAnd it&#39;s twice as bad when you&#39;re in a guild. I know my brothers are sick of me<br/>\ndoing &quot;Roll Call!&quot; hehe<br/>\n<br/>\nSara, Povar<br/>\n<br/>\nMitzi wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Mitzi&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mitzi@...\">mitzi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is a very good point.. I have done that much.. I hunt with someone so<br/>\n&gt; when we start new characters together then we have the other one pass along<br/>\n&gt; some coins to at least get starting spells.. I didn&#39;t even realize GM&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; would give you a &quot;leg up&quot; kit, it&#39;s shocking actually.  We do good to get<br/>\n&gt; GM&#39;s to answer us.. I did get to talk to a programmer once though.. he&#39;s in<br/>\n&gt; charge of the design of the spells..  He showed up on Erud&#39;s Crossing when I<br/>\n&gt; was there alone.. I thought I saw someone then did a /who and I was the only<br/>\n&gt; one there so I went to investigate of course, after asking him he told me he<br/>\n&gt; was testing out new spells..I didn&#39;t actually get to see those or anything..<br/>\n&gt; we did talk about several things though. I was surprised he did stay to talk<br/>\n&gt; to me for a several minutes.. among other things was how you have to med<br/>\n&gt; with that dratted book open.. I did get my 2 copper worth in about that.. he<br/>\n&gt; said at least it was better than beta where you couldn&#39;t even chat when<br/>\n&gt; medding.. that it stayed that way until a few other programmers decided to<br/>\n&gt; play spell casters and they didn&#39;t like it.. he did say the meditate button<br/>\n&gt; would be obsolete at some point and would just auto kick on when you open<br/>\n&gt; the book, which is good for blondes like me who sometimes sit to med and<br/>\n&gt; then run off to do something in the house real quick (gotta get that stuff<br/>\n&gt; done at some point ladies.. hehe) and come back to find I forgot to push<br/>\n&gt; that darn button.. hehe..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another thing we did talk about was the friend list, I commented that I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; made many friends in test that I hunt with at certain areas and like to keep<br/>\n&gt; in touch and find out where they are to see if I can find a group if my<br/>\n&gt; partner isn&#39;t with me.  I have to sometimes remove someone to put a new<br/>\n&gt; friend on cause of the 20 limit.. he said yes it was something he wanted<br/>\n&gt; changed.. and even asked how many I thought would be enough for me.. I said<br/>\n&gt; at LEAST 2x as big if not more and he agreed.. hopefully that&#39;ll change at<br/>\n&gt; some point.  This guy had a some great stuff on.. when I asked about where<br/>\n&gt; to get that sorta thing he said I couldn&#39;t.. that it was things he&#39;d made<br/>\n&gt; himself to test out.. must be nice to be able to do that.. All in all it was<br/>\n&gt; a good chat and I was grateful he took the time to explain some things to me<br/>\n&gt; about why things do what they do in the game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This list is GREAT by the way.. so good to talk to fellow lady EQ&#39;ers!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mitzi aka Roxi the Shaman Barb lvl 16<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; P.S.  What someone said (either this list or the other..) about it being<br/>\n&gt; hard to role play on test is quite true because of there being fewer players<br/>\n&gt; there.  I don&#39;t mind one bit though, I just enjoy meeting other people,<br/>\n&gt; learning how their characters do what they do (never know when I&#39;ll wanna<br/>\n&gt; try one of them) and just have fun in the game =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just remember when twinking your lowbies that their corpse will decay in a<br/>\n&gt; half<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hour after death until you&#39;re level 6..<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --Tori<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Where do some of the Internet&#39;s largest email lists reside?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; At ONElist - the most scalable and reliable service on the Internet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
