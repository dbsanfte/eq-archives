Nothing","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-803978909\">Salutations!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe used to talk about adopting a lot but we just kept<br/>\nhaving more kids instead, so we adopted them.<br/>\n:o)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no time management skills. Nothing ever gets<br/>\ndone on time or properly. I figure as long as it<br/>\neventually happens it successful.<br/>\n<br/>\nCongratulations on 62. As someone who recently hit 62<br/>\nmyself we seem to be taking the same road. Last night<br/>\nI took my 21% into 62 and my 65 ranger hubby and went<br/>\nto HoH. Why HoH instead of BoT. Well simple. He can<br/>\nsolo there bow kiting the mobs till they die. It&#39;s a<br/>\nbit slow but I keep him healed and toss in a few 1100<br/>\npoint nukes to speed the process and its not bad at<br/>\nall. The two of us were killing mobs with between 30K<br/>\nand 75K hp. So my recipie now is BoT if I can get a<br/>\ngood group, HoH if I&#39;m duoing, and trade skills etc.<br/>\nwhen I&#39;m alone. Working out pretty good.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinished my fourth coldain shawl yesterday, but I need<br/>\nto get my tailoring up some more before I try that 5th<br/>\none. Only 101, and although I know it trivs at 115 I<br/>\nthink I&#39;m going to triv Wu&#39;s armor at 158 before I<br/>\nmake the attempt. After all it will need to be higher<br/>\nlater anyway, so might as well get it on up now.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo we have any others who like to do that trade stuff<br/>\non the list. I do it a lot when it&#39;s slow. Just work<br/>\non this or that to pass the time. I like the easy<br/>\nrecipies though even if they cost me more. After all<br/>\nit&#39;s not hard to make a few thousand plat if I really<br/>\nneed to. And along that line, does anyone know a<br/>\nsimple smithing recipie to use from 88. I just made<br/>\nshields till 88. It was easy and all the parts could<br/>\nbe gotten in one convient spot. Now I&#39;m looking for<br/>\nsomething simple. But baking is the easiest to raise<br/>\nif you&#39;re bored and don&#39;t mind sitting around for a<br/>\nwhile. Fish cakes to 135 (a hearty meal), I caught the<br/>\nfish and bought the bat wings. Storm salmon to 202<br/>\n(stat food) but I&#39;m forgetting what I have to put with<br/>\nit. That&#39;s a lot of fish I&#39;ll tell you though. Again<br/>\nyou just have to have the patience for the fishing in<br/>\nPoS. Anyway just my cooking tip of the day.<br/>\n:oP<br/>\n<br/>\n/Hugs<br/>\nBran<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Dr. Mom&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drmom5@...\">drmom5@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am considering foster parenting.
