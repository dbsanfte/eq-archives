I do appreciate the input I got and I did end up buying the<br/>\ngame a few weeks ago. However, with one thing and another I did not get it<br/>\ninstalled onto my computer until today and as of right now I still have not<br/>\nsigned on. That will probably be tomorrow sometime.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Anyway, now that I am actually on the verge of getting started I had a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>couple of questions I was hoping some of you might help answer.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;1.) The tutorial that is included on the CD keeps locking up. Did anyone<br/>\n </span></blockquote>else have this problem? It has me a bit worried in that I am afraid that the<br/>\ngame might do the same thing. It always happens shortly after leaving the<br/>\nguildmaster to go get some food. Any input, or suggestions?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I will be contacting the website to see if they might know why but was<br/>\n </span></blockquote>wondering if any of you had the same problem.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2.) Can anyone give me some suggestion on where to start or what to do<br/>\n </span></blockquote>first? Some suggestions from those who have been there and done that might<br/>\nbe helpful/useful?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;3.) Anyone looking for a trainee or companion to go adventuring with. I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>plan on trying to start with a half-elf bard, and am looking forward to<br/>\ndoing some adventuring with someone or several someones if anyone is<br/>\ninterested in taking on a beginner.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Well, I hope everyone had a good Christmas and look foward to chating a bit<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and seeing some of you in the world of EQ.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Happy Adventuring,<br/>\n&gt;Brangvyne<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
