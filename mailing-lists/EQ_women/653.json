My interest in the Renaissance and the<br/>\nMiddle Ages is what originally led me to EQ. I am a firm believer in<br/>\nactively participating in living history, yet there are times when the<br/>\nweather, your health or your time leads you to more passive<br/>\nentertainment. The key is to keep a sense of perspective and not become<br/>\ntoo focused on one thing to the exclusion of reality. I have been<br/>\nplaying EQ from the start, yet I still enjoy it, maybe because my main<br/>\ncharacter is still level 20, has never been power leveled and is still<br/>\nexploring her environment. I also enjoy reading Pier Anthony&#39;s Zanth<br/>\nseries, in which characters explore a world of Pun-tastic fantasy.<br/>\n\tMy son is in training to become a SCA fighter. I myself am more<br/>\nintrigued with the costuming, arts and foods. We have attended a couple<br/>\nof wars already, it is great fun.....but it can also be taken to the<br/>\npoint where you lose life balance so take caution....then you will enjoy<br/>\nit as a lifelong pursuit and not a intense and expensive fling. We began<br/>\nthis interest by becoming regular attendees of Renaissance Faires (10<br/>\nyears), then realised that we wanted get more depth to our knowledge<br/>\nbase.<br/>\n\tMayhaps we shall end up having a group of EQ fans in the SCA. My son is<br/>\nsigned up to also beta test AO, Anarchy Online (Futureworld game). When<br/>\nhe starts playing I&#39;ll let you know how it looks as a game. Wishing you<br/>\nall a &quot;Good Morrow.&quot; :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
