The only <br/>\nreal service GMs provide is changing your surname when you are married. <br/>\nThey also sometimes help make weddings more fun by performing the marriage <br/>\nceremony.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for gifts, well that&#39;s up to you. A great place to look for wedding <br/>\ngifts might be the Bazaar, you can buy almost anything there and usually <br/>\nat a great value.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ring can be a wedding ring but PC jewlers can make rings that are <br/>\nactually called &#39;wedding rings&#39;. The cheapest wedding ring is an electrum <br/>\ncarnelian wedding ring, you could probably get one made for about 5pp but <br/>\nit would be a special order. You can also get Diamond and Fire Opal <br/>\nwedding rings that will be more expensive (then can be as expensive as <br/>\n1000pp). Like real life, with wedding rings you need to figure out how <br/>\nmuch you want to spend, then talk to a jewler, and they&#39;ll be happy to <br/>\ntake all your money.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 8 Nov 2002, Meleficent Ouverts wrote:<br/>\n&gt; so i have to have a GM marry us huh?
