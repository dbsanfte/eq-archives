These are coordinated<br/>\nactivities involving 12-40 people to achieve some common goal, like<br/>\nkilling a dragon. At this point, every server naturally develops politics,<br/>\nwhich govern how people are or are not allowed to participate in these<br/>\nraids, and when they can participate. With large groups of people all with<br/>\ndifferent desires, it&#39;s hard to come up with a common focus on what is<br/>\n&quot;fair&quot;. This is politics, and it sucks and there is no point, which is why<br/>\nI think it&#39;s best to just completely ignore it for your own happiness =)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 12 Jan 2001, P MacKinnon wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; A newbie question re server politics; what are they?
