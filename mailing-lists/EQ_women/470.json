I started because female chars in chainmail and D&D<br/>\nhad some penalties .. rolled an 18 00 strength, cut your bonus in<br/>\nhalf or decide your character changes sex ... ummm change sex!<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I ran an all-girl Roleplaying group ... several of us would<br/>\nsometimes play guy chars to liven it up.  We even had a few &quot;play&quot; <br/>\nromances, all in fun.  But more we just decided a pair was a couple<br/>\nand skipped RPing the romance.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen on-line MUDs first started, being the only female on could be<br/>\nquite a distraction. :p  So much so, I sometimes died in &quot;scroll&quot; when<br/>\nso many people were commenting &quot;OMG its a female!&quot; I couldn&#39;t see the<br/>\ntext battle messages fast enough :(  They were all text-based.  Not <br/>\nto mention, if only half of the males were interested in a romantic <br/>\nstory line .. that made about 100 with you the only viable target.<br/>\nEeeeeeeeee.  Since I&#39;d done it before ... I just played males chars for<br/>\nbreaks.  Then I could actually PLAY the game and SEE it. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI still do it when a class or character idea I come up with just &quot;works&quot;<br/>\nas a male.  I&#39;m allright in a &quot;male&quot; environment, I was the only girl<br/>\non the farm (and nearby ones) when I grew up, and work in mostly all-male<br/>\nfields (only female to 19 men in my dept. today).  So I handle guy stuff OK,<br/>\nand have been told I am capable of fitting in with a group of guys well<br/>\nenough to become &quot;one of the guys&quot; if we are on a work team long enough.<br/>\nI also test as highly agressive and mechanical (and still high when my<br/>\nscores are ranked against male scores), so its no surprise I have been<br/>\ntold I&#39;m believable as a guy in an RPG where they can&#39;t see me and I do no<br/>\n OOC chatting. But, I have to pick my interactions and definitely come up <br/>\nwith an IC way of avoiding romances.  Its when women hit on me when I&#39;m <br/>\nplaying a guy  that I get uncomfortable.  There&#39;s no parallel to what I&#39;m<br/>\nused to since there is no hitting on me allowed at work!  Of course, now its<br/>\nprobably a guy playing a girl who&#39;s hitting on a guy played by a girl to &quot;see <br/>\nwhat its like&quot;. Isn&#39;t THAT a twist!  Run awaaaaaaay .....<br/>\n<br/>\nI do find that now that female characters are plentiful, my first choice is<br/>\nto play a female and my male/female char ratio is about 1 to 10 in favor of<br/>\nplaying women.  And my male characters generally get played for shorter<br/>\nperiods<br/>\nthan the females as well.  Most of my male characters nowadays are<br/>\n&quot;adopted&quot; by<br/>\nmy son, who is too young to play.  And he is allowed to help make action<br/>\nchoices.  <br/>\nSo they sort of end up male-played by proxy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a male troll warrior out there tonight who was being played by a<br/>\nco-op of a grey-haired lady and her 1st grade son. Muhahaha.  Ungh? is a<br/>\nfairly<br/>\nsexless response ... <br/>\n<br/>\nFYI<br/>\nwomengamers is planning on doing a survey on women playing men in the future.<br/>\n(they&#39;re based in my hometown!)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Lora<br/>\nTaizu,Shiri on Brell<br/>\na few low levels on Luclin since my Brell friends outgrew me while I was<br/>\non deadline in RL :/</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
