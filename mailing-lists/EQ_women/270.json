My best guess is that<br/>\n&gt;the sisters strive to be chaste because they don&#39;t want their love to be<br/>\n&gt;bound and focussed on any one person.  I&#39;d like to see the whole chaste<br/>\n&gt;thing as a role playing element we can use if we want to, and not use if<br/>\n&gt;we don&#39;t want to.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But do we have to be like the NPC Sisters?  Seems to me the player guild can be <br/>\ndifferent (like allowing men in, for one thing).  Honestly, the ancient custom <br/>\nof sacred prostitution (hence sharing the love of the Goddess with Her <br/>\nworshippers) seems more likely to me, but not something we would necessarily <br/>\nwant to implement!  But I am not too big on the chastity idea either - who says <br/>\nSisters are monogamous in their love?<br/>\nIf nothing else, my character is unlikely to be chaste, but I would hate to have <br/>\n<br/>\nto view this choice as violating her vows to the Goddess, if you see what I <br/>\nmean.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;As for the men-protecting-the-women thing, it can be taken that way, but<br/>\n&gt;it doesn&#39;t have to.  I was basicly just trying to identify a nice way in<br/>\n&gt;which men could be incoroporated into the guild.  Your character could<br/>\n&gt;choose to not have a warder, and that would be a valid choice.  If I were<br/>\n&gt;to have a warder, I would see him as a default following of Erollisi<br/>\n&gt;looking to serve his god, and not as someone I needed for protection.<br/>\n&gt;Others might choose to define their relationship with their Warder in a<br/>\n&gt;different way (love, protection, siblings, or even the sister protecting<br/>\n&gt;the Warder?)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would seriously have to ponder the issue for my own character.
