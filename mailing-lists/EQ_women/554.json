The Ranger&#39;s Glade forum is an excellent\nsite (part of EQForge) and very active in ranger concerns.&nbsp; I had\nto make a clean break, however, because I really did have alot of emotion\ntied up in EQ, and when I quit, it was very difficult... I mean, I dragged\nmy real-life best friend into it so we could &#39;see&#39; each other every day...\nmy ingame partner has become my out-of-game partner, too... (looooooooong\nstory, hehe, and I wouldn&#39;t recommend it as a way to pick up guys) so you\ncan see why I would just want to turn my back on being active in the cause\nwhen that really isn&#39;t typical behavior for me.</i>\n<br>&nbsp;<font face=\"Arial\"><font size=\"-1\">But to be honest, I still think\nRangers rock.&nbsp; I could be prejudiced ;-)</font></font>&nbsp;\n<br><i>I do, too, honestly, but it&#39;s the rest of the world that needs convincing...\n&lt;sigh&gt;&nbsp; I didn&#39;t quit because I wasn&#39;t &#39;winning&#39;; I did it because\nVerant told a community of customers to screw off.</i>\n<br><i></i>&nbsp;<font face=\"Arial\"><font size=\"-1\">As for my game, I&#39;m now\nstuck on how to get away from &quot;killing mobs&quot; as the primary gameplay force.&nbsp;\nI want it more adventure based, I think, with characters given &quot;opportunities&quot;\nto alter the dynamic of gameplay.&nbsp; And each level grouping having\ndifferent quest orientations.&nbsp; And each server being uniquely itself\nbecause of the decisions made by players up to that time.</font></font>&nbsp;<font face=\"Arial\"><font size=\"-1\">Anyway,\nthe game is now called KARMA and when you die - you REALLY die ;-)&nbsp;\nNone of this resurrection gorp.&nbsp; You have to be reborn and how you\nare reborn is totally dependent on how you played up to that point.&nbsp;\nOf course, like anything else, it&#39;s all in the details.&nbsp; But those\nare my ideas so far.&nbsp; Opinions?</font></font>&nbsp;<font face=\"Arial\"><font size=\"-1\">Judy</font></font>\n<blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\">\n<div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">&nbsp;\n<br><i>I recommend you steal a page from the original Ultima series, then,\nand have quests and decisions actually count for &#39;Karma&#39; points... in the\nUltima series, if your avatar behaved a certain way, individual NPCs might\nor might not choose to adventure with him.&nbsp; Everything was a consequence\nof his actions.&nbsp; So, if a KARMA avatar did things according to how\nhis alignment and class should behave in a given situation, he should get\nkarma points.&nbsp; Depending on how many Karma points he has, he might\nhave a higher &#39;fame&#39; rating in how NPCs deal with him (one of the things\nI liked about UO; NPC shopkeeps would lower prices for higher famed players),\nbut it will also determine how he is reborn... just things to consider.\n=)</i><i></i>\n<p><i>Also, I like the idea of being reborn.&nbsp; I think, at that time,\nloot should disappear, maybe restored to the database as &#39;available&#39; for\nrespawn somewhere... that way, people don&#39;t get too attached to their stuff?&nbsp;\nI have to admit, my EQ and UO banks (and heck, my Diablo stash, hehe) had\nmore sentimental stuff in it than anything else, and it crushed me to have\nmy UO house looted by people who just destroyed the gifts I&#39;d been given\nif they had no value for use or resale... but maybe there&#39;s a lesson in\nthat? &lt;grin&gt;</i>\n<br><i>Keep us posted...</i><i></i>\n<p>Aelwesara C&ucirc;thalion, Ranger, of worlds to come\n<br><i></i>&nbsp;\n<br><i></i>&nbsp;</div>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n \n</span></blockquote></html>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
