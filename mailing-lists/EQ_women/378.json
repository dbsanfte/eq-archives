Luna<br/>\nmy 50th level enchanter will be marrying Duna a 45th level monk on Brell<br/>\nSerelis. Details of the wedding have not been finalized, but it will<br/>\nprobably happen in about two weeks.  I&#39;ll try and post more information to<br/>\nthe list when I get it.  We may be married in the throne room of King<br/>\nTranix the fire giant, in which case attendence of the wedding would be<br/>\nlimited to those levels 40+.  We may have a more mundane wedding, in which<br/>\ncase I would like to invite everyone to attend.  I think a nice alternate<br/>\nwedding spot would be the erollisi sisters island, only I&#39;m worried some<br/>\nof the guests would be KOS =/ Nothing makes a wedding suck more than NPCs<br/>\ntrying to kill your friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
