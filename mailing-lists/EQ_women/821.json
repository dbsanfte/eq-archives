I read the text again, I even<br/>\nasked someone who had just completed that quest and I<br/>\nmade sure I had what I needed. I went back to the guy<br/>\nand give him the stuff and he took it once again and<br/>\nhappily said, thanks and I got nothing once again. I<br/>\nwas so mad. It didn&#39;t help when I realized the fault<br/>\nwas entirely mine in that I had given the guy the key,<br/>\none Orc eye, and one firebeetle eye; instead of two<br/>\norc eyes. They looked the same and I was tired when I<br/>\ndid it. (Should have been in bed) :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, a 21st lvl Druid I talk to and have traveled<br/>\nwith a bit took pity on me, took me around, and sort<br/>\nof &quot;held my hand&quot; and walked me through getting one of<br/>\nthe quest items step by step which was nice of him.<br/>\nThe point is, at least to me, the instructions were<br/>\nnot that clear unless you already had some kind of<br/>\nknowledge of what was going on. At that point it seems<br/>\nvery obvious. But then perhaps I&#39;m just a bit dense.<br/>\n:o)<br/>\n<br/>\nAh well, live and learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n:o)<br/>\nBrangvyne<br/>\n14th lvl Wood Elf Ranger<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Christina Norman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tina@...\">tina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yikes it sucks to lose stuff to quests =(<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A good thing to do is before you hand in any quest<br/>\n&gt; items talk to the NPC <br/>\n&gt; again and listen very carefully to the exact<br/>\n&gt; instructions. I am ultra <br/>\n&gt; paranoid about this stuff, but I have never lost a<br/>\n&gt; quest item.

I never did find the forest drakling scale<br/>\n&gt; but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I found someone who had one and offered to sell it<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; me and asked what I would give them. I told them<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t have any idea what anything cost but<br/>\n&gt; would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pay them whatever the fair price was. They told me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that they used to get 50pp but that they would<br/>\n&gt; sell it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to me for 20pp and that to be nice they would let<br/>\n&gt; me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have it for 10pp if that was all I could afford.<br/>\n&gt; Well<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I had the 20pp and I didn&#39;t want to take advantage<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anyone so I gave it to them. (Yes, I&#39;m a sucker)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; :o)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Then I took all my stuff back to the Ranger guild<br/>\n&gt; &gt; house and gave it to the Ranger who gave me the<br/>\n&gt; quest,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I forget the name. He took all the stuff, told me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thank you, and that was it. I didn&#39;t get anything,<br/>\n&gt; no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tunic, no exp., no nothing. I was so upset I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; know whether to laugh or cry . . .<br/>\n&gt; &gt; :o)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, after standing there for a long time kicking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; myself I asked them for the quest all over again.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Oddly, this time they gave me the box to put<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everything in and they also gave me a pattern for<br/>\n&gt; an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;enchanted tunic&quot;? Not sure what that is all about<br/>\n&gt; as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there are not enough slots in the box to fit the<br/>\n&gt; stuff<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and the tunic.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; :o)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anyway, I went back out and started gathering<br/>\n&gt; stuff<br/>\n&gt; &gt; again. Still need to regain a couple items,<br/>\n&gt; including<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that silly Forest Drakling Scale, but now I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; paranoid<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about the exact approach to take to not lose<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everything again. Apparently, I did or said<br/>\n&gt; something<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wrong last time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; :o)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Oh well, live and learn I guess, but it certainly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t make me feel any better when I was telling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; someone about the whole thing later and they told<br/>\n&gt; me I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; had been ripped off on the price of the Forest<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Drakling Scale . . . ouch!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anyway, just thought I&#39;d throw that out in case<br/>\n&gt; anyone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was interested at all.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; :o)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Brangvyne<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 13th lvl Wood Elf Ranger<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; PS - I came across a master key in CB last night<br/>\n&gt; and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have the two Orc eyes for the sword.
