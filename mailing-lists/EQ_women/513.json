I&#39;ve been working on how to get experience\nin a game based on how you RP and the thought I have is that you get opportunities\nin the story to make decisions and based on the kind of character you have\nchosen, the points are based on how &quot;true to form&quot; your decision was.&nbsp;\nSo if you are the arch-nemisis and you actually help out another player,\nyou don&#39;t get any (or lose?) points but if you totally screw them over,\nyou get lots of them.&nbsp; Likewise for the hero.&nbsp; BUT, you can change\nyour character from evil to good by getting &quot;Karma points&quot;.\n<p>Anyway, trying to get away from the &quot;kill/reward&quot; system, as successful\nas it is I like to think &quot;outside the box&quot;.&nbsp; The basic concept is\ncomplete but, of course, it&#39;s all in the details.&nbsp; Fortunately, my\nnovel is getting lots of attention right now but unfortunately, my game\ndesign is not.\n<p>Ice\n<p>Amy Brau-Goldenburg wrote:\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote TYPE=\"CITE\"><tt>This thread is kinda old, but...</tt>\n<p><tt>Judy,</tt>\n<p><tt>Have you played Asheron&#39;s Call.&nbsp; I played it for a little while\nbut</tt>\n<br><tt>really hated some of the major gameplay (fighting) interface issues.</tt>\n<br><tt>Namely, when you go to loot you have to pick up each item</tt>\n<br><tt>individually.&nbsp; As well, there isn&#39;t an easy way to target\nor auto-</tt>\n<br><tt>attack.&nbsp; As well, corpse deterioration was VERY (far too)\nquick and</tt>\n<br><tt>people would take your items (limited left on corpse).&nbsp; It\nis just</tt>\n<br><tt>frustrating dealing with scavengers.&nbsp; Finally, their skills\nsystem is</tt>\n<br><tt>very complex, it offers some nice options, but it is mostly just</tt>\n<br><tt>confusing.&nbsp; I have since deleted my account.</tt>\n<p><tt>However, they had some really nice things that play balance well.&nbsp;\nIn</tt>\n<br><tt>particular, the economy seems stable and self-sustaining.&nbsp;\nEach</tt>\n<br><tt>vendor has a base of items and the only &quot;enhanced&quot; items they sell</tt>\n<br><tt>have been sold to them by players.&nbsp; I really like the &quot;note&quot;\nsystem</tt>\n<br><tt>where you pay a little extra money and get a note instead of carrying</tt>\n<br><tt>around tons of money.&nbsp; Their trade skills offer experience!!!\nAnd</tt>\n<br><tt>trades like cooking actually have rewards such as mana or hp gain.</tt>\n<br><tt>This unto itself was fantastic for RP value!&nbsp; I believe it\nis open</tt>\n<br><tt>ended leveling.&nbsp; You continue to get experience even off the\nlevel 1</tt>\n<br><tt>creatures, although it would take you a RL year to level on them</tt>\n<br><tt>*grin* but this means there are always things to kill, however</tt>\n<br><tt>small.&nbsp; As well, exp is granted based on damage done.&nbsp;\nLoot rights</tt>\n<br><tt>are given to the individual who did the most overall damage.&nbsp;\nBecause</tt>\n<br><tt>each person who does damage gets exp, this alleviates KS and</tt>\n<br><tt>contention between spawn camping, but sometimes leaves healers\nat a</tt>\n<br><tt>disadvantage.&nbsp; As I mentioned, they have a complex skill system\nwhere</tt>\n<br><tt>even a warrior can learn to use magic over time.&nbsp; This is\nnice for</tt>\n<br><tt>the really high level folks I imagine.&nbsp; I also like the way\nequipment</tt>\n<br><tt>is handled, but it could be simplified.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t have\nthe game,</tt>\n<br><tt>check out the ebay auctions because many have pictures of the details</tt>\n<br><tt>on the equipment they offer.&nbsp; The rest I have explained, but\nyou may</tt>\n<br><tt>wish to check it out yourself for the purposes of market study.</tt>\n<p><tt>I, too, have noticed so many folks THING oriented.&nbsp; It really\ngot</tt>\n<br><tt>nasty for a while on Veeshan with KS and people being generally</tt>\n<br><tt>nasty.&nbsp; The server split not long after Kunark came out and\nthings</tt>\n<br><tt>have been FAR better there.&nbsp; We used to have an average of\n2600</tt>\n<br><tt>people online during prime time and now it is down to 1800 or so\nwith</tt>\n<br><tt>many more zones to explore.</tt>\n<p><tt>One thing I have done to keep my interest high is play multiple</tt>\n<br><tt>characters.&nbsp; I have several characters in their 20s and none\nthat are</tt>\n<br><tt>any higher because I spend time exploring, mastering trade skills\nor</tt>\n<br><tt>generally hanging out with my fantastic guild.</tt>\n<p><tt>Speaking of... for anyone interested, I am the Guild Elder and</tt>\n<br><tt>Assistant Guildmaster of the Storm of Blades Guild on Veeshan.&nbsp;\nWe</tt>\n<br><tt>are a small, close-knit guild that values friendship above all\nelse.</tt>\n<br><tt>we welcome new members who seek the same values as we do.&nbsp;\nPlease let</tt>\n<br><tt>me know if you have interest in joining.&nbsp; I realize that for\nmost it</tt>\n<br><tt>would mean starting over, but we will be happy to help out with\ngear</tt>\n<br><tt>and leveling (not necessarily power leveling) if anyone transitioned.</tt>\n<p></p></blockquote>\n</span></blockquote></html>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
