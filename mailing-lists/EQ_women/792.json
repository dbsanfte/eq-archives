The only way to have youself bound close to where you might die is if you can bind yourself and you bind yourself where you are fighting at. I know that there have been talks about bind poitions or items with bind charges for melee classes (similar to gate potions), but I&#39;m not sure if Verrant has gone live with those or not. Remember most of us clerics are always willing to help rez you if your bound far away from your corpse. Check the /who for the zone to get the names of the clerics in the zone before you start fighting if the nearest city is rather far away that way you can send them a tell when you die, most of the time they are quiet willing to help you out.</p><p><br><hr size=\"1\">Do you Yahoo!?<br>\nNew <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rd.yahoo.com/evt=1207/*http://sbc.yahoo.com/\">DSL Internet Access</a> from SBC & Yahoo!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
