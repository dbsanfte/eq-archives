I think it<br/>\nwould be fun to chat with you all sometimes while we<br/>\nplay (battlespam allowing lol) &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not aware of one other than the standard means of<br/>\ncommunicating in game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother problem I think is that some of us dont play<br/>\nthat actively anymore, and many that do are spread out<br/>\nover a nubmer of servers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve mentioned it before but I&#39;ll say it again that I<br/>\nwould love to get together with some people here in<br/>\ngame and chat, or maybe group a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve done a little gaming with nwn and although the<br/>\nengine does not run smoothly on my computer one thing<br/>\nI&#39;ve liked is that I have a regular group that I often<br/>\nget together with on Friday evenings for a session.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve kind of thought that something similar here would<br/>\nbe cool. If anyone had characters that would already<br/>\nmatch up that would be great, or I would be happy to<br/>\ncreate a new toon on whatever server was agreeable and<br/>\ntry to set up a regular, or semi regular time that we<br/>\ncould get together and group.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now I&#39;ve got a lvl 33 Wood Elf Ranger and a lvl<br/>\n1 Iksar Shaman on Xygony, and a lvl 2 Half Elf Bard on<br/>\nChazic Thule (sp), but I&#39;m game for whatever if anyone<br/>\nelse has any interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nHugs,<br/>\nBran<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
