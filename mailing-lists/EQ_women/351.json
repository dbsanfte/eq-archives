He made a dwarven<br/>\ncleric and leveled very quickly to level 9, which is the level at which<br/>\nyou can fight anyone from 1st-17th level.  He then joined frequent dwarf<br/>\nraiding parties that attacked the elf newbies, and killed lots of them.<br/>\nFor some reason, the dwarves and gnomes seemed to have no problem<br/>\nattacking the elves, the but elves never seemed to launch counter<br/>\noffensives.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was a little surprised to admit I enjoyed watching those battles, human<br/>\nvs human has a real draw to it.  My boyfriend&#39;s role was generally to<br/>\nblind and root elves so that smaller dwarf warriors could fall on them and<br/>\nkill them quickly.  However, I also got to see my boyfriend be killed by<br/>\nparties of elves ocassionally.  For example, when fighting the sisters in<br/>\nlesser faydark, some elves started blinding and rooting him and his<br/>\npartner so the NPCs killed them.  Leveling there seems to be very hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately, I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d like Vallon, and my  mind hasn&#39;t changed.<br/>\nIt seems all too vicious to me.  The race wars concept justifies attacking<br/>\nanyone of another race for no reason.  I don&#39;t really want to kill other<br/>\npeople for sport, and I know I&#39;d find it very frustrating if people killed<br/>\nme, trained me, blinded me while I was fighting etc.  It takes hours just<br/>\nto get your corpse back some times on Race Wars.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 18 Aug 1999, Suzanne J.
