I,M \n<br>a youngish, LOL, gramma and I,M addicted to EQ. I play a level 12 High Elf \n<br>Magician on Morell Thule. It,s taken me 3 months to get that far alone as I \n<br>tend to ignore all the screaming little boys and explore and hunt alone. I \n<br>have been wondering about guilds also, and going of to new areas to explore.\n<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I,M not ready to start looking for a guild yet, but from \n<br>listening to conversations and reading lots of forums, I see that you have to \n<br>join to get to places you can,t fight alone.\n<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morell Thule is a fairly new server, so there are lots of lower \n<br>level characters and there is a fair amount of roleplaying on it. If you \n<br>ignore or avoid all the little screamers it,s fun. I,m running out of things \n<br>to hunt in my area so will have to leave soon.\n<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for female friends that don,t play , wow , they are not too \n<br>understanding, they think I have gone off the deep end. So I just don,t tell \n<br>them how much I play any more. I did get my daughter addicted too, so now I \n<br>have someone to talk to about the game..............Roseann in Minnesota</font></font></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
