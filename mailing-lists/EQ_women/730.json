You step into the sacred ring of fire and<br/>\nguardians spawn. As long as you have a person standing in the ring of<br/>\nfire, guardians will spawn fairly regularly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a while eventually a boss spawns, who when you kill, he drops some<br/>\ncool loot.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you stay in the ring of fire more powerful bosses will eventually<br/>\nspawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter about two hours a boss spawns that takes about 24 level 60s to <br/>\nkill. He drops some really neato stuff, including a 50 ac chain <br/>\nbreastplate, and a flowing thought 3 ranged item, and an all/all<br/>\nflowing thought 3 mask with 100 hp/mana and a bunch of stats and 7 resist<br/>\nall.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next boss is even tough, requiring about 40 people to kill. He drops<br/>\nthe same loot as the previous boss.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve never managed to make it to the next boss, we may try tonight.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway it&#39;s pretty fun, and it&#39;s a neat idea, I suspect there are things<br/>\nlike this all throughout Luclin :)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
