You see, we really want to get<br/>\nmarried in the Faydark, because that&#39;s where it all started (we&#39;re wood elf<br/>\nrangers).  I just didn&#39;t like the idea because a)  people could always wander by<br/>\nand interrupt things and b) there is SO much talking traffic going on.  If,<br/>\nhowever, you find a spot where there isn&#39;t anything to kill for as far as the eye<br/>\ncan see, you should be relatively safe. ;)  So, we&#39;re thinking about one of the<br/>\nhighest, most secluded platforms in Kelethin.  Against the background of the sky,<br/>\nwe should be able to get some lovely screen shots.<br/>\n<br/>\nTina, how did that catering thing go? What kinda goodies did you have?<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Bfree2bnkd@...\">Bfree2bnkd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Bfree2bnkd@...\">Bfree2bnkd@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you, Suzanne.  I have actually decided to postpone the nuptuals for a<br/>\n&gt; bit longer so that I may prep better.  I think I have decided on the Arena.<br/>\n&gt; That way everyone can attend with little or no extra ooc talk.  O how I would<br/>\n&gt; love to be able to wear a wedding dress *sigh* maybe someday they will<br/>\n&gt; include that in the game and then I will have to renew my vows.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wendy<br/>\n&gt; (Nkdalthetym)Brell Serillis </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
