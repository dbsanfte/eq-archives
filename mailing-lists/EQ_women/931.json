Apparently, she felt<br/>\nthat she was needed more online than off.  You probably made her<br/>\nfeel as if you didn&#39;t care about her anymore.  Her guildies did.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrankly, at 47 yrs old, I have seen enough fireworks (twice a year<br/>\noff my back deck.)  I have no other family alive except the hubby<br/>\nand the kids.  (And his family is in California.  I don&#39;t go along<br/>\nbecause 5 hour plane rides are bad for my health.)  And parades are<br/>\njust flat-out boring.  I DO have hot, fresh food every night for<br/>\nthe boys.  I am a substitute teacher, part-time grad. student,<br/>\ncomputer repair technician, run 17 yahoo groups and do nutritional<br/>\nconsulting.  I got into EQ so I would have something to talk about<br/>\nwith my boys who are also bored by parades.  Maybe the real world<br/>\njust isn&#39;t as challenging as learning to &quot;swim&quot; underwater in a 3-D<br/>\ncastle.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving them at their father&#39;s, on the weekends, really helps my<br/>\nrelationship with my husband and allows me to have a really clean<br/>\nhouse for two days a week.  He just lets them sit around and watch<br/>\ntv all the time.  At least when they are playing EQ, they are<br/>\nthinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour reminder is well-taken though as my hubby does sometimes feel<br/>\nneglected because I am not ready when he is.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*********** REPLY SEPARATOR  ***********<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 7/6/03 at Dave wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n____Oh, thank goodness your holiday won&#39;t be ruined by the presence<br/>\nof <br/>\n____your family.
