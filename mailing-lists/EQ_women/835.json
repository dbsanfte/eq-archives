If so<br/>\nthat&#39;s where I&#39;m at right now in the game more or<br/>\nless. I&#39;m soulbound there anyway.<br/>\n:o)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat could be an idea though, it is kind of a neat<br/>\nplace. I&#39;m not sure how many people will even come to<br/>\nsomething like this. I expect it to be small. I&#39;m<br/>\nfairly new to the game and don&#39;t know lots of people<br/>\nyet. He has played for much longer but tends to be a<br/>\nloner and solo a lot, at least before he ran into me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be an idea though. Funny I was right there<br/>\nand didn&#39;t even think of it. Of course, there are so<br/>\nmany places I haven&#39;t been yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for guilds I sort of have this feeling that its a<br/>\nbit tacky to go around asking. On the other hand I<br/>\nreally want to try that part of the game out.<br/>\nMaybe I don&#39;t have enough escapades.<br/>\n:o)<br/>\n<br/>\nHugs,<br/>\n:o)<br/>\nBrangvyne<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Suzanne J.

If you have any concerns about<br/>\n&gt; guests&#39; safety, ask some of your &#39;wedding party&#39; to<br/>\n&gt; be &#39;ushers&#39;, ie., escort your guests from Qeynos. <br/>\n&gt; Or have a wizard &#39;port &#39;em in.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My fiance and I were both rangers.  We were very<br/>\n&gt; effective at taunting; once one&#39;d take too much<br/>\n&gt; damage, the other would start taunting madly. <br/>\n&gt; &#39;Course, the roles may have changed in the past<br/>\n&gt; year...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Guilds, eh... they&#39;re nice if you&#39;ve joined one<br/>\n&gt; because you regularly adventure with many of its<br/>\n&gt; members, but I never personally advertised for a<br/>\n&gt; guild.  I tended to let my escapades take me where<br/>\n&gt; they would (as an elven ranger when Povar was first<br/>\n&gt; new, there was A LOT of escapade) and ran into my<br/>\n&gt; guild brethren when hunting.

I&#39;ve made a <br/>\n&gt;   couple of good friends who are more experienced<br/>\n&gt; then me and don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;   seem to mind giving advice or helping out so<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s very nice.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;ve also been trying to learn more about my role<br/>\n&gt; as a Ranger in <br/>\n&gt;   Norrath. I just found out last week what a handy<br/>\n&gt; thing taunt can be <br/>\n&gt;   when trying to keep a mob off your healer? OK, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; slow but I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt;   getting there I think. And I&#39;ve gotten duel wield<br/>\n&gt; and double attack <br/>\n&gt;   now so that&#39;s interesting to play with.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Last night a Druid friend and I went to Paudal<br/>\n&gt; Cavern for my first <br/>\n&gt;   trip there. I would have died twice during the<br/>\n&gt; first fight we had I <br/>\n&gt;   think if they had not been there to keep me from<br/>\n&gt; deaths door. That <br/>\n&gt;   was a tough mob and red all the way for me at lvl<br/>\n&gt; 19 (20 now).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Anyway, enough ramblin, so it&#39;s question time:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   1.) I have been asked to get married and have said<br/>\n&gt; yes. :o) Any good <br/>\n&gt;   suggestions on locations that would be nice but<br/>\n&gt; not to hard for <br/>\n&gt;   guests to get to? He has a place in mind, I forget<br/>\n&gt; the name, but it <br/>\n&gt;   sounds like it might be hard for lower level<br/>\n&gt; characters to even <br/>\n&gt;   reach. I have not traveled over much of Norrath<br/>\n&gt; still so I&#39;m not <br/>\n&gt;   sure. Anyway, if anyone has ideas I&#39;d love to hear<br/>\n&gt; them.<br/>\n&gt;   Also, when things are set, which may be a while<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll post a note here <br/>\n&gt;   letting everyone know. You are all invited, of<br/>\n&gt; course, feel free to <br/>\n&gt;   come if you have a character on the Xegony server,<br/>\n&gt; of if you want <br/>\n&gt;   just create a quick one at the proper time and<br/>\n&gt; come anyway. I&#39;d love <br/>\n&gt;   to meet anyone who might do me the honor of<br/>\n&gt; coming.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   2.) Can anyone give me advice on how to find a<br/>\n&gt; guild that might be <br/>\n&gt;   interested in letting a Ranger in the low 20&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; join? Would it be ok <br/>\n&gt;   to just kind of start asking around? Is there a<br/>\n&gt; way to tell a better <br/>\n&gt;   guild from one not as good?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Anyway, I hope everyone had a nice Thanksgiving.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Hugs<br/>\n&gt;   :o)<br/>\n&gt;   Bran<br/>\n&gt;   lvl 20 Wood Elf Ranger<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
