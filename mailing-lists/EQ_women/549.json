I havne&#39;t checked my em-ail in like a week and a hlf, so I had <br/>\na 134 message backlog. =( Anyhow... Some info on me. *drumroll*<br/>\n<br/>\nI play Gikkwiny Triseyed on the Quellious Server. I am level 23 and a <br/>\nbubble, and I am a warrior. I&#39;m also one of the rarest sex/race/classes, <br/>\nbeing a female Halfling warrior. You don&#39;t know how often I get clarity <br/>\nsince I&#39;m a halfling.. you would think they would notice the CRAFTED (anyone <br/>\nhigh enough to cast clarity HSOULD know what crafted looks like.. ) and even <br/>\nafter inspecting me, they still cast it.. LOL...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, I am in one of the best guilds (in my opinon) in EQ... I&#39;m in Far <br/>\nDareis Mai. Everyone in our guild is female (yes, I know there are probably <br/>\nguys playing girl chars, but a high majority are female). We have no real <br/>\nsquabbling, and we all have fun, which is the most important thing. It&#39;s <br/>\ngreat to go into a zone and you see a guildmate, and you can always be <br/>\nassured a friendly hello, or if you need help, the high levels in the guild <br/>\nwill do what they can.. (not to mention if they just HAPPEN to have a <br/>\ncrafted bracer or silvery axe around and you need them, they&#39;ll giveit to <br/>\nyou )=P But they are all really sweet... If you have a char on Qull and wish <br/>\nto join, let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a master fletcher, and I would say it&#39;s worth it... IF you are a class <br/>\nthat can use arrows. to about a 90 skill level, it&#39;s pretty much break <br/>\neven.. I think it MIGHT take 20 plat. You just keep combining the cheapest <br/>\ncomponents.. (don&#39;t worry about combinations, as long as you have an arrow <br/>\ntip, fletches, a nock, and a shaft, it&#39;ll combine) but after you hit about <br/>\n90, come of the components start costing 8 or 9 gold. Now, the reason why <br/>\nfletching is worth being such a money sink is that with a &quot;bad&quot; skill in <br/>\narchery, a longbow, and the regualr arrows you buy form mechants, I was <br/>\ndoing 2-5 damage with a bow, unless I critical hit. Now, with a carved <br/>\nashwood bow and Class 3 bone point arrows, I do 20 damage... so (even though <br/>\nit&#39;s difficult) I can actually kite with arrows... (btw, making magical <br/>\narrows costs about 10 pp or more for just 5 arrows, so that&#39;s not goint to <br/>\nhappen for a LONG time. ))<br/>\n<br/>\nthe worst thing about being a warrior is the horendous downtime, and that <br/>\nyou can&#39;t really solo over 20... You are conastantly dependant on others. <br/>\nOne of the perks, though, is watching the casters run around in cirlces with <br/>\na mob behind them going &quot;Help me! Help me!&quot; when two seconds ago they were <br/>\ntelling you how they could servive on their own.. =P Also, a lot of the <br/>\nother classes think that melee classes should be rolling in cash since they <br/>\ndon&#39;t have to buy spells... well, just an FYI, but I have only had over 200 <br/>\nplat ONCE. what happens is, I finally build up a moderate stash, then comes <br/>\nthe time to buy armor components, or jewels, or work on a trade skill, then <br/>\nI&#39;m back to having only 10 p in the bank. =(<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing I don&#39;t get is lately, mor and more newbies are ansking me <br/>\nto twink/powerlevel them. As in regards to the twink issue, I&#39;m level 22, <br/>\nand i&#39;m wearing bronze boots. I won&#39;t twink you, unless your level 10 and <br/>\nstill wearing cloth. There is nothing sillerier then a halfling with orange <br/>\nfeet. (they do not change the foot graphic for halflings when they put on <br/>\nboots, they just tint the feet. That means I have bright orange feet and <br/>\ndark orange nail polish).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Powerleveling, I have no clue HOW a warrior is supposed to PL <br/>\nsomeone.. I can&#39;t heal, I can&#39;t buff, all I could possibly do is make sure <br/>\nyou won&#39;t die, but that&#39;s a guard service, not PLing... *sighs* Ah, well... <br/>\nI&#39;m done ranting now... Talk to you all later!<br/>\n<br/>\nGikkwiny Triseyed<br/>\nWarrior od the 23rd Blade<br/>\nQuellious Server<br/>\nFAR DAREIS MAI<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
