I&#39;m glad you haven&#39;t had<br/>\n&gt; too many problems.

Maybe it&#39;s the whole<br/>\n&gt; cleric<br/>\n&gt; &gt;thing, I dunno.  On the other hand, I DID meet one of the best roleplayers<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; &gt;ever seen on that server, and after he rescued me from a pretty hairy<br/>\n&gt; &gt;situation, he gave me patchwork leggings....unsolicited! He had just<br/>\n&gt; upgraded<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and appreciated my roleplaying and effusive gratitude and thought I was<br/>\n&gt; worthy.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&lt;shrugs&gt;  Nothing like that had ever happened to me on Povar.  The PvP<br/>\n&gt; server<br/>\n&gt; &gt;wasn&#39;t what I expected, I must say, and neither was playing a Dark elf<br/>\n&gt; &gt;character.  It&#39;s actually been a good experience!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sara, Povar<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Valdaya, Rallos Zek<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;MJ Solomon wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; From: &quot;MJ Solomon&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mjsol@...\">mjsol@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; My RL friend plays on Rallos Zek. He doesn&#39;t SAY he wants me to play<br/>\n&gt; there,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; but he keeps asking about the character I made on that server.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyway Saturday I spent level 2 being chased by a &quot;female&quot; character<br/>\n&gt; named<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Typehere in the newbie area outside Kelethin. It was annoying, though<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; there&#39;s no reason to whine and complain if you are playing on Rallos Zek.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; But I just no for certain that Typehere was NOT a real female.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; So I&#39;m asking if there ARE any real females on Rallos Zek. I told my<br/>\n&gt; friend<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; no, he said he thought there were.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyone here play there? How do you put up with the annoyances? I&#39;m as<br/>\n&gt; tough<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; as anyone, but the game is challenging enough as it is, without worrying<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; about &quot;Typeheres.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Looking to expand your world?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ONElist has 170,000 e-mail communities from which to choose!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;How many communities do you think join ONElist each week?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;More than 5,000!
