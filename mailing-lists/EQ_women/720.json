My characters were:<br/>\n<br/>\nDruid - 54<br/>\nBard - 36<br/>\nNecromancer - 29<br/>\nCleric - 22<br/>\nWizard - 22<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m playing Dark Ages of Camelot now for a change of pace and FINALLY picked<br/>\nmy primary character - an Armswoman.  She&#39;s my first tank and it&#39;s really fun<br/>\nto have hit points and actually care about armor and weapons.  I am one last<br/>\nstep away from my crossbow quest but still need 3 levels to acquire the skill.<br/>\n I play in Albion on Percival.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and Christina, I did get my Warden to 4 on Morgan Le Fay, but after my<br/>\nfrist RvR experience, gonna try to settle on one character until I can do some<br/>\ndamage.  Hibernia took two of our keeps and made an assault on Snowdonia<br/>\nStation so there was a massive call to arms.  At 11 all I could do was<br/>\ninterrupt their lowest caster and I didn&#39;t succeed in doing that more than<br/>\nonce *sigh*  Our RvR leadership is PATHETIC!  But it was a lot of fun<br/>\nnonetheless.<br/>\n<br/>\nIce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHail Idaini: <br/>\nI play a 7 lvl cleric on Cazic Thule. Just started<br/>\nplaying a couple of weeks ago. Now am moving, will<br/>\nhave computer set up next week, have many questions<br/>\nabout Norrath. Thanks for joining list.
