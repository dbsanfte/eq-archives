Still need to find that<br/>\npristine dragon scale though.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the Misty Thicket one is much harder than finding<br/>\nthis one I&#39;m either very unlucky, or I feel for anyone<br/>\ntrying it. I have searched and searched, I have no<br/>\nidea how many Forest Draklings I&#39;ve killed but at<br/>\nleast several dozen and I have yet to come across a<br/>\nsingle Pristine scale except for the one I bought from<br/>\nsomeone else and then lost.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s good to know that it&#39;s a no fail task, but I&#39;m<br/>\nnot sure what you mean by the level being &lt;=20. Does<br/>\nthat mean if my sewing skill goes above 20 I can&#39;t<br/>\nmake it any more? It&#39;s 19 now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s kind of funny thinking about it since apparently<br/>\nI managed to find a way to fail the no fail quest.<br/>\n:o)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thanks for all your help.<br/>\n<br/>\n:o)<br/>\nBrangvyne<br/>\nlvl 13 Wood Elf Ranger<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Kristina Fiero &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kauthu@...\">kauthu@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; the sewing/smithing levels for all newbie armor is<br/>\n&gt; &lt;=20 but its also No Fail, which means you&#39;ll always<br/>\n&gt; suceed in your attempts at creating newbie armor. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Misty Thicket is the newbie zone for the Halflings<br/>\n&gt; they have a different type of drakling that they<br/>\n&gt; need scales from and only spawn every 30 minns and<br/>\n&gt; theres only about a 25% chance that the draklings<br/>\n&gt; will even have a scale let alone one of the 3<br/>\n&gt; different special types that you need, plus their<br/>\n&gt; pristine scales (the very rare drop off this rare<br/>\n&gt; spawn) is no drop so its much much harder to get the<br/>\n&gt; newbie tunics for rangers and rogues over there. So<br/>\n&gt; far I&#39;ve done just about all the newbie armor quests<br/>\n&gt; for almost every race/class combo so if anyone has<br/>\n&gt; questions just let me know.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; New DSL Internet Access from SBC & Yahoo!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
