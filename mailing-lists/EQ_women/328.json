The disadvantage was not being able","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-56247166\">CONGRATULATIONS!<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night when the East Coast router was down, Corellon could not get on so we<br/>\nchatted in Yahoo instead.  The disadvantage was not being able to look into his<br/>\neyes.  The advantage was no interruptive shouts, casting, ooc, auctions etc.<br/>\n*grin*  We discussed the honeymoon and both agreed &quot;PG&quot; and he said he is not a<br/>\nminor *really, a BIG concern on my part* so we can play it a little more adult<br/>\n*grin*.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the RL thing, we both share the same fear.  We got into it a little, out<br/>\nof curiousity, neither of us wanting to lose the fun of the roleplay.  He guessed<br/>\nI was 21 *bwahahahahahah*  I don&#39;t think knowing he was off by 25 years was the<br/>\nbest news he heard all night, but on the other hand the roleplay at the time went<br/>\nwell.  And we had a good time travelling back to Freeport, but got disconnected<br/>\nonce there as he smiths and orders started pouring in as soon as he showed up on<br/>\n/w and I got about 10 requests for binds and had bows and arrows to sell and and<br/>\nand - it was like being in a busy city - I hated it *grin*.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still don&#39;t know if it has an effect.  This morning started out okay, then he<br/>\nannounced he thinks our characters are on the wrong servers and we should bring<br/>\nthe humans to Vallon since he doesn&#39;t want to be a warrior and lose his favorite<br/>\nweapon to another player (MEN!).  I was TOTALLY disappointed as I like my<br/>\nBarbarian shaman a lot, even if she is only 4.  And before we had a chance to<br/>\ntalk, he went afk, then returned with &quot;gotta go&quot; which is more abrupt than<br/>\nnormal.  An old friend had just popped in out of nowhere.  So I suddently felt<br/>\nlike it HAD mattered, and also feel like I&quot;m overly paranoid.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe good news is I switched to Quellious, met up with one of my bridesmaids and<br/>\nher ranger friend, we hunted and the more I thought the more I realized it was<br/>\njust bad timing.  Well, this couple (though not anything but friends they protest<br/>\noverly much all the time *grin*) is also human on Vallon so I think I&#39;ll honor<br/>\nCor&#39;s request and we&#39;ll move our humans there only instead of being a cleric to<br/>\nhis monk, I&#39;m going to be a Druid and Sibonay&#39;s little sister.  Her friend,<br/>\nTenadar on Quellious is a  monk, Andus, so we&#39;d be matched couples. And now it<br/>\nsounds kind of fun.  As all four of us roleplay, we should have a blast.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if it does affect the roleplay then it is better to find out now, right?  The<br/>\nproblem is if one partner wants it to evolve into more than it can ever be and<br/>\nthe other does not.  As it can&#39;t on my part, that was my concern (leading him<br/>\nalong) and that being settled is probably important.  And if he starts sleeping<br/>\ninstead of playing with me, it&#39;s probabaly a good thing too.<br/>\n<br/>\nDnaice, Trisango, Troxfo<br/>\n<br/>\n(RP doesn&#39;t escape any of the complexities of RL, does it &lt;well other than the<br/>\ntoilet thing&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:weya@...\">weya@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:weya@...\">weya@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Greetings everyone!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;ooc&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well it seems I may have spoken just a bit too soon, lol!<br/>\n&gt;  Yesterday I wrote that I expected to have to face the<br/>\n&gt; honeymoon roleplay eventually.

I<br/>\n&gt; think I was just too excited being *betrothed* to think<br/>\n&gt; clearly on all the details.  And oh! there&#39;s so many<br/>\n&gt; details. &lt;mind races&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It was sooooo romantic.  He secretly planned to have two<br/>\n&gt; of our closest friends there to witness.  And then he<br/>\n&gt; recited a beautiful poem to me ... the last line of which<br/>\n&gt; was &quot;Will you marry me, we&#39;d make quite a pair&quot;.  I sat<br/>\n&gt; stunned for a moment, then blurted out &quot;Really?&quot; (what a<br/>\n&gt; fool I felt later).  It took me some doing to find my<br/>\n&gt; voice and answer &quot;YES&quot; ... poor fellow had to sit there<br/>\n&gt; and wait while I got my brain to working again. &lt;s&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyways, I could ramble on and on ... so I&#39;ll spare you<br/>\n&gt; all. :-)  Once we have the wedding details ironed out, I<br/>\n&gt; shall let you all know ... for of course, you&#39;re all<br/>\n&gt; invited. &lt;s&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Safe travels,<br/>\n&gt; Wynsong<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; P.S. - Dnaice, I shall try very hard to attend your<br/>\n&gt; wedding. :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; ~~~ Remember that our illusion of control is just<br/>\n&gt; that ... an illusion ~~~<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:weya@...\">weya@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:weya@...\">weya@...</a><br/>\n&gt; ICQ#1976509<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ___<br/>\n&gt; &gt;____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ___<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Message: 9<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Date: Thu, 05 Aug 1999 11:41:54 -0700<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   From: Judy Tyrer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:judy3t@...\">judy3t@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: Marriage<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;It is so interesting to read one another&#39;s experiences.  We are starting<br/>\n&gt; to talk a bit more<br/>\n&gt; &gt;about RL, he has a Golden Retriever, lives in VA, etc.  He knows<br/>\n&gt; I am a CS and AI is my hobby<br/>\n&gt; &gt;(I explained I had learned why he runs around in circles and then<br/>\n&gt; disappers and his brain<br/>\n&gt; &gt;went into overdrive *smile*).  I suspect he may be a student as he<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t have &quot;regular&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;work hours, but then I&#39;m &quot;on the beach&quot; at work since the recent<br/>\n&gt; take-over obsoleted my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;technology so one never really knows *smile*.   I did make my first<br/>\n&gt; reference to &quot;our&quot; when<br/>\n&gt; &gt;discussing missing my dog (OES, she died 2 mos. ago) and he didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; cringe outwardly.  Didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;comment either so it could have gone right over his head.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Okay, I&#39;m neurotic.  I&#39;m afraid if he finds out I&#39;m a married mother<br/>\n&gt; of 2 he might lose<br/>\n&gt; &gt;interest and he is the most fun part of the game.  *sigh*  This is<br/>\n&gt; worse then RL.  Oh, and as<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for the toilets, I noticed their lack when I got drunk and needed<br/>\n&gt; to throw up.  There was no<br/>\n&gt; &gt;place to puke!  Very embarassing.  And as my aclohol level is 3,<br/>\n&gt; the wedding party itself may<br/>\n&gt; &gt;be a disaster.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The honeymoon will definitely be PG.

The wedding is Sunday, Aug. 7 at the Temple of Marr (outside)<br/>\n&gt; in N.

When we roleplay we do it in talk rather than say - but our<br/>\n&gt; /ems have been known to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;produce a lot of puking and &quot;Get a room&quot; comments from those around<br/>\n&gt; us *smile*<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:weya@...\">weya@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:weya@...\">weya@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Dnaice,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; You bring up a bridge that I know I will have to cross eventually<br/>\n&gt; as well.  My character,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Wynsong, is very serious about a high elf named Rezok on Fenin<br/>\n&gt; Ro.  OOC, I know very<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; little about the person behind the character save that he&#39;s male,<br/>\n&gt; a few years younger<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; than me, and married (his r/l wife plays a character that is like<br/>\n&gt; a big sister to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Wynsong).  Because I&#39;m very happily married in r/l, very soon into<br/>\n&gt; the rp &quot;relationship&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I set some expectations that the relationship was rp-only ... which<br/>\n&gt; his response was &quot;of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; course&quot;  (what a relief that was).  I felt stupid bringing it up<br/>\n&gt; at all, but after some<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; experiences in Realm where ppl wanted the char&#39;s relationship to<br/>\n&gt; spill over to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; players, I learned to speak up front to avoid sticky situations<br/>\n&gt; later.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; As for the honeymoon ... you can rp that any way you wish.  It<br/>\n&gt; depends upon what &quot;rating&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;g&gt; you want that portion of the rp to be.  It can simply be the<br/>\n&gt; two of you &quot;retire&quot; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the honeymoon suite and then chat about the weather while everyone<br/>\n&gt; accepts that it&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; wedding night.  You could decide to go on a trip to a &quot;romantic&quot;<br/>\n&gt; spot in Norrath and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; hunt, explore, etc.  Or if you wish, you could take the roleplay<br/>\n&gt; further ....   To me,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the roleplaying is about how the character(s) is perceived in Norrath.<br/>\n&gt;  So that doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mean I have to roleplay every single detail.  Heck, we don&#39;t roleplay<br/>\n&gt; going to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; bathroom or showering or any of the hundreds of mundane (or not<br/>\n&gt; so mundane) personal<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; things we do irl.  Personally, my honeymoon will probably be rated<br/>\n&gt; pg to pg-13 &lt;g&gt; ...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Disney would prolly be able to put it in one of their movies, lol.<br/>\n&gt;  But the concept of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; honeymoon will be there<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; for everyone (us, friends, &quot;family&quot;) ... and that&#39;s the important<br/>\n&gt; part.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; As a side note ... I did have a marriage on Realm and while the<br/>\n&gt; characters were<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; roleplaying their &quot;true love&quot; for the world ... the other player<br/>\n&gt; and I would be /t&#39;ing<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; each other chatting about all kinds of &lt;ic&gt; and &lt;ooc&gt; stuff.  When<br/>\n&gt; it came time for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; honeymoon, we retired to the bedroom while our friends partied<br/>\n&gt; in the next room ... and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; just joked around and chatted some more.  For the role play, we<br/>\n&gt; had gone to the marriage<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; bed ... for us, the players, we had not crossed any lines that<br/>\n&gt; would complicate our<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; personal r/l relationships.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Ok, well I&#39;ve rambled enough.  Thanks for putting up with it as<br/>\n&gt; I thought through my own<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; eventual situation.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hey, btw ...

In<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; particular, er, how does one roleplay a honeymoon *smile*.  Unlike<br/>\n&gt; many who<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; develop relationships in Norrath, my beloved and I are unknown<br/>\n&gt; to one another in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; RL.  For all I know he weighs 300 pounds, guzzles beer, and is<br/>\n&gt; hygenically<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; challenged *smile*<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; There are times if I wonder if this is a positive thing to be<br/>\n&gt; doing.  I mean,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; what if he is some starry eyed adolescent and I ruin him for<br/>\n&gt; life *grin*.  I know<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; MY lines are clearly drawn in fuzz (okay, I think I know the<br/>\n&gt; difference between<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; reality and fantasy though I swear I saw a Pixie Trickster in<br/>\n&gt; the airport the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; other day *grin*).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Anyway, this is all fun and games and I am having fun.  But there<br/>\n&gt; is this part in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the back of my mind that wonders.  Because unlike reading romance<br/>\n&gt; novels (blech -<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; persish the thought) there is another person involved in my little<br/>\n&gt; fantasy and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; must never forget that.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Any other hard core role players out there struggle with these<br/>\n&gt; ridiculous<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; issues?
