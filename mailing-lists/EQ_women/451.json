I find that when I<br/>\nhave told them in the past, they become overly<br/>\nflirtatous and it gets in the way of what I find fun<br/>\nin the game. If I&#39;m taken for a guy, I just go with<br/>\nit. BTW, all my characters are female just because<br/>\nthat&#39;s what I feel comfortable with. :)<br/>\nI don&#39;t really flirt with any of the other characters<br/>\neither unless they start it because I have been<br/>\naccused in the past of being homosexual (Like that&#39;s a<br/>\nreally horrible thing to begin with...)because the<br/>\nother person just wouldn&#39;t believe I was a female,<br/>\nwhich bothered me just because I really am female, you<br/>\nknow?. <br/>\nI&#39;d rather just be called bro and leave it at that. :)<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
