One of the things I&#39;d like to set up is a petition to get<br/>\n&gt; less revealing clothing options for everquest characters.  In particular,<br/>\n&gt; I think you should be able to set your newbie (naked) clothing to be something<br/>\n&gt; better than, for example, a dark elf bikini.  It would also be nice if you<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t have to wear plate mail before you could get armor that didn&#39;t look<br/>\n&gt; like fine mesh with an exposed neckline.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d want this to be an online petition, maybe associated with one of the<br/>\n&gt; Everquest websites.  Does anyone know if any of those sites have those<br/>\n&gt; sorts of things? I&#39;ve seen lots of &#39;polls&#39; (but really I don&#39;t want to do<br/>\n&gt; this as a poll, otherwise all the 16 year old boys will vote no).  I want<br/>\n&gt; something where you can submit a form I guess.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Christina<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Books, music, auctions, and more.
