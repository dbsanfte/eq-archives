I&#39;ve been RPGing<br/>\n&gt; since I was 11 years old (started in pre D&D era), and since D&D, AD&D,<br/>\n&gt; Traveller, ICE, GURPS etc ... all came out when I was in high school to<br/>\n&gt; college I pen & paper RPed/GMed/DMed a lot back then.  I ran an all-female<br/>\n&gt; group around 20 years ago in my college hometown which at one time included<br/>\n&gt; my then 80-90-year-old (passed away now) conservative German immigrant<br/>\n&gt; grandmother.  She would visit and I really got to ask &quot;Canasta or D&D?&quot;. :)<br/>\n&gt;  I also ran mixed and male-only (except for me) groups.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Due to time contraints of job and children I haven&#39;t done pencil & paper<br/>\n&gt; games for at well over a decade, but do play on-line!  I&#39;ve played other<br/>\n&gt; on-line RPGs (but not UO for more than 1 week) for years, and am now<br/>\n&gt; playing in EQ.  Since I never have enough time ... my characters &quot;never<br/>\n&gt; amount to much&quot;.  But I have fun!  My almost teen daughter has played<br/>\n&gt; on-line with me in two other RPGs (supervised), and helps with the EQ<br/>\n&gt; character creation.  If I can ever get ADSL here, we&#39;ll be a mother &<br/>\n&gt; daughter team on-line. :) Sometimes I think we have as much fun coming up<br/>\n&gt; with the ideas for a character as actually playing them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I like to experiment with character ideas and right now have no &quot;main&quot;<br/>\n&gt; character.  So far I like Enchanter & Bard.  Though my Necromancer is<br/>\n&gt; surprisingly fun to play.  I sort of enjoy the amazement (do they even<br/>\n&gt; belive me?) when I claim that it REALLY is a female player behind this<br/>\n&gt; female character.  I know thay don&#39;t belive me when I tell many of the<br/>\n&gt; college age males that I&#39;ve been playing/running RPGs longer than they&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; been alive (and I&#39;m female). ;)  I mainly play on Erollisi Marr, but<br/>\n&gt; occasionally play on the Test Server.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Lora<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; P.S.<br/>\n&gt; My husband tolerates us well (he&#39;s not an RPGer), and I&#39;m waiting to see if<br/>\n&gt; my son got &quot;the gene&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At the moment:<br/>\n&gt; Starling, Lisonja, Ainsley, Meute, Mitte, Shaelie & Leontine<br/>\n&gt; on Erollisi Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Campaign 2000 is here!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Discuss your thoughts; get informed at ONElist.
