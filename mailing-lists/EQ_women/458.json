It&#39;s a chronic<br/>\nstruggle and I consider EQ an addiction with a WHOLE LOT of<br/>\nrationalization why I can play it.   If he is playing the raids on Fear<br/>\nand Hate and the dragon raids then he really is committing himself for<br/>\nthe duration of the raid.  At the earlier levels one can log on and log<br/>\noff pretty freely as there is less coordination with other people.  But<br/>\nthe raids require commitment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he IS level 50, he doesn&#39;t really have to play every night.  He is at<br/>\nthe maximum level.  One suggestion would be to set aside one night a<br/>\nweek as &quot;date night&quot; where the two of you spend time together.  And,<br/>\nyes, you might look into getting your own EQ account.  It really doesn&#39;t<br/>\ncost that much.  Not so you can spend more time playing with him as much<br/>\nas so you can learn a bit more about the environment and community.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr just hang out with him.  There is enough downtime in the game that I<br/>\noften read a book while other watch TV while playing.  It is interrupted<br/>\nconversation, but it is possible to have.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, good luck.  I don&#39;t know that there is a solution,<br/>\nhonestly.  If I had a real life group like SCA I might enjoy that more.<br/>\nI suspect it is a LOT healthier.  &lt;sigh&gt;  Oh well, good luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nIceiallana Forestfury<br/>\nBrell<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer McNitt wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Jennifer McNitt &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jenmcnitt@...\">jenmcnitt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was just wondering how you all balance playing EQ with real life<br/>\n&gt; roles/duties.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not actually a EQ player myself, but my husband is.  Since he<br/>\n&gt; started to<br/>\n&gt; play EQ (over 6 months ago), we haven&#39;t done as much as we used to<br/>\n&gt; together.<br/>\n&gt; Before EQ he played Ultima Online but was able to log whenever he felt<br/>\n&gt; like<br/>\n&gt; it in that game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With EQ it seems like he has to be on longer to get anywhere in the<br/>\n&gt; game and<br/>\n&gt; he isn&#39;t able to log whenever he wants to.  He is a level 50 ranger<br/>\n&gt; and is<br/>\n&gt; in the Plain of Fear a lot right now.  Due to the spawn rates he has<br/>\n&gt; to stay<br/>\n&gt; up late, and be online every day.  He even has taken off work<br/>\n&gt; periodically<br/>\n&gt; to be in the game more.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know a lot of the game just because it is mostly all of what we talk<br/>\n&gt; about<br/>\n&gt; right now.  :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I understand online role playing as I ran my own computer BBS for over<br/>\n&gt; 5<br/>\n&gt; years.  I was an avid MUD/MUSH player myself for a while and did play<br/>\n&gt; Ultima<br/>\n&gt; Online for a bit too.   My husband and I actually meet on my BBS when<br/>\n&gt; I was<br/>\n&gt; on college dated for about 3 years and have been married 3 1/2 years.<br/>\n&gt; We<br/>\n&gt; are both avid computer game players.  Due to life/new hobbies/etc. I<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; been in online games myself for the past 3 years.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I really don&#39;t mind him playing EQ as I know it is what he likes to<br/>\n&gt; do.  We<br/>\n&gt; have an understanding that I let him play EQ and I spend my free time<br/>\n&gt; doing<br/>\n&gt; SCA (medieval re-inactment group) activities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For Christmas all he wanted was anything EQ related.  He also tells me<br/>\n&gt; if I<br/>\n&gt; want to spend more time with him, that I should get a EQ account<br/>\n&gt; myself (we<br/>\n&gt; have a home network which would make this possible). :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was just wondering how others balance their life with their<br/>\n&gt; significant<br/>\n&gt; others and EQ playing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jen<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get 100% FREE Internet Access powered by Excite<br/>\n&gt; Visit <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://freeworld.excite.com\">http://freeworld.excite.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
