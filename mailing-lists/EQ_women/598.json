(Of course, neither proc YET, but I keep<br/>\nhoping - haven&#39;t tried the lariat in awhile).

It&#39;s a pretty cool<br/>\nranger only sword, that procs a root that does some damage.  It&#39;s<br/>\nconsidered a good low level ranger weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nAround 30-40 level many prefer switching to an Electrum Bladed Wakizatci<br/>\n(or two).  This sword has a better damage ratio, and is very light and<br/>\nfast.  This is the one you need the fangs for.<br/>\n<br/>\nAround level 40-50 most rangers try and pick up Yakeshas and a flowing<br/>\nblack silk sash.  Yakesha is a very popular weapon, with the same ratio as<br/>\nthe EBW and a nice 75 point damage proc.  EBWs are IMHO almost as good<br/>\nhowever, and you&#39;re fine with a pair of those at 50.<br/>\n<br/>\nA good two handed sword will have better damage output than dual wielding<br/>\nup to around level 35 or so.  It depends on your weapons though.  Some<br/>\ngood two handed ranger weapons are:<br/>\n   - Axe of the iron black (Found commonly in Kunark, sold for a couple<br/>\nhundred plat I believe.  This puppy really owns, it is good to 40th level<br/>\nfor sure. Pick one up.)<br/>\n   - Shiny Brass Halberds (SBH) and Blackened Iron Bastard Swords (BIBS)<br/>\nare good up to level 30 or so.<br/>\n   - I&#39;m not really up to date on all the crazy Kunark weapons, I know<br/>\nthere are a lot of powerful ones around now<br/>\n<br/>\nPixy, level 52 Ranger (Retired), Brell Serilis<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Thu, 19 Oct 2000, Suzanne J.

He has no<br/>\ntrouble getting groups anymore.  A lot of the flack is over and it has<br/>\nturned into a huge joke.   I get some grief for being a ranger, but there<br/>\nare only 22 of us on the new server (giggles) and since casters outnumber<br/>\ntanks 3:1 now, anyone who can tank is wanted for groups.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   As for kicking the habit, congratulatoins.
