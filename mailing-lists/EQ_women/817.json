So far I&#39;ve done just about all the newbie armor quests for almost every race/class combo so if anyone has questions just let me know.</p><p><br><hr size=\"1\">Do you Yahoo!?<br>\nNew <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rd.yahoo.com/evt=1207/*http://sbc.yahoo.com/\">DSL Internet Access</a> from SBC & Yahoo!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
