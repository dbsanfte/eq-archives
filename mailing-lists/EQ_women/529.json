That is sick.  I can t belive folks would do that.  And then when you get to 14 they will be begging you to group to get SOW s.  Heck I had folks tell me","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-91707996\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; I envy you being a 14 lv druid,  when I tell people I am ONLY lv 6,<br/>\n&gt; nobody wants to group with me!  :(<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That is sick.  I can&#39;t belive folks would do that.  And then when you<br/>\nget to 14 they will be begging you to group to get SOW&#39;s.  Heck I had<br/>\nfolks tell me to dump my husband ( the only one I really group with now<br/>\n) and group with them and then have a fit when I tell them no.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As far as grouping,  I have only been in 3 different groups for any<br/>\n&gt; length of time (1-6 hours)<br/>\n&gt; The first group didn&#39;t know what they were doing.  Of course, neither<br/>\n&gt; did I but they abandoned me in Lesser Feydark AND didn&#39;t split the &gt;loot fair<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>OW!!!  Then they wounder why you don&#39;t want to group with them or why<br/>\nyou want to loot to.  I have gotten &quot;why do you want it, you can&#39;t use<br/>\nit&quot;  I tell them to sell so I can buy those great spells you want me to<br/>\ncast on you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The second group I was with was great!  They were mostly lowbies (more<br/>\n&gt; experienced players with fairly low level characters).  Lots of fun, &gt;and they really helped me out with strategies and not getting lost &gt;(dumb blonde syndrome!)  I don&#39;t believe in twinking (sp?) but it is &gt;nice to get advice from more experienced folks.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*giggles* I&#39;m have red hair and I get lost all them time.  Got lost big<br/>\ntime in Lavastorm the other night.  All I can say is that the Wood Queen<br/>\n( can&#39;t remember the goddess of druids name ) for SOW and Lev.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My advice for grouping-make sure everyone agrees on plan of action<br/>\n&gt; before you start-including where to go, what to hunt, any quests &gt;people are on, and order of looting.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>That is the best advice I have heard in a long time.  And I&#39;ll give one<br/>\ntoo.  When someone new comes into a group and you have broken the spawn<br/>\n( ex - the small Drev camp in North Ro ) Don&#39;t get talked into moving by<br/>\nthem.  I have died more times because the others wanted to follow a fool<br/>\nlike that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRanalla the Lost Druid of Prexus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
