I don&#39;t know too <br/>\n&gt; much about them, but there seem to be some interesting ones, like <br/>\n&gt; Neverwinter Nights, which will not be massively multiplayer, but <br/>\n&gt; allow you to adventure with a few friends like AD&D, or  Shadowbane <br/>\n&gt; (sounds to PK-friendly to me) and Dark Age of Camelot. I know there <br/>\n&gt; are others, including futuristic ones. And then, of course, there is <br/>\n&gt; EQ2.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does anyone know anything about them?
