In answer to your<br/>\nquestion about getting married online, I have a RL husband who is my online<br/>\nprotector. He is a Barbarian Shaman and he is online with me 99% of the<br/>\ntime. So I don&#39;t really face that problem.

I am fairly<br/>\nnew to online roleplaying but I&#39;ve been addicted to many computer RPGs in<br/>\nthe past. So, I&#39;m still working on developing Ardynn as a character. (It&#39;s<br/>\nbeen tough, with all those orcs chasing me all the time!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a question for those of you who are getting &quot;married&quot; online, or<br/>\nhave gotten married online in the past. Do any of you have offline<br/>\nboyfriends (or husbands)? If so, do they mind if you have an online<br/>\nsignificant other?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Alison<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. I think when we reply to messages on the list, we should not hit<br/>\n&quot;reply&quot; but instead use the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@onelist.com\">EQ_women@onelist.com</a> address - otherwise we&#39;ll<br/>\nget a lot of copies of old messages in the digests. <br/>\n<br/>\nglad to be here! looking forward to meeting all of you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGet involved.
