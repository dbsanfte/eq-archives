I miss somethings about <br/>\nthat version, but have also fallen in love with some of the features <br/>\nthat the PS2 version offers. Slight differences, and some major ones, <br/>\nbut oh well. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am actually just waiting for the new game by Varient, Star Wars <br/>\nGalaxies. Supposedly it will fix everything crappy about EQ, and be <br/>\none of the best gam,es for online. I cant wait to bash heads with my <br/>\nfemale wookie. LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe when i get my new PC I will come back and play the PC version <br/>\nof EQ again. I loved my necromancer, and my druid there. I was <br/>\nuntouchable!
