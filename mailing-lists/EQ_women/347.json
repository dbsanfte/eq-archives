I used to stand at the orc lift and /ooc for fellow adventurers.<br/>\nThat brought me some companions that I count amongst my closest friends to<br/>\nthis day.  We would use one person to lure a centurion away from the<br/>\nspawning area and bring it back closer to the woods line (and incidentally,<br/>\nthe path BACK to Kelethin) and then the rest of us would join in and bash<br/>\nthe snot out of it.  Good, clean fun. &lt;grins&gt;<br/>\nSara, Povar<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;d try hunting on Orc Hill.  Orc Hill is near the orc lift, which is the<br/>\n&gt;lift in Kelethin that is on an incline.  If you follow the path from<br/>\n&gt;there, continuing on after it ends, you should see a hill surrounded by<br/>\n&gt;orc tents.  This is a great place to hunt up to level 9.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There are lots of orcs on orc hill.  The most important thing to know is<br/>\n&gt;how to run to the guards, if you have orcs on you.  That will save your<br/>\n&gt;life.  With your speed song, you should be able to outrun the orcs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;When you get an orc, try and run on top of the hill, so other orcs won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;wander by and join in on the fight.  They all spawn at the bottom of the<br/>\n&gt;hill.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Level five is a hard level in greater faydark, but once you get to level 6<br/>\n&gt;you&#39;ll find things a lot easier, that&#39;s when you get your healing song.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Christina<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
