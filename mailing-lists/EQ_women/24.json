Do I look like a boy to<br/>\nyou?&quot;  This response is in the context of my character who is, as I&#39;ve<br/>\nsaid, a bard.  Genneth LOVES to tease and poke fun, so she makes<br/>\ncomments like this and uses ROFL all the time.  Then I usually give a<br/>\ntell to say YES I AM a woman (note not girl) in real life.  And I go on<br/>\nto explain that I&#39;ve been playing these kind of games since I was very<br/>\nyoung.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather/ Genneth<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mystyrain8@...\">Mystyrain8@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mystyrain8@...\">Mystyrain8@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hello All,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wanted to jump in on this topic and introduce<br/>\n&gt; myself at the same time.  My <br/>\n&gt; name is Mystyrain and Im a 17th (almost 18th) level<br/>\n&gt; Magician on Cazic-Thule.  <br/>\n&gt; I have never found flirting to be a real problem,<br/>\n&gt; though there are some guys <br/>\n&gt; that are extremely crass about it.  Most of them<br/>\n&gt; flirt in fun.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have been fairly lucky, I managed to find a<br/>\n&gt; wonderful Monk to concentrate <br/>\n&gt; my &quot;serious&quot; flirting on and now we are engaged to<br/>\n&gt; be married.  There is <br/>\n&gt; still a lot of non-serious flirting that goes on but<br/>\n&gt; everyone is pretty much <br/>\n&gt; aware that Im taken now.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What i get a lot of is, &quot;Are you a girl IRL?&quot;.  As<br/>\n&gt; if that makes a <br/>\n&gt; difference.  I always have to laugh at that one. <br/>\n&gt; Some guys find it so hard <br/>\n&gt; to believe that women actually LIKE these kinds of<br/>\n&gt; games too.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In Light,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mystyrain<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
