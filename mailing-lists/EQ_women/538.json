My Barb Shaman (Kalara on the \n  Veeshan server)<br>got her SoW spell at lvl 9 and ever since then I&#39;ve \n  essentially been a SoW<br>whore (lol might be a bit crude, but apt). The big \n  difference now that i&#39;m<br>lvl 21 is that no one pays me for the SoW. They \n  just come up to me (and<br>pretty soon you&#39;ll know what I mean...they&#39;ll come \n  up, sort of stand there<br>and before they can ask for the SoW I am already \n  mid-spell to just get them<br>to go away). They literally assume that it is \n  for free, say thanks and walk<br>away. Drives me nuts when they do it right \n  after I&#39;ve just fought a mob, am<br>at half-life, oom and my party is the same \n  or worse. That&#39;s usually the only<br>time that I&#39;ll turn them \n  down.<br><br>Most people just say thanks (but often not even that) and leave. \n  Others,<br>usually the higher levels, will&nbsp; give me buffs and that I can \n  always<br>appreciate.<br><br>My in-game fiance (hey...THAT is a great topic, \n  in-game marriages...anyone<br>know of a good place in Norrath to tie the \n  knot?) is an enchanter and he<br>gets asked for breezes far more than I do and \n  they pay him...and often pay<br>him well. Hey, I have often paid several plat \n  to get a good breeze or<br>clarity. Can&#39;t live without my new addiction!&nbsp; \n  And seriously, I can&#39;t tell<br>you how great it is to have a perpetual sow and \n  breeze when you are in a<br>group.<br><br>My guild is a pretty big one but \n  there is a big disparity between high level<br>characters and lower ones. You \n  can really tell the difference between the<br>ones that came into the guild at \n  a later time and the ones that have been<br>there for awhile. Most of them are \n  lvl 30+ and then the next group is pretty<br>much right around 20, then it \n  drops to a few new secondary char of people in<br>the guild who are really low \n  levels. It sort of sucks because the guild<br>raids are mostly planned by the \n  higher levels and excludes a lot of people.<br>But it&#39;s growing and new people \n  are coming on board all the time. I&#39;m<br>finding that I hang out mostly with \n  people in my guild and it is a lot of<br>comradarie. It also doesn&#39;t hurt that \n  70% of the guild are druids (weird,<br>huh?) and so getting a port is never a \n  problem.<br><br>I play for the social aspects, but I love the questing and \n  learning skills.<br>I have half my totemic armor already and the getting it \n  has been most of the<br>fun...travelling all over, getting help from people. \n  I&#39;m a lvl 68 in baking<br>(funny because I&#39;m not a domestic sort in real \n  life...I can cook well but<br>don&#39;t like to so much). Baking is an awesome \n  skill to have because once you<br>buy a spit, you can bake while you meditate! \n  And fresh meat there is<br>aplenty. I find it funny though that there aren&#39;t \n  many bakers around. My<br>friends always laugh when I present them with beer \n  braised lion or pickled<br>gator. The food is also lighter than regular food \n  (monks love that) at .01<br>and it lasts a lot longer.<br><br>Okay, I&#39;m \n  rambling...brought up lots of things we can use for topics later<br>(guilds, \n  skills, weddings, social stuff). :-)<br><br>Crystal<br>Kalara, 21st Barbie \n  Shamaness<br>Azure Guard, Veeshan<br><br><br></tt></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
