The two oldest are much higher level <br/>\nand not on my server.  My character is Leerah on Quellious because <br/>\nthat&#39;s where some of my old D&D buddies were.  Level 33 wizard, just <br/>\nstarted in October of 2002.  Two of my sons are lower level.  One <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t play because of his cerebral palsy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am looking for a girlfriend for my 18 yr old son who plays a druid <br/>\n(57) on Karana.  He has unrealistic expectations for a girlfriend and <br/>\nI figure he isn&#39;t gonna&#39; meet anyone with his nose in the computer all <br/>\nthe time.  He also plays Diablo3.  I bet there are no women on there!<br/>\n<br/>\nMuriel <br/>\nwww.geocities.com/muriel_drmom</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
