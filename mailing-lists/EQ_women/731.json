I love to roleplay and have gotten my character into an engagement<br/>\nto a Minstrel .  Well, the problem is the Minstrel is always on and as soon as<br/>\nI log in he comes and spend the whole game with me, I never get to solo<br/>\nanymore, I never get to group, and he&#39;s a horrible player so I end up doing<br/>\nmore dying than I can stand.  It&#39;s made me kind of not want to play, but I am<br/>\nso bad at hurting people&#39;s feelings I don&#39;t know how to just say &quot;Um, mind if<br/>\nI solo tonight?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nSuggestions?  He started an alt so he wouldn&#39;t level without me and his alt is<br/>\nnow level 28.  I&#39;m feeling REALLY guilty.  I also have a lot more pity for<br/>\npoor Sylvanar *giggles and waves to Josh*<br/>\n<br/>\nIce<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.
