After that I went to PoS and fished for<br/>\nstorm trout and those make food also to get your<br/>\nbaking over 200 and get your fishing up at the same<br/>\ntime. It takes a bit of patience, but even with buying<br/>\nbat wings it took very little plat. It helped a lot<br/>\nthough to have a high wis character.
