He calculated that half the <br/>\n&gt; female characters on EQ at any time are played  by males, but very <br/>\n&gt; few women play male personae. This seems odd, but I have to say that <br/>\n&gt; I have very little interest in playing male characters, and it seems <br/>\n&gt; that I am far from alone in this. Is our researcher correct, do you <br/>\n&gt; think?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As an aside, I wondered if I could tell which females were  male, and <br/>\n&gt; I conclude that, on the whole, I can&#39;t, if they don&#39;t want me to. <br/>\n&gt; Sure, there are boys who give the game away with abuse and bad <br/>\n&gt; language (or am I just stereotyping boyish behaviour?) and a <br/>\n&gt; proportion making their gender clear (the surname Crossdresser was a <br/>\n&gt; giveaway,I though ;), but on the whole, I have no idea. To be honest, <br/>\n&gt; the only ones I really assume to be women are those who keep going <br/>\n&gt; afk to deal with domestic issues; more stereotyping?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just a few thoughts, if anyone is still there.....<br/>\n&gt; Love,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Liz, aka Gyngermynx, ranger of the 27th hunt, Quellious<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
