I&#39;ve heard of people meeting people through EQ, meeting in RL, than living together. I&#39;ve had 4 sets of EQ friends do this in RL. With my luck I&#39;d end up in prison for meeting a minor (I have a BF and he&#39;s 30 I&#39;m 25 in RL). I have an 8 year old son so in view with &quot;mother eyes&quot; I can&#39;t do it. One guy flirted with my main for a long time (Alexandrah) saying he&#39;s buying a house, I seem like a great person, and so on... but I left it as flirting. </div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>In RL I completed Microcomputer Operations and I&#39;m returning next month for Computer Programming. People say I&#39;m intelligent but I&#39;m normal in my eyes like any other person.
