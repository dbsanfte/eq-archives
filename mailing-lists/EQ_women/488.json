None of us have the time or ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1087159267\">Judy,<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s sad that you&#39;ve had these experiences, and there is a reason my group<br/>\nand I don&#39;t ever try to &#39;camp&#39; for valuables.  None of us have the time or<br/>\npatience to &#39;work&#39; at something that is supposed to be an escapist source of<br/>\nrelaxation and self-indulgence, and it would definitely be work to try and<br/>\nget something neat when all of Norrath wants the same thing..  We are also<br/>\nsome of the oldest players (made characters ON release day, most of us were<br/>\nbeta 3 and 4), and our primaries are only in their mid-twenties,<br/>\nlevel-wise.  Why?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, we tend to roleplay a bit too much, and we do quests.  Not so much for<br/>\nfaction gain or the experience but because they&#39;re there and they can be<br/>\ndone and that&#39;s what roleplaying is built around.  And my gosh, we have<br/>\nfun.  The last few nights my partner and I (and whichever of our friends<br/>\nwere on) have been exploring the Swamp of No Hope and the Lake of Ill Omen.<br/>\nWhy? They&#39;re there!  We&#39;ve found some really cool things that we&#39;ll be going<br/>\nback to visit.  Tonight we&#39;re exploring the Field of Bone--why? (you know<br/>\nthe answer, hehe)  We do it in character, and we do it in style, and people<br/>\ntend to gravitate toward us, hang out for a bit, and then check in with us<br/>\nweeks down the road when they&#39;re ten levels above us but still remembering<br/>\nthe fun they had. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nI digress.  Point is, most of our oldest friends are twenty levels above us<br/>\n(at least), and we never see them anymore.  This has been sad, but it&#39;s also<br/>\nallowed us to make new friends, and since we don&#39;t feel compelled to keep<br/>\nup, we&#39;ve seen more of Norrath than most.  That&#39;s one of the things we enjoy<br/>\nabout this game--the graphics are lush and the zones are intriguing (the new<br/>\nones especially).  Some of the quests need a bit of work, and that&#39;s<br/>\ndisappointing (obviously alot more time and effort is put into weapon<br/>\nbalancing and armor than into quests) to my particular group.  We like the<br/>\nfact that as long as you&#39;re not hunting the &#39;big name&#39; monsters, there are<br/>\nstill things to do and money to be made, and we wish there was more.  Or<br/>\nmore roaming monsters, or harder to find &#39;big name&#39; monsters.  When a &#39;big<br/>\nname&#39; monster is needed for two or three different quests involving two or<br/>\nthree different classes, it makes it difficult to achieve one&#39;s goals (ie,<br/>\ninferno goblin wizard gets camped by wizards as well as us rangers).  We<br/>\ndon&#39;t like that, and try to avoid it, but obviously there are some things<br/>\nwe&#39;re not going to be able to avoid hunting... urrr, camping. &lt;looks glum&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWould a game slanted toward roleplayers fill a demand? Indeed, yes.  Would<br/>\nit be commercially successful? Dunno.  There&#39;re a lot more power-levelers<br/>\nout there than roleplayers.  Would it be a critical success?  That depends<br/>\npartially on the level of programming that goes into it, and partially on<br/>\nwhether there are any roleplayers left at the fanzines. ;)  Letting the<br/>\nunderdog win? I think that first word says it all... &#39;let&#39;... Instead of<br/>\nbasing &#39;winning&#39; situations on who can hack and slash best and having<br/>\nunderdogs who are weaker but get rewarded for that weakness, what if there<br/>\nwere some reward for cunning and intelligence?  Solving a riddle, finding<br/>\ntraps, that sort of thing.  Make stats count for something--agility isn&#39;t<br/>\nworth nearly as much as strength in this game, which is kinda skewed (hard<br/>\nto hit something that won&#39;t hold still, isn&#39;t it?), luck is non-existent,<br/>\nrogues are just another version of the light tank...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my two cents&#39;. &lt;grin&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAelwesara C├╗thalion, Ranger with 23 seasons<br/>\nPovar<br/>\n<br/>\nJudy Tyrer wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I had the opportunity to play with a friend I really like grouping with<br/>\n&gt; but he was busy in another dungeon because &quot;It has thisg great &lt;class<br/>\n&gt; specific&gt; sword.&quot;  So we didn&#39;t get to spend the day together.  Another<br/>\n&gt; friend didn&#39;t want to play because &quot;I need to camp this really important<br/>\n&gt; piece of equipment and I can&#39;t give up the camp or I&#39;ll lose it&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I haven&#39;t played EQ all week and it is the second paragraph that really<br/>\n&gt; sums up why.<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone else feel this?  Is it just the people I&#39;ve been hanging out<br/>\n&gt; with lately being more &quot;thing&quot; than &quot;people&quot; oriented and I should go<br/>\n&gt; find some new friends?  Or is it that not being the target market of the<br/>\n&gt; game I just don&#39;t get it and getting the coolest things is really what<br/>\n&gt; the game is about?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; More importantly, if there were an RP style game tweaked more toward<br/>\n&gt; people than things, would you play it?  If the game gave points for<br/>\n&gt; storyline and sometimes favored the underdog (letting the least equipped<br/>\n&gt; defeat the most equipped like a David and Goliath kind of story) and<br/>\n&gt; promoted group dynamics with more &quot;realistic&quot; story effects - would that<br/>\n&gt; be of any interest?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just doing a bit of &quot;market research&quot; here.  And, yes, I do have an idea<br/>\n&gt; up my sleeve &lt;grins&gt;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Iceiallana Forestfury<br/>\n&gt; (aka Judy) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
