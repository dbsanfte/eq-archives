I havne&#39;t checked my em-ail in like a week \n  and a hlf, so I had <br>a 134 message backlog. =( Anyhow... Some info on me. \n  *drumroll*<br><br>I play Gikkwiny Triseyed on the Quellious Server. I am level \n  23 and a <br>bubble, and I am a warrior. I&#39;m also one of the rarest \n  sex/race/classes, <br>being a female Halfling warrior. You don&#39;t know how \n  often I get clarity <br>since I&#39;m a halfling.. you would think they would \n  notice the CRAFTED (anyone <br>high enough to cast clarity HSOULD know what \n  crafted looks like.. ) and even <br>after inspecting me, they still cast it.. \n  LOL...<br><br>Anyhow, I am in one of the best guilds (in my opinon) in EQ... \n  I&#39;m in Far <br>Dareis Mai. Everyone in our guild is female (yes, I know there \n  are probably <br>guys playing girl chars, but a high majority are female). We \n  have no real <br>squabbling, and we all have fun, which is the most important \n  thing. It&#39;s <br>great to go into a zone and you see a guildmate, and you can \n  always be <br>assured a friendly hello, or if you need help, the high levels \n  in the guild <br>will do what they can.. (not to mention if they just HAPPEN \n  to have a <br>crafted bracer or silvery axe around and you need them, they&#39;ll \n  giveit to <br>you )=P But they are all really sweet... If you have a char on \n  Qull and wish <br>to join, let me know.<br><br>I am a master fletcher, and I \n  would say it&#39;s worth it... IF you are a class <br>that can use arrows. to \n  about a 90 skill level, it&#39;s pretty much break <br>even.. I think it MIGHT \n  take 20 plat. You just keep combining the cheapest <br>components.. (don&#39;t \n  worry about combinations, as long as you have an arrow <br>tip, fletches, a \n  nock, and a shaft, it&#39;ll combine) but after you hit about <br>90, come of the \n  components start costing 8 or 9 gold. Now, the reason why <br>fletching is \n  worth being such a money sink is that with a &quot;bad&quot; skill in <br>archery, a \n  longbow, and the regualr arrows you buy form mechants, I was <br>doing 2-5 \n  damage with a bow, unless I critical hit. Now, with a carved <br>ashwood bow \n  and Class 3 bone point arrows, I do 20 damage... so (even though <br>it&#39;s \n  difficult) I can actually kite with arrows... (btw, making magical <br>arrows \n  costs about 10 pp or more for just 5 arrows, so that&#39;s not goint to <br>happen \n  for a LONG time. ))<br><br>the worst thing about being a warrior is the \n  horendous downtime, and that <br>you can&#39;t really solo over 20... You are \n  conastantly dependant on others. <br>One of the perks, though, is watching the \n  casters run around in cirlces with <br>a mob behind them going &quot;Help me! Help \n  me!&quot; when two seconds ago they were <br>telling you how they could servive on \n  their own.. =P Also, a lot of the <br>other classes think that melee classes \n  should be rolling in cash since they <br>don&#39;t have to buy spells... well, \n  just an FYI, but I have only had over 200 <br>plat ONCE. what happens is, I \n  finally build up a moderate stash, then comes <br>the time to buy armor \n  components, or jewels, or work on a trade skill, then <br>I&#39;m back to having \n  only 10 p in the bank. =(<br><br>The other thing I don&#39;t get is lately, mor \n  and more newbies are ansking me <br>to twink/powerlevel them. As in regards to \n  the twink issue, I&#39;m level 22, <br>and i&#39;m wearing bronze boots. I won&#39;t twink \n  you, unless your level 10 and <br>still wearing cloth. There is nothing \n  sillerier then a halfling with orange <br>feet. (they do not change the foot \n  graphic for halflings when they put on <br>boots, they just tint the feet. \n  That means I have bright orange feet and <br>dark orange nail \n  polish).<br><br>As for Powerleveling, I have no clue HOW a warrior is supposed \n  to PL <br>someone.. I can&#39;t heal, I can&#39;t buff, all I could possibly do is \n  make sure <br>you won&#39;t die, but that&#39;s a guard service, not PLing... *sighs* \n  Ah, well... <br>I&#39;m done ranting now...
