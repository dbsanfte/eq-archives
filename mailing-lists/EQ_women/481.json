So, my mother (the one who has all the money in my house)<br/>\n&gt; finally said I could order kunark the day it came out. I was amazingly<br/>\n&gt; excited, since on Everlore they said they would be selling it into May.. so<br/>\n&gt; I load up EQ, and the store button is GONE. Now tell me, is this an<br/>\n&gt; AMAZINGLY stupid marketing tactic? Give them no way to order something, i.e.<br/>\n&gt; giving them no way to PAY you?<br/>\n&gt;     *Shakes head* it just seems incredibly odd to me.. So I went to<br/>\n&gt; Wal-mart, and they has the new packs there, and I was wondering.. there was<br/>\n&gt; only one CD inside. Do you call the 1 888 # for the kunark code then?<br/>\n&gt; because I was going to give the actual EQ part of it (not kunark) to my<br/>\n&gt; sister. I hope I can do that, or they had better get the store back.. *grr*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Gikkwiny, 20th circle warrior on Quellious<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Why buy CDs?
