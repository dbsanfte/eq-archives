It is nice to see that the stereotype of the <br/>\nRPG fan is not always accurate!  We are not all nerdy teenage <br/>\nboys with nothing better to do then role dice :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy main character is Aaldiana, a lvl 17 high elf cleric though she <br/>\ndoes now have a little sister named Kina, who is a lvl 5 wood elf <br/>\nbard.  Both of my characters are on the Bristlebane server.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for some recent topics:<br/>\nFor the most part, I am grouped with all males, both in game and <br/>\nIRL.  My personality just tends to lead me to that.  I am an <br/>\noutrageous flirt and have a great time doing it.  I do not however <br/>\nuse that to any kind of advantage, not intentionally anyway.  I just <br/>\nRP and see where it leads.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband does not care since it is only an RPG.  Both <br/>\ncharacters do have SOs, though they are actually brother <br/>\ncharacters of each other, so obviously the other player and I are <br/>\nwhat mesh, and we have a great time doing it.  We also trade <br/>\nemails all the time.  I can truly say that he is now one of my best <br/>\nfriends even though I&#39;ve never met him in person :)  We have been <br/>\nplaying together since Aaldiana was lvl 4.  We are lucky to not only <br/>\nhave found each other, but there are also two other guys that we <br/>\nhave always grouped with so we have a good steady group. I like to <br/>\njoke that due to our frequent deaths, these guys have now seen me <br/>\ndress more often then my husband.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am proud to be a founding member of a brand new guild, <br/>\nHonorBound.  This guild is kind of a baby for me and I have had a <br/>\nlot of fun in creating it with my new friends.  It has put a whole new <br/>\nangle on the game too.  I look forward to seeing how this aspect <br/>\ngrows.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that&#39;s enough babble for now.  I look forward to hearing more <br/>\nfrom all of you!<br/>\n<br/>\nSee ya online!<br/>\n--Allison</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
