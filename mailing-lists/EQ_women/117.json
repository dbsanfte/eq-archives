My character s name is Guerilla, currently a level 9 human Paladin on the Tunare server. The name is a Spanish one, like all the chat and character","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-183698987\">Hi ya&#39;ll. My character&#39;s name is Guerilla, currently a level 9 human <br/>\nPaladin on the Tunare server. The name is a Spanish one, like all the chat <br/>\nand character names I use on online, including my other EQ characters. I <br/>\nwas raised in South America where I learned to speak Spanish fluently. <br/>\nFrench is my third language.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGuerilla has a double meaning, Literally it means small war, but it also <br/>\nconnotes the term &quot;guerilla fighters,&quot; those who, often against <br/>\noverwhelming odds, fight repressive governments on behalf of the poor and <br/>\ndefenseless. This suits my EQ game character, a paladin, well. It also <br/>\nrepresents my poltical ideals in real life where I have spent the last 25 <br/>\nyears working in and with high poverty schools in my role as a teacher, <br/>\nprincipal, and (most currently) educational reformer. It&#39;s often me, the <br/>\nlittle guy (gal), against the giant,  the school or educational system I&#39;m <br/>\ntrying to reform so that poor, non-English speaking, and other <br/>\ndisadvantaged children can have a real chance in life.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI love role playing games because they remind me of the legends and fairy <br/>\ntales I passionately devoured as a child. EQ is the first one I&#39;ve played <br/>\nonline. I&#39;ve noticed that the many male characters react differently to me <br/>\nthan they do to each other. Sometimes that&#39;s good because I do enjoy the <br/>\noccasional light flirting, the compliments, small gifts, the being saved <br/>\nfrom danger, etc. but sometimes it&#39;s bad because they over-protect and do <br/>\nnot let me kill the monsters I can handle myself, often under-estimating my <br/>\ncapabilities. Also, sometimes I know the answer to questions and problems <br/>\nbut some, (not all) male characters do not listen well to me because they <br/>\ndo not expect me to know. Just like real life, huh, sisters?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs for the flirting, romantic side of the game, as a 48 year old married <br/>\nwoman with a 16 year old son, I wonder what the guys would think if they <br/>\nknew my age and/or marital status. Probably most of them are half my age <br/>\nand single. Actually they seem more interested in the age issue. No one has <br/>\never asked me if I&#39;m married, but the first person I ever contacted online <br/>\nasked me my age. He turned out to be 13. On EQ if they ask I usually tell <br/>\nthem, &quot;I&#39;m too old for you. Just call me mom.&quot; Most reply ROFL and we go <br/>\non.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tDo you, the rest of my sisters, get regular questions about your age and <br/>\nmarital status? What do you reply? The truth, a lie, none of your business? <br/>\nInterested in hearing how you deal with the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Wednesday, June 16, 1999 9:42 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women-owner@onelist.com\">EQ_women-owner@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women-owner@onelist.com\">EQ_women-owner@onelist.com</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hi there, and welcome to EQ Women!
