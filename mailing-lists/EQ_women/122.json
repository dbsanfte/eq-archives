Aye, I am the only female in my guild and if I let them, they would<br/>\nspoil me shamelessly.  Actually, they already do, but I hope I have taught them<br/>\nrespect for my skills too........yes, just like in real life, over and over and over<br/>\nagain...heh.  I&#39;m thirty this year, and I&#39;m one of the oldest of my guildmates.<br/>\nSurprisingly, they don&#39;t ask how old I am, and I haven&#39;t run into that many requests<br/>\nfor my age.  When I get those requests from people who just met me, I tell them I&#39;m a<br/>\nhappily married thirty-year-old mother of two.  Well, I am thirty, and I am a mother,<br/>\nand the marital status sometimes makes me unattainable, and sometimes doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>\nmatter.  On the rare occasions that I have problems with someone, I try to gently<br/>\ndissuade them, in character first and out of character if need be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was so gratified to find there were women my age playing. I&#39;d often asked myself if<br/>\nI was a little old for this silly RP stuff, and whether I should start growing up and<br/>\nacting my age.  It&#39;s a major bone of contention for my paramour, who resents my<br/>\nonline time.  He&#39;s not a gamer.  I, on the other hand, am a child of my generation,<br/>\nand I had a very astute mother who scrimped and saved to buy us computers from a very<br/>\nearly age as well as encouraging us to explore our imaginations with &quot;traditional&quot;<br/>\nrole playing games......and books, lotsa books.  When Commodore first came out, they<br/>\nwere one of the first companies to offer IRC for the common masses, and from that day<br/>\nI was hooked on talking to people from all over the world.  Maybe that helped me<br/>\nlearn how to protect my &quot;online virtue&quot; early on.  My primary character appears to be<br/>\nvery light-hearted about life, so she refuses to take any overtures seriously.  My<br/>\nsecondary character, a Dark Elf Cleric on Rallos Zek, simply emotes &quot;muses whether<br/>\nthe creature before her would make a suitable sacrifice to her God, the Prince of<br/>\nHate.&quot;  That usually takes care of things rather well. &lt;grins&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, welcome!<br/>\n<br/>\nSara, Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;         I love role playing games because they remind me of the legends and fairy<br/>\n&gt; tales I passionately devoured as a child. EQ is the first one I&#39;ve played<br/>\n&gt; online. I&#39;ve noticed that the many male characters react differently to me<br/>\n&gt; than they do to each other. Sometimes that&#39;s good because I do enjoy the<br/>\n&gt; occasional light flirting, the compliments, small gifts, the being saved<br/>\n&gt; from danger, etc. but sometimes it&#39;s bad because they over-protect and do<br/>\n&gt; not let me kill the monsters I can handle myself, often under-estimating my<br/>\n&gt; capabilities. Also, sometimes I know the answer to questions and problems<br/>\n&gt; but some, (not all) male characters do not listen well to me because they<br/>\n&gt; do not expect me to know. Just like real life, huh, sisters?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         As for the flirting, romantic side of the game, as a 48 year old married<br/>\n&gt; woman with a 16 year old son, I wonder what the guys would think if they<br/>\n&gt; knew my age and/or marital status. Probably most of them are half my age<br/>\n&gt; and single. Actually they seem more interested in the age issue. No one has<br/>\n&gt; ever asked me if I&#39;m married, but the first person I ever contacted online<br/>\n&gt; asked me my age. He turned out to be 13. On EQ if they ask I usually tell<br/>\n&gt; them, &quot;I&#39;m too old for you. Just call me mom.&quot; Most reply ROFL and we go<br/>\n&gt; on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Do you, the rest of my sisters, get regular questions about your age and<br/>\n&gt; marital status? What do you reply? The truth, a lie, none of your business?<br/>\n&gt; Interested in hearing how you deal with the issue.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
