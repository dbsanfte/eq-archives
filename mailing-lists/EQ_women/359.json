She is a 21st level Erudite <br/>\nCleric.  I also have a secondary character called Gabriella on the same <br/>\nserver.  She is a level 3 wood elf bard.  I just started her recently, but <br/>\nspend most of my time playing my main char Tikha.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn RL I am 30 years old and married. I have a 4 year old daughter.  My <br/>\nhusband and I both play EQ and love it! We both have a computer and we have <br/>\ntwo ASDN connections to the internet in our home, so most of the time we <br/>\nplay together.  We have made many friends in EQ and are still making new <br/>\nones everyday.  It is funny cause lots of guys like flirting with Tikha, but <br/>\nif/when they find out that Imaaj (my husband&#39;s character) is being played by <br/>\nmy RL husband they don&#39;t seem to always know how to react.  Tikha has a love <br/>\nin EQ though.  His name is Oadn.  Whenever Imaaj seems to show any signs of <br/>\njealousy, Oadn just tells Imaaj that they will have to duel it out.  They <br/>\nget lots of kicks and laughs out of the situation.  My husband is ok with <br/>\nthe whole idea of my roleplaying a relationship on EQ.  He is not the type <br/>\nto be lovey with his character and knows that I enjoy the companionship in <br/>\ngame that Oadn brings.  Imaaj thinks of Oadn as one of his best hunting <br/>\npartners.  Oadn and Imaaj often hunt together even when Tikha isn&#39;t online.  <br/>\nBesides, it seems that Imaaj is waiting for Gabriella to grow up a bit so <br/>\nthat he can start courting her ;-) He really loves female wood elves!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am looking forward to creating a char on Brell and meeting with the rest <br/>\nof you.  Is there a meeting time each week, or is there another planned <br/>\nmeeting soon?  How do I go about joining the guild once I have created a <br/>\ncharacter on Brell?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
