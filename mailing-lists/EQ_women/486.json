A few minutes<br/>\nlater I ported to Emerald Jungle and the only people there was my and my<br/>\nfriend.  The difference between the two zones?  Karndor&#39;s castle has<br/>\nunique drops of great equipment and Emerald Jungle has nothing with loot<br/>\n(the MoBs give equivalent experience I found).<br/>\n<br/>\nI had the opportunity to play with a friend I really like grouping with<br/>\nbut he was busy in another dungeon because &quot;It has thisg great &lt;class<br/>\nspecific&gt; sword.&quot;  So we didn&#39;t get to spend the day together.  Another<br/>\nfriend didn&#39;t want to play because &quot;I need to camp this really important<br/>\npiece of equipment and I can&#39;t give up the camp or I&#39;ll lose it&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t played EQ all week and it is the second paragraph that really<br/>\nsums up why.  I feel like EQ used to be about friends, RP, and hunting<br/>\ntogether in groups and learning to take new areas and defeat dungeons<br/>\nyou&#39;d never tried before.  Then it turned into camping and lists.  And<br/>\nnow it has deteriorated to &quot;things&quot; being more important than &quot;people&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone else feel this?  Is it just the people I&#39;ve been hanging out<br/>\nwith lately being more &quot;thing&quot; than &quot;people&quot; oriented and I should go<br/>\nfind some new friends?  Or is it that not being the target market of the<br/>\ngame I just don&#39;t get it and getting the coolest things is really what<br/>\nthe game is about?<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, my disatisfaction toward EQ of late has been profound.<br/>\nProfound enough that I can&#39;t bring myself to log back in.  And I really<br/>\nthink it is that they tweaked the game for the worse, starting with the<br/>\naddition of class specific armor and weaponry.  Suddenly it&#39;s all about<br/>\n&quot;stuff&quot;.  Or was it always and I just missed the point?<br/>\n<br/>\nMore importantly, if there were an RP style game tweaked more toward<br/>\npeople than things, would you play it?  If the game gave points for<br/>\nstoryline and sometimes favored the underdog (letting the least equipped<br/>\ndefeat the most equipped like a David and Goliath kind of story) and<br/>\npromoted group dynamics with more &quot;realistic&quot; story effects - would that<br/>\nbe of any interest?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust doing a bit of &quot;market research&quot; here.  And, yes, I do have an idea<br/>\nup my sleeve &lt;grins&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIceiallana Forestfury<br/>\n(aka Judy)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
