If they try to act &#39;girlish&#39; and people believe<br/>\nthey&#39;re a girl, that&#39;s role playing, as far as I see it, and there&#39;s<br/>\nnothing wrong with it.  Even if they rollplay a girl badly, and boys<br/>\nbelieve them anyway =)<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if someone lies about being a girl in real life, I don&#39;t see it as<br/>\nthat big a deal.  I had that happen to me.  Someone I was friends with for<br/>\n3 months who I totally thought was a girl, turned out to be a boy.<br/>\nInitially, I was totally shocked, but it didn&#39;t take me long to realize<br/>\nthis was still the same person I was friend with.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if someone is actively deceptive about their gender, I really do<br/>\nthink it&#39;s pretty harmless.  The Internet offers a great medium for people<br/>\nto explore different things, in a way that is essentially harmless.  Until<br/>\nit starts intruding on the real world, I think it&#39;s basicly harmless.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure there are a number of people on my own server who are unsure as<br/>\nto my gender, or think that I&#39;m a boy.  That&#39;s just the way the Internet<br/>\nworks, it doesn&#39;t bother me.  I do tend to drop pretty overt gender cues,<br/>\nmost notably all my online friends know that my RL boyfriend is a player<br/>\non our server.  If someone thinks I&#39;m a boy though, it doesn&#39;t bug me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know lots of nice &#39;girls&#39; online who may or may not be boys, I haven&#39;t<br/>\nasked =) I must admit I wonder some time, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary<br/>\nfor me to pry.  I do know they&#39;re good friends, and I love grouping with<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Tina (a high elf in real life =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 23 Feb 2000, Crystal wrote:<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Crystal&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:clattimer@...\">clattimer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a topic for discussion, actually.
