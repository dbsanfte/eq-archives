It was a blast,<br/>\nalthough I found it two-dimensional at first, having become so accustomed to<br/>\nagonizing over how to build my character (&quot;Bam!  You&#39;re a necro!  That&#39;s<br/>\nit!&quot;)--but in a way, it was a relief!  Two choices, done!<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t get above level 6, but in the meantime, I had two pet skellies and a<br/>\ngolem, and boy lemme tell ya... such a difference, sitting back, filing my<br/>\nnails, waving my wand airily to debuff the mobs... much different from the<br/>\nranger I normally play. &lt;grin&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one I have spoken to is fond of Open games, and I can see why not... haven&#39;t<br/>\ntried a Realm game, but the TCP/IP is just as fun when you have a good group of<br/>\npeople.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa Johnson wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I must agree, been playing it awhile and love it... have a 16 necro and a 18<br/>\n&gt; sorceress, necro is my favorite :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The multiplayer isnt too bad... there are a few problems<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; you can play on battlenet in 2 ways... Open games, and Realm games...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Open games are played basically like Diablo 1 and open to all the cheating<br/>\n&gt; you can imagine.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Realm games are on Battlenet servers, your charcter are stord on th server<br/>\n&gt; and games are ran on th server to prevent cheating.  The problem with this<br/>\n&gt; though, they hav sub standard servers... and its basically impossible trying<br/>\n&gt; to play on servers designed for a few thousand people when 50,000 is trying<br/>\n&gt; to get on them...  I only play the single player, and direct conecting<br/>\n&gt; TCP/IP with friends and forget the battlenet problems and cheaters<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; but i startd playing this game over a week ago, nd hvent played EQ since...<br/>\n&gt; thats kinda hard after being addicted to EQ since beta<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; To email plain text is conventional, to add graphics is devine.<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ll show you how at www.supersig.com.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/6811/14/_/552123/_/963292086/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/6811/14/_/552123/_/963292086/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
