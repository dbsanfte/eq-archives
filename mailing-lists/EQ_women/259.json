Brell<br/>\nis also designated the alternate role-playing server.  IMHO a woman&#39;s<br/>\nguild on an RP server sounds like a good thing.  Is Brell a candidate for<br/>\nthe guild?  Does it being designated RP bother anyone?  (I *do* RP but am<br/>\nnot a fanatic .. nor do I denigrate those who don&#39;t .. a syndrome I refer<br/>\nto as the holier-than-thou-RP-er complex).<br/>\n<br/>\nGuild Comments (minor spoiler in this paragraph - but you will get the info<br/>\nfrom hailing the right sister in-game).<br/>\nWhile I like the Sisters of Erollisi concept ...<br/>\n- be prepared to PvP, they wear the Purity belts and the Island is a regular<br/>\n  camping/hunting spot for evil races and non-evil money grubbers of mid-<br/>\n  teens and up.  I can&#39;t see being a sister and not defending one :)<br/>\n- initial guild meetings should not be on the Isle.  The 20 minute wait for<br/>\nthe<br/>\n  boat combined with the 30 minute corpse decay &lt; level 5 could be bad.  There<br/>\n  are sharks at the dock .. and they rarely attack through the boat. <br/>\nBut I like the idea :)<br/>\n<br/>\nGuys & EQ Graphics.<br/>\nWell, the EQ Graphics are a bit of a family joke in our house.  Recently on<br/>\nthe <br/>\ntelevision, there was a rather (can we say it had to be silicone!) busty<br/>\nhostess<br/>\non a tabloid type talk show that we saw while my husband was &quot;grazing&quot;.  She<br/>\nwas wearing a &quot;push-up&quot; bra, with a very skimpy mini-skirt shirt-dress which <br/>\nhad front buttons unbuttoned *almost* to her navel, push up cleavage well<br/>\ndisplayed.<br/>\nBare long legs .... etc ...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daugher immediately said:<br/>\n&quot;Hey now SHE belongs in EQ!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband prompty replied:<br/>\n&quot;Well she&#39;s already wearing armor.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, I couldn&#39;t even add a comment I was snickering so hard.  And this<br/>\ncomment <br/>\nfrom the male!<br/>\n<br/>\n- Lora <br/>\n(Wondering how much AC the underwires add)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
