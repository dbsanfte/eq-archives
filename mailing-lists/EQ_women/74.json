Zuzu, my troll warrior, is the only one of all my girls<br/>\nwho flirts.  She gets tons of attention from it and if it gets out of line<br/>\nshe just tells them: &quot;Use leve Zuzu lone or she barsh use on de hed und use<br/>\nno like dat fur sure.  Har de har. &quot;    They even get a kick out of that.<br/>\nhehe   I find it much easier to flirt with Zuzu because she has a built in<br/>\nability to fuss at males with her role and personality.  It makes it easier<br/>\nto stop it before it gets too intense.  She once had a troll male say: &quot;Zuzu<br/>\ncute, we go make baby now.&quot;   Zuzu just smiled, drooled and told him in her<br/>\nworst troll accent: &quot; Zuzu too purdy ta be makin babies wif ugly troll lak<br/>\nuse be.  Zuzu waits fer purdy bard mans. &quot;  He laughed and gave her a<br/>\nshield. hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy your troll.  We need more female trolls. &lt;smiles&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJanice<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Maria Haskins &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:haskins@...\">haskins@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@onelist.com\">EQ_women@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, June 20, 1999 5:32 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_women] On flirting and getting stuff<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Maria Haskins&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:haskins@...\">haskins@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello all sisters...<br/>\n&gt; Well, after playing a goodie-two-shoes cleric since I first got into the<br/>\n&gt; game, I decided recently to check out how the other side lives and started<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; female troll shadow knight. The swamp was a new experience alright, and so<br/>\n&gt; was the famed troll regeneration (watch those HPs zoooom up!). But the<br/>\n&gt; funniest thing was when I flirted with an ogre warrior in Grobb (some big<br/>\n&gt; bad &#39;un with a last name). After all the recent discussion here on<br/>\nflirting<br/>\n&gt; and females getting items, I decided to try out my trollie charms on this<br/>\n&gt; ogre. All I did was to comment (in my well spoken troll dialect) on what a<br/>\n&gt; fine basher he seemed to be and emote &quot;:bats her eyelashes at [player]&quot;<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; all of a sudden I received 1 platinum! For a lvl 2 trollie SK, this was<br/>\n&gt; indeed a fine gift... I guess trollie women have something to teach my<br/>\n&gt; dwarven cleric when it comes to turning mens heads because my cleric never<br/>\n&gt; received such a fine gift... :)<br/>\n&gt; After this encounter, my trollie character is convinced she is indeed<br/>\n&gt; attractive, but I doubt she will carry her flirting further than the<br/>\n&gt; eyelashes at the moment. Still it&#39;s proof that it&#39;s not just the wood<br/>\nelves<br/>\n&gt; that can make a killing by flirting... :) /em smiles fiercely<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Gobba, alias Disa, alias me<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Congratulations to &quot;PAFind,&quot; our latest ONElist of the Week.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; How is ONElist changing YOUR life?
