I know of one other on Fennin Ro who is older than I am <br/>\nand a women in RL.  Mature people have a love of gaming, too.  I get a lot <br/>\nof pleasure from playing any game, puzzle, or challenge.  I work off <br/>\naggression with my slashing and hacking, get satisfaction in achieving <br/>\nsmall goals like acquiring items, making skill or experience levels and in <br/>\ndiscovering and exploring the EQ environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nUs old geezers have the time and the patience (and the money) for many <br/>\non-line activities, as well as having highly developed computer-related <br/>\nskills.  I have found that women have done very well in information <br/>\nmanagement/computer science careers and I have been involved since the <br/>\nmiddle 1960&#39;s with large corporations on the west and east coasts.<br/>\nI am retired now and only do a little consulting to keep my skills and <br/>\nmarketability up.  This leaves me much time for day playing and all night <br/>\nsessions, if I want.  I am a borderline compulsive when I play this game. <br/>\n It is so immersive and addicting.  When a good group forms, I like to stay <br/>\ntogether as long as I can for the session and the companionship.<br/>\n<br/>\nI played Realm before EQ.  But a family member was a beta tester for EQ and <br/>\nshowed it to me last year.  So I was on the distribution list for the <br/>\nproduction software by New Years of this year and started playing the first <br/>\nday of production.  I have found that my knowledge of the game is only now <br/>\nbeginning to surpass the beta testers and I am considering volunteering for <br/>\nguide duty.  I think older women would make excellent guides.  If anything, <br/>\nage teaches patience, wit, skin thickening and a little teaching skills, <br/>\nwhich I think are essential attributes for a good guide.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can always spot the youngest players.  They are the ones always shouting <br/>\nfor help with corpse retrieval, free food, free items, screaming &#39;gimme, <br/>\ngimme, gimme&#39;.  They can&#39;t seem to stand still.......ever.  They never <br/>\nbother with Sense Heading skill development, never learned the value of <br/>\nsaving up their coins for something they want, and seem very self-centered <br/>\nin every thing they do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, here is a new mail list thread idea:<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can always spot the kids when they<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Beg for favors all over the zone<br/>\n2) twink<br/>\n3) solo power game<br/>\n4) are on most people&#39;s ignore list<br/>\n5) bully other players with their own greediness<br/>\n6) brag too much about their race, class, level, wealth or items<br/>\n7) answer every question about game secrets with shouts across the zone to <br/>\nshow off what they know (and don&#39;t know, hehe)<br/>\n8) chatter incessantly about inanities<br/>\n9) complain the loudest about others not helping them<br/>\n10) ..................[you fill in your favorite here]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDornar and Dornita<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tBeth Moursund [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scrybsprite@...\">scrybsprite@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tSunday, June 20, 1999 1:29 PM<br/>\nTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_women@onelist.com\">eq_women@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject:\tRe: [EQ_women] fun after 40<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Beth Moursund &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scrybsprite@...\">scrybsprite@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJanice writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;By the way, regarding the subject of &quot;older women&quot; playing EQ, I bet I am<br/>\n&gt;one of oldest.
