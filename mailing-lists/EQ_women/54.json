Ever need<br/>\n&gt; a Tracker, give me a tell. Right now that&#39;s about<br/>\n&gt; all I can offer a group.<br/>\n&gt; :) I&#39;m trying to make my way back to High Hold Pass<br/>\n&gt; to retrieve my corpse.<br/>\n&gt; ( I believe I have a week of real time while I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; below Level 5 or 6. ) The<br/>\n&gt; group I was with got separated from me while zoning<br/>\n&gt; and I subsequently had<br/>\n&gt; no protectors when a Lion decided to take me out. I<br/>\n&gt; also had no one to loot<br/>\n&gt; my corpse for me and bring back my stuff. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Looking forward to getting to know everyone here,<br/>\n&gt; and in the game.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tbaald<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Where do some of the Internet&#39;s largest email lists<br/>\n&gt; reside?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; At ONElist - the most scalable and reliable service<br/>\n&gt; on the Internet.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
