Friendly kitties. Beastlords. If you don&#39;t have a<br/>\nlot of time to play, I would suggest making a new Vah&#39;shir Beastlord, that<br/>\nway you get to experience the new class, the friendly kitties, and the new<br/>\ngraphics all at once.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuclin is seriously hard on your computer system, but hey, wasn&#39;t it about<br/>\ntime you upgraded anyway? =o<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re on a budget, and need to upgrade, I can make some<br/>\nrecommendations.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Geforce 2MX graphics card. You can get these for like $50-100. They<br/>\nare low end for Luclin but they will get the job done. If you have money<br/>\nget a Geforce 3 TI 200, or a ATI Radeon 8500.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Ram. You can get 256mb of ram for about $25 these days. You want to<br/>\nupgrade to 512mb or so (which is about $50). For most people you just want<br/>\nto buy one 512mb memory chip and stick it in your computer. Some computers<br/>\ndon&#39;t like mixing ram, but that&#39;s ok, just throw out whatever was in there<br/>\noriginally. Of course, not all kinds of computers use the same ram, so you<br/>\nmay have to go back to the place you bought it for the upgrade to make<br/>\nsure you get the right ram.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most fun I have had in luclin honestly has been playing with my<br/>\ncharacter&#39;s look =) Looks like it&#39;s going to be fun though.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
