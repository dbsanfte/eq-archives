That&#39;s why I made Melwen. Melwen never had to<br/>\nsolo and spent 61 levels in duo or larger group mode.<br/>\nI like playing her a lot. Recently, though I am<br/>\nstarting to go back to playing my ranger and I&#39;m<br/>\nhaving fun with her as well. For me the others are<br/>\nkind of fill in characters and the druid was mostly<br/>\nleveled by a friend who quit the game and gave me her<br/>\naccount so I have not played them a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have actually been in this list twice before but I<br/>\ntend to come and go. I don&#39;t have a very long<br/>\nattention span sometimes and I&#39;m not very patient.<br/>\nIt&#39;s part of the reason I have a terrible time with<br/>\nQuests and none of my toons have an epic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do like to talk though. Some people say that I talk<br/>\nway to much, but I can&#39;t help it. And I have some<br/>\nlittle problems that sometimes keeps me from playing<br/>\nfor a while or answering e-mail etc so that kind of<br/>\nmesses things up too, but I&#39;m always glad to be able<br/>\nto face another day.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you see I&#39;m rambling already so I&#39;ll close for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n/Hugs<br/>\nBran<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Dr. Mom&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drmom5@...\">drmom5@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; No, I don&#39;t remember you, but hi!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a 60 wiz on Quellious and have just discoved<br/>\n&gt; the joy of being a<br/>\n&gt; ranger!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *********** REPLY SEPARATOR  ***********<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On 10/8/03 at Brangvyne wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ____Hi!<br/>\n&gt; ____Well, I&#39;m back again although I&#39;m not sure if<br/>\n&gt; anyone will even <br/>\n&gt; ____remember me.
