Since he started to ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1385871730\">I was just wondering how you all balance playing EQ with real life<br/>\nroles/duties.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not actually a EQ player myself, but my husband is.  Since he started to<br/>\nplay EQ (over 6 months ago), we haven&#39;t done as much as we used to together.<br/>\nBefore EQ he played Ultima Online but was able to log whenever he felt like<br/>\nit in that game.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith EQ it seems like he has to be on longer to get anywhere in the game and<br/>\nhe isn&#39;t able to log whenever he wants to.  He is a level 50 ranger and is<br/>\nin the Plain of Fear a lot right now.  Due to the spawn rates he has to stay<br/>\nup late, and be online every day.  He even has taken off work periodically<br/>\nto be in the game more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know a lot of the game just because it is mostly all of what we talk about<br/>\nright now.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand online role playing as I ran my own computer BBS for over 5<br/>\nyears.  I was an avid MUD/MUSH player myself for a while and did play Ultima<br/>\nOnline for a bit too.   My husband and I actually meet on my BBS when I was<br/>\non college dated for about 3 years and have been married 3 1/2 years.  We<br/>\nare both avid computer game players.  Due to life/new hobbies/etc. I haven&#39;t<br/>\nbeen in online games myself for the past 3 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really don&#39;t mind him playing EQ as I know it is what he likes to do.  We<br/>\nhave an understanding that I let him play EQ and I spend my free time doing<br/>\nSCA (medieval re-inactment group) activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Christmas all he wanted was anything EQ related.  He also tells me if I<br/>\nwant to spend more time with him, that I should get a EQ account myself (we<br/>\nhave a home network which would make this possible). :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI was just wondering how others balance their life with their significant<br/>\nothers and EQ playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nJen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet 100% FREE Internet Access powered by Excite<br/>\nVisit <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://freeworld.excite.com\">http://freeworld.excite.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
