Then petition a few hours early for a GM/Guide to wed you. <br/>\nDepending on the availability of someone to do it, they will either just <br/>\nchange your last name, or they will perform the whole ceremony. It&#39;s a <br/>\ngood idea as a backup plan to have a friend able to perform the ceremony <br/>\n(probably a cleric or druid) in case there are no GMs or guides available. <br/>\nTry and hold your wedding during prime time when it&#39;s more likely a <br/>\nGM/guide will be on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ceremony is really what you make of it and what you want out of it. <br/>\nYou can always simply say you&#39;re married, and then petition for a last <br/>\nname change. If you haven&#39;t taken a last name yet, you can just use the <br/>\nsurname command to give yourself your partner&#39;s last name.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 8 Nov 2002, Meleficent Ouverts wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hey there ladies, i was wondering if you all have ever been married to another char in eq? what do you get them? how do you get wed? i am marryign a 34 dark elf necro. i am a 24 woodelf ranger, what to do?<br/>\n&gt; meleficent mordoria/ranger/24<br/>\n&gt;  stephanie pierce &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:steffy22us@...\">steffy22us@...</a>&gt; wrote:haha hell no not really lol go joyce  ---<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zen7598610@...\">zen7598610@...</a> wrote: &gt; well sometimes you get<br/>\n&gt; gifts, but is a man really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; worth all that? hehe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Joyce, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; galadriana dimystic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 54 enchanter veeshan server<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________ <br/>\n&gt; Post your free ad now! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://personals.yahoo.ca\">http://personals.yahoo.ca</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
