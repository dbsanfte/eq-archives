Can you tell us a bit about it?  Getting a little<br/>\n&gt;bored in Albion *sigh*.  Are there new classes and races one can try out?<br/>\n&gt;That might bring me to Luclin for a bit to see.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Trying to play an MMORPG with only 3-10 hours a week is a challenge.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;hard to stay connected to the community with that little time.  And I will<br/>\n&gt;never again have the time to devote to a plane raid.  Hmmm... maybe I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;have the lifestyle for this anymore *cries pitifully*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ice<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;____________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Get free e-mail and a permanent address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amexmail.com/?A=1\">http://www.amexmail.com/?A=1</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
