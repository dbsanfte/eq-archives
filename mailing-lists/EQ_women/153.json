What she said! &lt;points&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     I believe a cleric&#39;s first priority is the safety of her party, but<br/>\nthat, to me, is the nature of clerics, and it may not be to everyone (and<br/>\nfor sure I don&#39;t attribute it to a maternal instinct).  Now, this does not<br/>\nlimit her to healing everyone, as Christina said, but imbues her with the<br/>\njudgement call--do I cast an offensive spell that will drop the critter to a<br/>\nquarter of its health and make it easier for the tanks, or do I cast a<br/>\nhealing spell to keep the tanks alive?  Decisions, decisions.  Or does my<br/>\n&gt; hatred for my foe overcome me, til I need to get in there and bash away?<br/>\nIn the case of the Undead, one of our clerics really does seem to feel the<br/>\nneed to wreak his vengeance. It seems to be a RP thing, with the stuff he<br/>\nsnarls out of the corner of his mouth (honest!), and we all know we have to<br/>\nwatch our own butts a little more closely when fighting them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sara, Povar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:truffle@...\">truffle@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:truffle@...\">truffle@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Some people do see clerics as just healers, and indeed standard<br/>\npower-gamer strategy for high level groups is that the cleric spends all<br/>\ntheir time healing and meditating.  The theory is that it&#39;s better for a<br/>\ncleric to heal a tank (so the tank can fight longer) than it is for the<br/>\ncleric to tank herself.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; There are lots of ways you can play a cleric who doesn&#39;t just heal<br/>\nthough! Here are a few.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; First, during the first 20 levels clerics can tank pretty good.  It&#39;s<br/>\nonly at really high levels, when the warriors have dual wield, double<br/>\nattack, and much higher weapon skills, that the clerics start to fall way<br/>\nbehind.  If you&#39;re not a power gamer, you may find that you can have most or<br/>\nall of your fun playing your character up to level 20 or so, tanking away.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Second, you can hunt in the undead dungeons like Unrest and Befallen.<br/>\nThese dungeons are amazing for clerics--it turns you basicly into a wizard<br/>\nwho can heal and wear plate mail.  In fact, your spells do more damage and<br/>\ncost less mana than those of wizards the same level as you! So wade straight<br/>\ninto combat with those undead.  Smack them with your hammer, burn them with<br/>\nyour magic.  Submissive? I don&#39;t think so.  It&#39;s hard to be submissive when<br/>\neveryone in the dungeon is pleading with you to join their party.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Druids have also been mentioned as a great alternative to clerics.<br/>\nDruids have some of the highest damage spells in the game.  Our stinging<br/>\nswarm spells pack serious punch.  Our bolts are second only to those of<br/>\nwizards.  At high levels we can transform ourselves into wolves and get an<br/>\nattack bonus.  We can even transform our party tanks into wolves so they get<br/>\nan attack bonus. We also can heal very well, though not as good as clerics.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Paladins are another great option.  These girls can tank, dealing out<br/>\ndamage toe on toe with warriors (well, almost quite toe on toe).  We have<br/>\nthe added bonus of decent healing spells, some undead burn, and the<br/>\nincredible lay-on-hands that lets us &#39;emergency&#39; heal a party member for up<br/>\nto 1000 points of damage.  That&#39;s not bad for an ability you can use for<br/>\nfree every 90 minutes.  You can be sure if you&#39;re a Paladin, no one is going<br/>\nto ask you to go med while other people fight.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Last and perhaps most importantly of all, if you don&#39;t like medding<br/>\nduring combat, don&#39;t do it.  Tell your party members you&#39;re not here to be a<br/>\nwalking bandaid, and you&#39;re going to be tanking because you like to tank.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - Christina<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Get free personalized email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.iname.com\">http://www.iname.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;              Free Games & Cash Prizes!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Gamesville - The World&#39;s Biggest & Best Game Show Site!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Find people who care about what you care about.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; At ONElist:  your connection to community.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
