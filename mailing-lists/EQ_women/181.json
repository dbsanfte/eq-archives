Tough luck for me. The way I accidently dropped something was having all my slots full as I was looting my corpse and mistakenly trying to pick up something else with a right click. I shouted and ooced a bit asking if anyone had seen my backpack with my newbie club in it, but there was no answer. Forget it. Tough pattoooties on me. <br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: Page Kennon &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pickone@...\">pickone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@onelist.com\">EQ_women@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@onelist.com\">EQ_women@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Date: Wednesday, July 07, 1999 4:06 AM<br/>\n    Subject: [EQ_women] happenings<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    Hi everyone, <br/>\n    I have a question for You all, i dont know if anyone else has experianced this but well here goes.  I wont go in to which server and what characters but on the server that i play on a friend of mine was accused of stealing from another player, they say they didnt see the other person in the room and the other party involved swears on them sitting on top of this item for some reason they have dropped in the floor.  Now for the reasons this was in the floor i still dont understand.  Now this is me but if something is laying there its open for the taking people drop unwanted stuff all the time.  I wont go into all the deltails but there was a big todo about it and i was trying to talk my friend into giving it back and had them talked into it when the other party in question and their friends started threating.  Ok now this makes me angery be cause they threaten them with having a GM friend delete their character.  By this point i am angery one because i do what ever i can to help people, so i let them know how stupid i though this whole matter was to try to get someone deleted.... this lovely female if she was inturn desided she wanted to call me a bitch while all along i am trying to get her her things back in which i did.  Now i will take alot but that was something that was uncalled for me knowing if all of them had just kept their mouths shut i could have gotten the stuff back with out any furth happenings other than what had gone on before i logged on.  Has this happened to anyone else or is my server just full of rude Arse people? <br/>\n<br/>\n    Page :o)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
