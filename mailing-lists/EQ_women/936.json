Her younger sister (31) is - my guess - about <br/>\n250 lb. and frequently travels for sexual flings with men she meets <br/>\nonline.  They both have (as does my wife) several 60+ level EQ <br/>\ncharacters.  Neither have ever been married; both still live with <br/>\ntheir mother and stepfather.  Their biological father was arrested a <br/>\ncouple of years ago (charges later dropped) for sexually abusing his <br/>\nteenage stepdaughter.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@yahoogroups.com\">EQ_women@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dr. Mom&quot; &lt;drmom5@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Wow!  18 hours a day?
