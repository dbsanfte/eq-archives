I&#39;m hoping that means everyone else was ok with<br/>\nall the times.  I am nervous setting the time for the meeting based on<br/>\nonly three votes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to wait another couple days to let people vote.  If all times<br/>\nare ok with you, please send me an email saying that.  That will let<br/>\nreassure me that people will come 8)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll post new times, based on feedback from people who can&#39;t attend,<br/>\nand the delay of another vote taking.  I really hope people will come!<br/>\n<br/>\nMeeting times: <br/>\n  - Saturday 14th 10am-12pm PST<br/>\n  - Monday 16th 6-8pm PST<br/>\n  - Tuesday 17th 6-8pm PST<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope these times work out for people.  Please send in your vote or<br/>\n&#39;all of them are fine&#39; 8) <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you would like to join the guild before that, Luna and Briei (Beth&#39;s<br/>\ncharacter) are both capable of adding people.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina<br/>\n<br/>\n---- Original Message<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHi everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you may recall Suzanne was organizing an online meeting for mailing<br/>\nlist.  We chatted and agreed that Brell Serelis would be a great server to<br/>\nhave the meeting on.  This way we can all meet eachother, and also have a<br/>\nsubsequent guild event.  The subsequent event would be a newbie hunt,<br/>\nduring which newbies could hunt critters, and higher level guild members<br/>\ncould help them out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to hold a brief vote on the time and place of the meeting on<br/>\nbrell.  The time matters because we all have different schedules.  The<br/>\nplace only matters in terms of where the newbie hunt will take place.<br/>\nPlease respond to this email if you have a preference (if you don&#39;t care,<br/>\nyou dont need to respond).  If any given meeting time is impossible for<br/>\nyou, please say that, I&#39;ll try and minimize those conflicts.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeeting places:<br/>\n    - Greater Faydark stone ring (kelethin newbie zone)<br/>\n    - East Freeport newbie zone<br/>\n<br/>\nMeeting times:<br/>\n    - Tuesday August 10th 6pm-8pm PST<br/>\n    - Thursday August 10th 6pm-8pm PST<br/>\n    - Saturday August 14th 10am-12pm PST<br/>\n<br/>\nVote will be closed friday at 6pm PST and I&#39;ll post the results that<br/>\nevening.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to use the guild chat feature to make our meeting easier.  Even<br/>\nif you&#39;re not planning on playing on Brell, you can make a newbie and join<br/>\nthe guild, to use this feature.  It allows us to send tells to our entire<br/>\nguild, so we can hear conversation even if we&#39;re not exactly in the same<br/>\nphysical area.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d also like to suggest an unofficial guild hunt Saturday August 7th at<br/>\nnoon PST.  The location will be wherever the official one will be held<br/>\n(results posted Friday evening).  This is for those of us who&#39;d like to<br/>\nget into playing together ASAP.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
