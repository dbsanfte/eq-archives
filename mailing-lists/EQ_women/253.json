Guys are just too silly aren&#39;t they? They see a blonde graphic and start<br/>\nto follow it around, but won&#39;t do the same for a brunette graphic? No wonder<br/>\nthey fall for silicone breasts and bleach blondes in real life! :)<br/>\nAs I play a dwarf I have a less &quot;seductive&quot; look in-game, something I share<br/>\nwith other short people like gnomes and halflings (and of course ogres and<br/>\ntrolls :) I guess the programmers like the long legged half nudes, but kept<br/>\nus short and stumpy folk in more sensible knee socks and heftier underwear.<br/>\nI personally think a lot of the female clothing looks beautiful (wood elf<br/>\nbanded is one of my favourites), but I do understand the comments about it<br/>\nlooking rather trampy and downright hard to wear in battle. It would be nice<br/>\nif there was an option to have your outfit either revealing or not so<br/>\nrevealing. Like a roleplay switch sort of :) Then the female casters could<br/>\nchoose a bustier look, and the warriors could (if they so wished) choose to<br/>\ncover themselves a bit more.<br/>\nAnyway, I hope this clothing issue doesn&#39;t discourage too many players. Male<br/>\nhormones must not be allowed to destroy our gaming experience!<br/>\n<br/>\nMaria, aka Disa, dwarven cleric on Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
