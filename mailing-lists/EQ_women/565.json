For me fulfilled by fantasies is a better phrase I think. I have a psychological challenge due to events","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-785453729\">Interesting thought - &quot;deterred by fantasies&quot;.   For me &quot;fulfilled by<br/>\nfantasies&quot; is a better phrase I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a psychological &quot;challenge&quot; due to events that happened to me as a<br/>\ntoddler.  One therapist&#39;s view was &quot;Well, if someone asked me how to ruin a<br/>\nperson&#39;s life, I&#39;d tell them to do what happened to you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, so I can sit back and feel sorry for myself and let my life be ruined,<br/>\nor I can go out and take the bull by the horns and wrestle it to the ground.<br/>\nI have chosen the latter.  I know what the deficit is.  I know what triggers<br/>\nthe extreme reactions.  And I have, through the help of some highly talented<br/>\nprofessionals, developed an arsenal for dealing with my &quot;ruined life&quot; events<br/>\nwhen they get triggered.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not something that will ever go away.  The best I can do is manage<br/>\nit.  And one way I can manage it is by filling that great void inside of me<br/>\nthrough fantasy.  This is not something I can ask my husband to fulfill as<br/>\ndoing so would warp our marriage.  This is not something I want my kids to<br/>\neven see (though they know sometimes Mom is really struggling and as they<br/>\nget older they learn a bit more about why).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, by examining how my relationship with Sylv filled this void and<br/>\nrecognizing it was not wanting that part of the fantasy to go that was<br/>\ncausing the pain, we were able to find a &quot;win/win/win&quot; situation for all<br/>\nthree of us.  I could not emotionally handle having a tragic ending to my<br/>\nlittle romantic comedy.  Ending the romance left Ice homeless and unloved<br/>\nand, well, who wants to play THAT?!?!?!?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we backed the story up to the night when he decided to &quot;throw propriety<br/>\nto the wind&quot; and we started our romance.  This time, he makes a different<br/>\nchoice.  He adheres to propriety and instead of having an affair with me, he<br/>\nadopts me.  I still mother his orphaned newborn twins (their mother commited<br/>\nsuicide and they were ripped from her womb by an eagle).  He still comforts<br/>\nme through the death of my fiancee (his son - which is why there was a major<br/>\npropriety issue) while I comfort him through the death of his wife.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo sad endings.  And the paternal relationship, which was a major part of<br/>\nour romance anyway, still lives.  There is just no underlying romance.  I<br/>\nwish he weren&#39;t so dedicated to the Empress (boy, does that story line<br/>\nsuddenly fit ;-) but my childhood crush will be replaced by a more<br/>\nappropriate relationship eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat RP, a good story, and doesn&#39;t threaten his girlfriend.  I&#39;m actually<br/>\nquite proud of this solution.  And we were laughing ourselves silly last<br/>\nnight as we kicked off the new RP (he had to pick himself up off the floor<br/>\nwhen I told him that I thought it was time to stop mourning Cian&#39;s death and<br/>\nstart dating - he&#39;s even giving me advice on who he thinks would be good for<br/>\nme to go out with).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also answers her question about his first marriage in Norrath.  &quot;How can<br/>\nyou say those things to another woman when you haven&#39;t said them to me?&quot; .<br/>\nBecause IRL you can&#39;t go back and rewrite your story when things go awry.<br/>\nIn Norrath you can!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when things get tough, I can still close my eyes and have him hold me<br/>\nand tell me there is nothing to be afraid of.  All the anxiety is from a<br/>\npast that is over and won&#39;t repeat itself.   And since this is one of the<br/>\nmajor tools in my aresenal against allowing my childhood to ruin my life,<br/>\nkeeping it is important.<br/>\n<br/>\nIce<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  Yes, he knows about the issues I face and he knows his role in my<br/>\ndealing with them.  It would be dishonest not to tell him.  And it makes him<br/>\nfeel good that he helps.  Because, after all, isn&#39;t that what friends are<br/>\nfor?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: JudyCA &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:judycagem@...\">judycagem@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@egroups.com\">EQ_women@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, July 13, 2000 2:40 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_women] Long reply and maybe some help for Judy (or not!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; oh wow I totally agree with all you said and hope<br/>\n&gt; others with hubbies and kids will appreciate the real<br/>\n&gt; life....and not be deterred by fantasies<br/>\n&gt; Remember Life is short & precious..and real life needs<br/>\n&gt; to be tendered with love, joy, and sharing<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; May all your dreams, wishes, and ideas lead you to the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;real thing&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Aka Royal Gem<br/>\n&gt; and aka Royalgem<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; =====<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Cherish your wishes and your dreams, as they are<br/>\n&gt; the children of your soul and the blueprints of your<br/>\n&gt; ultimate achievement.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get Yahoo!
