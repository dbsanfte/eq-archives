They have new rules: trivial loot, race/class/deity alignments that<br/>\nprohibit grouping and guilding with non aligned players, language barriers (no<br/>\ncommon tongue at all), everyone is ROLEPLAY ON, and only one character is<br/>\nallowed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI played it the last two nights and had a BLAST!  Everyone in Everfrost (never<br/>\ndid play Shaman past 9 before) was roleplaying.  I hear that wasn&#39;t the case<br/>\nin GFay and Qeynos but that the RP&#39;ers were pretty strong and insistent and<br/>\nthe spam quieted down.  The chars will be wiped out once the server goes live,<br/>\nbut I kind of like Katrice and will probably keep her.  I love the Shaman<br/>\npotions they can make now :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nA few powergamers have decided to come to FV to see how the new rules affect<br/>\npeople, and as long as they don&#39;t uber guild the server and camp the dragons<br/>\nand make the high end game SUCK I don&#39;t mind.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the rumor is the server goes live the day DAoC is released.  I&#39;m<br/>\nplanning on getting DAoC, but I may just not cancel my EQ account quite yet. <br/>\nAO, on the other hand, BIG YAWN!  Made it to 10 and quitting.  Good try, but<br/>\nthe game is just too buggy *sigh*.<br/>\n<br/>\nIce<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet free e-mail and a permanent address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amexmail.com/?A=1\">http://www.amexmail.com/?A=1</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
