I&#39;ve \n  made a <br>couple of good friends who are more experienced then me and don&#39;t \n  <br>seem to mind giving advice or helping out so that&#39;s very nice.<br><br>I&#39;ve \n  also been trying to learn more about my role as a Ranger in <br>Norrath. I \n  just found out last week what a handy thing taunt can be <br>when trying to \n  keep a mob off your healer? OK, I&#39;m slow but I&#39;m <br>getting there I think. \n  And I&#39;ve gotten duel wield and double attack <br>now so that&#39;s interesting to \n  play with.<br><br>Last night a Druid friend and I went to Paudal Cavern for my \n  first <br>trip there. I would have died twice during the first fight we had I \n  <br>think if they had not been there to keep me from deaths door. That <br>was \n  a tough mob and red all the way for me at lvl 19 (20 now).<br><br>Anyway, \n  enough ramblin, so it&#39;s question time:<br><br>1.) I have been asked to get \n  married and have said yes. :o) Any good <br>suggestions on locations that \n  would be nice but not to hard for <br>guests to get to? He has a place in \n  mind, I forget the name, but it <br>sounds like it might be hard for lower \n  level characters to even <br>reach. I have not traveled over much of Norrath \n  still so I&#39;m not <br>sure. Anyway, if anyone has ideas I&#39;d love to hear \n  them.<br>Also, when things are set, which may be a while I&#39;ll post a note here \n  <br>letting everyone know. You are all invited, of course, feel free to \n  <br>come if you have a character on the Xegony server, of if you want <br>just \n  create a quick one at the proper time and come anyway. I&#39;d love <br>to meet \n  anyone who might do me the honor of coming.<br><br>2.) Can anyone give me \n  advice on how to find a guild that might be <br>interested in letting a Ranger \n  in the low 20&#39;s join? Would it be ok <br>to just kind of start asking around? \n  Is there a way to tell a better <br>guild from one not as good?<br><br>Anyway, \n  I hope everyone had a nice Thanksgiving.<br><br>Hugs<br>:o)<br>Bran<br>lvl 20 \n  Wood Elf Ranger<br><br><br></tt><br><tt>Your use of Yahoo!
