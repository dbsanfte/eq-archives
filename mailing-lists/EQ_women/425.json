The first thing you want to decide is what type of player you think you will want to be.  There are three basic kinds of players: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1772453024\">Welcome to the addiction...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first thing you want to decide is what type of player you think you<br/>\nwill want to be.  There are three basic kinds of players:<br/>\n<br/>\nTANKS - these characters do a lot of &quot;mellee&quot; - actually hitting and<br/>\nsmashing on things, they require a LOT of equipment which means money<br/>\nand lots of time searching for armor, the best weapons, etc.  They get<br/>\nto kick, bash, dual weild, dodge, taunt etc.  The tank is expected to go<br/>\ndown to protect caster and healers.  They usually do the pulling of the<br/>\nMoBs, take the most damage, and often die the most frequently, though<br/>\nthat depends in good part on the skill of the group.<br/>\n    advantages:  they are the most active of the group<br/>\n    disadvantages: they can only be bound in major cities so have lots<br/>\nof travel when they day; they have long downtime for healing if not<br/>\npaired with a healer<br/>\n<br/>\nCASTERS - these are the characters that use magic to damage the MoBs.<br/>\nThey can either do direct damage, damage over time, or area damage.<br/>\nThey don&#39;t get or need nearly as much in the way of equipment, however<br/>\nthe spells cost money and at higher levels must be researched which<br/>\nmeans collecting and sorting through tons of runes and words.  Your bank<br/>\nwill look more like a library than a safety deposit box.   Casters don&#39;t<br/>\nreally mellee anymore at the higher levels and battle is a matter of<br/>\njudicious use of manna.<br/>\n    advantages:  they do best in kill stealing areas, its just fun to<br/>\nnuke the hell out of a MoB, they can bind themselves wherever they are<br/>\nfighting<br/>\n    disadvantages:  no strength, very low hit points, LOTS of time spent<br/>\nstaring at the spell book meditating<br/>\n<br/>\nHEALERS:  These people spend their time buffing and healing the group.<br/>\nThey have a few direct damage spells, weaker than pure casters, and they<br/>\ndo some mellee which means they can wear armor and have the same<br/>\nequipment hunting fun as the tanks.  But mostly they heal.  The healer<br/>\nis the most beloved and most protected member of any group.  A wise<br/>\ngroup does NOT let the healer die.  And when fighting groups with<br/>\nhealers, always kill the healer first.<br/>\n    advantages:  well loved and can always find a group, only has<br/>\ndowntime for manna, can bind anywhere like casters.<br/>\n    disadvantages:  always getting requests.  &quot;buff me, heal me, feed<br/>\nme&quot;  is pretty much all you hear.   And prone to attack since healing<br/>\naggravates MoBs.  Spends as much time meditating as casters, but has<br/>\nmore strength<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, once you decide the basic TYPE of play you want, then you can look<br/>\nat the classes.  I advise you pick the class first and the race second<br/>\neven though the &quot;Character Select&quot; screen is geared the other way.  Some<br/>\nclasses are limited, such as Shamans.   Only Barbarians, Trolls, and<br/>\nOgres can be Shamans.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmong the different basic categories is some crossover.  The basic TANK<br/>\nis the warrior.  However, Paladins, Shadow Knights, and Rangers are also<br/>\nconsidred tanks.  All of these are 3/4 warrior.  The Paladin is 1/4<br/>\ncleric.  The SK 1/4 necormancer.  The Ranger 1/4 Druid.   This means<br/>\nthey get the skills of the other class, only their spells will be<br/>\nsignificantly weaker.  They also take experience penalties because they<br/>\nare hybrids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe basic CASTER is the wizard.  The wizard does the most DD of all the<br/>\ncasting classes, but has no pet and is toast soloing if root doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwork (my experience at least).  The Magician is second most powerful,<br/>\nwith lesser spells but with a pet to tank for him.  Enchanters are also<br/>\npure casters and very well loved at the high levels once they can<br/>\nmesmerize and cast clarity.   Necromancers are pure casters as well, and<br/>\nprobably one of, if not THE, most powerful classes with the strongest<br/>\npets in the game and the ability to heal off the prey plus use health<br/>\nfor manna.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe basic HEALER is the cleric.  They have the most powerful of all<br/>\nhealing spells and the best buffs in the game.  They are also very<br/>\npowerful casters against the undead.  I would list Shamans, Druids, and<br/>\nBards as healers as well, since they get good healing and buffing<br/>\nskills.  However, they also get excellent Damage over Time spells and<br/>\nsome decent DD.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you figure out which class, then you might want to decide whether<br/>\nyou want to play good guy or bad guy.  Bad guy is harder because there<br/>\nare so many places you are killed on sight and a lot of time needs to be<br/>\nspent fixing factions for easier travel.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it comes to pumping up your stats, if you are a caster or healer,<br/>\nput everything you can into int (caster) or wisdom (healer).  If you are<br/>\na tank, strength and dexterity are important.  The green characteristics<br/>\non the screen are the ones you want to pump up.  But your manna will be<br/>\ndetermined by int and wisdom and I find being encumbered because I can&#39;t<br/>\ncarry anything pretty tolerable as a caster since I don&#39;t move much<br/>\nduring battle anyway.  Pretty pathetic trying to travel with 3,000 loose<br/>\ncoins though *smiles*.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen go out and start killing snakes and rats and bats.  Ask questions<br/>\nin /ooc and you&#39;ll get tons of help.  It&#39;s a mostly friendly game,<br/>\nreally.<br/>\n<br/>\nDnaisha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Brangvyne@...\">Brangvyne@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Salutations All!<br/>\n&gt; It has been a bit since I have posted asking for some input on getting the game Ever Quest. I do appreciate the input I got and I did end up buying the game a few weeks ago. However, with one thing and another I did not get it installed onto my computer until today and as of right now I still have not signed on. That will probably be tomorrow sometime.<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, now that I am actually on the verge of getting started I had a couple of questions I was hoping some of you might help answer.<br/>\n&gt; 1.) The tutorial that is included on the CD keeps locking up. Did anyone else have this problem? It has me a bit worried in that I am afraid that the game might do the same thing. It always happens shortly after leaving the guildmaster to go get some food. Any input, or suggestions?<br/>\n&gt; I will be contacting the website to see if they might know why but was wondering if any of you had the same problem.<br/>\n&gt; 2.) Can anyone give me some suggestion on where to start or what to do first? Some suggestions from those who have been there and done that might be helpful/useful?<br/>\n&gt; 3.) Anyone looking for a trainee or companion to go adventuring with. I plan on trying to start with a half-elf bard, and am looking forward to doing some adventuring with someone or several someones if anyone is interested in taking on a beginner.<br/>\n&gt; Well, I hope everyone had a good Christmas and look foward to chating a bit and seeing some of you in the world of EQ.<br/>\n&gt; Happy Adventuring,<br/>\n&gt; Brangvyne<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    ----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;                                [Image]<br/>\n&gt;                               Click Here<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
