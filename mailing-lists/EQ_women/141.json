Alot of us are married to or live with someone,<br/>\nand they have a significant effect on how we play.  Right now, I&#39;m in the<br/>\nprocess of moving to the East Coast, without said SO, and the sad part is, the<br/>\nfact that I&#39;m a gamer and roleplayer and he isn&#39;t has something to do with it. I<br/>\nwas content to try to be the perfect &quot;fit&quot; until he started standing over my<br/>\nshoulder every time I got on the computer.  That was when I first realized we<br/>\nhad some serious problems.  I noticed that I had no RL friends anymore because I<br/>\nwas strongly discouraged from seeing them.  I work, and I buy groceries, and I<br/>\ngo home.  I didn&#39;t even realize I was being controlled until he started telling<br/>\nme who I could and could not hunt with.  And this from a supposedly enlightened,<br/>\nintelligent, strong-minded woman.  Sheesh. &lt;grins&gt;<br/>\n    I don&#39;t know if anyone else has had my sort of experience or not, and I hope<br/>\nyou haven&#39;t.  But it IS a valid argument for discussing how we deal with our<br/>\ndomestic relationships.  If one woman here reads and relates to anything any of<br/>\nus write, then it&#39;s all worthwhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nSara, Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn Lamb wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Dawn Lamb&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dawn@...\">dawn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When I intruduced myself earlier I just told you about my character, but now<br/>\n&gt; about myself. I am a 31 year old married mother of 3 all under the age of 5.<br/>\n&gt; My husband is one of my group mates and plays a female. He gets more<br/>\n&gt; flirting and stuff than I do, which rather makes me jealous I think. (Of<br/>\n&gt; course when his character runs around half nekkid when he dies he can&#39;t help<br/>\n&gt; but get flirted with ya know?) When asked about my age I am honest and tell<br/>\n&gt; them how old I am. And I have openly made a point of telling those that ask<br/>\n&gt; that I am married because my husband is the jealous type. About the only<br/>\n&gt; comments I have gotten so far are about the new banded mail I am wearing, it<br/>\n&gt; is rather um...form fitting on the top. My husband does not tell others his<br/>\n&gt; age, marital status nor his gender. Oh well that is his business and this<br/>\n&gt; list is not about him right? :) Sorry to ramble on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Zoya (Dawn)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
