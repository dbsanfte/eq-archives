I have seen female characters begging for things<br/>\neither free or for less than the going price...saw this yesterday and<br/>\nwas VERY verbal to the young lady as she was not only a half-elf, but<br/>\nalso a bard...Needless to say that Genneth got quite righteous!  (but<br/>\ntotally in character)  As for myself, most of the things that I have<br/>\nbeen given came from guildmembers either passing along outdated items<br/>\n(which I have also done for newer guild members)or just being nice<br/>\nbecause a bard is always poor (I have a Qeynos guard shield that was<br/>\nsuch a gift).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t consider this gift giving twinking.  And if someone in my guild<br/>\ngave me a full set of armor, I would take it and when I earned enough<br/>\nto replace it with better, I would pass the gift along...I never sell<br/>\ngifts...<br/>\n<br/>\n Genneth<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
