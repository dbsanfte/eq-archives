I&#39;ve been RPGing<br/>\nsince I was 11 years old (started in pre D&D era), and since D&D, AD&D,<br/>\nTraveller, ICE, GURPS etc ... all came out when I was in high school to<br/>\ncollege I pen & paper RPed/GMed/DMed a lot back then.  I ran an all-female<br/>\ngroup around 20 years ago in my college hometown which at one time included<br/>\nmy then 80-90-year-old (passed away now) conservative German immigrant<br/>\ngrandmother.  She would visit and I really got to ask &quot;Canasta or D&D?&quot;. :)<br/>\n I also ran mixed and male-only (except for me) groups. <br/>\n<br/>\nDue to time contraints of job and children I haven&#39;t done pencil & paper<br/>\ngames for at well over a decade, but do play on-line!  I&#39;ve played other<br/>\non-line RPGs (but not UO for more than 1 week) for years, and am now<br/>\nplaying in EQ.  Since I never have enough time ... my characters &quot;never<br/>\namount to much&quot;.  But I have fun!  My almost teen daughter has played<br/>\non-line with me in two other RPGs (supervised), and helps with the EQ<br/>\ncharacter creation.  If I can ever get ADSL here, we&#39;ll be a mother &<br/>\ndaughter team on-line. :) Sometimes I think we have as much fun coming up<br/>\nwith the ideas for a character as actually playing them. <br/>\n<br/>\nI like to experiment with character ideas and right now have no &quot;main&quot;<br/>\ncharacter.  So far I like Enchanter & Bard.  Though my Necromancer is<br/>\nsurprisingly fun to play.  I sort of enjoy the amazement (do they even<br/>\nbelive me?) when I claim that it REALLY is a female player behind this<br/>\nfemale character.  I know thay don&#39;t belive me when I tell many of the<br/>\ncollege age males that I&#39;ve been playing/running RPGs longer than they&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen alive (and I&#39;m female). ;)  I mainly play on Erollisi Marr, but<br/>\noccasionally play on the Test Server.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Lora<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.<br/>\nMy husband tolerates us well (he&#39;s not an RPGer), and I&#39;m waiting to see if<br/>\nmy son got &quot;the gene&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the moment:<br/>\nStarling, Lisonja, Ainsley, Meute, Mitte, Shaelie & Leontine<br/>\non Erollisi Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
