So, I only let myself<br/>\nplay maybe 5 hours a week during the semester and just<br/>\nlet myself play the 12 hours a day if I want to during<br/>\nthe summer and winter break. <br/>\nI guess it&#39;s really a one or the other situation. I<br/>\nknow if I&#39;m gonna play EQ I&#39;m not gonna want to get<br/>\noff when I&#39;m supposed to so most of the time I just<br/>\ndon&#39;t let myself play. I guess I&#39;m a little obsessive<br/>\nwhen it comes to role playing games. <br/>\nThe whole time thing about EQ: Yeah, I&#39;ve noticed it<br/>\ntakes way longer to get anything done in this game. In<br/>\nUO I could get wherever I wanted to go lickety split<br/>\njust by gating, but EQ, sheesh, it&#39;s a half hour<br/>\ncommitment just to run through 5 zones. Ridiculous. :/<br/>\nI think that it&#39;s just the downside of makeing play<br/>\ndependant upon other players, you spend more time<br/>\ntrying to coordinate times to be on together and just<br/>\ngetting a darn group together. <br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
