My husband and son  were beta testers and I gave them a hard<br/>\ntime about how much they liked to play the game until I tried it<br/>\nmyself.  I now have three main characters I play on the Rathe server, a<br/>\ndruid (my favorite), a ranger, and a paladin.  I also have a couple of<br/>\nminor ones the I am trying out.  My husband and son play also and we are<br/>\nvery lucky to have a couple of good computers so we can play together.<br/>\nPeople get a kick out of finding that our characters are really mother<br/>\nand son though its not as unusual when my husband and I play together.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are trying to get together enough folks to start our own guild and<br/>\nare just about there.  I think that will make it even more fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood hunting,<br/>\nJackie<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women-owner@onelist.com\">EQ_women-owner@onelist.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hi there, and welcome to EQ Women!
