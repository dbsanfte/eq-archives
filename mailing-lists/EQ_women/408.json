I am <br/>\ncurrently playing way to many characters *smile*.  I play mostly on The Rathe <br/>\nserver, but have started a druid on Brell. I will be joining the Sisterhood <br/>\nwith her as soon as im old enough to travel to Freeport.  I am determined to <br/>\nstay near Kelethin until I reach 9th level.  I must get the ability to <br/>\nmeditate before traveling far (I cant stand not having it, makes me insane).  <br/>\nSo since it so close to a spell level I figure I mine as well do that as well <br/>\nbefore leaving.<br/>\nI was curious to know if the possibility of taking this guild to multiple <br/>\nservers was ever considered.  I know that when my Husband started his <br/>\nguild... he was told that once it was approved that he was welcome to start <br/>\nhis guild on &quot;any and all servers&quot;.  I ask simply because I find the whole <br/>\nconcept to be wonderfully rich in role-play potential, but people can never <br/>\nreally leave there main characters... admit it hehe if we leave them for to <br/>\nlong we feel guilty lol.<br/>\nAnyhow it was just a thought :)  I look forward to seeing more of you in game <br/>\nas well as here, until then safe travels and good hunting to all of you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarigold</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
