I have <br/>\nstarted them, but don&#39;t seem to get far before I lose interest; I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think I can easily explain this. The experience is not vastly <br/>\ndifferent from playing a newbie female, since, on the whole, people <br/>\nare willing to help and give you things. I wonder if it is different <br/>\nat higher levels? Does a female playing a male come across as camp? <br/>\nDo the male players react to that? What would you need to do to carry <br/>\noff playing a male more convincingly?<br/>\n<br/>\nI certainly notice some, not all, groups being somewhat patronising <br/>\n(eg assuming a male player will pull, when I am plainly better <br/>\nequipped and more experienced in the locality), but the same groups <br/>\ntend to be more likely to be protective towards me too. I suppose <br/>\nthat is an advantage, but one I do not seek or welcome. Like anyone <br/>\nelse, I want to play with a trustworthy, competent group, and fulfil <br/>\nmy role in it. Perhaps the oddest thing is that the patronising type <br/>\nof group often doesn&#39;t know whether I am female, but merely goes from <br/>\nthe skin I wear.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of you have far more experience than me, and must have tried <br/>\nthis out more extensively. <br/>\n<br/>\nLiz</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
