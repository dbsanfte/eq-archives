I have been harassed by a young dwarf, <br/>\nwho was crude, profane and persistent during the first few days of <br/>\nproduction in March.  Needless to say, I learned how &#39;/petition&#39; worked and <br/>\nhe was slapped down and repeatedly warned by other players, guides and GM&#39;s <br/>\nalike until he learned to quell his urge to poke any and everything that <br/>\nwalked by.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I have observed another Fennin Ro female player, who shall remain <br/>\nnameless, use OUTRAGEOUS sexual overtones to sell her wares.  One wondered <br/>\nif it was just leather armor she was selling, but it is interesting to <br/>\nwatch her use sex as a way to control male players.  She has been doing <br/>\nthis since production and I have recently played in a group in Unrest with <br/>\nher and she does keep the patter up.  You would think she would get tired <br/>\nof it and concentrate on the game, but it seems that this IS her game, <br/>\nso.......I watch and wonder.  I have met two men who are playing female <br/>\ncharacters and was able to detect it immediately, and they admitted it in <br/>\nprivate tells.  I have kept their secret, but over time they have improved <br/>\ntheir &#39;femininity&#39;, so I think that few others know that they are male in <br/>\nRL.  I have been saddened to not have made friends with other female <br/>\ncharacters on-line in EQ, when I have had wonderful lady friends on other <br/>\non-line games and miss them terribly.  Thus, my hopes soared when this <br/>\nmailing list was created.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am always up front about my age when I am asked, but I am not too forth <br/>\ncoming when I am asked for my email address or for personal pictures.  I <br/>\nalways say that I am an ugly, fat, old, rich women and that usually puts a <br/>\nstop to the pushiness.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have taken on the role of &#39;Auntie&#39; to a few fellow players.  One who is <br/>\nmarried on EQ.  He is baffled by his woman friend<br/>\nand her behavior and doesn&#39;t understand periodic moodiness.  He always <br/>\nthinks he has done something wrong.  Another, slowly budding, only wants to <br/>\nrelate to women on-line who live half a world away from him in real life. <br/>\n It is so much safer emotionally and has more richness to his fantasy if <br/>\nthere is no chance of meeting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the half-elves, high elves and wood elf women get hit on the most <br/>\nsince they seem like such &#39;pin-up&#39; girls to the young male players.  I <br/>\nthink that men are biologically over balanced from visual stimulation in <br/>\nreal life, and these types of female characters are the epitome of a male <br/>\nfantasy girl-thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn that note, do you notice that we are the Girls of Norrath on some <br/>\nweb-sites, but they are the Men of Norrath?  Think that is a subconscious <br/>\nneed to control, by belittling???<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that is my two coppers worth.  Hope it fuels some discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nDornita and Dornar<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mystyrain8@...\">Mystyrain8@...</a> [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mystyrain8@...\">Mystyrain8@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tWednesday, June 16, 1999 3:45 PM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@onelist.com\">EQ_women@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\tRe: [EQ_women] Women on EQ: Flirting<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mystyrain8@...\">Mystyrain8@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHello All,<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to jump in on this topic and introduce myself at the same time. <br/>\n My<br/>\nname is Mystyrain and Im a 17th (almost 18th) level Magician on <br/>\nCazic-Thule.<br/>\nI have never found flirting to be a real problem, though there are some <br/>\nguys<br/>\nthat are extremely crass about it.  Most of them flirt in fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been fairly lucky, I managed to find a wonderful Monk to concentrate <br/>\nmy &quot;serious&quot; flirting on and now we are engaged to be married.  There is<br/>\nstill a lot of non-serious flirting that goes on but everyone is pretty <br/>\nmuch<br/>\naware that Im taken now.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat i get a lot of is, &quot;Are you a girl IRL?&quot;.  As if that makes a<br/>\ndifference.  I always have to laugh at that one.  Some guys find it so hard <br/>\nto believe that women actually LIKE these kinds of games too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Light,<br/>\n<br/>\nMystyrain<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nHow has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\nShare your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
