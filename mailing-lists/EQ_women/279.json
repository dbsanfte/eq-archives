Wow, what a move....&lt;groans&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as our meeting goes, here is a rough update.  So far, Friday and<br/>\nWednesdays are bad days for us, and it&#39;s going to be the first week of August.<br/>\nHow about that first Thursday? Any one have a conflict with that?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have made a character named Ishtarre, who will act as hostess only to the<br/>\npoint of getting everyone together.  She will probably be 3rd or 4th at the<br/>\nmost.  I will be getting her to Freeport, where she will start making bat<br/>\ncrunchies like there is no tomorrow. =)  Make a new character, bring one if you<br/>\nhave one already so we can see who you like to be, whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really excited about this.  I don&#39;t know anyone here yet except my family<br/>\nand I won&#39;t be starting college until the fall, so......I&#39;m lonely! hehe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa Johnson wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Melissa Johnson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mnj_@...\">mnj_@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; are we all making newbie level 1s then or should we have a character up some<br/>\n&gt; in levels?
