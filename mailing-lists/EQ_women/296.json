Our characters roleplayed together and we were married<br/>\non-line, at the time I was married in real life (but not happily).  After<br/>\ntime, we became RL friends (though we never met) and then I got a divorce<br/>\nand we met in real life. He moved to where i live and we have been together<br/>\nfor 5 years and got married just last year.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have known people that have gotten really involved in their characters and<br/>\nit has spilled into real life and has caused divorces, great marriages,<br/>\ngreat friendships etc. I think if you and the person you are roleplaying<br/>\nwith have a clear understanding that this is JUST a roleplay thing<br/>\n(especially if you are married or in another serious relationship in real<br/>\nlife) then you will be fine.  Your partner in real life may not understand<br/>\nthis roleplaying relationship either and it can cause a great deal of<br/>\njealousy.  Roleplaying the honeymoon can enter dangerous territory. I<br/>\nprobably dont need to say much more on that subject, unless you both<br/>\nunderstand what you are doing.  Roleplaying (no matter what people say) can<br/>\ncreate alot of emotions for you in real life that you may not want.  For me<br/>\nit was a very positive experience that lead to me meeting my best friend, my<br/>\nhusband.  It was not what I was looking for, but I am sure my husband at the<br/>\ntime thought it was the worst thing I ever got involved in.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to ramble on, and some may not agree.. but in the end if you both have<br/>\nan understanding I think you will be okay.  It is alright in my mind to say<br/>\nooc that you are married, engaged, single etc. so that if someone has the<br/>\nidea that since you are roleplaying a romantic relationship it can become<br/>\nsomething more, they will know what to expect.  And yes, you never know who<br/>\nis behind the character!  Hope this helps some!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Judy Tyrer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:judy3t@...\">judy3t@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@onelist.com\">EQ_women@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, August 03, 1999 6:43 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_women] Marriage<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Judy Tyrer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:judy3t@...\">judy3t@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As my character is marrying on Sunday I must confess to a few minor<br/>\nqualms.  In<br/>\n&gt; particular, er, how does one roleplay a honeymoon *smile*.  Unlike many<br/>\nwho<br/>\n&gt; develop relationships in Norrath, my beloved and I are unknown to one<br/>\nanother in<br/>\n&gt; RL.  For all I know he weighs 300 pounds, guzzles beer, and is hygenically<br/>\n&gt; challenged *smile*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are times if I wonder if this is a positive thing to be doing.  I<br/>\nmean,<br/>\n&gt; what if he is some starry eyed adolescent and I ruin him for life *grin*.<br/>\nI know<br/>\n&gt; MY lines are clearly drawn in fuzz (okay, I think I know the difference<br/>\nbetween<br/>\n&gt; reality and fantasy though I swear I saw a Pixie Trickster in the airport<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; other day *grin*).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, this is all fun and games and I am having fun.  But there is this<br/>\npart in<br/>\n&gt; the back of my mind that wonders.  Because unlike reading romance novels<br/>\n(blech -<br/>\n&gt; persish the thought) there is another person involved in my little fantasy<br/>\nand I<br/>\n&gt; must never forget that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any other hard core role players out there struggle with these ridiculous<br/>\n&gt; issues?  Any other players over the age of 25, for that matter *smile*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dnaice on Quellious<br/>\n&gt; Trisango on Brell Serilis<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist announces &quot;FRIENDS & FAMILY!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; For details, including our weekly drawing, go to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
