If he&#39;d play, in game as well as life, I<br/>\nwould be with him.  BUT he doesn&#39;t play and in game I have a steady<br/>\nlove interest from my guild.  He knows i&#39;m married in RL, my husband<br/>\nknows I have been &quot;seeing&quot; this other elf on line, and I know that my<br/>\non-line boyfriend is also married, and his wife knows that he is seeing<br/>\nmy character on line.  Does that make sense?  <br/>\n<br/>\nOther characters who have flirted with Genneth seriously also know that<br/>\nI am married.  I try to be honest about that to the guys out there who<br/>\nsee a cute bardic lass and don&#39;t connect her to the woman behind her. <br/>\nIf I think they are flirting really hard and are misinterpreting Genn&#39;s<br/>\nin character responses, I always tell them so there will be no<br/>\nmisunderstandings.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
