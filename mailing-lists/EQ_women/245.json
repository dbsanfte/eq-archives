One of the things I&#39;d like to set up is a petition to get<br/>\nless revealing clothing options for everquest characters.  In particular,<br/>\nI think you should be able to set your newbie (naked) clothing to be something<br/>\nbetter than, for example, a dark elf bikini.  It would also be nice if you<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have to wear plate mail before you could get armor that didn&#39;t look<br/>\nlike fine mesh with an exposed neckline.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d want this to be an online petition, maybe associated with one of the<br/>\nEverquest websites.  Does anyone know if any of those sites have those<br/>\nsorts of things? I&#39;ve seen lots of &#39;polls&#39; (but really I don&#39;t want to do<br/>\nthis as a poll, otherwise all the 16 year old boys will vote no).  I want<br/>\nsomething where you can submit a form I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
