My fiance and I both play EQ. It&#39;s a <br/>\nlot of fun to be together but there are times when I wish we would go out <br/>\ninstead of playing. We are both avid game players and play other MUD/ <br/>\nStrategy games as well as EQ.<br/>\nI have noticed that EQ becomes VERY involved. And at times we have both <br/>\nbecome obsessed with the game. That&#39;s just when the servers go down on the <br/>\nweekend for emergncy matience or my cable modem goes down. hehe it makes us <br/>\nrealize that the world is still out there and we go do something else. Just <br/>\nbe patient. He&#39;ll get bored of it soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nElahana<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
