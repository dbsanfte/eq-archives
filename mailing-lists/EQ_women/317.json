Well, all I can say is don&#39;t get too attached. I have a friend<br/>\nwho plays a female on Rodcet but in Rl he is a guy so we flirt a bit<br/>\n(very little) in tells and icq whenever we see each other on. I know a<br/>\nbit about his life and he knows a bit about mine. I finally got sick of<br/>\nplaying my cleric so I moved to the Brell server. I play a Bard named<br/>\nDusky there. He said he was going to start a new character there so we<br/>\ncould play together again but I didn&#39;t see him in the game nor recieved<br/>\nany other communication. So I missed him terribly for about a week on<br/>\nBrell as he was the only real friend I had in the game. I recently<br/>\nstarted a new job where I don&#39;t have hardly any time to play EQ anymore<br/>\nso I guess I&#39;m spared having to play with no friends. :P The whole week<br/>\non Brell anyone I met who called me Darlin caused an acute twist in my<br/>\nheart. :( And this pain is caused from only a friend without any real<br/>\nromantic involvement. I guess what I&#39;m saying is be careful. If I were<br/>\nyou I wouldn&#39;t exchange any rl info and I&#39;d keep it all contained to<br/>\nroleplay. If we were talking about me however, I would have had my real<br/>\nlife all over the tells as I no longer am as interested in rolplaying<br/>\nso go figure. Hmm, I guess what I&#39;m really saying is don&#39;t get in too<br/>\ndeep because I think you&#39;ll just get hurt. I&#39;m definitely not telling<br/>\nyou to ruin your fun though! *grin* I&#39;m sure I wouldn&#39;t mind<br/>\nroleplaying with some romantic minded fellow myself. (At least someone<br/>\nwho appeared so in game) I guess I&#39;m middling more on the powergamer<br/>\nside of the divide between that and rping. *sighs* I&#39;ve been thinking,<br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t sound like that&#39;s acceptable in the guild though....<br/>\n<br/>\n*For all on the list*---&gt;Feel free to give me a tell in game if you<br/>\nwant and you&#39;re not a strict rper.<br/>\n<br/>\n I think my bard is level...um.. (it&#39;s been days since I got a chance<br/>\nto play! *sadness* )around level 7. If she&#39;s not level 7 yet, I&#39;m sure<br/>\nshe&#39;s pretty darn close. :) Bloodless will be at the wedding, but<br/>\nshe&#39;ll have to turn in early since I have to get up early for work the<br/>\nnext day. I work in a sweatshop and I need all the rest I can get! haha<br/>\nIt&#39;s only till school starts thank goodness. Btw, I&#39;m 25 since you<br/>\nwanted to know from people who had a few seasons under their belts. :P<br/>\nGood luck all! *smiles*<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
