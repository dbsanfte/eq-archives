The first time I ever saw one I was like...oh my gosh! It walks around and swings its little tail and talks and everything! It&#39;s like the best pet!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Kunark is very pretty.  Lots of fun new zones, with cool looking critters.  It&#39;s pretty obvious to me you could hunt in Kunark and never leave, and get all the way to 50.  It seems a self sufficient continent.<br/>\n<br/>\nKunark is dangerous though, I have talked to a lot of people who brought their mains over and got stomped by something.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe solution to all this is...make an Iksar shaman! You get SOW at 9th level and you can explore like crazy.  Team up with a friend and make an Iksar monk, and you have a great 2-person leveling/exploring team especially for low levels.  FYI Iksar have regeneration, and the highest wis of the shaman races, making them the best shaman and monk races IMHO (though they aren&#39;t as cute as Duna).<br/>\n<br/>\n(Rumor: Iksar do not get the inherent haste that human monks get at level 20+)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
