I switched to Cazic-Thule because I felt it was good","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1055211712\">I was had been playing on Bristlebane when I found out some real life<br/>\nfriends were playing on Cazic-Thule. I switched to Cazic-Thule because I<br/>\nfelt it was good to be around some folks I knew.  These fellow are guys I<br/>\nknow from our paper and pencil role playing group.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway we made arrangements when I first made my character. My friend<br/>\nbrought me an entire set of cloth armour. He was a wizard so basically he<br/>\njust handed me his clothing. At level 1 I had a cracked staff, then later my<br/>\nfriends brought me a fine steel staff. I was about level 5 then.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis mini-twinking did make it easier for me to advance. I did not die half<br/>\nas many times as I had as my first bristlebane character. I was able to more<br/>\nquickly save up for patchwork. A &quot;female&quot; player gave me a good deal on a<br/>\nset of patchwork when I was level 4.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think this was serious twinking. And I don&#39;t think I got the stuff<br/>\nbecause I was &quot;female.&quot; I  think they would have given it to a friend<br/>\nregardless.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, no one has given me anything. Maybe these other &quot;females&quot;<br/>\nare asking for stuff?<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, one of my male friends plays a female high elf. He said he plays<br/>\nher because he likes to inviso people to killl their pets and likes the<br/>\nreaction he gets to his &quot;female&quot; self. Heh.
