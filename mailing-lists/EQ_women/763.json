We were married in game  at the little dock in nro at sunset that takes you to IC when we   <br/>\nmade lvl 20  and that was about a 1 1/2 ago. We spent almost every night eather grped or we would talk in game, after about a month we started talking over the phone, slowly our friendship grew in the real world. <br/>\nThe only problem was he was on the other side of the US from me so it was limited to just talking on the phone, the feelings for each other grew and we found we had we had fell in love for real. we wanted to meet  but at that time it wasnt a thing we could do. we continued to talk daily on eq and on the phone for about a year. We then started to talk using netmeeting and did that for a few months. We started both feeling<br/>\nof wanting to be togeather very strongly. we then started making plans for him to come down so we could meet for real. This last July he spent 3 weeks here wiht me. we had so much fun and both of us realized how much we  loved being with each other. We both realized how hard it was going to be for him to go back home. We talked about him moving here.<br/>\nAt the end of aug he moved him self down here to move in with me.<br/>\nWe are very happy togeather and cant imagine what it would be to be wiht one an other now. He is a very loving person and im very happy and feel very luck to have found him. The odds of us meeting in game are huge and the odds of us grping in the same grp that night are even bigger. So we  feel it was totally ment to be. <br/>\nSo see wonderful things can happen from playing a game and ingame marrage.<br/>\nso i guess that is my answer about getting married in the game.<br/>\nTyhana Storm<br/>\n55 cleric<br/>\nBertoxx <br/>\n<br/>\nPs my cleric as preformed a few marrages now also and those ppl are still very happy with there partner in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Brangvyne&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brangvyne7@...\">brangvyne7@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wed, 06 Nov 2002 22:24:26 -0000<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@yahoogroups.com\">EQ_women@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [EQ_women] Question Me This . . .<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;tt&gt;<br/>\n:o)&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nHi!&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nI sent a long post the other day and hoped on the list today only to &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nrealize that it had not made it to this list at all.
