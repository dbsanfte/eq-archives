My main character is Elahana (Eudrite cleric)on the Bertxo <br/>\nserver. I play with my boyfriend and my other roommate. We have a really <br/>\ngreat group. My boyfriend plays a human monk and my roommate plays a Edurite <br/>\nwizard. It seems like we&#39;ve been all over the world. Most recently we&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen to Unrest and to BlackBurrow. I really enjoy playing Everquest. It&#39;s <br/>\nnot at all like the other rpgs I have played. Most of the ones I played were <br/>\ntext based. (gemstone) Anyway, If anyone else is on the Bertox server I <br/>\nwould love to hear from you!<br/>\n<br/>\nElahana (Romney)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
