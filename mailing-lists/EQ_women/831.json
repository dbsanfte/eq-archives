Your personal<br/>\nfavorites. As a relative newcomer to the game I would<br/>\nbe especially interested in what some of you who have<br/>\nbeen playing the game for a while think on that topic<br/>\nas I&#39;m trying to decide on creating another character<br/>\nand cant make up my mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy principal 20th lvl character is Wood Elf Ranger<br/>\nI also have a lvl one Iksar Shadow Knight but I&#39;ve<br/>\ndone nothing with them and may drop them.<br/>\nFinally, I have a lvl 2 half elf bard. This toon was<br/>\nactually made a long time ago when I first bought EQ<br/>\nbut could not get it to run properly. Oddly when I<br/>\nfinally did get it to work I found her still there as<br/>\nfirst lvl. Anyway, any comments are appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nHugs<br/>\n:o)<br/>\nBran<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
