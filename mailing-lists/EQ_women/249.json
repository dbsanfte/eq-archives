The purpose of forming the<br/>\nguild would be to allow those of us who wish to to play with their EQ<br/>\nsisters.  The purpose in forming it on a new server would be so no one<br/>\nwould be directly advantaged by already having characters and contacts on<br/>\ntheir current server which they could carry over to this new server.  Here<br/>\nare some further ideas I have about how this guild might operate.  Please<br/>\ngive me feedback!<br/>\n<br/>\nParticipation<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, I&#39;d like to stress that I&#39;d see participation in this guild<br/>\nas voluntary.  I&#39;d also like to stress that I wouldn&#39;t be asking anyone to<br/>\ndrop their existing characters to play in this guild.  Many of us already<br/>\nhave really good characters in really good environments, and we don&#39;t want<br/>\nto give this up!<br/>\n<br/>\nTo facilitate participation in this guild, I&#39;d probably thus suggest two<br/>\nunofficial times each week which would be guild play times.  While you can<br/>\nplay any time, you&#39;d be encouraged to try and play during guild times.<br/>\nThis would ensure a reasonable number of us playing at those times, so we<br/>\ncan group.  Example guild times might be Wednesday evening, and Saturday<br/>\nmorning.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoleplaying Background:<br/>\n<br/>\nEver good guild should have a nice robust role playing background, that<br/>\nthose of us who wish to roleplay can work into our characters.  One such<br/>\nbackground might be as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\nErollisi Marr is the goddess of love.  Here is her description from the<br/>\nplayer manual: Followers of Erollisi Marr cling to the belief that love<br/>\nconquers all. It should be pointed out that while love is a generally<br/>\npeaceful concept, Erollisi worshippers are not pacifists. They would like<br/>\nto live in a world where everyone loves everyone else and violence does<br/>\nnot exist but they are not naive enough to think that Norrath is that<br/>\nworld. They have passionate loves of people, places and ideas and are more<br/>\nthan willing to fight and die to preserve those things. The dream of every<br/>\nfollower of Erollisi is to die in selfless defense of someone or something<br/>\nthey love. Many Paladins hear the true calling of their hearts and<br/>\nfollow Erollisi Marr. <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom my own playing I think Erollisi bears a great resemblence to Artemis<br/>\nthe greek goddess of the hunt.  Evidence to this includes the Sisters of<br/>\nErollisi, a warrior-cult of women who live in the Ocean of Tears.  These<br/>\nchaste (except when they stray) warrior women seem to me to be a great<br/>\nbasis for a guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to see us take &quot;Sisters of Erollisi&quot; as our guild name.  This<br/>\nwould afford us the great opportunity to use the island of Erollisi in the<br/>\nocean of tears as our guild home.  Few guilds can have a whole island<br/>\nto themselves.  It would also give our guild a strong tangible connection<br/>\nto the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to allow males to be in the guild (when sponsored by a female<br/>\nmember) and suggest incorporating them (from a roleplaying perspective) as<br/>\n&quot;Warders&quot; (I&#39;m stealing the concept from Robert Jordan&#39;s Wheel of Time<br/>\nseries).  A Warder would be a male who pledges his life to the protection<br/>\nof a Sister of Erollisi.  Each sister could have only one warder.  A<br/>\nWarder would most obviously be a Paladin, but could be of any class.  An<br/>\nobvious line of roleplaying courtship might involve a male courting a<br/>\nSister to first become her Warder, and perhaps even one day her husband.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of races/classes allowed, I would like to have no restrictions on<br/>\nthat.  We all have different playing interests.  Obviously a Shadow Knight<br/>\nor Necromancer doesn&#39;t fit in very well with the Sisters of Erollisi.<br/>\nWith proper thought, and a well crafted story, it could be done.<br/>\n<br/>\nRules:<br/>\n<br/>\nI like keeping rules to a minimum.  The main reason for this is so no one<br/>\nwill feel they don&#39;t want to be a part of the guild, because it has<br/>\nrestrictive rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only rule I can think of is that female players should play female<br/>\ncharacters, and male players should play male characters.  This will allow<br/>\nus to more easily recognize other women in the guild.  Even this rule I&#39;d<br/>\nbe willing to bend if someone had a good reason they couldn&#39;t abide by<br/>\nthis rule.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone think of any other obvious, required, rules?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMen in the guild:<br/>\n<br/>\nI think men should be allowed in the guild, but they should be sponsored<br/>\nby a female guild member.  While I think a truly women-only guild would be<br/>\ncool, it seems unnecessarily restrictive (there are nice guys out there<br/>\nafter all).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHierarchy:<br/>\n<br/>\nGuild hierarchy can be a fun thing, but it can also be annoying.  I&#39;d like<br/>\nto see hierarchy so those of us who enjoy it can take part.  I&#39;d also like<br/>\nthose of us who aren&#39;t interested in hierarchy to be able to play without<br/>\nit.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only actual benefits from being higher in the hierarchy, as I see it,<br/>\nshould be from a role playing perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is an example hierarchy we might use:<br/>\n<br/>\nSister<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the introductary level at which all Sisters of Erollisi would be.<br/>\nThis afford one the right to vote and participate in guild events.  All<br/>\nSisters have the responsility to aid other Sisters in need.<br/>\n<br/>\nAcolyte<br/>\n<br/>\nOne becomes an Acolyte of Erollisi by achieving at least level 15, and<br/>\nthen completing a quest as dictated by a Priestess.  An Acolyte has the<br/>\nresponsibility to aid, advise, and watch over all Sisters.  Early on the<br/>\nlevel requirements might be restricted.<br/>\n<br/>\nPriestess<br/>\n<br/>\nOne becomes a Priestess of Erollisi by achieving at least level 25, and<br/>\nthe completing a quest as dictated by the Hand of Erollisi.  Implicit in<br/>\nbeing offered the rank of Priestess is a history of good guild conduct.<br/>\nA Priestess has the responsibility to organize guild events and hunts.  A<br/>\nPriestess can be of any class.  Early on the level requirements might be<br/>\nrestricted.<br/>\n<br/>\nHand of Erollisi<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Hand of Erollisi is the leader of the Sisters of Erollisi.  It is her <br/>\nresponsibility to organize guild meetings, induct new members, and oversee<br/>\nany guild issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWarder<br/>\n<br/>\nMale members of the guild would all inducted warders.  They would be sworn<br/>\nto protect an indivual Sister of Erollisi.  They would not have any voting<br/>\npower.  Warders would gain title as the sisters they protect gain title.<br/>\nWarders could not vote, but his valued opinion would be rightly<br/>\nconsidered by the Sister he is sworn to protect.<br/>\n    Sister&#39;s Rank      Warder&#39;s Rank<br/>\n    Sister             Warder<br/>\n    Accolyte           Knight   <br/>\n    Priestess          Guardian<br/>\n    Hand of Erollisi   Sword of Erollisi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDues:<br/>\n<br/>\nMany guilds have dues.  I don&#39;t really see the need for them.  Anyone have<br/>\nany good reasons why Dues should be part of this guild?<br/>\n<br/>\nComments?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease let me know what you think about any or all of these ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
