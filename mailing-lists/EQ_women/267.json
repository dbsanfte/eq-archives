My best guess is that<br/>\nthe sisters strive to be chaste because they don&#39;t want their love to be<br/>\nbound and focussed on any one person.  I&#39;d like to see the whole chaste<br/>\nthing as a role playing element we can use if we want to, and not use if<br/>\nwe don&#39;t want to.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the men-protecting-the-women thing, it can be taken that way, but<br/>\nit doesn&#39;t have to.  I was basicly just trying to identify a nice way in<br/>\nwhich men could be incoroporated into the guild.  Your character could<br/>\nchoose to not have a warder, and that would be a valid choice.  If I were<br/>\nto have a warder, I would see him as a default following of Erollisi<br/>\nlooking to serve his god, and not as someone I needed for protection.<br/>\nOthers might choose to define their relationship with their Warder in a<br/>\ndifferent way (love, protection, siblings, or even the sister protecting<br/>\nthe Warder?)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the role playing background can and should be taken on an &quot;if you want<br/>\nto use it&quot; basis.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 21 Jul 1999, Melissa Wilson wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Melissa Wilson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:moontiger@...\">moontiger@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of comments on the guild ideas as given... first, why would sisters <br/>\ndedicated to the Goddess of Love be chaste?

Maybe the <br/>\nmen could belong to a brother order, The Brothers of Mithaniel, with a close <br/>\nassociation with the Sisters of Erollisi?<br/>\nOther than those two quibbles, I think the idea in general is sound and I would <br/>\nenjoy belonging to this guild on a new server.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nICQ#23767351<br/>\n&quot;If Moses had been Pagan, there would have been drummers and dancers around the burning bush.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow that you are &#39;For Women&#39; by using free email from 4wmn.com!  www.4wmn.com<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
