We have been<br/>\ninvited to another wedding that is going to take place<br/>\nthere so we are planning to come and see how<br/>\neverything works out.<br/>\nRight now I think everyone on my friend list is up to<br/>\nlvl 13 or higher so I think most of the guests should<br/>\nnot have a major problem getting there if they want to<br/>\ncome. We can offer transportation from the druids (I<br/>\nseem to have a fairly high number of druid friends for<br/>\nsome reason, well 3 or 4 anyway including my<br/>\nintended).<br/>\n<br/>\nI know what you mean about being the ranger that was<br/>\nlost, I generally have no idea where I am, but I guess<br/>\nI must be a bit more timid in my exploring then you<br/>\nwere. In fact, it&#39;s kind of a running joke with us<br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\nA tell between us might go something like this: Me,<br/>\n&quot;Dear heart, how do I get to &quot;place x&quot;?&quot;<br/>\nHim, &quot;Where are you now hun?&quot;<br/>\nMe &quot;I don&#39;t really know, but I think I&#39;m in the &quot;so<br/>\nand so&quot; zone.&quot;<br/>\nHim, &quot;Ok dear no problem, just go east.&quot;<br/>\nMe, &quot;Which way is east?&quot;<br/>\nHim, (after delivering some kind of arcane analysis of<br/>\nthe weather and cloud patterns or Norrath) &quot;and that<br/>\nshould take you right there.&quot;<br/>\nMe, &quot;???&quot;<br/>\nHim, &quot;Or, you could just try sense heading.&quot;<br/>\nMe, &quot;You know my sense heading is broken.&quot;<br/>\nHim, &quot;No, it&#39;s not broken dear, just keep trying it.&quot;<br/>\nMe, &quot;I&#39;m telling you this thing is broken, even when<br/>\nit gives me a direction I&#39;m not sure if I can trust<br/>\nit.&quot;<br/>\nHim, (seeming more frustrated now for some reason)<br/>\n&quot;Just keep trying, it&#39;s not broken.&quot;<br/>\nMe, (with an appropriate silance and a sigh) &quot;OK.&quot;<br/>\nHim, &quot;Do you want me to come help you?&quot;<br/>\nMe, &quot;No, I&#39;m fine, just lost that&#39;s all, you know I&#39;m<br/>\nalways lost, kind of funny really, I&#39;m the ranger who<br/>\nhas no sense of direction.&quot;<br/>\nHim, &quot;Yes, funny, ha ha, Now, just keep pushing sense<br/>\nheading.&quot;<br/>\nMe, &quot;OK, but I&#39;m telling you it&#39;s broken.&quot;<br/>\nHim, &quot;It&#39;s not broken!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so on it goes . . .<br/>\n<br/>\nI have now explored most of Feydwar, and I&#39;m working<br/>\non Antonica (sp) now, but it&#39;s a very slow process<br/>\nwith me. Got killed twice in North Karana last night<br/>\nby Griffons . . . ack, that was frustrating and not<br/>\ngood for the exp lvl but did manage to make lvl 21<br/>\nnever the less.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, it&#39;s fun and I&#39;m learning.<br/>\n:o)<br/>\n<br/>\nBest Regards till next time,<br/>\nHugs,<br/>\n:o)<br/>\nBrangvyne<br/>\nLvl 21.5 Wood Elf Ranger of Tunare<br/>\n:o)<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Suzanne J.

I&#39;m not sure how many people will even come<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt;   something like this. I expect it to be small. I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;   fairly new to the game and don&#39;t know lots of<br/>\n&gt; people<br/>\n&gt;   yet.

Funny I was right<br/>\n&gt; there<br/>\n&gt;   and didn&#39;t even think of it.

I&#39;ve made a <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   couple of good friends who are more<br/>\n&gt; experienced<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; then me and don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   seem to mind giving advice or helping out so<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; that&#39;s very nice.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   I&#39;ve also been trying to learn more about my<br/>\n&gt; role<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; as a Ranger in <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   Norrath. I just found out last week what a<br/>\n&gt; handy<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; thing taunt can be <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   when trying to keep a mob off your healer? OK,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; slow but I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   getting there I think. And I&#39;ve gotten duel<br/>\n&gt; wield<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; and double attack <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   now so that&#39;s interesting to play with.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   Last night a Druid friend and I went to Paudal<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Cavern for my first <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   trip there. I would have died twice during the<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; first fight we had I <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   think if they had not been there to keep me<br/>\n&gt; from<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; deaths door. That <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   was a tough mob and red all the way for me at<br/>\n&gt; lvl<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; 19 (20 now).<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   Anyway, enough ramblin, so it&#39;s question time:<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   1.) I have been asked to get married and have<br/>\n&gt; said<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; yes. :o) Any good <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   suggestions on locations that would be nice<br/>\n&gt; but<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; not to hard for <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   guests to get to? He has a place in mind, I<br/>\n&gt; forget<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; the name, but it <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   sounds like it might be hard for lower level<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; characters to even <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   reach. I have not traveled over much of<br/>\n&gt; Norrath<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; still so I&#39;m not <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   sure. Anyway, if anyone has ideas I&#39;d love to<br/>\n&gt; hear<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; them.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   Also, when things are set, which may be a<br/>\n&gt; while<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; I&#39;ll post a note here <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   letting everyone know. You are all invited, of<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; course, feel free to <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   come if you have a character on the Xegony<br/>\n&gt; server,<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; of if you want <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   just create a quick one at the proper time and<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; come anyway. I&#39;d love <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   to meet anyone who might do me the honor of<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; coming.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   2.) Can anyone give me advice on how to find a<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; guild that might be <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   interested in letting a Ranger in the low 20&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; join? Would it be ok <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   to just kind of start asking around? Is there<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; way to tell a better <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   guild from one not as good?<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   Anyway, I hope everyone had a nice<br/>\n&gt; Thanksgiving.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   Hugs<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   :o)<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   Bran<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   lvl 20 Wood Elf Ranger<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
