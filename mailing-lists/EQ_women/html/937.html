<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1305893881">Well then.  You should be proud of yourself for pulling your woman<br/>
out of that environment and making a difference in her life.  Have<br/>
you ever checked into the men&#39;s movement?  They support men who are<br/>
using their male energy to protect and serve the family.<br/>
<br/>
My EQ addict (18.5) yr old is finally off to college in less than 2<br/>
months.  If he flunks out, he is NOT going to be parking his butt<br/>
here in front of the computer!   Their parents are enablers.<br/>
