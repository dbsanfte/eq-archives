&lt;&lt; My wedding on Brell Serelis will be at 8:00pm PST on Friday the 12th <br/>
 of November (tomorrow).  The wedding will take place on the Sisters of<br/>
 Erollisi island.  It will be a fully catered event! All list members are<br/>
 welcome.<br/>
  The best way to get to the island is to take the boat from freeport.  You<br/>
 should allot 15 minutes for boat travel.  If you&#39;re coming from Faydwer, <br/>
 I recommend you just wait for the boat to start coming back, rather than <br/>
 jumping ship and trying to swim.<br/>
  If you are of an evil race, you can still attend, as festivities will be <br/>
held <br/>
 a safe distance from the good NPCs on the island.  Please don&#39;t kill the <br/>
 Erollisi sisters.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations!<br/>
:o)<br/>
Unfortunately I know I want be set up by tomorrow so I want be able to attend <br/>
but your post got me so curious. I can hardly wait to get started now.<br/>
