I love how your characters have such distinctive, fun and interesting <br/>
personalities. I&#39;m not exactly sure what my character (Guerrilla on <br/>
Tuneare) &#39;s personality is yet. I guess I&#39;m developing it, but you&#39;ve given <br/>
me some good food for thought.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve met mostly nice and only a few rude characters on line. More of the <br/>
rude ones tend to be male characters and I suspect that the rude ones, <br/>
whether their characters are male or female, in RL are probably those 13 <br/>
year old males you mentioned. Two of the nicest female characters are my <br/>
guild sisters and they are for sure female in RL. What I&#39;ve noticed about <br/>
EQ characters, both female and mostly male, is that some are very selfish <br/>
and obnoxious.  They are impatient and lead their comrades into dangerous <br/>
places too often. They take more than their share of the loot. And they <br/>
never say thank you. Somehow I think that most of these characters are <br/>
young males in RL, but they could be older (some people never grow up) or <br/>
female (good and bad are not limited by gender).<br/>
<br/>
I chose to play a female to begin with on EQ because I figured I would have <br/>
enough to learn about the game environment and my race/class without having <br/>
to worry about role playing a gender I&#39;m less familiar with than my own. <br/>
Perhaps later I&#39;ll try a male character and see how it works. Do any of you <br/>
real women every play male characters? Do you recommend it and if so why?<br/>

&gt; Hello Everyone,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It has been a long night of fighting orcs and watching the beautiful <br/>
unicorn<br/>
&gt; in Lesser so I will keep this short.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My girls all live on Bristlebane and they are:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bitty lvl 3 halfling Druid  -- However, Bitty has had a head injury and <br/>
does<br/>
&gt; not acknowledge she is a Druid, she believes she is a pirate and that<br/>
&gt; someone has stolen her ship, The Miss Lady Red Toes. Please be kind to <br/>
her,<br/>
&gt; she is quite insane.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Garnet lvl 7 human Ranger -- A bit tough but has a good heart but, shhhh,<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t tell that to anyone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Honi lvl 6 human Bard --  Honi was named for her sweet voice and<br/>
&gt; disposition.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ivory lvl 6 high elf Cleric -- Ivory is a tailor as well as a healer. <br/>
 Quiet<br/>
&gt; but good at her job.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kachine lvl 12 human Monk -- Very shy, Kachine is to be married to <br/>
Mondre, a<br/>
&gt; 15th level Cleric.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Zuzu lvl 9 troll Warrior -- Zuzu also has some mental problems but we <br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; mention them to her because we don&#39;t want to get &quot;barshed on de hed&quot;. <br/>
  She<br/>
&gt; is convinced she is beautiful and boasts about it on a regular basis. <br/>
 She<br/>
&gt; thinks she has won some sort of beauty contest to prove it but, when<br/>
&gt; questioned about it, she changes the subject with song or threats of<br/>
&gt; barshing.  She also thinks she is always right.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, there you have it, my girls.  If you are ever on Bristlebane, take a<br/>
&gt; moment and say hello.  Another female and I were discussing how difficult <br/>
it<br/>
&gt; is to make female friends on our server.  We have both encountered many <br/>
rude<br/>
&gt; female chars. and it was beyond role-play.   I told her I felt most were <br/>
13<br/>
&gt; year old males, lol.  Seriously though, she and I have talked about this <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; would like some input regarding the subject. Do you find this on the <br/>
other<br/>
&gt; servers?  I love my male friends dearly but, come on, we all need a <br/>
little<br/>
&gt; girl-talk now and then, don&#39;t we?  I am looking forward to some feedback <br/>
on<br/>
&gt; this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, so much for short.  Glad to be here on the list with all of you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Janice<br/>
