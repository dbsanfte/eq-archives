<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EQ_women] Lifespan of EQ <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819128203">I&#39;m a former guide and I think that EQ&#39;s model for CS is flawed, but<br/>
probably in pretty much the oposite of what most people think! <br/>
<br/>
I think in EQ too much is done in terms of item restoration due to bugs,<br/>
and resses in terms of death by bugs. The best way to stop that is to<br/>
ensure that people don&#39;t die or lose items because of bugs. The second is<br/>
to design the entire game model so dying or losing an item is not so big a<br/>
deal. Unfortunately EQ makes it so losing an item, or dying, is a huge<br/>
penalty so people demand customer service when this happens because of a<br/>
bug.<br/>
<br/>
People abuse guides and GMs all the time also it&#39;s really sad. I know my<br/>
own guild on Tholuxe does this. They trick guides/GMs into ressing them,<br/>
or porting them around, it&#39;s no good.<br/>
<br/>
MMRPGs are really young, hopefully we will see them evolve so guides are<br/>
only there to answer questions, and not to compensates for technical flaws<br/>
in the game.<br/>

&gt; Yeah it&#39;s going to be all about timing and improvement.<br/>

&gt; They need to get their CS dept in gear too. Customer service is NUMERO uno.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I think EQ will last until about a year after EQ2. EQ2 probably won&#39;t come<br/>
&gt; &gt; out for a couple more years. Verant has a dynasty in the works, if they<br/>
&gt; &gt; handle their sequel well.<br/>
