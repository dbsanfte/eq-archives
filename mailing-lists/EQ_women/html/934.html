<b>Subject:</b> Re: neglecting our families? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512554506">Well.  For the suggestions offered by you ladies, let me thank you, <br/>
although I doubt I&#39;ll be using them.  &quot;Life is good&quot; for me, too...as <br/>
my wife has gradually weaned herself out of EQ&#39;s grip.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, I agree:<br/>
1. EQ, as with any pasttime, is harmless - in moderation<br/>
2. The game itself is not &quot;evil&quot;; SOE is not Satan<br/>
3. What people do with their time is their own business<br/>
and...<br/>
4. The vast majority of EQ players play responsibly<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, my wife did not.<br/>
<br/>
She began playing playing in Sep 01, and by May 02 was up to about 18 <br/>
hours a day, 7 days a week (with some - few - exceptions).  Her life <br/>
consisted of rolling off of the couch at noon, slumping directly to <br/>
her PC, and battling mobs until dawn.  She would not leave the house <br/>
for 20-30 days at a stretch (seriously, not even step foot into the <br/>
yard, let alone get into her Lexus)<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I worked about 12 hours a day (active duty military), plus <br/>
a 1-hour commute to-and-from work.  When I got home, all the chores - <br/>
and I mean ALL - fell to me: cook, clean, laundry, home repair, <br/>
shopping, trash, entertainment of our daughter (5), bills, etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
On weekends she suggested I take our daughter &quot;out somewhere&quot;...so <br/>
she could play uninterrupted.  Later she would say that her playing <br/>
while I did chores all day made her feel guilty.<br/>
<br/>
For six months, I went to bed alone, listening to her typing away <br/>
amid all the EQ-sounds.  In the morning, as I got dressed for work, <br/>
she&#39;d be there slumped on the couch.  <br/>
<br/>
Occasionally, I&#39;d read her character logs while she slept, because <br/>
I&#39;d wonder what a 36-y.o. woman could possibly have to discuss with <br/>
teenage and 20-something males for endless hours...<br/>
<br/>
My friends suggested throwing her PC out with the trash.  My MOTHER <br/>
IN LAW (!) suggested I move out (she has 3 EQ-addicted daughters).<br/>
<br/>
Eventually...inevitably...we had a confrontation over EQ; I said <br/>
she&#39;d become a BUM, she admitted the game controlled her life.  I <br/>
made it clear that I&#39;d be there for her when she&#39;s ready to rejoin <br/>
RL; meanwhile, I&#39;m living my life too.  Now, at 39, I&#39;m in the best <br/>
shape of my life (run 30 miles a week), have finished my 2nd masters, <br/>
ready to retire from military next year comfortably.  Life IS good.<br/>
<br/>
She continues to play, but her playtime has greatly diminished (about <br/>
10 hours a week now, mostly due to our daughter beginning grade <br/>
school).<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the long post, but when I read the original message, it <br/>
struck a nerve.  To you ladies who play EQ responsibly, I&#39;m sorry if <br/>
you were offended.  But I hope you can appreciate my feelings, and <br/>
the reasons for them.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll keep my future rants in more appropriate forums (EQ Widows, <br/>
SpousesAgainstEQ, OLGAnon.org)<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
<br/>

&gt; playing EQ because it was my husband&#39;s game for 3<br/>
&gt; years before I started, and I wanted to share the time<br/>
&gt; with him not away from him! I was lonely for his<br/>
&gt; attention. He didn&#39;t have to raise the kids, cook the<br/>
&gt; meals, go to practice, clean the house, I DID. If<br/>
&gt; anyone was neglected from their family it was me. Get<br/>
&gt; a clue! If you have a regret of neglecting your family<br/>
&gt; look at yourself, but don&#39;t throw your dirty laundry<br/>
&gt; in my yard wash it! Judgemental people really irritate<br/>
&gt; me! You play what you want and I&#39;ll play what I want,<br/>
&gt; right along with my family and friends. Get a life!<br/>

&gt; &gt; dude, you sound like an <br/>
&gt; &gt; utter loser (not u dr. mom, dave...)  i am QUITE<br/>
&gt; &gt; happy spending time on EQ <br/>
&gt; &gt; rather than w/ my family...  i am 25 years old and<br/>
&gt; &gt; the only person my age <br/>
&gt; &gt; smart enough not to have children when i didnt want<br/>
&gt; &gt; them (or couldnt take <br/>
&gt; &gt; care of them because of my drug/booze/sex<br/>
&gt; &gt; problem)...  As far as MY mother <br/>
&gt; &gt; goes, she&#39;s recently divorced (and i had to go to<br/>
&gt; &gt; her 47th cake-and-icecream <br/>
&gt; &gt; birthday party w/ HER parents this weekend) and<br/>
&gt; &gt; quite insane.  Her <br/>
&gt; &gt; self-worth comes from &quot;knowin&#39; that when i walk into<br/>
&gt; &gt; a bar that i&#39;m the best <br/>
&gt; &gt; lookin&#39; woman there&quot; and sleeping with as many<br/>
&gt; &gt; drunken mechanics as she can <br/>
&gt; &gt; in one weekend...  My 21 year old brother who still<br/>
&gt; &gt; lives with her is on <br/>
&gt; &gt; some HEAVY ass drugs (they can make him walk home<br/>
&gt; &gt; from a 70mph collision and <br/>
&gt; &gt; go to sleep, but make him angry when the police wake<br/>
&gt; &gt; him up to come clean up <br/>
&gt; &gt; the dmg done..*amazingly no charges were pressed in<br/>
&gt; &gt; that matter*)...  My <br/>
&gt; &gt; dear sister...  well i promised never to talk about<br/>
&gt; &gt; her hehehehe....  really <br/>
&gt; &gt; i did...  Anything I write about her has to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; approved for public <br/>
&gt; &gt; release...  even a yahoogroup...  Now...  What I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; doing when I should be <br/>
&gt; &gt; tending to my family...  I am lvling a necro of<br/>
&gt; &gt; course, and also GOING TO <br/>
&gt; &gt; COLLEGE so that i wont make the thrilling 2.17 an<br/>
&gt; &gt; hour of a waitress for the <br/>
&gt; &gt; rest of my accursed days.  So shame on us!  Shame on<br/>
&gt; &gt; us women who have less <br/>
&gt; &gt; than perfect families where mothers are sluts and<br/>
&gt; &gt; brothers fight cops and <br/>
&gt; &gt; husbands whine like toddlers over the slightest<br/>
&gt; &gt; diversion of a wife&#39;s <br/>
&gt; &gt; attention.  Shame on us for needing an escape! <br/>
&gt; &gt; (btw, my bf has a 63 cleric <br/>
&gt; &gt; *yes RL bf we live together and life is good*).... <br/>
&gt; &gt; Doc, i wouldnt give this <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;dave&quot; fellow any more info...  he&#39;s obviously in<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Subject: [EQ_women] neglecting our families?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Date: Sun, 06 Jul 2003 15:51:34 -0400<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;There are several lists on Yahoo for family members<br/>
&gt; &gt; who feel that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;their loved one has an internet addiction. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Apparently, she felt<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;that she was needed more online than off.  You<br/>
&gt; &gt; probably made her<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;feel as if you didn&#39;t care about her anymore.  Her<br/>
&gt; &gt; guildies did.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Frankly, at 47 yrs old, I have seen enough<br/>
&gt; &gt; fireworks (twice a year<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;off my back deck.)  I have no other family alive<br/>
&gt; &gt; except the hubby<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;and the kids.  (And his family is in California.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t go along<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;because 5 hour plane rides are bad for my health.) <br/>
&gt; &gt; And parades are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;just flat-out boring.  I DO have hot, fresh food<br/>
&gt; &gt; every night for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;the boys.  I am a substitute teacher, part-time<br/>
&gt; &gt; grad. student,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;computer repair technician, run 17 yahoo groups and<br/>
&gt; &gt; do nutritional<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;consulting.  I got into EQ so I would have<br/>
&gt; &gt; something to talk about<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;with my boys who are also bored by parades.  Maybe<br/>
&gt; &gt; the real world<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;just isn&#39;t as challenging as learning to &quot;swim&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; underwater in a 3-D<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;castle.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Having them at their father&#39;s, on the weekends,<br/>
&gt; &gt; really helps my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;relationship with my husband and allows me to have<br/>
&gt; &gt; a really clean<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;house for two days a week.  He just lets them sit<br/>
&gt; &gt; around and watch<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;tv all the time.  At least when they are playing<br/>
&gt; &gt; EQ, they are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;thinking.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Your reminder is well-taken though as my hubby does<br/>
&gt; &gt; sometimes feel<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;neglected because I am not ready when he is.<br/>
