&gt; This list has grown pretty quiet, and that&#39;s ok.  I thought I&#39;d send an<br/>
&gt; innocent &#39;hi&#39; to the list though and see what everyone has been up to in<br/>
&gt; EQ lately?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I finally got married. =)  Aelwesara married Celedhros Cuthalion on<br/>
February 5th, but I had to reformat my hard drive twice before it happened so<br/>
I lost my friends&#39; list AND my URLs AND... well, you name it.  Anyway, that&#39;s<br/>
why the invite didn&#39;t get out.  My guild and alot of people who hunt with us<br/>
regularly turned out in force, and it was really lovely.  I recommend Surefall<br/>
Glade, the Druid Tree with Te&#39;Anara in it, to any new bride.  My betrothed had<br/>
asked each of the wedding party members to carry a lightstone, and we carried<br/>
a greater lightstone each, so it was nicely lit and really quite lovely.  The<br/>
site is ideal, since it has an &#39;altar&#39; and a red carpet already, hehe.</div>
