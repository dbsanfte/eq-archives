<div id="ygrps-yiv-334754417"><p>hey there, Ha, yes that happens to me quite often, i am a wood elf ranger so feel for you hon about the whole thing, it happened to me again yesterday to be exact. What i do when that happens is just usually duel them and win. LOL 
<p>It tends to knock them down a notch or two, or three....hahahhahah&nbsp; But if it really bothers you tell them that and then promptly leave, orrrr you can do what i did once and it kinda freaked them out, tell them that you are actaully a guy playing a girl, freaks them out really good. LOL&nbsp; Be creative!!!!!!!!!!!!!
