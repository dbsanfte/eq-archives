<div id="ygrps-yiv-195512342">Actually, this is kind of funny.  Since we started the<br/>
cleric/healer/nurturer thread, I started thinking.  I know five male<br/>
clerics well enough to hunt regularly with them, and one female cleric.<br/>
Two male druids (one of whom is a gazillionth level by now and comes to<br/>
rescue us teens whenever we need him)(it&#39;s great having guildbrothers,<br/>
hehe), and three male shaman.  On the other hand, I know lotsa female<br/>
rangers and finger-wigglers and Paladins.  Is that a reflection on me or<br/>
women gamers in general?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; My partner in crime is a cleric level 10 and i am a wizard level 7, i<br/>
&gt; must say he does all the tanking for us.  We tend to group together<br/>
&gt; when ever on because we tend to fight well together.  He has more time<br/>
&gt; on than i do and gets to group with others more often so i do know His<br/>
&gt; take on the cleric.  He is a manly man as well but so far it seems he<br/>
&gt; enjoys His character but then again he plays the tank in our group,<br/>
&gt; and we very much enjoy our rp.  Its all about How much you enjoy your<br/>
&gt; character if you are in it to do nothing than power game a cleric or a<br/>
&gt; mage for that matter prolly isnt gonna be a good one to use.... as for<br/>
&gt; us we are both very happy with what we are currently playing and i<br/>
&gt; expect will both be playing them for a while.<br/>

&gt;&gt; My game mate was playing a cleric when we met.  As he progressed in<br/>
&gt;&gt; levels<br/>
&gt;&gt; he started to experience exactly what you described.   By level 16<br/>
&gt;&gt; he was<br/>
&gt;&gt; burnt out.  Now we are on the Test Server and he plays a monk, I am<br/>
&gt;&gt; a druid.<br/>
&gt;&gt; We love this combination.  I discussed your letter with him and he<br/>
&gt;&gt; wants me<br/>
&gt;&gt; to tell you it is not a female thing, he is very, very male ( jock<br/>
&gt;&gt; even) and<br/>
&gt;&gt; he experienced the same thing.  Personally, I think the<br/>
&gt;&gt; partner/group makes<br/>
&gt;&gt; all the difference in the world.  I also believe that if you cease<br/>
&gt;&gt; to have<br/>
&gt;&gt; fun then change what you are doing or with whom you are doing it.  I<br/>
&gt;&gt; cannot<br/>
&gt;&gt; stress enough how much difference the right partner/group can make<br/>
&gt;&gt; for ANY<br/>
&gt;&gt; class.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; I would just like to tell everyone out there who is a Cleric that<br/>
&gt;&gt; they<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; just might like to try out a shaman. I spent 18 levels being a<br/>
&gt;&gt; Cleric<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; and 5 being a Shaman so far. I was always frustrated with my<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; limitations as a Cleric and took on way too much responsibility<br/>
&gt;&gt; for<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; other people&#39;s lives, which made grouping a very un-fun<br/>
&gt;&gt; experience. I<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; love being a Shaman so far. ( I&#39;ve made 2 new characters in<br/>
&gt;&gt; Quellios.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Bloodless and Blacksatin) Go ahead and laugh at the names, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt; the<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; best I can do on such short notice! I agonized believe me. Someone<br/>
&gt;&gt; even<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; called me &quot;campy&quot;!- whatever that means. I&#39;m only 25, that term&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; before my time.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Anyway, I&#39;ve played on that server for a total of 3 days and have<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; noticed, not just me - also complete strangers, that most people<br/>
&gt;&gt; on<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; that server are really helpfull and nice. Or maybe just the people<br/>
&gt;&gt; in<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Halas as that&#39;s the only town I&#39;ve been in. I encourage you guys<br/>
&gt;&gt; to try<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; it out as I have been so happy. I don&#39;t die constantly and I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt; have<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; to sit out the action all the time. I get to actually participate<br/>
&gt;&gt; as a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; part of the group instead of staring at my spellbook all the time<br/>
&gt;&gt; with<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; nothing to do but chat. Not that chatting is at all bad, but I<br/>
&gt;&gt; want to<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; have some fun too!<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I have noticed that a lot of us have said that we play clerics, it<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; seems more than any other class. (Or maybe I only notice the<br/>
&gt;&gt; clerics<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; because I play one.)I hope this doesn&#39;t offend you all, but I<br/>
&gt;&gt; wonder if<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; we have chosen to play one because we are by nature nurturing and<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; helpfull, or because we have been raised in our society to act<br/>
&gt;&gt; servile<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; to men. (I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve raised a few hackles-sorry!) It bothered me<br/>
&gt;&gt; that<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I would be one of the only women in rl playing a female character<br/>
&gt;&gt; in<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; any given group and I would be forced to sit and heal all the male<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; warriors. I grew resentfull. I&#39;m wondering if many of you have<br/>
&gt;&gt; done the<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; same thing, or if this just says a lot about me.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks! :)<br/>
