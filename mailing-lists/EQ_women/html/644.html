<div id="ygrps-yiv-1762664738">Hi Again, <br/>
<br/>
I am also a player from the start of the game.....I still remain<br/>
enthused by EQ. <br/>
Perhaps because I have not power-leveled my characters. I have several<br/>
with which I rotate playing, my highest is Deneyu Firnloch, a Barbarian<br/>
Shaman on Lans T&#39;yvel at level 20. I solo most of the time, partly<br/>
because I can play in only short periods of time and partly because of<br/>
hating to end up in a group with a bunch of pre-adolesent slash and<br/>
dash. I buff those I meet along the way, assist when I see a person in<br/>
difficulty, but I do not worry about making levels....just in having<br/>
fun. I explore<br/>
EQ mostly with my level 16 Enchanter on E&#39;ci, Yadienu... I even visited<br/>
a bit of Velious with her. How long will I remain a player, probably<br/>
quite a while longer....It continues to surprise and enchant me. I am a<br/>
40-something single mom of two, I am a member of SCA,  I am a teacher a<br/>
supporter of youth organizations. I think that the secret in EQ, is to<br/>
take your time at the game, not rush up a ladder to the top, only to<br/>
find you want to jump off :) Patience is a virtue in EQ too. Good<br/>
Hunting to all and may your hearths be warm with the joy of well lived<br/>
lives.<br/>
