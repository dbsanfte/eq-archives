<div id="ygrps-yiv-710928276">Hi Genneth,<br/>
<br/>
Yes I do get flirted with quite often. I don&#39;t really flirt back because it<br/>
is not in character with my human Paladin. I really think it&#39;s the armor I<br/>
wear. I guess its OK as long as it does not get in the way of my killing.<br/>

I&#39;m throwing out a topic ladies, just want to see what experiences you<br/>
have had.....<br/>
<br/>
Flirting<br/>
<br/>
My character is the biggest flirt!  I discovered early in the game that<br/>
most males (no matter what race) liked the look of my character, a<br/>
half-elf.  Many flirted with her before she even knew she was cute.  It<br/>
was in-character for Genneth (a bard) to flirt, so she is constantly<br/>
engaging in flirting.  <br/>
<br/>
And to add to it, Genn has herself somewhat of a boyfriend in the game,<br/>
another member of her guild, Teban. (&#39;Course she still flirts with<br/>
others, but he understands that she is mostly committed to him ;) So,<br/>
has this phenomenon hit anyone else?  Do you get flirted with?  Have<br/>
you found yourself a steady??<br/>
<br/>
Just curious<br/>
<br/>
