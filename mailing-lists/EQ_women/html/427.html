&lt;&lt; Welcome to the addiction... &gt;&gt;<br/>

Salutations Dnaisha!<br/>
Wow! and thank you for all the great advice! You really sound like you have a <br/>
handle on it.<br/>
Well, as you may have read I decided on Bard but am so far having serious <br/>
problems playing. Everytime I try my computer locks up and I have to actually <br/>
pull the soundcard to get it to reboot. Not fun :o(<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m hoping I&#39;ll get something figured out. My little taste of the <br/>
game was enough to wet my appitate.<br/>
