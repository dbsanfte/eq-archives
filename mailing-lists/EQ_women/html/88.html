<div id="ygrps-yiv-977440681">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
To introduce myself let me say I, too and one of the over 40 women who<br/>
play EQ.  My husband and son  were beta testers and I gave them a hard<br/>
time about how much they liked to play the game until I tried it<br/>
myself.  I now have three main characters I play on the Rathe server, a<br/>
druid (my favorite), a ranger, and a paladin.  I also have a couple of<br/>
minor ones the I am trying out.  My husband and son play also and we are<br/>
very lucky to have a couple of good computers so we can play together.<br/>
People get a kick out of finding that our characters are really mother<br/>
and son though its not as unusual when my husband and I play together.<br/>
<br/>
We are trying to get together enough folks to start our own guild and<br/>
are just about there.  I think that will make it even more fun.<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting,<br/>
Jackie<br/>
