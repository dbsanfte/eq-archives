<br/>
I don&#39;t know what&#39;s usual for an introduction, but here goes:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m an (alost) middle-aged computer person/working mom.  I&#39;ve been RPGing<br/>
since I was 11 years old (started in pre D&D era), and since D&D, AD&D,<br/>
Traveller, ICE, GURPS etc ... all came out when I was in high school to<br/>
college I pen & paper RPed/GMed/DMed a lot back then.  I ran an all-female<br/>
group around 20 years ago in my college hometown which at one time included<br/>
my then 80-90-year-old (passed away now) conservative German immigrant<br/>
grandmother.  She would visit and I really got to ask &quot;Canasta or D&D?&quot;. :)<br/>
 I also ran mixed and male-only (except for me) groups. <br/>
<br/>
Due to time contraints of job and children I haven&#39;t done pencil & paper<br/>
games for at well over a decade, but do play on-line!  I&#39;ve played other<br/>
on-line RPGs (but not UO for more than 1 week) for years, and am now<br/>
playing in EQ.  Since I never have enough time ... my characters &quot;never<br/>
amount to much&quot;.  But I have fun!  My almost teen daughter has played<br/>
on-line with me in two other RPGs (supervised), and helps with the EQ<br/>
character creation.  If I can ever get ADSL here, we&#39;ll be a mother &<br/>
daughter team on-line. :) Sometimes I think we have as much fun coming up<br/>
with the ideas for a character as actually playing them. <br/>
<br/>
I like to experiment with character ideas and right now have no &quot;main&quot;<br/>
character.  So far I like Enchanter & Bard.  Though my Necromancer is<br/>
surprisingly fun to play.  I sort of enjoy the amazement (do they even<br/>
belive me?) when I claim that it REALLY is a female player behind this<br/>
female character.  I know thay don&#39;t belive me when I tell many of the<br/>
college age males that I&#39;ve been playing/running RPGs longer than they&#39;ve<br/>
been alive (and I&#39;m female). ;)  I mainly play on Erollisi Marr, but<br/>
occasionally play on the Test Server.<br/>

P.S.<br/>
My husband tolerates us well (he&#39;s not an RPGer), and I&#39;m waiting to see if<br/>
my son got &quot;the gene&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment:<br/>
Starling, Lisonja, Ainsley, Meute, Mitte, Shaelie & Leontine<br/>
on Erollisi Marr</div>
