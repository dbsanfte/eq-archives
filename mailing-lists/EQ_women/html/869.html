<div id="ygrps-yiv-86059727">Thank you for the offer but i am a techie who does tech support for a <br/>
major PC company. I am building my own and have a discount through a <br/>
friend, so get wholesale prices :)<br/>
<br/>
For me I have liked being in a fantasy and a sci-fi story. I know I <br/>
will be playing Galaxies as soon as it comes out. Mmmmmm hopefully I <br/>
can meet up with Han Solo and give Leia a run for her money :)</div>
