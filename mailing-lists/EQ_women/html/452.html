 </span></blockquote>I have to be really strict with myself because I know<br/>
that EQ takes up so much time. So, I only let myself<br/>
play maybe 5 hours a week during the semester and just<br/>
let myself play the 12 hours a day if I want to during<br/>
the summer and winter break. <br/>
I guess it&#39;s really a one or the other situation. I<br/>
know if I&#39;m gonna play EQ I&#39;m not gonna want to get<br/>
off when I&#39;m supposed to so most of the time I just<br/>
don&#39;t let myself play. I guess I&#39;m a little obsessive<br/>
when it comes to role playing games. <br/>
The whole time thing about EQ: Yeah, I&#39;ve noticed it<br/>
takes way longer to get anything done in this game. In<br/>
UO I could get wherever I wanted to go lickety split<br/>
just by gating, but EQ, sheesh, it&#39;s a half hour<br/>
commitment just to run through 5 zones. Ridiculous. :/<br/>
I think that it&#39;s just the downside of makeing play<br/>
dependant upon other players, you spend more time<br/>
trying to coordinate times to be on together and just<br/>
getting a darn group together. <br/>
