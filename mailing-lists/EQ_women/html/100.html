<div id="ygrps-yiv-1972741051">I&#39;ve pretty much decided to do it exactly as you said (give her the armor at<br/>
level 5-6, when you lose your newbie gear), but hadn&#39;t thought of the<br/>
roleplaying tie-in!  Thanks!<br/>
I have to tell you, I&#39;m really not looking forward to doing levels 9-13<br/>
again, though....*shudders*<br/>

&gt; &gt;     I recently tossed around the idea of making a<br/>
&gt; &gt; new character, exactly like my<br/>
&gt; &gt; primary but with my &quot;true&quot; elven name (Sara just<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t sound very wood<br/>
&gt; &gt; elvish).  A friend offered to hold my stuff and give<br/>
&gt; &gt; it to my new character.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now, I have full banded, a combine, an ash bow, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; works.  My dilemma is<br/>
&gt; &gt; this--I don&#39;t believe in power gaming or twinking.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Granted, it&#39;s the same exact<br/>
&gt; &gt; character, stats and all, just a different<br/>
&gt; &gt; name......the stuff I have would just<br/>
&gt; &gt; help me get to my current experience level quicker;<br/>
&gt; &gt; at which point I would<br/>
&gt; &gt; delete my current primary.  So, to twink, or not to<br/>
&gt; &gt; twink?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; I say Twink....make up a story to go with it...my twin sister died to<br/>
&gt; give these to me....I was given these by my mother who was<br/>
&gt; dying....Whatever you think would justify a level 1 to have banded...<br/>
&gt; Another thought is to work the new chacter up to 3-4 and then twink...<br/>
