<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655805981">Hi everyone, I play a Paladin as my main character on E&#39;ci and just achieved<br/>
level 50 yesterday.. yay me.. :)<br/>
<br/>
But for weapons, I started with 1hs and a shield till around the early teens<br/>
when 2hs seemed to deal out more damage.  Fine steel is okay, but as soon as<br/>
u get some pp, a combine weapon is good for magical creatures.<br/>
<br/>
At higher levels I seem to use my 2hs more than anything else, I have been<br/>
frequenting the Plane of  Hate to try to get my Dark Metal Holy Water<br/>
Sprinkler which happens to be 1hb, and I hadnt used that skill.. So for the<br/>
last 10 levels or so I have been summoning my 1hb weapon to try to raise<br/>
skill.  Its seems odd that one of the best weapons at higher levels is a<br/>
blunt, but go figure.<br/>
<br/>
Right now and for the last 5-15 levels I use my ghoulbane and mm shield<br/>
(magic resist ) / cracked darkwoodshield (str)  in Lower Guk with a FBSS<br/>
(haste belt), and Mithral 2h with a +ac belt everywhere else unless fighting<br/>
undead.  You just cant beat the proc that the ghoulbane dishes out.  As soon<br/>
as u can get together friends, guildmates, get  a ghoulbane, its not too<br/>
hard for a level 30ish group.<br/>
<br/>
But as was posted here, we Paladins are very versatile in our weaponry, so<br/>
try to keep all 1hs, 1hs and 1hb maxed, I havent seen any 2hb yet, but Im<br/>
sure they are out there. grin<br/>
<br/>
So fellow Paladin, Well met and hunt safely<br/>

&gt; Thanks for your help, Tina.  I have been keeping all my skills maxed<br/>
except 2h<br/>
&gt; blunt... but I&#39;ll get that going soon as I find a weapon to use.  :)  I&#39;ve<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; watching how the 2h slash and the 1h slash compare, and it seems the 2h<br/>
slash is<br/>
&gt; slower, but deals more damage, while the 1h slash is faster, deals less<br/>
damage,<br/>
&gt; but has the added benefit of the shield to bash.  So it&#39;s rather a toss up<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; seems. I&#39;ve heard that the 2h slash is the paladin&#39;s best weapon, so I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; probably stick with that and see how it goes. AFter all others are maxed,<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; course. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think they do still have the weekly market on Mith Marr, but I&#39;ve never<br/>
been.<br/>
&gt; Went to N freeport yesterday and wow it was busy.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Paladins actually have exciting weapons of almost every type.  Off hand<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt; can think of excellent 1h blunt, 2h blunt, 1h slashing, and 2h slashing<br/>
&gt; &gt; weapons.  Accordingly, I&#39;d suggest trying to train them all to some<br/>
&gt; &gt; extent.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If you don&#39;t want to train them all, I think one handed slashing is<br/>
&gt; &gt; probably your most defining weapon type.  Paladins are skilled shield<br/>
&gt; &gt; bashers.  Ghoulbane, a relatively easy to obtain Paladin weapon is one<br/>
&gt; &gt; handed slashing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; However without an exceptional one handed slashing weapon like<br/>
Ghoulbane,<br/>
&gt; &gt; most of the time you will benefit from using a two handed slashing<br/>
&gt; &gt; weapons.  They are more commonly available, and generally do far more<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage, then normal one handed slashing weapons.  Exceptional one handed<br/>
&gt; &gt; slashing weapons are usually paladin only.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A good lower-priced two handed slashing weapon is an axe of the iron<br/>
&gt; &gt; black.  They are easily found Kunark weapons.  BBCs are common Antonica<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2-handed slashing weapons as are shiny brass halberds, and should be<br/>
&gt; &gt; cheaper than an axe.  GZs are also good.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; For one handed slashing, until you obtain ghoulbane, there really aren&#39;t<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt; lot of great one handed slashers.  I&#39;d suggest keep your bash and slash<br/>
&gt; &gt; maxed with a fine steel longsword and a shield, then switch back to your<br/>
&gt; &gt; two-hander once both skills are maxed.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hope this helps =)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One simple way to measure the effectiveness of a weapon is by its<br/>
&gt; damage/delay ratio.  For example, a fine steel two handed sword is 12 dmg<br/>
&gt; 43 delay for a ratio of 0.28.  A fine steel longsword is 6 damage 28 delay<br/>
&gt; for a ratio of 0.21.  This means you&#39;ll do about 30% more damage on<br/>
&gt; average with the two handed weapon.  Bashing does help to close that<br/>
&gt; difference, but my experience has been that it&#39;s a small amount of your<br/>
&gt; total damage output.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At high levels (50+) it gets much more complicated because the minimum<br/>
&gt; damage a weapon can do is based primarily on your level, and not on the<br/>
&gt; weapon, which gives an advantage to small fast weapons.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; This thread is kinda old, but...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Judy,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Have you played Asheron&#39;s Call.  I played it for a little while but<br/>
&gt; really hated some of the major gameplay (fighting) interface issues.<br/>
&gt; Namely, when you go to loot you have to pick up each item<br/>
&gt; individually.  As well, there isn&#39;t an easy way to target or auto-<br/>
&gt; attack.  As well, corpse deterioration was VERY (far too) quick and<br/>
&gt; people would take your items (limited left on corpse).  It is just<br/>
&gt; frustrating dealing with scavengers.  Finally, their skills system is<br/>
&gt; very complex, it offers some nice options, but it is mostly just<br/>
&gt; confusing.  I have since deleted my account.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However, they had some really nice things that play balance well.  In<br/>
&gt; particular, the economy seems stable and self-sustaining.  Each<br/>
&gt; vendor has a base of items and the only &quot;enhanced&quot; items they sell<br/>
&gt; have been sold to them by players.  I really like the &quot;note&quot; system<br/>
&gt; where you pay a little extra money and get a note instead of carrying<br/>
&gt; around tons of money.  Their trade skills offer experience!!! And<br/>
&gt; trades like cooking actually have rewards such as mana or hp gain.<br/>
&gt; This unto itself was fantastic for RP value!  I believe it is open<br/>
&gt; ended leveling.  You continue to get experience even off the level 1<br/>
&gt; creatures, although it would take you a RL year to level on them<br/>
&gt; *grin* but this means there are always things to kill, however<br/>
&gt; small.  As well, exp is granted based on damage done.  Loot rights<br/>
&gt; are given to the individual who did the most overall damage.  Because<br/>
&gt; each person who does damage gets exp, this alleviates KS and<br/>
&gt; contention between spawn camping, but sometimes leaves healers at a<br/>
&gt; disadvantage.  As I mentioned, they have a complex skill system where<br/>
&gt; even a warrior can learn to use magic over time.  This is nice for<br/>
&gt; the really high level folks I imagine.  I also like the way equipment<br/>
&gt; is handled, but it could be simplified.  If you don&#39;t have the game,<br/>
&gt; check out the ebay auctions because many have pictures of the details<br/>
&gt; on the equipment they offer.  The rest I have explained, but you may<br/>
&gt; wish to check it out yourself for the purposes of market study.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I, too, have noticed so many folks THING oriented.  It really got<br/>
&gt; nasty for a while on Veeshan with KS and people being generally<br/>
&gt; nasty.  The server split not long after Kunark came out and things<br/>
&gt; have been FAR better there.  We used to have an average of 2600<br/>
&gt; people online during prime time and now it is down to 1800 or so with<br/>
&gt; many more zones to explore.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One thing I have done to keep my interest high is play multiple<br/>
&gt; characters.  I have several characters in their 20s and none that are<br/>
&gt; any higher because I spend time exploring, mastering trade skills or<br/>
&gt; generally hanging out with my fantastic guild.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Speaking of... for anyone interested, I am the Guild Elder and<br/>
&gt; Assistant Guildmaster of the Storm of Blades Guild on Veeshan.  We<br/>
&gt; are a small, close-knit guild that values friendship above all else.<br/>
&gt; we welcome new members who seek the same values as we do.  Please let<br/>
&gt; me know if you have interest in joining.  I realize that for most it<br/>
&gt; would mean starting over, but we will be happy to help out with gear<br/>
&gt; and leveling (not necessarily power leveling) if anyone transitioned.<br/>
