<div><font face="Arial" size="2">WOW!&nbsp; Great advice and THANK YOU!&nbsp; 
</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I am a WHOLE lot more trusting than you are, 
however.&nbsp; And gullible, very gullible.&nbsp; </font>I don&#39;t doubt any of 
what I have been told about this situation.&nbsp; And I don&#39;t entirely blame the 
girlfriend, though I think trust is an essential ingredient in a relationship 
and it&#39;s not like they even live in the same city - his time in Norrath probably 
keeps him out of the bars where he could pick up RL women ;-)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But yes, Norrath, and any other on-line community is going to have a wide 
variety of people in it.&nbsp; There will be scum and there will be the greatest 
people int he world.&nbsp;&nbsp; And we&#39;ll develop relationships and they&#39;ll 
work or they won&#39;t.&nbsp; Friends will fight and make-up.&nbsp; And yeah, some 
of the people are WAY WAY out there (one woman apparently lives off of men she 
meets in Norrath staying with one and then the next until they throw her out 
often thousands of dollars short of when they first met her).&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So the advice to be careful is well taken.&nbsp; I have examined what I am 
so sad about losing and think we can rewrite the story so that there is a purely 
platonic affection which still meets what I get out of the relationship without 
violating what she wants and he has promised (she doesn&#39;t mind us being friends, 
she just doesn&#39;t want him pretending to be in love with anyone but 
her).&nbsp;&nbsp; And if I need more than a platonic affection, heck - now I&#39;m 
free to date &lt;giggles&gt;</div>

  <div><br></div>I can understand you being irate at Verant, IF what the 
  girlfriend says is true (and I have known people to create fantastic lies in 
  order to trap their significant others into relating purely innocent 
  information that comes out sounding sordid; my ex is one of them) OR if your 
  in-game friend is telling the truth and not trying to whitewash something that 
  may leave him sounding less desireable in your eyes (like a fight he and his 
  GF might have had where he flung you up in her face)(not a very trusting soul, 
  am I...), although it seems unlikely that someone at Verant would jeopardize 
  his career on the basis of helping someone else &#39;catch&#39; her boyfriend in 
  something possibly (but not definitely) shady.&nbsp; However, keeping text 
  logs is the only way they can verify certain petitions, when people file 
  claims of harrassment from other players, etc., and according to their EULA, 
  it&#39;s perfectly legal, because you&#39;re aware they&#39;re doing it.&nbsp; As that 
  stands, I am more in favor of them keeping these text logs than not, since 
  it&#39;s just like going to the doctor... you know what he&#39;s looking at but you 
  have to understand that for him, it&#39;s just a job and your whatever isn&#39;t 
  anything different from all the others he&#39;s seen (I&#39;m trying to be subtle, 
  here! &lt;g&gt;).&nbsp; I&#39;m sure that there&#39;s nothing that you&#39;ve done or said 
  that could measure up to HALF of what really goes on in a lot of online 
  relationships. Yes, there are voyeurs in the business, as there are 
  everywhere, but for the most part, 90% of software companies are replaceable, 
  and they all know it and tread lightly.&nbsp; Verant is hot right now, and the 
  people who are there, want to stay there. 
  <p>All that said, what you, he, or she did or didn&#39;t do isn&#39;t as important as 
  the fact that you feel your privacy has been violated.&nbsp; You could draft a 
  letter to Verant customer service, and it might warn them to take a closer 
  look at their employees who have access to those text files.&nbsp; You know 
  how I feel about Verant customer service, so don&#39;t ask me if I think that will 
  get anything done. &lt;grin again&gt;&nbsp; However, I have to be fair and 
  tell you that in the industry, that kind of breach of customer confidence is 
  strictly bad business, and I HIGHLY doubt Verant as an entity approves... no 
  matter how much I dislike admitting that.&nbsp; Ask yourself if you trust your 
  sources, and if you do, fire off a letter.&nbsp; At the worst, it&#39;ll go 
  ignored, but who knows? It might get noticed by someone who&#39;ll keep a closer 
  eye out. 
  <p>As for your need to have a fantasy life, I admit that I&#39;m a bit queasy with 
  the idea that my other half needs something that I can&#39;t fill.&nbsp; That&#39;s 
  me, though, and when I had your need, it was because I was unfulfilled in my 
  relationship (which is clearly not your case), so I might be biased. 
  &lt;g&gt;&nbsp; And I certainly do understand the GF&#39;s reaction, because as 
  much as I trust my partner, I really don&#39;t want him having a romantic 
  relationship that&#39;s based on pure fantasy, with someone other than... well, 
  me.&nbsp; Not very enlightened of me, but there it is.&nbsp; Things look like 
  they work differently for you, and since you&#39;re happily married (15 
  years!&nbsp; That&#39;s terrific!) and I&#39;m not, maybe I would do well to take a 
  page from your book. &lt;grin&gt; So!&nbsp; You know what you need, and you&#39;ve 
  been responsible in your choice of partners; what now? 
  <p>Well... I, too, am disheartened by the lack of RPG&#39;s right now.&nbsp; 
  Asheron&#39;s Call is the next best thing and some people prefer it to 
  Everquest.&nbsp; There is even a book that you can buy IN game that tells you 
  how to have a successful wedding, and apparently there are no lack of 
  roleplayers in that world.&nbsp; SO, you might find what you&#39;re looking for 
  there.&nbsp; Other places to try include chat rooms for writers of fantasy, 
  mailing lists for writers of fantasy, mailing lists for writers of romance, 
  yada yada.&nbsp; Hey!&nbsp; I forgot!&nbsp; If you&#39;re willing to do without 
  the lush graphics of a commercial RPG, you might do well to go back to the 
  MUDs and MUCs.&nbsp; I had a blast with those!&nbsp; In fact, they can be even 
  more fun than RPGs because you need a better imagination to supply your own 
  visuals.&nbsp; I&#39;m trying to remember a couple; Astaria comes to mind... if 
  you do a search, though, on Multi-User Dungeons, you&#39;ll come up with a few of 
  your own.&nbsp; Here are some links to pages that I have pre-scanned for your 
  viewing enjoyment *giggle*: 
  <p><a rel="nofollow"
 target="_blank" href="http://users.erols.com/stuartm/Mudspage.html--this">http://users.erols.com/stuartm/Mudspage.html--this</a> 
  one has MUD clients on it; ZMUD is the most popular and arguably one of the 
  better ones, depending on who you ask <br><a rel="nofollow"
 target="_blank" href="http://www.mudconnector.com/--this">http://www.mudconnector.com/--this</a> 
  lists over 1000 MUDS <br><a rel="nofollow"
 target="_blank" href="http://www.xania.demon.co.uk/mud.html--this">http://www.xania.demon.co.uk/mud.html--this</a> 
  has a nice opening page, that describes MUDS and provides a couple interesting 
  links--you might want to go to this or Stu&#39;s page first (first one listed) 
  <p>All very well and good, but this IS a list about Everquest, and I don&#39;t 
  want Christina to feel compelled to boot me, so I&#39;ll return to topic. 
  &lt;grin&gt;&lt;hug!&gt;&nbsp; Don&#39;t boot me! 
  <p>You will find that as the client base changes, so do your opportunities to 
  be in closer contact with roleplayers who can handle the separation of reality 
  and fantasy.&nbsp; The good news is that a large portion of the later arrivals 
  are going to be gravitating back to their FPS and RTS genres as new games open 
  up for them.&nbsp; The bad news is that alot of them are going to Diablo II, 
  ruining open games.&nbsp; &lt;grin&gt; Sorry couldn&#39;t resist... I did enjoy 
  Diablo II the week I got to play it, and am plugging it shamelessly, I 
  know.&nbsp; I digress.&nbsp; The good news is that some of the new arrivals 
  that are staying are excellent roleplayers.&nbsp; The bad news is that they 
  are few and far between.&nbsp; Point is, I think you will have to be more 
  careful about who you select as your next partner.&nbsp; It&#39;s not your fault 
  if your ingame partner doesn&#39;t have an understanding real life partner, but 
  knowing you, you&#39;ll feel bad all the same if something goes wrong.&nbsp; Alot 
  of newer roleplayers, who have only come into RPing since it became online 
  RPing, don&#39;t know the rules of the game; ie., they become possessive of you or 
  they get in too deep or they don&#39;t lay it all on the line for their SOs who 
  aren&#39;t gamers and don&#39;t understand any of it. You run the risk of these 
  pitfalls and more each time you choose to start a new RP fantasy. 
  <p>Should you continue to play? Should you continue to have RP fantasies? 
  Well, consider this:&nbsp; regardless of the terms of the relationship, you 
  just came to the end of one.&nbsp; Doesn&#39;t matter that it&#39;s just RP, does it? 
  How do you feel right now?&nbsp; Sounds to me like your heart doesn&#39;t know the 
  difference between online and real life friends.&nbsp; That&#39;s okay; neither 
  does mine, and some online friends have become the best real life friends I&#39;ve 
  ever had, with birthday gifts and going to each other&#39;s kids&#39; school things 
  etc.&nbsp; Point is, your heart doesn&#39;t know, and so you&#39;re grieving.&nbsp; 
  When a relationship ends in the real world, we&#39;ve come to accept that there is 
  a mourning period and a readjusting period.&nbsp; Same holds true for RP, as 
  far as I&#39;m concerned.&nbsp; Treat your heart and your mental health as if 
  you&#39;d just ended a real life relationship.&nbsp; Don&#39;t push anything, don&#39;t 
  concern yourself about getting involved in the next fantasy right away.&nbsp; 
  Don&#39;t lock yourself away either, unless that&#39;s really what you need to do (and 
  sometimes it is, I know).&nbsp; Just take the time to heal, and then see where 
  your heart wants to go from there.&nbsp; But do treat yourself as if you have 
  a right to grieve, even if you do end up keeping your friendship (I&#39;m gonna 
  tell you the GF is gonna FLIP if he does).&nbsp; You have that right!&nbsp; 
  And please, please, please... do be careful while you&#39;re still tender, okay? 
  <p>&lt;HUG!&gt; <br>Aelwesara C├╗thalion, Ranger of worlds to come <br>&nbsp;
