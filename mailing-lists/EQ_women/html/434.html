<div id="ygrps-yiv-1212713251">Since I considered healers as buffers as well, the Bards ability to use<br/>
song for the same effect Shamans and Druids use spells had me classify<br/>
them that way.  They are the characters that strengthen the groups<br/>
abilities,  especially by removing downtime.<br/>
<br/>
We had two bards in our group last night in Cazic Thule and had ZERO<br/>
downtime between huge MoB battles.  I kept Embrace Death up which<br/>
converts my health to manna, having a similar effect to Clarity.  But<br/>
with the Bards healing songs I never lost enough health to have to Drain<br/>
Life so could use my far more potent &quot;Shock of Poison&quot; spell.  That was<br/>
the plus side.  The down side was that fighting for me was REALLY BORING<br/>
since I required none of my special skills.  /assist 2 2 2 /assist 2 2 2<br/>
/assist 2 2 2 2 all night long (2 is my poison hotkey).   And with no<br/>
downtime, there was not roleplay or chat.  &lt;sighs grimly&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My next two newbie characters are going to be Bard and Enchanter.  The<br/>
enchanter will replace my 11 mage - didn&#39;t like mage that much.  But<br/>
first I want to get my Druid on Brell to the same level as my Druid on<br/>
Quellious ( 12 on Brell, 20 on Quellious).<br/>
<br/>
Everquest has taken over my life *grins*.  I use the writing of the<br/>
roleplay as an excuse since I&#39;m changing careers to writing and the<br/>
short scenes I post on the boards do help me in my novel.  Now where was<br/>
I... oh yes...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Damian was an incredible specimen of a man.  Blue eyes looked out from<br/>
his tan chiseled face, darting about as though he was a trapped animal.<br/>
He had a dancers body and grace.  Tall as he was, he was able to fold<br/>
himself into the small space of the tent without looking awkward or<br/>
uncomfortable&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, couldn&#39;t resist *smiles*<br/>

&gt; &gt; Some bard-specific advice from a seasoned Bard...  (BTW, great<br/>
&gt; &gt; descriptions, Dnaisha, though I don&#39;t know if I necessarily agree with your<br/>
&gt; &gt; classification of a bard as a healer....the bard kind of fits outside your<br/>
&gt; &gt; categories).<br/>
