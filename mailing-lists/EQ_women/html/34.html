<br/>
As an older women in real life, I find it amusing to watch the juvenile <br/>
attempts at flirting that some characters try.<br/>
<br/>
My experiences have been varied.  I have been harassed by a young dwarf, <br/>
who was crude, profane and persistent during the first few days of <br/>
production in March.  Needless to say, I learned how &#39;/petition&#39; worked and <br/>
he was slapped down and repeatedly warned by other players, guides and GM&#39;s <br/>
alike until he learned to quell his urge to poke any and everything that <br/>
walked by.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have observed another Fennin Ro female player, who shall remain <br/>
nameless, use OUTRAGEOUS sexual overtones to sell her wares.  One wondered <br/>
if it was just leather armor she was selling, but it is interesting to <br/>
watch her use sex as a way to control male players.  She has been doing <br/>
this since production and I have recently played in a group in Unrest with <br/>
her and she does keep the patter up.  You would think she would get tired <br/>
of it and concentrate on the game, but it seems that this IS her game, <br/>
so.......I watch and wonder.  I have met two men who are playing female <br/>
characters and was able to detect it immediately, and they admitted it in <br/>
private tells.  I have kept their secret, but over time they have improved <br/>
their &#39;femininity&#39;, so I think that few others know that they are male in <br/>
RL.  I have been saddened to not have made friends with other female <br/>
characters on-line in EQ, when I have had wonderful lady friends on other <br/>
on-line games and miss them terribly.  Thus, my hopes soared when this <br/>
mailing list was created.<br/>
<br/>
I am always up front about my age when I am asked, but I am not too forth <br/>
coming when I am asked for my email address or for personal pictures.  I <br/>
always say that I am an ugly, fat, old, rich women and that usually puts a <br/>
stop to the pushiness.<br/>
<br/>
I have taken on the role of &#39;Auntie&#39; to a few fellow players.  One who is <br/>
married on EQ.  He is baffled by his woman friend<br/>
and her behavior and doesn&#39;t understand periodic moodiness.  He always <br/>
thinks he has done something wrong.  Another, slowly budding, only wants to <br/>
relate to women on-line who live half a world away from him in real life. <br/>
 It is so much safer emotionally and has more richness to his fantasy if <br/>
there is no chance of meeting.<br/>
<br/>
I think the half-elves, high elves and wood elf women get hit on the most <br/>
since they seem like such &#39;pin-up&#39; girls to the young male players.  I <br/>
think that men are biologically over balanced from visual stimulation in <br/>
real life, and these types of female characters are the epitome of a male <br/>
fantasy girl-thing.<br/>
<br/>
On that note, do you notice that we are the Girls of Norrath on some <br/>
web-sites, but they are the Men of Norrath?  Think that is a subconscious <br/>
need to control, by belittling???<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that is my two coppers worth.  Hope it fuels some discussion.<br/>

Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to jump in on this topic and introduce myself at the same time. <br/>
 My<br/>
name is Mystyrain and Im a 17th (almost 18th) level Magician on <br/>
Cazic-Thule.<br/>
I have never found flirting to be a real problem, though there are some <br/>
guys<br/>
that are extremely crass about it.  Most of them flirt in fun.<br/>
<br/>
I have been fairly lucky, I managed to find a wonderful Monk to concentrate <br/>
my &quot;serious&quot; flirting on and now we are engaged to be married.  There is<br/>
still a lot of non-serious flirting that goes on but everyone is pretty <br/>
much<br/>
aware that Im taken now.<br/>
<br/>
What i get a lot of is, &quot;Are you a girl IRL?&quot;.  As if that makes a<br/>
difference.  I always have to laugh at that one.  Some guys find it so hard <br/>
to believe that women actually LIKE these kinds of games too.<br/>
<br/>
In Light,<br/>
<br/>
