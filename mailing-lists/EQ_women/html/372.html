<b>Subject:</b> Re: Deciding which character to go with <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-410971063">Thanks for the advice.  I decided I didn&#39;t like the mage that much so I started<br/>
a DE cleric to go with the DE Necromancer.  And I loved my cleric while he<br/>
didn&#39;t love his monk.  Now the cleric is as high as the mage and higher than the<br/>
human cleric.  She levelled really fast and I love playing her.  I really like<br/>
Cleric.  I also really like Shaman.  I like Druid, but not as much I think,<br/>
though it is hard to say.  We didn&#39;t play her very long and the roleplay was<br/>
kind of droll.<br/>
<br/>
It is interesting and so far we only have two sets of characters we both agree<br/>
to take into the 20s, the high elf wizard and paladin who are now 22 and 23<br/>
respectively, and the dark elf cleric and necromancer who are now 11 and 15<br/>
respectively.  And now if the servers would ever come back up, I might get my<br/>
cleric up to 12 BEFORE he makes 16 *grin*.<br/>

&gt; I have been role-playing a wood elf ranger since the day the game came out.<br/>
&gt; She has become affianced to another wood elf ranger, but at one point she<br/>
&gt; found herself strangely drawn to a High elf cleric.  I find that I like the<br/>
&gt; idea of love crossing all boundaries.  And a ranger/cleric combination is<br/>
&gt; pretty good; I am a pretty effective tank and it&#39;s really nice to have a<br/>
&gt; healer standing behind you. =) Maybe you will find that you can accept the<br/>
&gt; idea of cross-racing too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Although two finger wigglers are very impressive, it&#39;s nice to have the<br/>
&gt; tank ability for when either you&#39;re soloing or you want to take on something<br/>
&gt; more resistant to magic.  Lately, my ranger has paired with an enchanter,<br/>
&gt; and I must say the combination is incredibly powerful.  The enchanter is<br/>
&gt; played by the same person who plays my character&#39;s betrothed, so we know<br/>
&gt; each others&#39; style of play already, but it was certainly an eye-opener to<br/>
&gt; learn to play with an effective, knowledgeable enchanter.  He hasn&#39;t let me<br/>
&gt; die yet, and we&#39;ve been taking out mostly yellows and some even monsters.<br/>
&gt; His ability to keep more than one monster from hitting me at a time<br/>
&gt; (Mesmerize), combined with his long-term-damage (DoT) spells allow me to<br/>
&gt; hack and slash and whittle the sucker down with relative ease.  Not to<br/>
&gt; mention I ALWAYS go into combat with Strength and Haze. =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Something to consider.  I know you don&#39;t want to start another character.<br/>
&gt; You may wish to examine each class and decide what you can&#39;t live without,<br/>
&gt; and work from there.  I restarted my character, Sara, with her full elven<br/>
&gt; name, and her beloved ranger is waiting patiently for her to &#39;grow up.&#39;<br/>
&gt; Obviously, the enchanter is a much better partner for her until she comes<br/>
&gt; into her own (and we usually pick up a cleric or druid from our guild to<br/>
&gt; stand by for healing, hehe).  So we have a case of one person being more<br/>
&gt; powerful than the other, and the two unable to play together.  This will<br/>
&gt; pass, and my character will be stronger than ever, and our patience will be<br/>
&gt; rewarded.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just some thoughts. =)<br/>

&gt; &gt; My partner and in game husband in four out of five of our character<br/>
&gt; &gt; pairs and boyfriend in one (the only chance I get to flirt with other<br/>
&gt; &gt; men *grin*) gets restless easily, as you can tell by the number of<br/>
&gt; &gt; character pairs we have.  We have decided five is definitely enough and<br/>
&gt; &gt; want to choose which ones to take to the next level (10 to 20).  It<br/>
&gt; &gt; takes little time to bring them up to 9 and longer through the teens.<br/>
&gt; &gt; But what we have noticed in the 20s is that it is a week or two per<br/>
&gt; &gt; level and with the amount of time invested we want to pick the<br/>
&gt; &gt; characters we like most to put that kind of time in.<br/>
