<div id="ygrps-yiv-1423010831">OOoh, what realm is mentalist?  If that&#39;s Hibernia I could try.  I tried<br/>
Hibernia on Guinevere (the OTHER RP server) but was a little nauseated after<br/>
level 1 as it was too much like Candy Land and decided to do Hibernia on a non<br/>
RP server.  So I started a Skald who is only 4 but man having hit points is a<br/>
GAS.<br/>
<br/>
Iceiallana (on Percival) is now 10 and if I weren&#39;t all the way in Avalon<br/>
Marsh I&#39;d have her last name, though I&#39;m not sure ForestFury fits a Highlander<br/>
so was thinking MacFury instead :-)  Anyway, I got revive and it is SO much<br/>
better now.  As long as spring lasts and we&#39;re not fighting casters (damn<br/>
wisps) I can pull the team back and we can get going again in about half the<br/>
time it takes to run without a minstrel.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, having a blast!  And loving my Dwarf Skald so  much I think I&#39;ll make<br/>
a Norseman Thane :-)  I&#39;d do Highlander Armsman, but I&#39;m sick to death of<br/>
newbie Camelot Hills.  <br/>
<br/>
Uh-oh, I&#39;m rambling... and time here is limited as well, but I had sick kids<br/>
at home yesterday and, well, they were sleeping and all *giggles*.  When my<br/>
new system gets here and I have a computer in both houses.. eep, when will I<br/>
sleep?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m playing DAOC on Bevedere. I have a level 6 Spiritmaster (kinda <br/>
like a necro). I also have a level 2 mentalist on Morgan Le&#39;fay <br/>
I am looking more forward to playing her. I haven&#39;t had much time<br/>
to play because of time limitations.... Both my characters<br/>
are named Kitae.<br/>
