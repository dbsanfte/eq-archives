<div id="ygrps-yiv-685887505"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Hi, Melissa, and welcome to our &#39;sisterhood&#39;. =) We&#39;re trying to firm up a date <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;for an all-women<br/>
&gt;&gt;meeting that I am hosting on Quellios, during the first week in August.  Please <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;let me know what<br/>
&gt;&gt;days are good for you, if you&#39;re interested in attending.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, while I would have to make a new character, I could do so.  Good dates for <br/>
<br/>
me would be August 4, or 6-8.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;On a side note, ladies, I&#39;m moving to MD tomorrow via cross-country truck <br/>
&gt;*groans* so I will be<br/>
&gt;&gt;out of contact for a WHOLE WEEK. *sniffles*But I hope to have lots to read when <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I get my computer<br/>
&gt;&gt;set back up. (not so subtle hint) This is an interesting move for me because <br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve quit my job and<br/>
&gt;&gt;left my significant other at the same time, so bear with me and my &quot;growing <br/>
&gt;pains&quot; as I move back<br/>
&gt;&gt;in with my parents to go back to college full-time (me and my two kids).  Hope <br/>
<br/>
&gt;no one out there<br/>
&gt;&gt;can relate, but I&#39;m sure some of you can.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, I can relate.  I myself am moving in with a roommate at the end of this <br/>
month so I can go back to school.  I hope everything works out for both of us!<br/>
