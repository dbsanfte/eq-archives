My name is Lori and i have bene playing EverQuest for over 4 years <br/>
now.  I am on The Nameless.  I have my main char. Named Lorina <br/>
(Cleric) lvl 51., Lorinya (Beastlord) 24, Lori (Druid) lvl 25, <br/>
Loriana (warrior) lvl 26, and a few lower lvls as well.  (Yes i am <br/>
stuck on the Lori names, LOL.  No chars have Epics, and i am getting <br/>
the tch to get my clerics really badly.  So we will see.<br/>
I Just came across this board yesterday  And wanted to give an <br/>
introduction.  If anyone sees me in world give me a tell, let me know <br/>
