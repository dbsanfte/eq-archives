<b>Subject:</b> Re: Twinking?? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2132536331">Most of the twinking I&#39;ve seen done is male characters switching from<br/>
one to another.  I have seen female characters begging for things<br/>
either free or for less than the going price...saw this yesterday and<br/>
was VERY verbal to the young lady as she was not only a half-elf, but<br/>
also a bard...Needless to say that Genneth got quite righteous!  (but<br/>
totally in character)  As for myself, most of the things that I have<br/>
been given came from guildmembers either passing along outdated items<br/>
(which I have also done for newer guild members)or just being nice<br/>
because a bard is always poor (I have a Qeynos guard shield that was<br/>
such a gift).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t consider this gift giving twinking.  And if someone in my guild<br/>
gave me a full set of armor, I would take it and when I earned enough<br/>
to replace it with better, I would pass the gift along...I never sell<br/>
gifts...<br/>
