  <p><tt>I&#39;m Viv, and play various chars on Tunare and Morell-Thule.</tt></p>
  <p><tt><font color="#0000ff">Welcome to the list Viv!&nbsp; It sounds to me like 
  we are kindred spirits.&nbsp; I play mostly on Brell though I did create a 
  char on Morell-Thule when it first came up.&nbsp;</font><br><br>There&#39;s a 
  coupla things I&#39;ve always thought of asking other eq <br>girls.. firstly, I 
  know a lot of guys play female chars, and I&#39;ve <br>tried a few times making 
  male chars but just felt silly playing them <br>and ended up deleting them 
  within the first level or so. Is it just <br>me? Have I got too much wussiness 
  factor in me? Or am I just a <br>mediocre role-player? Or both?!?! ;)</tt></p>
  <p><tt><font color="#0000ff">I only tried playing a male character once and it 
  felt just too strange.&nbsp; In fact, I also have trouble playing the less 
  feminine style characters.&nbsp; I find myself drawn to the graphics and so 
  finally gave up.&nbsp; I like the sexy little female things like wood elves, 
  humans, and barbarians.&nbsp; I think it is because I&#39;ll never have a young 
  perky body again and I miss it.&nbsp; Getting old has very negative impact on 
  the body (the mind, on the other hand, makes it an almost fair 
  trade).</font></tt></p>
  <p><tt></tt><tt>Also.. has anyone else had their heart broken in eq? Silly 
  question I <br>know, but i guess I just want reassurance that I&#39;m not alone 
  here ;P </tt></p>
  <p><tt><font color="#0000ff">More than once, in fact.&nbsp; And I don&#39;t think 
  it&#39;s a silly question or even silly.&nbsp; The game is so immersive that I 
  have found it has a greater emotional impact on me than my real life.&nbsp; 
  Now, perhaps that is because my real life is stable and very happy and my 
  biggest worry is finding a good landscape architect.&nbsp; </font></tt></p>
  <p><font color="#0000ff"><tt>But recently when the RL girlfriend of my in-game 
  fiancee decided to be jealous and paranoid and asked him to stop seeing me I 
  was heartbroken.&nbsp; The game just felt so flat without that 
  relationship.&nbsp; I think a big reason I&#39;m not playing right now, other than 
  being on vacation for the month, has been the loss of that 
  relationship.</tt></font></p>
  <p><tt></tt><tt></tt><tt>In fact, I met a guy the other day whose heart was 
  broken by a girl <br>in eq, so it&#39;s not just a girlie thing i guess..</tt></p>
  <p><tt><font color="#0000ff">No, I know a young man who has been through three 
  heartbreaking relationships in the course of my knowing him.&nbsp; For him 
  Norrath presents a way of &quot;testing the waters&quot; of relationships as he is just 
  starting college this year.&nbsp; </font></tt></p>
  <p><tt>Btw, i&#39;m in Australia in rl, and my Tunare chars are Athens, Rynni 
  <br>and Lrynn (tho Lrynn may be taking a break..) and on Morell-Thule are 
  <br>Jhasper, Leilanni and Volare.</tt></p>
