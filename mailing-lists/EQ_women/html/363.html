<div id="ygrps-yiv-910641408">Do guilds ever span more than one server? Right now I&#39;m a level 11 druid on<br/>
Cazic Thule. I have been playing VEERRRRRYYYY slowly, and though I&#39;m<br/>
interested in the Brell gang, I just can&#39;t handle doing the newbie thing<br/>
when I am just out of the newbie zone myself!  Can gangs cross servers? I<br/>
don&#39;t know if they can or not. I&#39;d like to take part. I made a character on<br/>
Brell, but I don&#39;t have the heart to play it when I&#39;m just getting my druid<br/>
going.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>

&gt;Hey everyone,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I recently got 36th level with my enchanter on Brell Serelis.  I&#39;m a<br/>
&gt;little in shock in I&#39;m only now starting to comprehend that I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt;power leveling like crazy.  I think it&#39;s time for me to back off a bit,<br/>
&gt;because I&#39;ve been just way to into this character.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m currently doing jewelry on Brell and I&#39;m the only jeweler who can<br/>
&gt;make the coveted Platinum Ruby Veil (+7 wis +7 str) and Platinum Sapphire<br/>
&gt;Necklace (+7 int +7 str).  I never though I&#39;d be in that kind of position<br/>
&gt;on a server it&#39;s kind of weird.  It won&#39;t last for long, but for now, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;the best jewler on the server.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The guild is fairly slow.  We have probably 6 regular players I&#39;d say<br/>
&gt;(people who log in on a daily basis).  We have a few other more infrequent<br/>
&gt;members.  There is a wide range in the guild in terms of levels it seems.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d like to encourage anyone interested in exploring things on a new<br/>
&gt;server to consider trying Brell.  Now that the server has been up for<br/>
&gt;almost two months it seems to have stabalized a bit.  The newbie zones<br/>
&gt;aren&#39;t as over hunted as they were.  Because there are less people on<br/>
&gt;brell, the hunting areas in general don&#39;t seem as camped.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I plan on starting a new character on Brell soon, a ranger or bard I<br/>
&gt;suspect.  I&#39;m very tempted to make a ranger because I acquired a Gigantic<br/>
&gt;Zweihander in a trade (great 2-handed slashing weapon).  I really like the<br/>
&gt;spell-songs of bards as well though.  I see this character as being for<br/>
&gt;mainly grouping.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I hope everyone is having fun playing!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
