<div id="ygrps-yiv-1200669654"><p>Since you don&#39;t need the cd to run the game you can use one CD to load the game onto all of your computers, and run EQ on as many computers as you have at once. (Get up to 5 games of eq going at once in my house!) The problem is that you cannot run the same account on more than 1 computer at a time, and you have to reqister a differnet CD for every account. Example: When PoP came out we had to buy 5 copies of the game because we have 5 accounts (me plus 4 roomates), but we only used one of the CD&#39;s to install the expansion onto the computers. When it came time to register our expnasions we opened the rest of the boxes and each grabbed a cd so that we would each have our own registration code.</p><p><br><hr size="1">Do you Yahoo!?<br>
