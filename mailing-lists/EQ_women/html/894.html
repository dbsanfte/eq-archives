<div id="ygrps-yiv-850077436">OMG!  Less than 4 lbs.  I can&#39;t imagine that!  I saw one at<br/>
Challenger Little League who was &quot;up to 6lbs&quot; now.  My smallest one<br/>
was 7 11 (and I don&#39;t have diabetes.)<br/>
<br/>
I bet you learned some things about your son while talking to him.<br/>

Of course, Dr. Mom recommends total darkness after 9 PM!  Read<br/>
Lights Out!  Sleep, sugar and survival.<br/>
