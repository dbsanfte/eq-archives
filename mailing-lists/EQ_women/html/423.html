&lt;&lt; I&#39;ll hopefully get this thing figured out shortly. If not I&#39;ll have to <br/>
contact them and cancel until I can get back up and on line.<br/>

Here I am responding to my own post.<br/>
Well, I figured out the problem and got everything running and got back on EQ <br/>
and the thing locked up my system again. The only way to even get my computer <br/>
to re-boot at that point is to pull out the modem and then re-install it.<br/>
I will contact EQ and see if there is a patch of something that might help to <br/>
overcome this problem. If not I&#39;m afraid that EQ is out for me for the <br/>
forseeable future as I can&#39;t afford another computer.<br/>
