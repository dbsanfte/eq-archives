Most times gaming does NOT equate to real life socializing, and it is very
difficult to tell whether that person who is your best friend ingame is
anything like a friend you would want in your real life.</i>

<p><br><i>It is very true that unless the ingame relationship is entered

I have only married ingame twice, in all the MUDing and RPGing that I&#39;ve
done.&nbsp; The first time, it was to a total powergamer (who is married
IRL and was trying to break into roleplaying) who simply wanted someone
to help him learn to roleplay.&nbsp; That was so nice and non-threatening
and it shocked the pants off everyone who knew him, which was part of the
charm for both of us. =)&nbsp; Then, for about a year after, I was very
careful because I was in a relationship with a non-gamer who was threatened
by my gaming life.&nbsp; I acquiesced and was a very aloof person, no flirting
or anything.&nbsp; Finally, I realized that I wasn&#39;t a very happy woman,
got rid of that relationship, loosened up in the gaming world, and realized
I didn&#39;t need to play to please anyone but myself.&nbsp; From that, a wonderful
friendship that had been budding rapidly blossomed, and I was able to roleplay
with confidence.&nbsp; In that scenario, getting married was great fun
and still non-threatening.&nbsp; And the friendship gets better all the
time. ;)&nbsp; But again... I do recognize I am fortunate.</i><i></i>
<p><i>Had I not found the friend I did in EQ, I would not have married.&nbsp;
My character was a free spirit for a long time and was happy on her own.&nbsp;
But then... that&#39;s usually when the best relationships happen in real life,
too... &lt;grin&gt; Sometimes the parallels are a wee bit scary...</i><i></i>
