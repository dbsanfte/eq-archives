<br/>
I have seen this on Karana as well. However, I&#39;m in a<br/>
great guild because we are not just a guild, we are a<br/>
family. We are small, about 30 members with about 45<br/>
characters. In order to get in our family the entire<br/>
family votes and then the new person is adopted in<br/>
during a ceremony. It really is wonderful. We all have<br/>
the same last name as well and are recognized server<br/>
wide. Our charter is dedication to family, love,<br/>
honor, and loyalty and we go out of our way to help<br/>
others in need. I have many wonderful brothers and<br/>
sisters and have an adopted daughter as well.<br/>

&gt; one thing that I&#39;ve come to believe is that the<br/>
&gt; quality of guilds has definitely gone down hill.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve always thought of a guild as a group of<br/>
&gt; friends, people that want to play together, or chat<br/>
&gt; or hang out. Just recently, I was on as a newbie<br/>
&gt; character I have and someone I didn&#39;t know just<br/>
&gt; walked up to her and invited her into a guild. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d love to join a small guild that everyone is<br/>
&gt; friendly, that people get together for fun once in a<br/>
&gt; while, no matter what their levels. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So what do you all think, have guilds changed from<br/>
&gt; what they once were?<br/>
