<b>Subject:</b> Re: balancing EQ with real life :) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-265555916">Okay, to be honest, I don&#39;t balance well at all.  It&#39;s a chronic<br/>
struggle and I consider EQ an addiction with a WHOLE LOT of<br/>
rationalization why I can play it.   If he is playing the raids on Fear<br/>
and Hate and the dragon raids then he really is committing himself for<br/>
the duration of the raid.  At the earlier levels one can log on and log<br/>
off pretty freely as there is less coordination with other people.  But<br/>
the raids require commitment.<br/>
<br/>
If he IS level 50, he doesn&#39;t really have to play every night.  He is at<br/>
the maximum level.  One suggestion would be to set aside one night a<br/>
week as &quot;date night&quot; where the two of you spend time together.  And,<br/>
yes, you might look into getting your own EQ account.  It really doesn&#39;t<br/>
cost that much.  Not so you can spend more time playing with him as much<br/>
as so you can learn a bit more about the environment and community.<br/>
<br/>
Or just hang out with him.  There is enough downtime in the game that I<br/>
often read a book while other watch TV while playing.  It is interrupted<br/>
conversation, but it is possible to have.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, good luck.  I don&#39;t know that there is a solution,<br/>
honestly.  If I had a real life group like SCA I might enjoy that more.<br/>
I suspect it is a LOT healthier.  &lt;sigh&gt;  Oh well, good luck.<br/>

&gt; I was just wondering how you all balance playing EQ with real life<br/>
&gt; roles/duties.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not actually a EQ player myself, but my husband is.  Since he<br/>
&gt; started to<br/>
&gt; play EQ (over 6 months ago), we haven&#39;t done as much as we used to<br/>
&gt; together.<br/>
&gt; Before EQ he played Ultima Online but was able to log whenever he felt<br/>
&gt; like<br/>
&gt; it in that game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With EQ it seems like he has to be on longer to get anywhere in the<br/>
&gt; game and<br/>
&gt; he isn&#39;t able to log whenever he wants to.  He is a level 50 ranger<br/>
&gt; and is<br/>
&gt; in the Plain of Fear a lot right now.  Due to the spawn rates he has<br/>
&gt; to stay<br/>
&gt; up late, and be online every day.  He even has taken off work<br/>
&gt; periodically<br/>
&gt; to be in the game more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know a lot of the game just because it is mostly all of what we talk<br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt; right now.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I understand online role playing as I ran my own computer BBS for over<br/>
&gt; 5<br/>
&gt; years.  I was an avid MUD/MUSH player myself for a while and did play<br/>
&gt; Ultima<br/>
&gt; Online for a bit too.   My husband and I actually meet on my BBS when<br/>
&gt; I was<br/>
&gt; on college dated for about 3 years and have been married 3 1/2 years.<br/>
&gt; We<br/>
&gt; are both avid computer game players.  Due to life/new hobbies/etc. I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; been in online games myself for the past 3 years.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I really don&#39;t mind him playing EQ as I know it is what he likes to<br/>
&gt; do.  We<br/>
&gt; have an understanding that I let him play EQ and I spend my free time<br/>
&gt; doing<br/>
&gt; SCA (medieval re-inactment group) activities.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For Christmas all he wanted was anything EQ related.  He also tells me<br/>
&gt; if I<br/>
&gt; want to spend more time with him, that I should get a EQ account<br/>
&gt; myself (we<br/>
&gt; have a home network which would make this possible). :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was just wondering how others balance their life with their<br/>
&gt; significant<br/>
&gt; others and EQ playing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
