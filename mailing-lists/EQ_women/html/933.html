<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EQ_women] neglecting our families? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-866053396">Ok this is to much to let go by. First of all some of<br/>
us have raised our families. They are gone!<br/>
hallalujeah. They have their own lives. I started<br/>
playing EQ because it was my husband&#39;s game for 3<br/>
years before I started, and I wanted to share the time<br/>
with him not away from him! I was lonely for his<br/>
attention. He didn&#39;t have to raise the kids, cook the<br/>
meals, go to practice, clean the house, I DID. If<br/>
anyone was neglected from their family it was me. Get<br/>
a clue! If you have a regret of neglecting your family<br/>
look at yourself, but don&#39;t throw your dirty laundry<br/>
in my yard wash it! Judgemental people really irritate<br/>
me! You play what you want and I&#39;ll play what I want,<br/>
right along with my family and friends. Get a life!<br/>

&gt; dude, you sound like an <br/>
&gt; utter loser (not u dr. mom, dave...)  i am QUITE<br/>
&gt; happy spending time on EQ <br/>
&gt; rather than w/ my family...  i am 25 years old and<br/>
&gt; the only person my age <br/>
&gt; smart enough not to have children when i didnt want<br/>
&gt; them (or couldnt take <br/>
&gt; care of them because of my drug/booze/sex<br/>
&gt; problem)...  As far as MY mother <br/>
&gt; goes, she&#39;s recently divorced (and i had to go to<br/>
&gt; her 47th cake-and-icecream <br/>
&gt; birthday party w/ HER parents this weekend) and<br/>
&gt; quite insane.  Her <br/>
&gt; self-worth comes from &quot;knowin&#39; that when i walk into<br/>
&gt; a bar that i&#39;m the best <br/>
&gt; lookin&#39; woman there&quot; and sleeping with as many<br/>
&gt; drunken mechanics as she can <br/>
&gt; in one weekend...  My 21 year old brother who still<br/>
&gt; lives with her is on <br/>
&gt; some HEAVY ass drugs (they can make him walk home<br/>
&gt; from a 70mph collision and <br/>
&gt; go to sleep, but make him angry when the police wake<br/>
&gt; him up to come clean up <br/>
&gt; the dmg done..*amazingly no charges were pressed in<br/>
&gt; that matter*)...  My <br/>
&gt; dear sister...  well i promised never to talk about<br/>
&gt; her hehehehe....  really <br/>
&gt; i did...  Anything I write about her has to be<br/>
&gt; approved for public <br/>
&gt; release...  even a yahoogroup...  Now...  What I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; doing when I should be <br/>
&gt; tending to my family...  I am lvling a necro of<br/>
&gt; course, and also GOING TO <br/>
&gt; COLLEGE so that i wont make the thrilling 2.17 an<br/>
&gt; hour of a waitress for the <br/>
&gt; rest of my accursed days.  So shame on us!  Shame on<br/>
&gt; us women who have less <br/>
&gt; than perfect families where mothers are sluts and<br/>
&gt; brothers fight cops and <br/>
&gt; husbands whine like toddlers over the slightest<br/>
&gt; diversion of a wife&#39;s <br/>
&gt; attention.  Shame on us for needing an escape! <br/>
&gt; (btw, my bf has a 63 cleric <br/>
&gt; *yes RL bf we live together and life is good*).... <br/>
&gt; Doc, i wouldnt give this <br/>
&gt; &quot;dave&quot; fellow any more info...  he&#39;s obviously in<br/>
&gt; the wrong group.....  <br/>
&gt; TAKING SUGGESTIONS FOR WHAT GROUP DAVE SHOULD<br/>
&gt; JOIN!!!  I would vote...  <br/>

&gt; &gt;Subject: [EQ_women] neglecting our families?<br/>
&gt; &gt;Date: Sun, 06 Jul 2003 15:51:34 -0400<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;There are several lists on Yahoo for family members<br/>
&gt; who feel that<br/>
&gt; &gt;their loved one has an internet addiction. <br/>
&gt; Apparently, she felt<br/>
&gt; &gt;that she was needed more online than off.  You<br/>
&gt; probably made her<br/>
&gt; &gt;feel as if you didn&#39;t care about her anymore.  Her<br/>
&gt; guildies did.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Frankly, at 47 yrs old, I have seen enough<br/>
&gt; fireworks (twice a year<br/>
&gt; &gt;off my back deck.)  I have no other family alive<br/>
&gt; except the hubby<br/>
&gt; &gt;and the kids.  (And his family is in California.  I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t go along<br/>
&gt; &gt;because 5 hour plane rides are bad for my health.) <br/>
&gt; And parades are<br/>
&gt; &gt;just flat-out boring.  I DO have hot, fresh food<br/>
&gt; every night for<br/>
&gt; &gt;the boys.  I am a substitute teacher, part-time<br/>
&gt; grad. student,<br/>
&gt; &gt;computer repair technician, run 17 yahoo groups and<br/>
&gt; do nutritional<br/>
&gt; &gt;consulting.  I got into EQ so I would have<br/>
&gt; something to talk about<br/>
&gt; &gt;with my boys who are also bored by parades.  Maybe<br/>
&gt; the real world<br/>
&gt; &gt;just isn&#39;t as challenging as learning to &quot;swim&quot;<br/>
&gt; underwater in a 3-D<br/>
&gt; &gt;castle.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Having them at their father&#39;s, on the weekends,<br/>
&gt; really helps my<br/>
&gt; &gt;relationship with my husband and allows me to have<br/>
&gt; a really clean<br/>
&gt; &gt;house for two days a week.  He just lets them sit<br/>
&gt; around and watch<br/>
&gt; &gt;tv all the time.  At least when they are playing<br/>
&gt; EQ, they are<br/>
&gt; &gt;thinking.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Your reminder is well-taken though as my hubby does<br/>
&gt; sometimes feel<br/>
&gt; &gt;neglected because I am not ready when he is.<br/>
