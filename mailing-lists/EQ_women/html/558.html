<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EQ_women] Diablo II <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-548099081">I was staying with friends on the day Diablo II arrived at their house, and so<br/>
we all took turns playing on their machines via TCP/IP.  It was a blast,<br/>
although I found it two-dimensional at first, having become so accustomed to<br/>
agonizing over how to build my character (&quot;Bam!  You&#39;re a necro!  That&#39;s<br/>
it!&quot;)--but in a way, it was a relief!  Two choices, done!<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t get above level 6, but in the meantime, I had two pet skellies and a<br/>
golem, and boy lemme tell ya... such a difference, sitting back, filing my<br/>
nails, waving my wand airily to debuff the mobs... much different from the<br/>
ranger I normally play. &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No one I have spoken to is fond of Open games, and I can see why not... haven&#39;t<br/>
tried a Realm game, but the TCP/IP is just as fun when you have a good group of<br/>
people.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; The multiplayer isnt too bad... there are a few problems<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; you can play on battlenet in 2 ways... Open games, and Realm games...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Open games are played basically like Diablo 1 and open to all the cheating<br/>
&gt; you can imagine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Realm games are on Battlenet servers, your charcter are stord on th server<br/>
&gt; and games are ran on th server to prevent cheating.  The problem with this<br/>
&gt; though, they hav sub standard servers... and its basically impossible trying<br/>
&gt; to play on servers designed for a few thousand people when 50,000 is trying<br/>
&gt; to get on them...  I only play the single player, and direct conecting<br/>
&gt; TCP/IP with friends and forget the battlenet problems and cheaters<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; but i startd playing this game over a week ago, nd hvent played EQ since...<br/>
&gt; thats kinda hard after being addicted to EQ since beta<br/>
