<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-676502456">I am married in real life and my husband plays EQ.  We have both RP&#39;d for <br/>
many years, table top and online, and we understand that what is in game <br/>
stays in game.  My Magician is engaged to a monk who, in real life, is in a <br/>
very long and committed relationship.  They key is to trust each other. And, <br/>
for the record, though Mdian and Mysty RP an engagement there is no cyber <br/>
going on &lt; chuckles &gt;.  The closest we come to that is laughing about it.<br/>

simply adore her!  : )</div>
