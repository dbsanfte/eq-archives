<div id="ygrps-yiv-858866451">This reply took some serious consideration on my part, only because I know it<br/>
too well.  I have twice role-played with a partner.  My first one was in Ultima<br/>
Online, and my partner and I got married in a very lovely ceremony in front of<br/>
our guild and friends.  His RL wife didn&#39;t mind, my RL fianc´┐¢ hated it so much<br/>
that he made my life miserable as often as he could over it.  I no longer have<br/>
the fianc´┐¢, but I still have the friend I made in UO (he and his lovely lady are<br/>
expecting, and I have a gift for her on the way).<br/>
    My second one was here in EQ, with another friend.  Again, remember I no<br/>
longer have the fianc´┐¢, but I still have the friend.  He has never made me<br/>
uncomfortable, and he has never crossed the lines that I have set (although my<br/>
RL fianc´┐¢ sat over my shoulder and second-guessed everything I did and said).<br/>
Now that I am single, my EQ friend is one of my best buds.  We talk about dating<br/>
woes and all sorts of things, and I&#39;m glad to have his friendship.<br/>
    It seems to me that as long as you&#39;re careful to set expectations straight<br/>
UP FRONT, and I mean as SOON as it looks like there&#39;s going to be some romantic<br/>
role-playing, AND as long as your partner is of equal or greater age/maturity,<br/>
you can have fun.  That&#39;s what I did, and fortunately, it worked.  Just<br/>
remember.....Ted Bundy was very charming. =)  Sorry, lovely thought I know, but<br/>
be careful out there.<br/>
