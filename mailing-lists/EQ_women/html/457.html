<div id="ygrps-yiv-17792133">Settle onto Brell and damned and determined to get my Druid to 50.  She<br/>
should hit 34 today!  Joined a great guild, Mithril Empire, and am<br/>
having a blast with what I hope becomes a new in-game romance (just<br/>
starting, but he DID kiss me).  I&#39;ve been at odds since my partner of 4<br/>
mos. left EQ entirely and had a bad spate with my DE necromancer.  I<br/>
think I&#39;m going to kill her and take all her good int stuff and twink a<br/>
newbie enchantress with it someday.<br/>
<br/>
My primary alt at the moment is a young Bard who I&#39;m having fun making<br/>
lambent armor for (though the wood elf helm looks like a bright blue<br/>
bucket with ears).  She has a twin brother cleric who has to work hard<br/>
to keep her in line because she&#39;s basically a brat &lt;giggles&gt;.  I&#39;m<br/>
loving bard though and it may be the next class I commit to.  I have<br/>
played all classes now except monk, enchanter, and rogue.  No desire for<br/>
monk and rogue, actually.<br/>
<br/>
The best part of hitting the 30s is that it&#39;s as high as I&#39;ve ever been<br/>
so I&#39;m getting to explore new areas.  Note:  do not attempt Kedge Keep<br/>
using enduring breath until you don&#39;t have to look at your book to<br/>
meditate.  Boy we drown FAST!  My favorite prey at the moment are<br/>
giants.  I can&#39;t solo them but with a small group when the zones aren&#39;t<br/>
crowded, they are a blast.  I joke about breaking their toes with my<br/>
tiny hammer making it harder for them to run because I do insignifant<br/>
damage compred to my high 30s groupmates.  Still, something about<br/>
killing that Sand Giant that ate you for breakfast every morning in the<br/>
oasis is SOOOOO satisfying.<br/>

&gt; This list has grown pretty quiet, and that&#39;s ok.  I thought I&#39;d send<br/>
&gt; an<br/>
&gt; innocent &#39;hi&#39; to the list though and see what everyone has been up to<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; EQ lately?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I recently became an apprentice guide and I&#39;ve been having a lot of<br/>
&gt; fun<br/>
&gt; with that.  We&#39;re not supposed to tell people what server we&#39;re on<br/>
&gt; unfortunately, so I can&#39;t tell you that =/<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My Ranger on Brell made 50 recently (I also have a 50 enchanter<br/>
&gt; there).<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been spending a lot of time killing dragons, and romping though<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; planes.  In a way I miss the simpler dungeons, since plane and dragon<br/>
&gt; raids are usually always lengthy undertakings, and 90% of the time you<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; just sit around waiting for the next fight to happen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I started a baby magician on Luclin mostly to visit a close friend who<br/>
&gt; has<br/>
&gt; moved there.  It&#39;s nice to have a pet =) They&#39;re fun.<br/>
