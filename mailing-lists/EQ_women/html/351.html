<div id="ygrps-yiv-1320665588">My boyfriend played on Vallon a bit and I watched him.  He made a dwarven<br/>
cleric and leveled very quickly to level 9, which is the level at which<br/>
you can fight anyone from 1st-17th level.  He then joined frequent dwarf<br/>
raiding parties that attacked the elf newbies, and killed lots of them.<br/>
For some reason, the dwarves and gnomes seemed to have no problem<br/>
attacking the elves, the but elves never seemed to launch counter<br/>
offensives.<br/>
<br/>
I was a little surprised to admit I enjoyed watching those battles, human<br/>
vs human has a real draw to it.  My boyfriend&#39;s role was generally to<br/>
blind and root elves so that smaller dwarf warriors could fall on them and<br/>
kill them quickly.  However, I also got to see my boyfriend be killed by<br/>
parties of elves ocassionally.  For example, when fighting the sisters in<br/>
lesser faydark, some elves started blinding and rooting him and his<br/>
partner so the NPCs killed them.  Leveling there seems to be very hard.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d like Vallon, and my  mind hasn&#39;t changed.<br/>
It seems all too vicious to me.  The race wars concept justifies attacking<br/>
anyone of another race for no reason.  I don&#39;t really want to kill other<br/>
people for sport, and I know I&#39;d find it very frustrating if people killed<br/>
me, trained me, blinded me while I was fighting etc.  It takes hours just<br/>
to get your corpse back some times on Race Wars.<br/>

&gt; haven&#39;t played her in a loooong time and haven&#39;t leveled her to the point<br/>
&gt; where PvP becomes reality.  Has anyone played Tallon to any extent? My<br/>

&gt; the time for another char, but if it&#39;s something we all want to explore, I<br/>
&gt; will...<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;It&#39;s been a little quiet here lately so I&#39;m going to suggest a little Q&A<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;to get some chatter going.<br/>
