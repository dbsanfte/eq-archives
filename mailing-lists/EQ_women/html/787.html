Thanks for the note.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a way to unbind your soul so that it&#39;s no<br/>
longer bound to any specific location.<br/>

&gt; It is probably best to join an existing guild, an<br/>
&gt; existing guild will have <br/>
&gt; more experienced players who can help you learn the<br/>
&gt; game. Running a guild <br/>
&gt; is a lot of work!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Retrieving bodies when you are level 10 or higher<br/>
&gt; can be difficult. If you<br/>
&gt; think you&#39;re going to die it&#39;s a good idea to<br/>
&gt; quickly type<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; /l<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; this will tell you your current location. When you<br/>
&gt; die, write down the <br/>
&gt; number, then you can use /l to see how close you are<br/>
&gt; to that location <br/>
&gt; while you&#39;re trying to find your body.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bards, Necromancers, and Shadow Knights can locate<br/>
&gt; corpses with spells. If <br/>
&gt; there is one in the zone they will often help you if<br/>
&gt; you are polite. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Salutations!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Can anyone give me information about starting a<br/>
&gt; guild, is that <br/>
&gt; &gt; possible, or do you have to join an existing one?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Can anyone give me some sewing tips? I&#39;ve figured<br/>
&gt; out how to take a <br/>
&gt; &gt; ruined wolf pelt and certain patterns and put them<br/>
&gt; in the small <br/>
&gt; &gt; sewing kit to make tunics, boots, etc. but what<br/>
&gt; about other things. I <br/>
&gt; &gt; have not gotten anything to work in my large<br/>
&gt; sewing kit at all yet, <br/>
&gt; &gt; keeps saying it&#39;s the wrong stuff. The<br/>
&gt; instructions for sewing large <br/>
&gt; &gt; items say use a ruined bear pelt and an<br/>
&gt; appropriate pattern which <br/>
&gt; &gt; patterns would those be?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Finally, for now I was with someone who died the<br/>
&gt; other day and we <br/>
&gt; &gt; were haveing a lot of trouble finding her body so<br/>
&gt; she could get her <br/>
&gt; &gt; stuff back. After a while she said that someone<br/>
&gt; else had gotten the <br/>
&gt; &gt; stuff for her. How does this work? If I die and<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t find my body <br/>
&gt; &gt; how do I get my stuff back? How can I do this for<br/>
&gt; someone else?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks for any help ya&#39;ll can give,<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
