<br/>
Another question.<br/>
<br/>
I was on last night and ran into this dwarf who keep asking my half <br/>
elf ranger to see her Boobies/mellons (his exact terms) for which he <br/>
offered to pay me some gold. I said no thanks and ran off and he <br/>
didn&#39;t follow me.<br/>
<br/>
Has something like this happened to anyone else?<br/>
What is the correct response, what should I do, or did I handle it <br/>
right?<br/>
It bothered me but when I told the person I was grouping with they <br/>
just laughed it off, so I said no big deal and went on, but I&#39;m not <br/>
sure. Anyway, any advice?<br/>
<br/>
