<br/>
&lt;&lt; Is there an in-game chat channel for us?  If so,<br/>
what is it? If not, could we make one?  I think it<br/>
would be fun to chat with you all sometimes while we<br/>
play (battlespam allowing lol) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not aware of one other than the standard means of<br/>
communicating in game.<br/>
<br/>
Another problem I think is that some of us dont play<br/>
that actively anymore, and many that do are spread out<br/>
over a nubmer of servers.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve mentioned it before but I&#39;ll say it again that I<br/>
would love to get together with some people here in<br/>
game and chat, or maybe group a bit.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done a little gaming with nwn and although the<br/>
engine does not run smoothly on my computer one thing<br/>
I&#39;ve liked is that I have a regular group that I often<br/>
get together with on Friday evenings for a session.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve kind of thought that something similar here would<br/>
be cool. If anyone had characters that would already<br/>
match up that would be great, or I would be happy to<br/>
create a new toon on whatever server was agreeable and<br/>
try to set up a regular, or semi regular time that we<br/>
could get together and group.<br/>
<br/>
Right now I&#39;ve got a lvl 33 Wood Elf Ranger and a lvl<br/>
1 Iksar Shaman on Xygony, and a lvl 2 Half Elf Bard on<br/>
Chazic Thule (sp), but I&#39;m game for whatever if anyone<br/>
else has any interest.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>
Bran<br/>
