<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513730802">Hi Beth,<br/>
<br/>
I have been playing rpg&#39;s for almost 30 years.  I have been a computer<br/>
addict for about 15 years.  The two just seem to mesh so very well.  I<br/>
started online gaming with The Realm and moved to Meridian 59 where I met my<br/>
r/l best friend.  Hopefully he will soon have his computer up to speed and<br/>
will be joining me in EQ. Btw, he just turned 60.<br/>
<br/>
I come from a predominantly matriarchal family and the elder women have<br/>
always been strong role models.  My mother is 96 and still works full time<br/>
in her craft shop.  Nobody ever taught any of us that age was a limiting<br/>
factor. lol<br/>
<br/>
Now that I am disabled, and spend most of my time at home, I am very<br/>
thankful for worlds such as EQ.  EQ gives me contact with the outside world<br/>
that is beyond my limited r/l world.  I live in a very small community in<br/>
r/l so the larger one of EQ is very precious to me.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, happy news:  Kachine and Mondre were married in Rivervale, Bristlebane<br/>
on June 19th.   They are very happy and will be hosting a big party later so<br/>
all of their friends can help them celebrate their love.  They were to be<br/>
married July 10th but just couldn&#39;t wait so they eloped.  When the party<br/>
date has been set there will be an announcement here so that all of you who<br/>
are on Bristlebane or just want to come visit Bristlebane, can come have<br/>
some fun with them.   There will be some games and lots of food and drink.<br/>
Get those alcohol tolerance skills up for the drunken relay races. hehe<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Beth, for asking about my experiences with gaming.  I wish more<br/>
of my generation would give it a try.  I think it is a great stress reliever<br/>
and such a wonderful opportunity for expanding ones world.<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting and stay safe,<br/>
Janice<br/>

&gt; &gt;By the way, regarding the subject of &quot;older women&quot; playing EQ, I bet I am<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;one of oldest.  I will be 49 next month.  Not that it matters.   Maybe it<br/>
&gt; &gt;will give some of you young gals hope that there IS fun after 40.  Boy,<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; &gt;there ever fun after 40.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s great!  You&#39;re certainly on the tip of the demographic curve for<br/>
&gt; computer games.  How did you happen to start playing Everquest?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; By the way, I&#39;m 35.  My mother is over 60, and she plays some computer<br/>
&gt; games.  She has a Macintosh, though, so I can&#39;t introduce her to<br/>
Everquest.<br/>
