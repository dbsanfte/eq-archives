<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071840324"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Does anyone else feel this?  Is it just the people I&#39;ve been hanging out<br/>
&gt; with lately being more &quot;thing&quot; than &quot;people&quot; oriented and I should go<br/>
&gt; find some new friends?  Or is it that not being the target market of the<br/>
&gt; game I just don&#39;t get it and getting the coolest things is really what<br/>
&gt; the game is about?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Things are getting to be more Thing wise.  But I play doing the weekday<br/>
mornings and really don&#39;t see that much.  Well beside folks camping the<br/>
Orc&#39;s in EC for the belts.  Not just the levels they where made for but<br/>
higher levels wanting to twink here low level char.  <br/>
<br/>
But when the find out that someone who the orcs where made for they have<br/>
helped me to get a few belts and watch out over me. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; At any rate, my disatisfaction toward EQ of late has been profound.<br/>
&gt; Profound enough that I can&#39;t bring myself to log back in.  And I really<br/>
&gt; think it is that they tweaked the game for the worse, starting with the<br/>
&gt; addition of class specific armor and weaponry.  Suddenly it&#39;s all about<br/>
&gt; &quot;stuff&quot;.  Or was it always and I just missed the point?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well Crushbone is like that, everyone wants that shiny shield or the<br/>
screaming mace.  And I guess Highpass is like that too, for that shield<br/>
the gnoll drops.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; More importantly, if there were an RP style game tweaked more toward<br/>
&gt; people than things, would you play it?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sure would.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If the game gave points for  storyline and sometimes favored the underdog (letting the least equipped defeat the most equipped like a David and Goliath kind of story) and promoted group dynamics with more &quot;realistic&quot; story effects - would that be of any interest?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would have to see what the plot was about, but sure if it caught my<br/>
eye I would give it a try.<br/>
