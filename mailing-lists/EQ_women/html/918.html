<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014866686">(No time to chat.  Just had these ideas while making dinner.  Have<br/>
a class tonight.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We are a sisterhood.  Only women may join.  If we find out that a<br/>
man has joined, he will be deguilded. (And trained.  Just kidding.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyone can &quot;serve and protect&quot; but not to the degree that women are<br/>
capable of.  We vow to cover for each other when someone hears a<br/>
THUMP from in the playroom.  We vow to tutor each others youngsters<br/>
in the ways of the game.  When they are 18, they must seek their<br/>
own guilds.  We vow to watch our sisters&#39; backs when they smell<br/>
smoke in the kitchen.  We vow to be there for each other when<br/>
someone needs to talk.  We vow to never leave a comrade&#39;s body<br/>
unrezzed or unobtainable.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, this is only a game.  We vow not to take it so seriously<br/>
our egos could be threatened.  Raids are not mandatory.  We will<br/>
set buffing schedules for those who need to solo early in the AM or<br/>
late at night.<br/>
<br/>
If you breathe a sigh of relief to see these vows, apply today at<br/>
our guild website.&lt;insert link&gt;<br/>

What did I forget?<br/>
<br/>
Someone see if the last name, Amazon, is available?<br/>
Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little<br/>
temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. <br/>
