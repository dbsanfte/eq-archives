<div id="ygrps-yiv-264275394">Server politics for me had to do with being a high level character, and<br/>
usually are only something that directly touches high level characters.<br/>
At high levels your focus shifts so instead of soloing, and hunting in<br/>
groups, you become more focussed on raids. These are coordinated<br/>
activities involving 12-40 people to achieve some common goal, like<br/>
killing a dragon. At this point, every server naturally develops politics,<br/>
which govern how people are or are not allowed to participate in these<br/>
raids, and when they can participate. With large groups of people all with<br/>
different desires, it&#39;s hard to come up with a common focus on what is<br/>
&quot;fair&quot;. This is politics, and it sucks and there is no point, which is why<br/>
I think it&#39;s best to just completely ignore it for your own happiness =)<br/>

&gt; A newbie question re server politics; what are they?  Are there different &#39;cultures&#39; on different servers?  Is this a guild thing?  Is there something I should look out for?  &lt;gulp&gt;<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve gone back to my old server to visit and that&#39;s nice, I always run<br/>
&gt; into some old friends who say hi and chat with me. There are people I<br/>
&gt; still care about on that old server. But, it seems like I have a barrier<br/>
&gt; that prevents me from playing there. I just know if I play there that<br/>
&gt; server politics will rear its ugly head again.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So for now I will power level my little enchanter on Tholuxe, and see what<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s like playing there. <br/>
