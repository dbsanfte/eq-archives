<div id="ygrps-yiv-964709000">Hi there!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Megan. I&#39;m a 30 year old woman who has been playing RPGs since she was 12. I started in the On-Line RPG world with Ultima Online a couple of years ago, but these days I only play that long enough to refresh my houses.<br/>
<br/>
I play on the Veeshan and Tunare servers. My major characters are (on Veeshan) Kiowa, a 17th level Paladin and (on Tunare) Shalka, an 11th level Shaman. As you can see, I like playing the characters that can help people and group well. (And I&#39;m currently looking for groups on both servers!)<br/>
<br/>
As for the recent flirting thread, I find it dangerous to encourage the flirting too much. Boys tend to take such things too seriously, which is fine if you take it seriously too, but if you, like me, aren&#39;t interested in guys more than 15 years on either side of your age it can be a real problem. especially when you start trading email. (which you need to do to keep a good group together.) <br/>
<br/>
I have also gotten the &quot;R U a girl in RL?&quot; question. It&#39;s irritating, but since I typically assume the other female characters on line are guys I can&#39;t really fault them for that. (or more accurately, It&#39;s sort of a schrodengers cat. Until I know for certain, they&#39;re both sexes. which means I don&#39;t attempt to girltalk them.)<br/>
<br/>
Well, I hope I didn&#39;t babble too long! I hope to see you all on-line!<br/>
