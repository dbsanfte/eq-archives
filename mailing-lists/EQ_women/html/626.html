<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154227936">Hello all<br/>
<br/>
Short intro - I&#39;m a 40 something woman (natch) sequestered in the Frozen North aka Ontario, and I just started playing EQ a few weeks ago.  Life as I knew it is over;  My time is now divided into EQ, and all that other stuff I have to take care of before I get back to EQ.  ^_^   This will wear off as the snow melts I hope, but now I understand why they call it &quot;Evercrack.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so new I squeak (just hit 5th level with my druid and monk last night), but one of the main attractions to me right now is exploration.  (I guess I&#39;m still in the gee whiz stage ^_^)  I don&#39;t know how the game will appear to me once I run out of places to explore.  I&#39;m going to try trades as well, and that will add another dimension, but I think at some point Verant may have to offer something new to keep the longer term players involved.  Expansion packs will fill the need for now, but eventually an overhaul of the graphics and terrain of the original world should be considered.  That might refresh things for people a bit.<br/>
<br/>
All this is, of course, in my extremely humble, low-level, can&#39;t-even-run-my-scared little-newbie-past-West Commons opinion.  ^_^  Who know what I&#39;ll be thinking when I&#39;m a veteran.<br/>
<br/>
cheers!<br/>

p.s.  At what point do your non-eq women friends start rebelling now that conversations invariably turn to the interesting and new way you found to die last night?<br/>

&gt; around a year, so long as I could get groups. EQ does not strike me <br/>
&gt; as a game I could easily play casually though, so I probably wouldn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; play fewer hours per week over a longer period.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think the decisive factor would be in-game; it&#39;s a miserable <br/>
&gt; occupation if you can&#39;t play as part of a group, so if it comes to <br/>
&gt; the point where my ranger cannot get into groups, it will probably be <br/>
&gt; time to move on. I suppose I might try another class, but I am not <br/>
&gt; that interested in doing so.<br/>
