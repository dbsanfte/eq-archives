<br/>
Those plat necklaces have about a 20% success rate.  In other words, you<br/>
need five black sapphires on average to make one.  I can try it for you<br/>
for sure, but can&#39;t guarantee success.<br/>
<br/>
Eboots, eboots, eboots.  Why not just camp them? I guess I don&#39;t know how<br/>
hard it is to camp eboots these days.  If you want I&#39;d be happy to help<br/>
you camp them some time.  I am not playing EQ much right now, but basicly<br/>
if you wanted to set up a time in email I can dutifully log in and help<br/>
out.  I&#39;m pretty sure one full group of level 50+ people would be<br/>
sufficient.  You + me + sylvanar would be a good start.  Ideally bring<br/>
along as few people as possible who actually need boots, you know how it<br/>
goes =) <br/>

&gt; Oh, Luna - thanks for the reminder...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Look me up in game if you have a few million spare moments please.  I have TWO black saphires ;-)  Saw the black saphire necklace selling for 7K.  If I could sell two I could afford the ever elusive Eboots.  Of course, as soon as I get them, vermiculite boots will drop in Fear and I&#39;ll win the roll, but such seems to be the nature of life, both in Norrath and elsewhere.<br/>

&gt;   I was a master smith and a grandmaster jewler, here is some of the stuff<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;ve learned.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Tailoring is a great starter skill, it requires little investment to make<br/>
&gt;   patchwork armor.  However, if you want to continue on to high end stuff<br/>
&gt;   (reinforced leather, 10-slot bags) it requires considerable time and money<br/>
&gt;   investment.  You can make good newbie-level money doing tailoring in<br/>
&gt;   greater faydark.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Smithing requires about a 200pp investment to master (less if you are<br/>
&gt;   optimal).  Smithing I found to be very rewarding early on in my server&#39;s<br/>
&gt;   life, there were lots of tanks who wanted armor.  For various reasons<br/>
&gt;   though, it can get boring.  To make small or large armor you have to<br/>
&gt;   travel a lot to get your molds and metals and such.  To make medium armor,<br/>
&gt;   you can do it in freeport, where all the materials are fairly available.<br/>
&gt;   Smithing is quite enjoyable I found though eventually it becomes tedious.<br/>
&gt;   You can make good low level money smithing in freeport or greater fay.<br/>
&gt;   This will probably work best if you are level 20 or under as you will be<br/>
&gt;   able to hunt in the near vicinity to freeport where people who will want<br/>
&gt;   your wares will hang out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Oh I almost forgot, smiths can make weapons now.  They couldn&#39;t when I<br/>
&gt;   smithed.  I don&#39;t get the impression that forged weapons are a<br/>
&gt;   very competitive business though.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Baking and brewing are both more &#39;fun&#39; trades.  All the skilled bakers and<br/>
&gt;   brewers I know are druids, which makes sense because getting your goods<br/>
&gt;   requires a lot of travel.  These two skills require little investment to<br/>
&gt;   start, but a lot of work and travel to master.  These are nice because you<br/>
&gt;   can give people alcohol or food, I still remember with joy the day my<br/>
&gt;   druid friend gave me chocolate! You won&#39;t make money doing this.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Jewlery is one of the few trades you can make serious money in but it is<br/>
&gt;   also fairly competitive.  In order to make money in jewelcraft you usually<br/>
&gt;   need a sizible investment.  Maxing your jewelcraft to 200 will cost<br/>
&gt;   several thousand plat.  On the other hand, 50pp will get you able to make<br/>
&gt;   some jewelry.  If you are not an enchanter you will have to pay to get<br/>
&gt;   your metal bars enchanted which is a pain.  If you have a close enchanter<br/>
&gt;   friend you could do ok though =)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Alchemy is shaman only and you have to be fairly high level to do it.<br/>
&gt;   Shrink and SOW potions are pretty cool though, but they require a sizible<br/>
&gt;   investment (thus the high level).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
