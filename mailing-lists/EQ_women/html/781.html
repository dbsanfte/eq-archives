<div id="ygrps-yiv-1218718345">These sorts of things happen online. You can try and pursue the matter <br/>
further to try and get this person in trouble, but it&#39;s rather hard to get <br/>
a complaint to result in actual punishment. Unless you are seriously <br/>
offended and upset by comments like this online, it&#39;s probably best just <br/>
to ignore the teenager in question. Remember, you can ignore anyone with <br/>
the following command:<br/>
<br/>
/ignore name<br/>
<br/>
When someone is on ignore, you can&#39;t hear anything they say.<br/>

&gt; Another question.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was on last night and ran into this dwarf who keep asking my half <br/>
&gt; elf ranger to see her Boobies/mellons (his exact terms) for which he <br/>
&gt; offered to pay me some gold. I said no thanks and ran off and he <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t follow me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Has something like this happened to anyone else?<br/>
&gt; What is the correct response, what should I do, or did I handle it <br/>
&gt; right?<br/>
&gt; It bothered me but when I told the person I was grouping with they <br/>
&gt; just laughed it off, so I said no big deal and went on, but I&#39;m not <br/>
&gt; sure. Anyway, any advice?<br/>
