<br/>
Thanks for the note. I&#39;ve got most of the stuff for<br/>
the tunic back together. Still need to find that<br/>
pristine dragon scale though.<br/>
<br/>
If the Misty Thicket one is much harder than finding<br/>
this one I&#39;m either very unlucky, or I feel for anyone<br/>
trying it. I have searched and searched, I have no<br/>
idea how many Forest Draklings I&#39;ve killed but at<br/>
least several dozen and I have yet to come across a<br/>
single Pristine scale except for the one I bought from<br/>
someone else and then lost.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good to know that it&#39;s a no fail task, but I&#39;m<br/>
not sure what you mean by the level being &lt;=20. Does<br/>
that mean if my sewing skill goes above 20 I can&#39;t<br/>
make it any more? It&#39;s 19 now.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kind of funny thinking about it since apparently<br/>
I managed to find a way to fail the no fail quest.<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for all your help.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; the sewing/smithing levels for all newbie armor is<br/>
&gt; &lt;=20 but its also No Fail, which means you&#39;ll always<br/>
&gt; suceed in your attempts at creating newbie armor. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Misty Thicket is the newbie zone for the Halflings<br/>
&gt; they have a different type of drakling that they<br/>
&gt; need scales from and only spawn every 30 minns and<br/>
&gt; theres only about a 25% chance that the draklings<br/>
&gt; will even have a scale let alone one of the 3<br/>
&gt; different special types that you need, plus their<br/>
&gt; pristine scales (the very rare drop off this rare<br/>
&gt; spawn) is no drop so its much much harder to get the<br/>
&gt; newbie tunics for rangers and rogues over there. So<br/>
&gt; far I&#39;ve done just about all the newbie armor quests<br/>
&gt; for almost every race/class combo so if anyone has<br/>
&gt; questions just let me know.<br/>
