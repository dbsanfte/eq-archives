<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-176164036">Master Tarker Blazetoss invites you to attend the wedding of his<br/>
apprentice Dnaice with Corellon.  The wedding will take place on the<br/>
Quellious server Sunday, Aug.7 at 5 PM Pacifc, 8 PM Eastern Daylight<br/>
time at the Temple of Marr in North Freeport.<br/>

I am Dnaice, a high elf wizard on Quellious server and, occasionally,<br/>
Trisango a human cleric on Brell Serilis.  My love, Corellon and I met<br/>
in  Norrath and know absolutely nothing about one another on any<br/>
dimension outside of Norrath which, we feel, makes this romance and<br/>
wedding extremely special.  Our tale, which I must complete today, is<br/>
posted on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://longroad.mpog.com">http://longroad.mpog.com</a> under Tales/ Dnaice&#39;s Tale.<br/>
<br/>
Tigeress and Swiftlion, who were wed last weekend will be in<br/>
attendance.  I was priveleged to see their wedding and it was most<br/>
spectacular.  If you have never attended one, you must come.  It is a<br/>
grand and glorious spectacle.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to getting to know other women who play, particularly<br/>
roleplay.  I would dearly love to create an all female hunting party.  I<br/>
just meet very few female tanks *smile*.<br/>
