<div id="ygrps-yiv-503190031">Greetings everyone!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;ooc&gt;<br/>
Well it seems I may have spoken just a bit too soon, lol! <br/>
 Yesterday I wrote that I expected to have to face the <br/>
honeymoon roleplay eventually.  Well, it seems eventually <br/>
is coming sooner than I thought! &lt;g&gt;  Ok, ok, I&#39;ll spit <br/>
it out. :-)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;ic&gt;<br/>
Last night Rezok proposed to me ... and I accepted!! :-) <br/>
 Isn&#39;t it thrilling?! &lt;claps her hands in excitement&gt;  <br/>
We&#39;ve not set a date or ironed out any plans yet.  I <br/>
think I was just too excited being *betrothed* to think <br/>
clearly on all the details.  And oh! there&#39;s so many <br/>
details. &lt;mind races&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It was sooooo romantic.  He secretly planned to have two <br/>
of our closest friends there to witness.  And then he <br/>
recited a beautiful poem to me ... the last line of which <br/>
was &quot;Will you marry me, we&#39;d make quite a pair&quot;.  I sat <br/>
stunned for a moment, then blurted out &quot;Really?&quot; (what a <br/>
fool I felt later).  It took me some doing to find my <br/>
voice and answer &quot;YES&quot; ... poor fellow had to sit there <br/>
and wait while I got my brain to working again. &lt;s&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I could ramble on and on ... so I&#39;ll spare you <br/>
all. :-)  Once we have the wedding details ironed out, I <br/>
shall let you all know ... for of course, you&#39;re all <br/>
invited. &lt;s&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Safe travels,<br/>
Wynsong<br/>
<br/>
P.S. - Dnaice, I shall try very hard to attend your <br/>
wedding. :-)<br/>
<br/>

that ... an illusion ~~~<br/>

&gt;It is so interesting to read one another&#39;s experiences.  We are starting <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to talk a bit more<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;about RL, he has a Golden Retriever, lives in VA, etc.  He knows <br/>

 </span></blockquote>disappers and his brain<br/>

 </span></blockquote>doesn&#39;t have &quot;regular&quot;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Okay, I&#39;m neurotic.  I&#39;m afraid if he finds out I&#39;m a married mother <br/>
 </span></blockquote>of 2 he might lose<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;interest and he is the most fun part of the game.  *sigh*  This is <br/>
 </span></blockquote>worse then RL.  Oh, and as<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;for the toilets, I noticed their lack when I got drunk and needed <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to throw up.  There was no<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;place to puke!  Very embarassing.  And as my aclohol level is 3, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the wedding party itself may<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;be a disaster.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The honeymoon will definitely be PG.  I sort of view this is my equivalent <br/>

&gt;&gt; You bring up a bridge that I know I will have to cross eventually <br/>
 </span></blockquote>as well.  My character,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>the rp &quot;relationship&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; I set some expectations that the relationship was rp-only ... which <br/>
 </span></blockquote>his response was &quot;of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; course&quot;  (what a relief that was).  I felt stupid bringing it up <br/>
 </span></blockquote>at all, but after some<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; experiences in Realm where ppl wanted the char&#39;s relationship to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>spill over to the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; players, I learned to speak up front to avoid sticky situations <br/>
 </span></blockquote>later.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; As for the honeymoon ... you can rp that any way you wish.  It <br/>
 </span></blockquote>depends upon what &quot;rating&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &lt;g&gt; you want that portion of the rp to be.  It can simply be the <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; the honeymoon suite and then chat about the weather while everyone <br/>
 </span></blockquote>accepts that it&#39;s the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; wedding night.  You could decide to go on a trip to a &quot;romantic&quot; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>spot in Norrath and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; hunt, explore, etc.  Or if you wish, you could take the roleplay <br/>
 </span></blockquote>further ....   To me,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; the roleplaying is about how the character(s) is perceived in Norrath. <br/>
 </span></blockquote> So that doesn&#39;t<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; mean I have to roleplay every single detail.  Heck, we don&#39;t roleplay <br/>
 </span></blockquote>going to the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; bathroom or showering or any of the hundreds of mundane (or not <br/>
 </span></blockquote>so mundane) personal<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; things we do irl.  Personally, my honeymoon will probably be rated <br/>
 </span></blockquote>pg to pg-13 &lt;g&gt; ...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Disney would prolly be able to put it in one of their movies, lol. <br/>
 </span></blockquote> But the concept of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; honeymoon will be there<br/>
&gt;&gt; for everyone (us, friends, &quot;family&quot;) ... and that&#39;s the important <br/>
 </span></blockquote>part.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; As a side note ... I did have a marriage on Realm and while the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>characters were<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; roleplaying their &quot;true love&quot; for the world ... the other player <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and I would be /t&#39;ing<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; each other chatting about all kinds of &lt;ic&gt; and &lt;ooc&gt; stuff.  When <br/>
 </span></blockquote>it came time for the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; honeymoon, we retired to the bedroom while our friends partied <br/>
 </span></blockquote>in the next room ... and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; just joked around and chatted some more.  For the role play, we <br/>
 </span></blockquote>had gone to the marriage<br/>

 </span></blockquote>would complicate our<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; personal r/l relationships.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Ok, well I&#39;ve rambled enough.  Thanks for putting up with it as <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought through my own<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Hey, btw ... I lost the date, time and place (and server) for your <br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; As my character is marrying on Sunday I must confess to a few <br/>
 </span></blockquote>minor qualms.  In<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &gt; particular, er, how does one roleplay a honeymoon *smile*.  Unlike <br/>
 </span></blockquote>many who<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &gt; develop relationships in Norrath, my beloved and I are unknown <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to one another in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &gt; RL.  For all I know he weighs 300 pounds, guzzles beer, and is <br/>
 </span></blockquote>hygenically<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &gt; challenged *smile*<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; There are times if I wonder if this is a positive thing to be <br/>
 </span></blockquote>doing.  I mean,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &gt; what if he is some starry eyed adolescent and I ruin him for <br/>
 </span></blockquote>life *grin*.  I know<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &gt; MY lines are clearly drawn in fuzz (okay, I think I know the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>difference between<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &gt; reality and fantasy though I swear I saw a Pixie Trickster in <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the airport the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &gt; other day *grin*).<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Anyway, this is all fun and games and I am having fun.  But there <br/>
 </span></blockquote>is this part in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &gt; the back of my mind that wonders.  Because unlike reading romance <br/>
 </span></blockquote>novels (blech -<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &gt; persish the thought) there is another person involved in my little <br/>
 </span></blockquote>fantasy and I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &gt; must never forget that.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Any other hard core role players out there struggle with these <br/>
 </span></blockquote>ridiculous<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &gt; issues?  Any other players over the age of 25, for that matter <br/>
