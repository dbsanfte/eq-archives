<div id="ygrps-yiv-229387680">As my character is marrying on Sunday I must confess to a few minor qualms.  In<br/>
particular, er, how does one roleplay a honeymoon *smile*.  Unlike many who<br/>
develop relationships in Norrath, my beloved and I are unknown to one another in<br/>
RL.  For all I know he weighs 300 pounds, guzzles beer, and is hygenically<br/>
challenged *smile*<br/>
<br/>
There are times if I wonder if this is a positive thing to be doing.  I mean,<br/>
what if he is some starry eyed adolescent and I ruin him for life *grin*.  I know<br/>
MY lines are clearly drawn in fuzz (okay, I think I know the difference between<br/>
reality and fantasy though I swear I saw a Pixie Trickster in the airport the<br/>
other day *grin*).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this is all fun and games and I am having fun.  But there is this part in<br/>
the back of my mind that wonders.  Because unlike reading romance novels (blech -<br/>
persish the thought) there is another person involved in my little fantasy and I<br/>
must never forget that.<br/>
<br/>
Any other hard core role players out there struggle with these ridiculous<br/>
issues?  Any other players over the age of 25, for that matter *smile*<br/>
