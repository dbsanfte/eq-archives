<div id="ygrps-yiv-1129897203">Hello all!  I also am a working mother, I put in alot of hours at work and<br/>
then come home to take care of two children (12 and 9) not that they take<br/>
alot of babysitting, but it does get hetic at times.  I usually get settled<br/>
down around 9 or 10 to play.  I have had nights where I got off the game<br/>
just in time to jump in the shower for work (very long days). But the game<br/>
is so much fun I just can not help myself.  I am usually up by 4 in the<br/>
morning and that is the time I check my email and surf a bit for new<br/>
information on whatever.  I would not change it though because I have so<br/>
much fun on this game!<br/>

&gt; I play Sara, a 13th level ranger, on Povar.  I was gratified to find our<br/>
&gt; &quot;own&quot; spot!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am a working mother, so I don&#39;t get to play that often.  How does<br/>
&gt; everyone else manage?<br/>
