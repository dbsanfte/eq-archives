<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Sever politics hits when you get to higher 
levels.&nbsp; It has to do with scheduling raids, loot rules, etc.&nbsp; Once 
the server matures to a certain point there are more people wanting to go on 
raids than spots to accomodate them.&nbsp; On Brell it was at the point that 
guilds camped the boards to be the first person to sign up for the next raid 
right as the clock rolled over.&nbsp; Then there are cliques of people who won&#39;t 
play with people.&nbsp; There&#39;s fighting about loot (I think that is the worst - 
I HATE it so much).&nbsp; </font></div>

have formed friends and enemies and your reputation makes a HUGE difference 
(HUGE!!!!) in how you get to play.&nbsp; </font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>A newbie question re server politics; what are they?&nbsp; 
  Are there different &#39;cultures&#39; on different servers?&nbsp; Is this a guild 
  thing?&nbsp; Is there something I should look out for?&nbsp; 
  &lt;gulp&gt;<br><br>patti<br><br><br>I&#39;ve gone back to my old server to visit 
  and that&#39;s nice, I always run<br>into some old friends who say hi and chat 
  with me. There are people I<br>still care about on that old server. But, it 
  seems like I have a barrier<br>that prevents me from playing there. I just 
  know if I play there that<br>server politics will rear its ugly head 
  again.<br><br>So for now I will power level my little enchanter on Tholuxe, 
  and see what<br>it&#39;s like playing there.
