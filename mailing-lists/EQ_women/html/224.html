Had to speak up on this one.. I call test my home.. I&#39;ve always played there<br/>
and love helping out, making a new character to test whatever it is they are<br/>
requesting at the time.. giving feedback on new things.. that&#39;s what we&#39;re<br/>
there for.. but I totally disagree with what they have done to our server..<br/>
We have all had to kind of look over the races and work together.. teams may<br/>
consist of one for every race just because that&#39;s who&#39;s on.. it&#39;s the person<br/>
behind the character and not the race of character that&#39;s important to me..<br/>
I have many different races of characters myself.. so does that mean I&#39;d go<br/>
to war against myself?  no.. so all these new people have flocked to our<br/>
server and wrecked havoc.. they won&#39;t just let us play the game with all of<br/>
the (what I feel is) childish pranks.. bothering everyone..  it&#39;s totally<br/>
unfair the way they can do things to get you killed.. for instance, I had my<br/>
lvl 8 human cleric in Blackburrow, killing gnolls.. too many got on me at<br/>
once so I was heading toward zone (calling out a shout to warn others, of<br/>
course) then when I was just before zone I turned to try and kill at least<br/>
one.. there was an elf standing there and just as I was gonna zone he snared<br/>
me.. then just stood there and laughed out loud about it.. I gave him a few<br/>
choice words and got down to about 10 or so health when I finally broke free<br/>
and was able to zone.. he could have come up behind me and finished me off<br/>
with one hit and then looted my body of all coins and what ever one item he<br/>
wanted (they have turned this off right now on test but I&#39;m speaking as if<br/>
it was on the race war server).. now how is that a fair fight?  you have to<br/>
watch your back every single time you hunt or move?  who gets enjoyment out<br/>
of that?  I don&#39;t.. and I hope that those that do please move on to the race<br/>
war server when it goes live.. Oh btw he zoned with me and healed me after<br/>
we zoned.. then profusely apologized for what he&#39;d done, saying he hadn&#39;t<br/>
even attempted anything to another race and saw that &quot;opportunity&quot; and<br/>
couldn&#39;t pass it up.. heh.. I know test is just what it says, test.. but to<br/>
force this kind of thing on the people that have done nothing but helped you<br/>
out isn&#39;t the way to go.. they could have just opened the race war server<br/>
and let those that were into that sort of thing go there and test away!<br/>
It&#39;s an ever changing game anyway.. after all is said and done and these<br/>
other people move on to it, I just hope my friends come back to their<br/>
regular characters (who they put on a week vacation because of this) and we<br/>
can get on with what we&#39;ve been doing before.. my 4-5 copper worth, sorry<br/>
for the ramble..  there are many more examples of what they have done that<br/>
is totally crazy but I won&#39;t go into them all..<br/>
