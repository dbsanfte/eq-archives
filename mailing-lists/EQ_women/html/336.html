<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425319744">Hey Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
The time for the meeting has been set for Monday August 16th at 6pm PST in<br/>
East Freeport on Brell Serelis.<br/>
<br/>
The meeting is an opportunity for us all to meet eachother and chat.<br/>
You can either make a newbie character just to attend the meeting, or you<br/>
can use your existing Brell Serelis character.  While Evil races are not<br/>
allowed inside East Freeport, the newbie zone is not patrolled.<br/>
<br/>
My character Luna will be hosting the event, and you can send her a tell<br/>
if you have any questions.<br/>
<br/>
After the chat, there will be a subequent newbie hunt for any who are<br/>
interested.  This will be an opportunity to group and hunt together.  East<br/>
Freeport has an excellent newbie zone.  North Ro, which borders East<br/>
Freeport, has numerous creatures levels 1-4 for hunting.<br/>
<br/>
Please note the boat from Butcherblock takes about an hour in total travel<br/>
and waiting time, so be sure to boat early.<br/>
<br/>
I realize not everyone will be able to attend during this time, but this<br/>
was the best match available.  I&#39;ll try to have another event, and make<br/>
sure that it works with the time schedule of those who can&#39;t attend.<br/>
<br/>
