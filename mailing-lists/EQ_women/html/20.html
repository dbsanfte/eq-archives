<b>Subject:</b> Re: Women on EQ: Flirting <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-704782727">Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to jump in on this topic and introduce myself at the same time.  My <br/>
name is Mystyrain and Im a 17th (almost 18th) level Magician on Cazic-Thule.  <br/>
I have never found flirting to be a real problem, though there are some guys <br/>
that are extremely crass about it.  Most of them flirt in fun.<br/>
<br/>
I have been fairly lucky, I managed to find a wonderful Monk to concentrate <br/>
my &quot;serious&quot; flirting on and now we are engaged to be married.  There is <br/>
still a lot of non-serious flirting that goes on but everyone is pretty much <br/>
aware that Im taken now.  <br/>
<br/>
What i get a lot of is, &quot;Are you a girl IRL?&quot;.  As if that makes a <br/>
difference.  I always have to laugh at that one.  Some guys find it so hard <br/>
to believe that women actually LIKE these kinds of games too.<br/>
<br/>
In Light,<br/>
<br/>
