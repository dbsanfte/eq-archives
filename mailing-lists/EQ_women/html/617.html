<div id="ygrps-yiv-1958402705">After a little while, most especially if I&#39;m  grouped with them, the female characters who are really males, usually start to show signs of their true gender. There&#39;s usually lots of little things that give them away, especially once they relax into the routine of group fighting. Their sentence structure, the words they use, their attitudes towards other characters. And I use my instinct. If something sees &quot;off&quot; about a character, and I have the inclination (this is a game after all), I start to watch what they say closely.<br/>
<br/>
Not fool proof by any means. I&#39;m certain there are lots who i&#39;ve never suspected.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe because I&#39;m a writer who makes a living studying the communication differences between males and females, I see the signs start adding up. EQ is a communication-heavy game. Men and women have entirely different methods of communicating, so its only natural, that if you&#39;re looking for the signs, that&#39;s where they&#39;re going to give themselves away.<br/>

Just another $.02,<br/>
