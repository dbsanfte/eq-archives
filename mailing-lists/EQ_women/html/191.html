<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268489280">actually, EQ spells are more complex then you make them look... yes a spell <br/>
that said it uses evoc does use that skill, but there is also a hidden skill <br/>
with each spell... the more you use one spell the better you get with it, <br/>
not just the skill type... which i kind of like<br/>

&gt;Hey Lora!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think many of us have played pen-and-paper RPGs.  I&#39;ve also played RPGs <br/>
&gt;since I was 11 (starting with the original Basic D&D).  I actually ran an <br/>
&gt;RPG zine for a while, and wrote a module for Dungeon magazine.  I&#39;ve also <br/>
&gt;reviewed TSR/GURPS material prior to publication (translation: I knew a guy <br/>
&gt;who wrote for them, and I reviewed his manuscripts).  At one time I <br/>
&gt;seriously considered becoming a full time RPG writer, but then I saw my <br/>
&gt;friend who did it full time still lived with his parents, and I decided to <br/>
&gt;be a computer programmer instead 8)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My favorite pen and paper RPG is without a doubt Ars Magica.  I can&#39;t <br/>
&gt;figure out why it hasn&#39;t become the most popular RPG ever actully.  The <br/>
&gt;thing I like the most about it is its magic system, which ... well I won&#39;t <br/>
&gt;go into the whole thing but it&#39;s super cool.  Wait, here is a link which <br/>
&gt;describes it, so you can read about it if you want.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;What I really like about this system is that it is a two dimensional <br/>
&gt;system.  In Everquest, for example, a spell is an &#39;Evocation&#39; spell (and <br/>
&gt;you have an evocation skill).  In Ars Magica, if you wanted to throw <br/>
&gt;fireballs around you&#39;d have to train up &#39;Creo&#39; (create) and &#39;Ignem&#39; (fire). <br/>
&gt;  But, as a side benefit, you&#39;d also be better at extinguishing fire, and <br/>
&gt;creating water.  This makes for interesting and complex magical dynamics.<br/>
