<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542204294">Dear Friends,<br/>
<br/>
I received this email from another friend and wish to pass it along.<br/>
Please send it to women you care about.  You may save a life.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how true it is, if at all, but it is better to be safe than sorry.<br/>

Subject: PAGET&#39;S DISEASE OF THE NIPPLE<br/>
<br/>
Is a rare form of breast cancer, and is on the outside of the breast, on<br/>
<br/>
the nipple and areola.  It appeared as a rash which later became a lesion<br/>
with a  crusty outer edge. I would not have ever suspected it to be<br/>
breast cancer but it was. My nipple never seemed any different to me, but the<br/>
rash bothered me so went to my doctor for that. Sometimes it itched and was<br/>
sore, but other than that it didn&#39;t really bother me. It was just ugly and a<br/>
nuisance, and could not be cleared up with all the creams prescribed by<br/>
my doctor and dermatologist for the dermatitis on my eyes just prior to<br/>
this outbreak.They seemed a little concerned but did not warn me it could be<br/>
cancerous.Now I suspect there are not many women out there who know a lesion or<br/>
rash on the nipple or areola can be breast cancer.<br/>
<br/>
What are the symptoms? Mine started out as a single red pimple on the<br/>
areola.  One of the biggest problems with Paget&#39;s disease of the nipple<br/>
is that the symptoms appear to be harmless. It is frequently thought to be<br/>
a skin inflammation or infection, leading to unfortunate delays in<br/>
detection and care.<br/>
<br/>
   The symptoms include:<br/>
<br/>
   1. A persistent redness, oozing, and crusting of your nipple causing<br/>
       it to itch and burn. ( As I stated mine did not itch or burn much,<br/>
       and  had no oozing I was aware of, but it did have a crust along<br/>
       the outer edge on one side).<br/>
<br/>
   2. A sore on your nipple that will not heal. (Mine was on the areola<br/>
       area with a whitish thick looking area in center of nipple).<br/>
<br/>
   3. Usually only one nipple is affected.<br/>
<br/>
   How is it diagnosed?<br/>
<br/>
   Your doctor will do a physical exam and should suggest having a<br/>
    mammogram of both breasts done immediately.<br/>
<br/>
   Even though the redness, oozing and crusting closely resemble<br/>
dermatitis  (inflammation of the skin), your doctor should suspect cancer if the<br/>
sore   is only on one breast. Your doctor should order a biopsy of your sore<br/>
to   confirm what is going on. They will take a sample of your breast<br/>
tissue in   that area to test for cancer.<br/>
<br/>
   If the cancer is only in the nipple and not in the breast, your doctor<br/>
   may  recommend just removing the nipple and surrounding tissue or<br/>
suggest   radiation treatments. Had my doctor caught mine right away, instead<br/>
of   flaking it off as dermatitis, perhaps they could of saved my breast,<br/>
and   it wouldn&#39;t have gone to my lymph nodes.<br/>
<br/>
   This message should be taken seriously and passed on to as many of<br/>
your   friends as possible; it could save someone&#39;s life. My breast cancer<br/>
has   spread and metastasized to my bones after receiving mega doses of<br/>
   chemotherapy, 28 treatments of radiation and taking tamaxofin. If<br/>
this   had been diagnosed in the beginning as breast cancer and treated<br/>
right away,   perhaps it would not have spread...<br/>
<br/>
   I did try to spread the word through Rosie O&#39;Donnell show on breast<br/>
   cancer awareness, but it failed trigger importance enough to announce<br/>
on her   show last year. This is sad as woman are not aware of Paget&#39;s<br/>
disease. If by   passing this around on the e-mail, we can make others aware of it,<br/>
and it&#39;s   potential danger we are helping women everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
   Thanks for taking the time to share.</div>
