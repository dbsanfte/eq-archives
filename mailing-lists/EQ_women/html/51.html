<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439226720">I hate to say it, but I beleive that until you reach level 6, your corpse will <br/>
only stay there for 30 minutes.  Even though its not very much fun, I find it <br/>
good to stay near your city of origin until you hit level 6.  That is when you <br/>
begin to have a week to retrieve your corpse.  I have a level 2 human ranger <br/>
named Lanla on the Prexus server.  Perhaps if we are on at the same time we <br/>
can adventure together.<br/>

&gt;Hello Everyone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m Tbaald, only a level 3 Half-Elf Ranger on the Prexus Server. Ever need<br/>
&gt;a Tracker, give me a tell. Right now that&#39;s about all I can offer a group.<br/>
&gt;:) I&#39;m trying to make my way back to High Hold Pass to retrieve my corpse.<br/>
&gt;( I believe I have a week of real time while I&#39;m below Level 5 or 6. ) The<br/>
&gt;group I was with got separated from me while zoning and I subsequently had<br/>
&gt;no protectors when a Lion decided to take me out. I also had no one to loot<br/>
&gt;my corpse for me and bring back my stuff.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Looking forward to getting to know everyone here, and in the game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Tbaald<br/>
