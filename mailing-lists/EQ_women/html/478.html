<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947061752">I am living in Europe, the Netherlands. Didnt receive my copy either, <br/>
although I ordered the very first day. Yesterday I tried to call the 888 <br/>
number to check my order and guess what? Its a USA-only free of charge <br/>
number, not accessable from outside the USA.<br/>
Like with the GM hours and the downtimes (which is always during primetime <br/>
for Europe) this proves again that Varant totally ignores their European <br/>
customers. We pay as much as any of the others but we dont have any support <br/>
whatsoever.<br/>
I wonder if I will get my refund. I wonder if I get my CD.<br/>
I even wonder if it wont spoil my gamefun.<br/>

&gt;LOL, Rose.  I even went to Comp USA today, since it was to hit retail<br/>
&gt;shelves.  HAHAHAHA!!!  Nope, they haven&#39;t gotten THEIR order in either<br/>
&gt;;-(.  The good news is I FINALLY got all the way through to getting to<br/>
&gt;hold at the 800 number.  This after 3 days of calling, once getting<br/>
&gt;through to be told &quot;everyone will get their order&quot; and then hung up on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Oh, and just called.  They have no record of my order.  However, I<br/>
&gt;cannot order again because I&#39;ve already ordered and no, the shipping<br/>
&gt;company people can&#39;t do anything, I have to call Sony.  But, of course,<br/>
&gt;Sony can&#39;t do anything I have to call the shipping company.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry, this IS a rant.  I have had a lot of respect for Verant in the<br/>
&gt;past, but the way they have handled Kunark is totally and completely<br/>
&gt;unacceptable.  A valuable lesson in how NOT to handle customer support.<br/>
