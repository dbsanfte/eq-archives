<b>Subject:</b> getting back to college <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327907634">Maybe as my character gets higher level, and I get bored, I will<br/>
find it easy to get back to my paperwork.  I think half of bryn&#39;s<br/>
problem is that he can&#39;t refuse the games.  You ever see a man who<br/>
walks into the room when a TV is on?  It captivates his vision,<br/>
those flickering images.  Bryn needs to give up gaming in order to<br/>
succeed at college.  He was turned down for Drexel because of his<br/>
grades.<br/>
<br/>
But who am I to talk?  I made level 34 yesterday and chatted with a<br/>
woman in a potentially abusive relationship for almost an hour.  My<br/>
paperwork is piling up.<br/>
<br/>
Bryn plays Diablo most nights now.  Last night, he played EQ for<br/>
over 8 hours, but he got the last piece to his Epic.<br/>

____Hi, I just joined.  <br/>
____<br/>
____My sons got me started playing.  The two oldest are much higher<br/>
level <br/>
____and not on my server.  My character is Leerah on Quellious<br/>
because <br/>
____that&#39;s where some of my old D&D buddies were.  Level 33 wizard,<br/>
just <br/>
____started in October of 2002.  Two of my sons are lower level.<br/>
One <br/>
____doesn&#39;t play because of his cerebral palsy.<br/>
____<br/>
____I am looking for a girlfriend for my 18 yr old son who plays a<br/>
druid <br/>
____(57) on Karana.  He has unrealistic expectations for a<br/>
girlfriend and <br/>
____I figure he isn&#39;t gonna&#39; meet anyone with his nose in the<br/>
computer all <br/>
____the time.  He also plays Diablo3.  I bet there are no women on<br/>
there!<br/>

The people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.<br/>
That is easy.  All you have to do is tell them they are being<br/>
attacked and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and<br/>
exposing the country to danger.  It works the same in any country.<br/>
