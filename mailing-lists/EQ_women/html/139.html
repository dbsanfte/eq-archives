<div id="ygrps-yiv-204002257">I play a 31 wood elf warrior on the karana server.I<br/>
feel it is alot of fun being the center of attention...I stand and get<br/>
hit all the time and slash away at the badies while others heal me.<br/>
Getting buffs from the casters in the group really makes things<br/>
nice.Since I am the one protecting everybody i put my self in the<br/>
position and state of mind that .I am a mother protecting my<br/>
children.And it really gives me a nice feeling inside.Being a warrior<br/>
has been very satisfying for me.It is always nice to do things you<br/>
couldnt otherwise do in real life..I have always fantasized about being<br/>
a warrior in those dark days.And herein eq i can do just that. *giggles*<br/>
