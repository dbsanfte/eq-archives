Sara, Povar<br/>
And still looking forward to attending your wedding! I forgot to ask, where is it<br/>
going to be held at?<br/>

&gt; As my character is marrying on Sunday I must confess to a few minor qualms.  In<br/>
&gt; particular, er, how does one roleplay a honeymoon *smile*.  Unlike many who<br/>
&gt; develop relationships in Norrath, my beloved and I are unknown to one another in<br/>
&gt; RL.  For all I know he weighs 300 pounds, guzzles beer, and is hygenically<br/>
&gt; challenged *smile*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are times if I wonder if this is a positive thing to be doing.  I mean,<br/>
&gt; what if he is some starry eyed adolescent and I ruin him for life *grin*.  I know<br/>
&gt; MY lines are clearly drawn in fuzz (okay, I think I know the difference between<br/>
&gt; reality and fantasy though I swear I saw a Pixie Trickster in the airport the<br/>
&gt; other day *grin*).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, this is all fun and games and I am having fun.  But there is this part in<br/>
&gt; the back of my mind that wonders.  Because unlike reading romance novels (blech -<br/>
&gt; persish the thought) there is another person involved in my little fantasy and I<br/>
&gt; must never forget that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any other hard core role players out there struggle with these ridiculous<br/>
&gt; issues?  Any other players over the age of 25, for that matter *smile*<br/>
