<div id="ygrps-yiv-1212393504">Hahaha!  I&#39;ve been asked that several times as well and I have a great<br/>
answer for it.  I always say, &quot;are you blind?  Do I look like a boy to<br/>
you?&quot;  This response is in the context of my character who is, as I&#39;ve<br/>
said, a bard.  Genneth LOVES to tease and poke fun, so she makes<br/>
comments like this and uses ROFL all the time.  Then I usually give a<br/>
tell to say YES I AM a woman (note not girl) in real life.  And I go on<br/>
to explain that I&#39;ve been playing these kind of games since I was very<br/>
young.<br/>

&gt; Hello All,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wanted to jump in on this topic and introduce<br/>
&gt; myself at the same time.  My <br/>
&gt; name is Mystyrain and Im a 17th (almost 18th) level<br/>
&gt; Magician on Cazic-Thule.  <br/>
&gt; I have never found flirting to be a real problem,<br/>
&gt; though there are some guys <br/>
&gt; that are extremely crass about it.  Most of them<br/>
&gt; flirt in fun.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have been fairly lucky, I managed to find a<br/>
&gt; wonderful Monk to concentrate <br/>
&gt; my &quot;serious&quot; flirting on and now we are engaged to<br/>
&gt; be married.  There is <br/>
&gt; still a lot of non-serious flirting that goes on but<br/>
&gt; everyone is pretty much <br/>
&gt; aware that Im taken now.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What i get a lot of is, &quot;Are you a girl IRL?&quot;.  As<br/>
&gt; if that makes a <br/>
&gt; difference.  I always have to laugh at that one. <br/>
&gt; Some guys find it so hard <br/>
&gt; to believe that women actually LIKE these kinds of<br/>
&gt; games too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In Light,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mystyrain<br/>
