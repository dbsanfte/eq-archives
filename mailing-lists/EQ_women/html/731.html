<div id="ygrps-yiv-129835661">Currently out of game, but just bumped into an old old friend and it may just<br/>
be the little &quot;oomph&quot; I need to go get the last two upgrades and explore some<br/>
new territory.<br/>
<br/>
I have an new thread, though, because it is part of why I&#39;m also not playing<br/>
in DAoC.  I love to roleplay and have gotten my character into an engagement<br/>
to a Minstrel .  Well, the problem is the Minstrel is always on and as soon as<br/>
I log in he comes and spend the whole game with me, I never get to solo<br/>
anymore, I never get to group, and he&#39;s a horrible player so I end up doing<br/>
more dying than I can stand.  It&#39;s made me kind of not want to play, but I am<br/>
so bad at hurting people&#39;s feelings I don&#39;t know how to just say &quot;Um, mind if<br/>
I solo tonight?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Suggestions?  He started an alt so he wouldn&#39;t level without me and his alt is<br/>
now level 28.  I&#39;m feeling REALLY guilty.  I also have a lot more pity for<br/>
poor Sylvanar *giggles and waves to Josh*<br/>
