<div id="ygrps-yiv-981470607">Gobba, you should meet my friend, Gooba the ogre, on Povar.  He plays totally IN<br/>
character (&quot;Gooba smash! Gooba like woody lady! Gooba sawwy he hug woody lady so<br/>
hard&quot;).  Heh.  I role play a ranger with no sense of direction.  I have a friend<br/>
who roleplays a rogue with a sense of morality.  Another is a cleric who likes<br/>
to drink and gamble.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s what you make it, and I love it. =)<br/>

&gt; Hello all sisters...<br/>
&gt; Well, after playing a goodie-two-shoes cleric since I first got into the<br/>
&gt; game, I decided recently to check out how the other side lives and started a<br/>
&gt; female troll shadow knight. The swamp was a new experience alright, and so<br/>
&gt; was the famed troll regeneration (watch those HPs zoooom up!). But the<br/>
&gt; funniest thing was when I flirted with an ogre warrior in Grobb (some big<br/>
&gt; bad &#39;un with a last name). After all the recent discussion here on flirting<br/>
&gt; and females getting items, I decided to try out my trollie charms on this<br/>
&gt; ogre. All I did was to comment (in my well spoken troll dialect) on what a<br/>
&gt; fine basher he seemed to be and emote &quot;:bats her eyelashes at [player]&quot; and<br/>
&gt; all of a sudden I received 1 platinum! For a lvl 2 trollie SK, this was<br/>
&gt; indeed a fine gift... I guess trollie women have something to teach my<br/>
&gt; dwarven cleric when it comes to turning mens heads because my cleric never<br/>
&gt; received such a fine gift... :)<br/>
&gt; After this encounter, my trollie character is convinced she is indeed<br/>
&gt; attractive, but I doubt she will carry her flirting further than the<br/>
&gt; eyelashes at the moment. Still it&#39;s proof that it&#39;s not just the wood elves<br/>
&gt; that can make a killing by flirting... :) /em smiles fiercely<br/>
