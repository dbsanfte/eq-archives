<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565546429">I am really depressed about EQ right now.  My partner almost since I<br/>
began playing and in-game mate for most of my characters seems to have<br/>
decided not to play.  I wanted to settle onto Brell where I got involved<br/>
with a fun RPG guild.  He decided, after umpteen changes of characters,<br/>
in retrospect we changed everytime I started making friends outside the<br/>
partnership, that he didn&#39;t want to play on Brell anymore, and wanted to<br/>
go back to our original couple.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the loss has really taken its toll on my joy in EQ.  I have<br/>
another sometime partner romantically for one of my new characters (he<br/>
plays my &quot;sugar daddy&quot;) but now his RL is falling apart.  *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
My RL is TOTALLY stable, okay, so maybe that is why I look for a little<br/>
fun and romance in-game.  But, this is so much like the old days of<br/>
dating.  Anyway, I&#39;m drifting between characters right now, mostly<br/>
thinking Necromancer is my all time favorite class.  But as she was<br/>
formed with my partner, it&#39;s hard to separate them.  Just before we<br/>
split, she had moved from apprentice to journeyman and he asked her to<br/>
marry him at her second naming.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to ramble on.  Just needing someone to listen, I guess.  I&#39;m kind<br/>
of sad about it all.  And confused.<br/>

&gt; I just joined the mailing list and I am looking forward to meeting all<br/>

&gt; addicted women :)<br/>
