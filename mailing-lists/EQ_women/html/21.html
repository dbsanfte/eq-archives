<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265170040">Hiya!<br/>
<br/>
I was excited to see this list at onelist.. Gosh knows there aren&#39;t many of<br/>
us ladies around.. I even heard 80% of the female characters aren&#39;t really<br/>
female at all.. Anyone else heard this? hehe.. Just curious..<br/>
<br/>
I play on test server.. I have many different characters I&#39;ve tried out but<br/>
my main one is a Barb Shaman.. She&#39;s level 15.. It&#39;s the character I&#39;ve<br/>
liked the best so I&#39;ve been concentrating on her.. I am almost always with<br/>
Mosik, he&#39;s a Barb Warrior and it makes a very good duo.. the tank and the<br/>
spells work out well..<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just signed up here and read a couple of posts.. one mentioned<br/>
flirting.. I do get a lot of it at times.. I think there are even less<br/>
number of ladies on test may be why.. I can handle them fine tho and usually<br/>
end up making friends with many..  it&#39;s usually in fun.. there are so many<br/>
great folks there.. they&#39;re helpful and kind..  hope everyone else is having<br/>
that same kinda treatment..<br/>
<br/>
This is great to get a chance to know fellow lady EQ addicts.. hehe<br/>
