<div id="ygrps-yiv-1635910055"><div>I&#39;m 25 but pretend I&#39;m 21... have a kid,, and play on &quot;Quellious&quot; mostly grouped with my BF these days. I play Alexandrah, Alexis, Justene, and my new kitty Beverly. He plays Jaice (named after my cat that died recently but named it back when I got him), Nindara, Castour, Arminius, amoung others... </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I am a computer nerdie female but look like a house wife. I&#39;m returning to college next month or this month... haven&#39;t decided. I did &quot;Microcomputer Operations&quot; but returning for &quot;Computer Programming&quot;. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Don&#39;t feel bad... most of the time I think the people playing are pre-teens too. Which is why as of lately I&#39;ve stuck to friends and family members that play EQ. </div>

I also play EQ ~ PS2 as I <br>was involved in the beta on that one. <br><br>I often think the people I&#39;m grouped with are all 14 or 15 only to <br>find out that I&#39;m wrong and most of the group is my age let alone <br>there being a female in the bunch. <br><br>I too have built both of my PC&#39;s only because I couldnt really find <br>one that had what I wanted in it for less that and arm and a leg. <br>Nope not into tech in the real world, I&#39;m a full time Paramedic~ so <br>I guess that&#39;s why I save lives one day and kill the next =)<br><br>I play on Brell and Torvonnilous ~ anyone here play on those??<br><br>I look forward to grouping with some of you<br><br>Q<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your use of Yahoo!
