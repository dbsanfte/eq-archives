&lt;&lt; What I most love about the bard is that it is a really fun class to<br/>
 play..it has a complexity to it and your strategies change with each new<br/>
 level and new song.  It is always interesting and there&#39;s always something<br/>
 new to look forward to with the advancement of levels.  I really think that<br/>
 the bard is one of the most strategically complex classes in the game. &gt;&gt;<br/>
