<div id="ygrps-yiv-926218704">8D  i&#39;m very happy for you and your family!  hehe  you should&#39;ve played a <br/>
month or two ago when everyone at any lvl was running around with c3 and <br/>
aego hehe  i personally like it a lil tougher but i think you would&#39;ve liked <br/>
that...  then again, you might be tempted to quit again now that they&#39;ve <br/>
taken it away 8/  at any rate WB!!!  (and if anyone ever makes it out <br/>
towards Rallos Zek server, give Gizzi a tell and i&#39;ll come DMF ya or <br/>
something...)<br/>

&gt;Hello,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have been on this list for a very long time.. but not ever actually<br/>
&gt;posted.. mainly because I gave up playing eq for about 2 years or maybe<br/>
&gt;more... Just recently I tried it again though .. and wow!!! its nice<br/>
&gt;again!!! I gave up at lvl 54, somewhere along the line the game had changed<br/>
&gt;for me and I had lost the feeling I first had on being chased by a giant to<br/>
&gt;the bridge in the karanas.. I had started a few months after the game first<br/>
&gt;came out.. when they still announced when people made 50 and there were no<br/>
&gt;expansion packs. I had gained a new husband through the game and we had<br/>
&gt;decided we wanted to move on to other games (but no they were never as fun.<br/>
&gt;I tred daoc, Anarchy on line and went back to first person shooters.. but<br/>
&gt;nothing grabbed me..) Then I had a go on eqemu.. noticed verant were<br/>
&gt;offering me a free week on real eq . and .. went on line on my old server<br/>
&gt;Innouruuk again.. well that seemed much the same, and my characters were<br/>
&gt;all still there and that wouldnt have caught my attention. but then I<br/>
&gt;noticed there were some new Euro serevers so I tried the new server and<br/>
&gt;made a cat person.. (ooh . I had bought the luclin expansion and never<br/>
&gt;bothered to install it before..) and before you can say boo I loved it<br/>
&gt;again. and.. so many changes for the better!!!!! I became a froglock and<br/>
&gt;all my family have joined in .. the server is near empty and all the people<br/>
&gt;friendly . no loud arguments in ooc ..  we didn&#39;t have the awful horror of<br/>
&gt;corpse searching at low lvls so we have been runing around exploring and we<br/>
&gt;can easlily move from one newbie zone to another via pok.. Its great!!!!<br/>
&gt;Loads of new places to explore. and much much easier to play .. and the<br/>
&gt;atmosphere seems to have changed back to how it was.. with much<br/>
&gt;friendliness and many people willing to buff a small frog who croaks a<br/>
&gt;lot.. I don&#39;t know if the game has been destroyed for high end play as I<br/>
&gt;have no intention at this time of playing my enchanter and having to play<br/>
&gt;for hours on end and join in massive raids that keep me up all night.. nor<br/>
&gt;do I wish to hear endlessly about server politics and the best way to share<br/>
&gt;spawns and zones.. What I do want is what I have found, a family orientated<br/>
&gt;game (my partner, myself and my kids of 14 and 11 play as a group) where<br/>
&gt;all of us can lvl up together and explore zones, get the occasional heart<br/>
&gt;stopping scare as we walk through some dangerous cavern with beasts in it<br/>
&gt;we haven&#39;t seen before, chat in friendly way with people we meet and..<br/>
&gt;relax.. Verant appear to have made the low lvl game much much easier but at<br/>
&gt;the same time have enough areas where you haven&#39;t been before to make<br/>
&gt;exploring scary and fun. Mind you I would love a horse but that seems to be<br/>
&gt;something I would have to work to hard to get...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;anyway hello all :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
