<div id="ygrps-yiv-749154718">No support at all?  What the heck are they thinking!  <br/>
<br/>
I know I play doing the days and have a lot of folks from outside the <br/>
US to group with, and I hate those down times.  They don&#39;t even tell <br/>
us anymore when they are going to be.  *Rant Rant Rant*<br/>
<br/>
You would think with as many folks that play EQ they would get their<br/>
act together.<br/>
<br/>
Ok I&#39;m done now ranting.<br/>

&gt; I am living in Europe, the Netherlands. Didnt receive my copy either,<br/>
&gt; although I ordered the very first day. Yesterday I tried to call the 888<br/>
&gt; number to check my order and guess what? Its a USA-only free of charge<br/>
&gt; number, not accessable from outside the USA.<br/>
&gt; Like with the GM hours and the downtimes (which is always during primetime<br/>
&gt; for Europe) this proves again that Varant totally ignores their European<br/>
&gt; customers. We pay as much as any of the others but we dont have any support<br/>
&gt; whatsoever.<br/>
&gt; I wonder if I will get my refund. I wonder if I get my CD.<br/>
&gt; I even wonder if it wont spoil my gamefun.<br/>

&gt; &gt;LOL, Rose.  I even went to Comp USA today, since it was to hit retail<br/>
&gt; &gt;shelves.  HAHAHAHA!!!  Nope, they haven&#39;t gotten THEIR order in either<br/>
&gt; &gt;;-(.  The good news is I FINALLY got all the way through to getting to<br/>
&gt; &gt;hold at the 800 number.  This after 3 days of calling, once getting<br/>
&gt; &gt;through to be told &quot;everyone will get their order&quot; and then hung up on.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Oh, and just called.  They have no record of my order.  However, I<br/>
&gt; &gt;cannot order again because I&#39;ve already ordered and no, the shipping<br/>
&gt; &gt;company people can&#39;t do anything, I have to call Sony.  But, of course,<br/>
&gt; &gt;Sony can&#39;t do anything I have to call the shipping company.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Sorry, this IS a rant.  I have had a lot of respect for Verant in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;past, but the way they have handled Kunark is totally and completely<br/>
&gt; &gt;unacceptable.  A valuable lesson in how NOT to handle customer support.<br/>
