<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660055886">Well having actually joined a guild for DAoC RP, I am committed now.  Of<br/>
course, I was certain I&#39;d be switching as soon as I read about it and the<br/>
guild is filled with old EQ guildies and I&#39;m excited.  In fact, since<br/>
Highlander is one of the races (we&#39;re playing Albion) one of the other reasons<br/>
for starting a Shaman was to get into character a bit.  <br/>
<br/>
But, do tell... what did Verant say in the Brit mag that has you upset.  I do<br/>
love gossip (plus, I finished a chunk of work and am just waiting until time<br/>
to go home :-)<br/>
