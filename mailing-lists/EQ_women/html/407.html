<div id="ygrps-yiv-450423002">Thank you, Suzanne.  I have actually decided to postpone the nuptuals for a <br/>
bit longer so that I may prep better.  I think I have decided on the Arena.  <br/>
That way everyone can attend with little or no extra ooc talk.  O how I would <br/>
love to be able to wear a wedding dress *sigh* maybe someday they will <br/>
include that in the game and then I will have to renew my vows.  <br/>
