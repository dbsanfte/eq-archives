<b>Subject:</b> Re: balancing EQ with real life :) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243857143">The way my husband and I balance our EQ life and real life is that well.. we<br/>
both have a characters on EQ and have had for over a year but we made a pact<br/>
that we play together so our characters are close to the same level.  We<br/>
both like roleplaying and gaming so it helps.  However, we too spent too<br/>
much time on EQ and took a break for several months and became involved in<br/>
other things.  We then went back to it later and had even more fun.  We also<br/>
limit ourselves if we get to involved in it.  I think that EQ is very<br/>
addicting and it can ruin a relationship if someone is always on-line and<br/>
the other person has no interest in it at all. You have to balance your time<br/>
together and sometimes it means spending time doing things you may not<br/>
normally do.  You might create a character to play with him on-line and in<br/>
return he spends time doing a hobby you like, or just going to dinner,<br/>
movie, etc.  EQ is NOT the real world, and taking off from work to play is a<br/>
bit scary... but I can see how it can happen.  I hope you can find a<br/>
balance, it is difficult.<br/>

&gt; I was just wondering how you all balance playing EQ with real life<br/>
&gt; roles/duties.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not actually a EQ player myself, but my husband is.  Since he started<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; play EQ (over 6 months ago), we haven&#39;t done as much as we used to<br/>
together.<br/>
&gt; Before EQ he played Ultima Online but was able to log whenever he felt<br/>
like<br/>
&gt; it in that game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With EQ it seems like he has to be on longer to get anywhere in the game<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; he isn&#39;t able to log whenever he wants to.  He is a level 50 ranger and is<br/>
&gt; in the Plain of Fear a lot right now.  Due to the spawn rates he has to<br/>
stay<br/>
&gt; up late, and be online every day.  He even has taken off work periodically<br/>
&gt; to be in the game more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know a lot of the game just because it is mostly all of what we talk<br/>
about<br/>
&gt; right now.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I understand online role playing as I ran my own computer BBS for over 5<br/>
&gt; years.  I was an avid MUD/MUSH player myself for a while and did play<br/>
Ultima<br/>
&gt; Online for a bit too.   My husband and I actually meet on my BBS when I<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; on college dated for about 3 years and have been married 3 1/2 years.  We<br/>
&gt; are both avid computer game players.  Due to life/new hobbies/etc. I<br/>
haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; been in online games myself for the past 3 years.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I really don&#39;t mind him playing EQ as I know it is what he likes to do.<br/>
We<br/>
&gt; have an understanding that I let him play EQ and I spend my free time<br/>
doing<br/>
&gt; SCA (medieval re-inactment group) activities.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For Christmas all he wanted was anything EQ related.  He also tells me if<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; want to spend more time with him, that I should get a EQ account myself<br/>
(we<br/>
&gt; have a home network which would make this possible). :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was just wondering how others balance their life with their significant<br/>
&gt; others and EQ playing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Jen<br/>
