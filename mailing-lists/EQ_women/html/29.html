Oh yes, flirting seems to occur every now and then for my dwarven cleric,<br/>
though it is somewhat infrequent, probably due to my dwarven looks (or lack<br/>
there of :) Most people flirting with me seem to get into it after a few<br/>
rounds of conversation in character, so maybe I have more charms than my<br/>
charisma seems to show... Disa, my dwarven cleric, isn&#39;t really a flirt but<br/>
she does have somewhat of a weak spot for wood elves and especially gallant<br/>
behaviour. After being escorted by an ogre warrior across Antonica, she did<br/>
even develop a sweet spot for him! Disa is otherwise more into the grind of<br/>
battle and the healing and casting business, though she enjoys the verbal<br/>
sparring of flirting none the less if the opportunity presents itself.<br/>
The &quot; r u a girl in rl&quot; seems to happen less now than it used to... In beta<br/>
when I was a half elf ranger, I had several comments on my bust size... Now<br/>
my bust is about the same, but my legs are shorter so maybe that&#39;s why I<br/>
don&#39;t hear the wolf whistles :)<br/>
I haven&#39;t had any real problems with sexism, but I guess the /ignore has to<br/>
be good for something :)<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting to all sisters!<br/>
