<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147383534">I wrote this when Celedhros and I left EQ, for my best friend Cinae, who<br/>
remained behind.  I am still getting eMails from the multitude of people I<br/>
learned to care for in Norrath, and I hope to meet up with them again.  So,<br/>
in essence, this was for them, too..<br/>
<br/>
It may see the light of day on one of the Ranger boards, since both Cinae<br/>
and Celedhros have gently recommended it (nudges from loved ones have all<br/>
the subtlety of Sherman tanks at times, eh?), but I have no real confidence<br/>
in my doodlings and their appeal for the mass market.  I thought, however,<br/>
it might do some good here.<br/>
<br/>
In deference to Christina&#39;s wishes to not have attachments, I had two<br/>
choices:  I could either cut and paste, or I could put it on my board and<br/>
leave the option of whether anyone wanted to trace the link.  However, I am<br/>
learning to code by hand, without an editor, so my board is a mess right<br/>
now, and I didn&#39;t want company over for dinner til I had a chance to steam<br/>
the carpets, so to speak. &lt;grin&gt;  So here it is, and my apology if it<br/>
doesn&#39;t have anything of value in it for you.  I thought to share it with<br/>
everyone who lost people they cared about in Norrath to attrition,<br/>
frustration, or the various calls and responsibilities from the &#39;real<br/>
world&#39;.  I hope you enjoy.<br/>

    The party threatened to go on for days, but at the end of the second, it<br/>
finally wore down.  Sunset embraced a glade filled with the exhausted but<br/>
happy bodies of more than a score of seasoned adventurers, gathered to<br/>
celebrate the birthdays of two of their membership.  The celebrations were a<br/>
bit belated, as it was difficult to gather everyone from the far corners of<br/>
Norrath, but the well-wishes were nonetheless heartfelt, and the joy at<br/>
being all together to make merry in honor of the recipients was definitely<br/>
sincere.<br/>
     Those two had refrained from overindulging their senses on the fine<br/>
Elven wine and delicacies that had abounded; they had a long night ahead of<br/>
them, and their plans were not known to the rest.  They had watched their<br/>
friends with loving indulgence, and accepted the multitude of gifts<br/>
presented them with grave courtesy.  It was more difficult for the younger<br/>
to do so without giving their plans away.<br/>
     ┬ôThey look so happy,┬ö she murmured to her husband, linking her arm<br/>
through his.  ┬ôWhat will they think when they wake?  Why can┬Æt we just leave<br/>
them a note, so they won┬Æt worry?┬ö<br/>
     Her husband enfolded her in his arms and kissed the top of her head.<br/>
┬ôBecause they┬Æd insist on finding us, honey.  And they┬Æd be all the more<br/>
hurt that we didn┬Æt take them along, and would never understand that, in<br/>
spite of how much we┬Æve come to treasure their company, we have to do this<br/>
by ourselves.<br/>
     ┬ôAh┬à don┬Æt cry, my wonderful Ael┬à we┬Æll find them again, after we┬Æve<br/>
done this.┬ö  He hugged her tightly.  ┬ôI think, once they see what we took<br/>
with us, that they┬Æll understand and won┬Æt worry.  After all, they┬Æve been<br/>
such steady and loyal companions, they have to have known this day was going<br/>
to come to us, and being who we are, we had to do it.┬ö<br/>
     She nodded, the tears on her cheeks drying with the kiss of the evening<br/>
breeze.  ┬ôFirst and always Rangers, and I don┬Æt regret our decision, but it<br/>
tears my heart to leave without saying good-bye.┬ö She sighed heavily and<br/>
squeezed the hand that enfolded hers.<br/>
     ┬ôAnd mine, too.  But as Rangers, we have a duty to explore the lands,<br/>
and to scout out the evil that exists unseen, so that others may come after<br/>
and attend to that evil in ways better than we could.  And that means that<br/>
no matter how fair the company, nor how inviting the hunt that we know, we<br/>
are bound to go forward and seek the unknown.┬ö<br/>
     She rested her cheek on his shoulder for a time, gazing out at the<br/>
peacefully slumbering bodies of her friends.  They┬Æd earned their rest; each<br/>
and every one of them was a staunch fighter of Evil and true at heart, and<br/>
had done his or her share of struggling against the tide of darkness that<br/>
never fully receded.<br/>
     She turned her eyes to her husband, her mentor sent from Maesyn<br/>
Trueshot himself to ensure that one wayward little wood elf learned all she<br/>
could about the real meaning of being a Champion, after she fled his<br/>
Crafthall.  She smiled up at the stern countenance and into the twinkling<br/>
gray eyes that hid his real nature, behind the aloof exterior.  She closed<br/>
her eyes, then, and inhaled deeply, taking in the fragrance of trees and<br/>
grass and roses brought from Firiona Vie, across the water, and well oiled<br/>
weaponry and finely wrought leather, and everything that had become familiar<br/>
and dear to her.  She held it, committing it to memory, as she did the feel<br/>
of her axe handle, and the breeze lifting her hair, and the warmth and<br/>
strength of the hand that held hers.<br/>
     ┬ôWill we travel home first?┬ö She asked her husband, who shook his head.<br/>
<br/>
     ┬ôAs much as I long to see Kelethin once more, I don┬Æt think our resolve<br/>
would hold once we were in our beloved Faydark again.  No, honey, I think<br/>
it┬Æs best to leave from here, and it were best done quickly.┬ö<br/>
     She nodded sadly, and gave him a smile more sweet for its false<br/>
bravery.  They each attended to the last thing they had said they would do,<br/>
and hoisted their packs on their shoulders.  Her hand stole into his once<br/>
more.<br/>
     ┬ôI┬Æm scared,┬ö she whispered, and he squeezed again.<br/>
     ┬ôMe, too,┬ö he replied, ┬ôBut we┬Ære together, and we┬Æll be just fine.┬ö<br/>
He winked, and she giggled, and with exaggerated courtesy he gestured her<br/>
onward.  On feet that made no sound, they stole away from the glade and<br/>
their friends, and headed into the trees.  She paused at the edge of the<br/>
woods, and looked back at the land she┬Æd loved.<br/>
    ┬ôMaybe,┬ö she said wistfully, ┬ôWe┬Æll find a land that will let us really<br/>
be Rangers?┬ö<br/>
    Her husband smiled down at her once more.  ┬ôWe┬Æll never know until we<br/>
look, will we?  But legend has it that there are other worlds to explore,<br/>
and surely one of those will have a use for our skills┬à if those worlds<br/>
exist, my lovely wife, we┬Æll find them!┬öAnd he tugged her further into the<br/>
forest.  She followed, cheeks dimpling, eager for the chance to be exploring<br/>
again.<br/>
    If anyone had been awake to see, Celedhros C├╗thalion and Aelwesara<br/>
Vallarien C├╗thalion, formerly known as Sara of Kelethin, disappeared into a<br/>
nimbus of cool blue light that swallowed them whole and vanished, leaving no<br/>
trace.<br/>
┬½<br/>
     Cinae the enchantress awoke early, and for no apparent reason.  She<br/>
blinked, waiting for the strangeness to go away, but even when the sun rose<br/>
and began to warm the dew-laden grass, it didn┬Æt leave her.  She shivered,<br/>
and leaned into her husband Talzain┬Æs slumbering body for warmth, and looked<br/>
about the campsite.  It took a moment, but only a moment, since one who had<br/>
honed her analytical powers to a fine keenness to aid her in her magic used<br/>
those powers automatically and unconsciously.  Finally, she crept out of her<br/>
bedroll and padded over to the piles of birthday gifts that had been<br/>
presented to Celedhros and Aelwesara the night before.  She found what she<br/>
thought she would and sighed.  She reached down and picked up two small<br/>
items from the piles, tears beginning to glimmer in her eyes, and held them<br/>
to her breast.  After a moment, she could bear it no longer, and tiptoed<br/>
back to her husband┬Æs sleeping form.<br/>
     She woke him quietly then, and showed him what she┬Æd found, while tears<br/>
crept down her face.  He said not a word, and pulled her to him, and let her<br/>
cry, creating a magical shield around them that kept the others from hearing<br/>
her weeping and awakening in alarm.<br/>
     Often Talzain could be thought to be detached from the rest of the<br/>
world, for his great powers of concentration had enabled him to achieve far<br/>
higher levels of wizardry than his youth would seem to allow, at the price<br/>
of his portraying a certain stillness that was often misinterpreted as a<br/>
lack of compassion.  Nothing could be farther from the truth; and he and<br/>
Cinae had been handfasted from their childhood in Felwithe, and she was the<br/>
most important thing in his world.  He sought for the words to comfort her,<br/>
but found none.  So he held her, and waited.<br/>
     She finally subsided into occasional sniffles that drew a smile of<br/>
tenderness from her husband, who stroked her hair and murmured nonsense.<br/>
Eventually, she looked up and said, ┬ôYou know what this means.┬ö<br/>
     He nodded slowly.  ┬ôI trust they are nowhere to be found?┬ö<br/>
     She nodded.  ┬ôTheir packs are gone, and the feasting table is lighter<br/>
than it was when we left it last eve.  I know, because I tended it for quite<br/>
a while at the end, there.  Mostly bread and cheese are gone, and some<br/>
wine.  There is no sign of a struggle, and no blood on the ground.  It<br/>
appears they have left voluntarily, with the armor and weapons they have<br/>
carried for so long, rather than their new gifts.  Of course, I won┬Æt find a<br/>
trace of them if they don┬Æt want to be discovered; they are Rangers, after<br/>
all.  But there is no feeling of magic, and no sign of battle, and there are<br/>
these.┬ö She gestured with her chin at the things she held in her hands.<br/>
     He mused, absently rubbing his fingers together.  ┬ôIt seems safe to say<br/>
that they don┬Æt want to be found, then.  I don┬Æt completely understand why,<br/>
but then, I┬Æve never completely understood many of the crazy things they<br/>
did.┬ö He smiled reminiscently.  ┬ôI think this┬ù┬ôand he nodded at what she<br/>
held┬ù┬ôis the best indication of what they have done and their reasons behind<br/>
it.  I also don┬Æt think you should show these to the others.  I believe they<br/>
would probably be grateful to us if we just let them go.  I know it┬Æs hard<br/>
for you, my love, but you yourself said it was getting more difficult to<br/>
keep their concentration on setting up hunts.  Let them be true to their<br/>
nature, as we are to ours.  Things have a way of working themselves out, and<br/>
I doubt they┬Æve walked out of our lives forever.┬ö<br/>
     Cinae acquiesced, for she too doubted that the little wood elf who had<br/>
been her friend since they were both maidens would have left her, if she<br/>
hadn┬Æt anticipated one day finding her again.  She sighed, and wiped her<br/>
eyes, and prepared to face the others.  She was willing to buy her friends<br/>
whatever time they needed to do whatever it was they thought they needed to<br/>
do.  Wood elves!  She thought scathingly, but not seriously.  And Rangers<br/>
are the worst!<br/>
     She held her burden to her chest and hugged it for a moment, closing<br/>
her eyes and savoring her memories of two merry spirits, sallying forth to<br/>
conquer the world, parrying quips as they parried with their enemies, loving<br/>
fiercely and lightening hearts.  Then she opened one of her packs, and<br/>
consecrated two armor insignia of the Champions of the Faydark to her most<br/>
treasured hiding place, where they would remain until and unless they were<br/>
reclaimed.</div>
