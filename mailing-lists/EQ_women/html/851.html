<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-132137657">Salutations Beverly,<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about the slow response but things have been a<br/>
bit wierd lately around here and I am way, way, way<br/>
behind on my e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, wanted to throw in my welcome to you.<br/>
<br/>
I have been on EQ close to four months now and I&#39;m<br/>
afraid I&#39;m addicted. I mostly play on the Xegony<br/>
server where my more or less only remains the 33rd lvl<br/>
wood elf Ranger Brangvyne Nimloth &lt;Hand of Judgement&gt;.<br/>
Bran can be found on for at least a while most<br/>
evenings, where she likes to sit among the trees and<br/>
work on her fletching skills, or go kill giants to<br/>
make money to work on her fletching skills. I finally<br/>
trived oak last night and immediately went out and<br/>
ruined my first attempt at an oak bow. I also made my<br/>
first True Shot Bow last night. :o)<br/>
<br/>
I do have a lvl 2 half elf bard also named Brangvyne<br/>
on Cazic-Thule too although you can tell I obviously<br/>
don&#39;t get on her a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I do love to chat though and can talk about almost<br/>
anything EQ or not. If you ever see my on pst . . .<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m too little to group with you there, but I&#39;d be<br/>
happy to say hi.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>
Bran<br/>
<br/>
