<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113814535">Greetings fellow gamers!  It is nice to see that the stereotype of the <br/>
RPG fan is not always accurate!  We are not all nerdy teenage <br/>
boys with nothing better to do then role dice :)<br/>
<br/>
My main character is Aaldiana, a lvl 17 high elf cleric though she <br/>
does now have a little sister named Kina, who is a lvl 5 wood elf <br/>
bard.  Both of my characters are on the Bristlebane server.<br/>
<br/>
As for some recent topics:<br/>
For the most part, I am grouped with all males, both in game and <br/>
IRL.  My personality just tends to lead me to that.  I am an <br/>
outrageous flirt and have a great time doing it.  I do not however <br/>
use that to any kind of advantage, not intentionally anyway.  I just <br/>
RP and see where it leads.<br/>
<br/>
My husband does not care since it is only an RPG.  Both <br/>
characters do have SOs, though they are actually brother <br/>
characters of each other, so obviously the other player and I are <br/>
what mesh, and we have a great time doing it.  We also trade <br/>
emails all the time.  I can truly say that he is now one of my best <br/>
friends even though I&#39;ve never met him in person :)  We have been <br/>
playing together since Aaldiana was lvl 4.  We are lucky to not only <br/>
have found each other, but there are also two other guys that we <br/>
have always grouped with so we have a good steady group. I like to <br/>
joke that due to our frequent deaths, these guys have now seen me <br/>
dress more often then my husband.<br/>
<br/>
I am proud to be a founding member of a brand new guild, <br/>
HonorBound.  This guild is kind of a baby for me and I have had a <br/>
lot of fun in creating it with my new friends.  It has put a whole new <br/>
angle on the game too.  I look forward to seeing how this aspect <br/>
grows.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s enough babble for now.  I look forward to hearing more <br/>
from all of you!<br/>
<br/>
See ya online!<br/>
