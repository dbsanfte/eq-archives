<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101303081">Hi, I discovered your list today and I&#39;m thrilled that there actually other<br/>
women playing EQ.  I was beginning to get very lonesome for someone to<br/>
relate to regarding the game.  I play Mistre, a 20th level female half-elf<br/>
Ranger and I am also on Mithaniel Marr.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to reading the past letters here this week and would like to<br/>
say &quot;Greetings&quot; to everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Brenda<br/>
