<div id="ygrps-yiv-398416974">Hi, I just joined.  <br/>
<br/>
My sons got me started playing.  The two oldest are much higher level <br/>
and not on my server.  My character is Leerah on Quellious because <br/>
that&#39;s where some of my old D&D buddies were.  Level 33 wizard, just <br/>
started in October of 2002.  Two of my sons are lower level.  One <br/>
doesn&#39;t play because of his cerebral palsy.<br/>
<br/>
I am looking for a girlfriend for my 18 yr old son who plays a druid <br/>
(57) on Karana.  He has unrealistic expectations for a girlfriend and <br/>
I figure he isn&#39;t gonna&#39; meet anyone with his nose in the computer all <br/>
the time.  He also plays Diablo3.  I bet there are no women on there!<br/>
