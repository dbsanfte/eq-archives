<div id="ygrps-yiv-1818421212">I&#39;m sorry to hear that things arent working out and believe me I understand.  <br/>
I had someone that I had met in my 4th or 5th season that I began grouping <br/>
with on a regular basis and she and I even made dates and times to hook our <br/>
characters up.  I know it seems silly, but I really enjoyed this person.  I <br/>
dont keep many female friends and so to have one on EQ was fun.  One day she <br/>
just quit playing without warning and every now and then I run into someone <br/>
with the same race/class/face as her and cant help but hope its her and I <br/>
miss her.  Someone else that she and I grouped with saw her corpse in Unrest, <br/>
so it gives me hope that I may see her again and so she is still on my <br/>
friends list.  =(<br/>
