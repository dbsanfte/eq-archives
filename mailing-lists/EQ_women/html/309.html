You bring up a bridge that I know I will have to cross eventually as well.  My character,<br/>
Wynsong, is very serious about a high elf named Rezok on Fenin Ro.  OOC, I know very<br/>
little about the person behind the character save that he&#39;s male, a few years younger<br/>
than me, and married (his r/l wife plays a character that is like a big sister to<br/>
Wynsong).  Because I&#39;m very happily married in r/l, very soon into the rp &quot;relationship&quot;<br/>
I set some expectations that the relationship was rp-only ... which his response was &quot;of<br/>
course&quot;  (what a relief that was).  I felt stupid bringing it up at all, but after some<br/>
experiences in Realm where ppl wanted the char&#39;s relationship to spill over to the<br/>
players, I learned to speak up front to avoid sticky situations later.<br/>
<br/>
As for the honeymoon ... you can rp that any way you wish.  It depends upon what &quot;rating&quot;<br/>
&lt;g&gt; you want that portion of the rp to be.  It can simply be the two of you &quot;retire&quot; to<br/>
the honeymoon suite and then chat about the weather while everyone accepts that it&#39;s the<br/>
wedding night.  You could decide to go on a trip to a &quot;romantic&quot; spot in Norrath and<br/>
hunt, explore, etc.  Or if you wish, you could take the roleplay further ....   To me,<br/>
the roleplaying is about how the character(s) is perceived in Norrath.  So that doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean I have to roleplay every single detail.  Heck, we don&#39;t roleplay going to the<br/>
bathroom or showering or any of the hundreds of mundane (or not so mundane) personal<br/>
things we do irl.  Personally, my honeymoon will probably be rated pg to pg-13 &lt;g&gt; ...<br/>
Disney would prolly be able to put it in one of their movies, lol.  But the concept of<br/>
honeymoon will be there<br/>
for everyone (us, friends, &quot;family&quot;) ... and that&#39;s the important part.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note ... I did have a marriage on Realm and while the characters were<br/>
roleplaying their &quot;true love&quot; for the world ... the other player and I would be /t&#39;ing<br/>
each other chatting about all kinds of &lt;ic&gt; and &lt;ooc&gt; stuff.  When it came time for the<br/>
honeymoon, we retired to the bedroom while our friends partied in the next room ... and<br/>
just joked around and chatted some more.  For the role play, we had gone to the marriage<br/>
bed ... for us, the players, we had not crossed any lines that would complicate our<br/>
personal r/l relationships.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, well I&#39;ve rambled enough.  Thanks for putting up with it as I thought through my own<br/>
eventual situation.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, btw ... I lost the date, time and place (and server) for your wedding. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Safe travels,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; As my character is marrying on Sunday I must confess to a few minor qualms.  In<br/>
&gt; particular, er, how does one roleplay a honeymoon *smile*.  Unlike many who<br/>
&gt; develop relationships in Norrath, my beloved and I are unknown to one another in<br/>
&gt; RL.  For all I know he weighs 300 pounds, guzzles beer, and is hygenically<br/>
&gt; challenged *smile*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are times if I wonder if this is a positive thing to be doing.  I mean,<br/>
&gt; what if he is some starry eyed adolescent and I ruin him for life *grin*.  I know<br/>
&gt; MY lines are clearly drawn in fuzz (okay, I think I know the difference between<br/>
&gt; reality and fantasy though I swear I saw a Pixie Trickster in the airport the<br/>
&gt; other day *grin*).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, this is all fun and games and I am having fun.  But there is this part in<br/>
&gt; the back of my mind that wonders.  Because unlike reading romance novels (blech -<br/>
&gt; persish the thought) there is another person involved in my little fantasy and I<br/>
&gt; must never forget that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any other hard core role players out there struggle with these ridiculous<br/>
&gt; issues?  Any other players over the age of 25, for that matter *smile*<br/>
