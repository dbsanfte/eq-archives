<b>Subject:</b> Guys, New server (!), Guild <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132854482">New Server, Guild?<br/>
Just read the new news text.  A new (non-race war) server is up.  Brell<br/>
is also designated the alternate role-playing server.  IMHO a woman&#39;s<br/>
guild on an RP server sounds like a good thing.  Is Brell a candidate for<br/>
the guild?  Does it being designated RP bother anyone?  (I *do* RP but am<br/>
not a fanatic .. nor do I denigrate those who don&#39;t .. a syndrome I refer<br/>
to as the holier-than-thou-RP-er complex).<br/>
<br/>
Guild Comments (minor spoiler in this paragraph - but you will get the info<br/>
from hailing the right sister in-game).<br/>
While I like the Sisters of Erollisi concept ...<br/>
- be prepared to PvP, they wear the Purity belts and the Island is a regular<br/>
  camping/hunting spot for evil races and non-evil money grubbers of mid-<br/>
  teens and up.  I can&#39;t see being a sister and not defending one :)<br/>
- initial guild meetings should not be on the Isle.  The 20 minute wait for<br/>
the<br/>
  boat combined with the 30 minute corpse decay &lt; level 5 could be bad.  There<br/>
  are sharks at the dock .. and they rarely attack through the boat. <br/>
But I like the idea :)<br/>

Guys & EQ Graphics.<br/>
Well, the EQ Graphics are a bit of a family joke in our house.  Recently on<br/>
the <br/>
television, there was a rather (can we say it had to be silicone!) busty<br/>
hostess<br/>
on a tabloid type talk show that we saw while my husband was &quot;grazing&quot;.  She<br/>
was wearing a &quot;push-up&quot; bra, with a very skimpy mini-skirt shirt-dress which <br/>
had front buttons unbuttoned *almost* to her navel, push up cleavage well<br/>
displayed.<br/>
Bare long legs .... etc ...<br/>
<br/>
My daugher immediately said:<br/>
&quot;Hey now SHE belongs in EQ!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My husband prompty replied:<br/>
&quot;Well she&#39;s already wearing armor.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I couldn&#39;t even add a comment I was snickering so hard.  And this<br/>
comment <br/>
from the male!<br/>
