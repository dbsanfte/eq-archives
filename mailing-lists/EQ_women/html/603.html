<div id="ygrps-yiv-889917577">Hi, I have been reading off and on since the board began...despite<br/>
computer crashes, etc. My main character is on Lans T&#39;val Server, Lvl 20<br/>
Barbarian Shaman Deneyu Firnloch. Sorry, my other characters are on Eci<br/>
and The Seventh Hammer. I enjoy chatting when I can, but I work, raise 2<br/>
teenagers and care for older parents. My EQ playtime is my only spot of<br/>
R & R, so I hurry through the mail a lot. I started my characters at the<br/>
beginning of the game, and I still enjoy playing. Mainly, because I am<br/>
not rushing through my EQ life, trying to powerlevel, twinking or<br/>
rushing the storyline. Deneyu has finally earned her chainmail through<br/>
earnest efforts. She often will expend her whole mana reserves, healing<br/>
the needy adventurers that she meets.  She has too often, been placed in<br/>
jeopardy from less cautious hunting partners, so while Deneyu has made<br/>
many friends but perfers to hunt alone. Lately, she has been hunting in<br/>
the LavaStorm, but is happy to even just explore the environment around<br/>
her without worrying about kills. <br/>
	Sometimes I also play my level 17 High Elf Enchanter Yadienu on Eci or<br/>
my new baby lvl 12 Halfling Druid Whirlwinda on Seventh Hammer. While I<br/>
have other characters created, these are my most often played ones. If<br/>
you are on any of these servers let me know, I am always happy to meet<br/>
new folk. <br/>
                 Meet you on EQ.... <br/>
                                   Donna C.</div>
