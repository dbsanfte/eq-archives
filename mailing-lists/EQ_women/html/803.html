<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331262669">Basicly it&#39;s up to you to decide what is and is not acceptable in how you <br/>
interact with people in the game. You can create your own emotes in the <br/>
following way:<br/>
<br/>
/me slaps Joewoodelf<br/>
<br/>
That will make the game say<br/>
<br/>
Bangvyne slaps Joewoodelf<br/>
<br/>
There are no easy answers to personal interactions, you need to figure <br/>
that stuff out yourself. My advice is have fun and try to not <br/>
unnecessarily hurt people&#39;s feelings, while at the same time ensuring <br/>
people respect your boundaries.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; OK, thanks Christina.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been noticing a couple of things of late which<br/>
&gt; are probably not great mysteries to anyone here, but .<br/>
&gt; . .<br/>
&gt; One is that a lot of the females on EQ are male in rl.<br/>
&gt; Another is that once people start finding out your<br/>
&gt; female in rl the males start hanging around a lot<br/>
&gt; more.<br/>
&gt; :o)<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s kind of laughable sitting here thinking that it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; all a computer game, but I had two guys both wanting<br/>
&gt; to group with me last night but each didn&#39;t want the<br/>
&gt; other one around. The one I didn&#39;t group with kept<br/>
&gt; contacting me with messages trying to find out if I<br/>
&gt; was through with the other guy yet, and telling me how<br/>
&gt; he knew better places to go. I want go into all the<br/>
&gt; details, but I couldn&#39;t help but laugh.<br/>
&gt; :o)<br/>
&gt; OK, and the questions:<br/>
&gt; Is it normal for guys to start calling you &quot;babe&quot;<br/>
&gt; after you have grouped for a couple hours, and start<br/>
&gt; trying to use the /hug and /kiss command, or do I just<br/>
&gt; find all the &quot;good&quot; :o) ones? Is there a slap command,<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t think of that last night but I guess I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; have to check that one out.<br/>
&gt; :o)<br/>
&gt; If there is someone you have grouped with a couple<br/>
&gt; times and, well, they are kind of a looser, is there a<br/>
&gt; nice way to avoid them, not let them know if you are<br/>
&gt; online etc. without just telling them flat out? (By<br/>
&gt; looser I&#39;m saying this particular character is non<br/>
&gt; comunicative, a problem I don&#39;t have, and never seems<br/>
&gt; to understand me when they do communicate. They group<br/>
&gt; and then run off by themselves and die instead of<br/>
&gt; letting me come along and help, they are very quick<br/>
&gt; and whenever we, usually I, kill something they always<br/>
&gt; grab whatever it is carrying faster than I can. I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want to be rude, and I don&#39;t want to hurt<br/>
&gt; anyones feelings but I don&#39;t really want to group with<br/>
&gt; them either, because it&#39;s not fun.<br/>
&gt; The bad part is that they badgered me into agreeing to<br/>
&gt; meet them Sat to group. Yes, I&#39;m a wimp. Should I try<br/>
&gt; to sit down and have a heart to heart talk with them<br/>
&gt; about what they are doing wrong?<br/>
&gt; Suggestions please!<br/>
&gt; Not sure how to handle it and thought maybe someone<br/>
&gt; here might have been there and done that and could<br/>
&gt; pass on a bit of advice.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for listening anyway,<br/>
&gt; Hugs,<br/>
&gt; :o)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Say is it possible to get unmarried in EQ?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I mean suppose your &quot;spouse&quot; quits playing and you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; find interest elsewhere or somehting.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just curious.<br/>
