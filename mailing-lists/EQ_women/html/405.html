<b>Subject:</b> Solo xp for 35th level necro <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-439392120">Oh if you do have to solo and need good xp for your necro, I suggest you<br/>
try butcherblock.  Level 35 is actually really hard for a soloing necro,<br/>
especially with the recent nerfs to DOT spells.  In butcherblock however<br/>
there are a wide range of dwarven NPCs, some that will give very good xp<br/>
for your level.  You don&#39;t want to attack anything that isn&#39;t blue.  I<br/>
believe for example that south of the docks area there are some NPC<br/>
dwarven guards that should be blue to you, but I would strongly<br/>
recommend you get a SOW before trying them, I haven&#39;t fought them myself<br/>
and they might be really tough.<br/>
<br/>
Asking other level 40+ necros on your server should also help you find<br/>
good sources of xp.  Most people are happy to talk about where they got<br/>
their xp 5 levels ago or more.<br/>
