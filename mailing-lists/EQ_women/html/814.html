<br/>
You don&#39;t even want to know what I did last night with<br/>
that quest.<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
But maybe someone will get a laugh out of my<br/>
stupidity.<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
I finally got together all the things I needed for the<br/>
tunic. I never did find the forest drakling scale but<br/>
I found someone who had one and offered to sell it to<br/>
me and asked what I would give them. I told them that<br/>
I didn&#39;t have any idea what anything cost but would<br/>
pay them whatever the fair price was. They told me<br/>
that they used to get 50pp but that they would sell it<br/>
to me for 20pp and that to be nice they would let me<br/>
have it for 10pp if that was all I could afford. Well<br/>
I had the 20pp and I didn&#39;t want to take advantage of<br/>
anyone so I gave it to them. (Yes, I&#39;m a sucker)<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
Then I took all my stuff back to the Ranger guild<br/>
house and gave it to the Ranger who gave me the quest,<br/>
I forget the name. He took all the stuff, told me<br/>
thank you, and that was it. I didn&#39;t get anything, no<br/>
tunic, no exp., no nothing. I was so upset I didn&#39;t<br/>
know whether to laugh or cry . . .<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
So, after standing there for a long time kicking<br/>
myself I asked them for the quest all over again.<br/>
Oddly, this time they gave me the box to put<br/>
everything in and they also gave me a pattern for an<br/>
&quot;enchanted tunic&quot;? Not sure what that is all about as<br/>
there are not enough slots in the box to fit the stuff<br/>
and the tunic.<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I went back out and started gathering stuff<br/>
again. Still need to regain a couple items, including<br/>
that silly Forest Drakling Scale, but now I&#39;m paranoid<br/>
about the exact approach to take to not lose<br/>
everything again. Apparently, I did or said something<br/>
wrong last time.<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, live and learn I guess, but it certainly<br/>
didn&#39;t make me feel any better when I was telling<br/>
someone about the whole thing later and they told me I<br/>
had been ripped off on the price of the Forest<br/>
Drakling Scale . . . ouch!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just thought I&#39;d throw that out in case anyone<br/>
was interested at all.<br/>
<br/>
:o)<br/>

PS - I came across a master key in CB last night and I<br/>
have the two Orc eyes for the sword. For any more<br/>
experienced rangers out there, is there anything<br/>
special I need to do to give this to the Ranger in the<br/>
guild and actually get the sword instead of losing<br/>
that too.<br/>

&gt; LOL ... someone in guild was just complaining about<br/>
&gt; that earlier today :) ... they&#39;re a pain but, the<br/>
&gt; newbie armor quests are worth it in the long run :)<br/>
&gt; Have fun, and hunt safe ~<br/>

&gt; I never would have thought how much trouble it<br/>
&gt; can be to find a pristine forest drakling scale.<br/>
