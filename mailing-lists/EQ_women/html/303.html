<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798331632">Hi Brent,<br/>
<br/>
The EQ_women list is only for women to join and participate in.<br/>
<br/>
I will not enforce this rule in any way, because there is no point in<br/>
trying to enforce it--anyone can get around it.  I don&#39;t want to pretend<br/>
that this can be enforced, so I won&#39;t remove you from the list, or even<br/>
ask you to leave, I&#39;ll just say that that&#39;s the rule.<br/>
<br/>
Digests from the list are publicly readable from www.onelist.com.<br/>

&gt; Greetings, m&#39;ladies.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I recently happened to hear of your gatherings for discussion. I thought <br/>
&gt; I might ask if you would welcome a man, such as myself, to participate. <br/>
&gt; In my travels of the lands of Norrath, it often seems the women I <br/>
&gt; encounter are much more likely to have the wit and intelligence for a <br/>
&gt; good conversation. So, ladies, might I participate, or am I invading your <br/>
&gt; sanctuary away from us uncouth men? I certainly would not be offended if <br/>
&gt; you would prefer that I depart.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I await your decision, ladies.<br/>
