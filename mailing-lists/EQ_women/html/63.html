<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277919993">Just saying HI!<br/>
<br/>
actually i dont have alot of time to be social in game cuz my boyfriend is <br/>
way ahead of me (he has 2 charctes i have 6) and im always trying to catch <br/>
up so he can do more then babysit me :-)<br/>
<br/>
all my charcters are on the karana server (so i can change stuff between <br/>
them) and i play way too much, ecspecily now that schools out<br/>
<br/>
Mita level 8 gnome necromancer (necromancers rule :-) this is going to be my <br/>
new main charcter)<br/>
Ayeli Starphere level 22 gnome enchanter (enchanters get old)<br/>
Reyan level 16 dark elf cleric<br/>
Fudora level 10 human monk<br/>
Mylesia level 9 wood elf bard<br/>
Namawene level 4 high elf paladin<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and to talk about what some other people were saying... just cuz someones <br/>
rude or doesnt want to talk or mean doesnt mean they are really a guy :-)  <br/>
you should talk to Reyan sometime (is fun to be a mean dark elf).  /rude is <br/>
the best command in the game!!! (as long as its roleplay)<br/>
<br/>
