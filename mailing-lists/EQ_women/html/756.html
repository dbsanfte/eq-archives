<br/>
&lt;&lt; I would like to do this. I have just created a wiz<br/>
on the Cazic Thule server. If that&#39;s not convenient<br/>
let me know. Otherwise sure anywhere you wanna go is<br/>
fine with me. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Great! I don&#39;t think the server matters that much does<br/>
it? I&#39;m assuming that if I create a new character I<br/>
can put them on any of the servers more or less, so<br/>
this should be fine.<br/>
I could bring a ranger, or a cleric to support your<br/>
wizard. Any suggestion on the best combination? I can<br/>
see pluses to both.<br/>
<br/>
What race are you? It might be nice to start from the<br/>
same home base if we&#39;re going to start out together.<br/>
Also, what is the name of your character, so I can put<br/>
you on my friend list when I come on to help locate<br/>
you and start out? Finally, what is the day or days<br/>
and time or times that would work best for you to try<br/>
to get together and adventure?<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone else interested. I think it would be cool to<br/>
get together a group of three or four who could meet<br/>
and adventure together on a somewhat regular basis if<br/>
there are more interested.<br/>
Meanwhile when we can&#39;t get together I&#39;ll keep playing<br/>
Brangvyne as well and save the new character for when<br/>
we can.<br/>
<br/>
Also, just as a note on my play style, advancing is<br/>
nice but I&#39;m definately not a power gamer.<br/>
:o)<br/>
Along with the action I like to chat, explore, quest<br/>
and basically take time to learn how to do neat little<br/>
things like sew or make arrows in the game. And I&#39;m<br/>
still new to EQ so I&#39;m still learning a lot but I&#39;ve<br/>
found that for me it&#39;s more fun to adventure with<br/>
someone and I think having a regular traveling<br/>
companion or two would be neat.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, let me know the above questions and I&#39;ll see<br/>
about setting up a new character possibly as soon as<br/>
tonight if I hear back by then.<br/>
<br/>
:o)<br/>
