<b>Subject:</b> I&#39;m getting married! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1208339397">I never intended to get married in EQ, but somehow it has happened.  Luna<br/>
my 50th level enchanter will be marrying Duna a 45th level monk on Brell<br/>
Serelis. Details of the wedding have not been finalized, but it will<br/>
probably happen in about two weeks.  I&#39;ll try and post more information to<br/>
the list when I get it.  We may be married in the throne room of King<br/>
Tranix the fire giant, in which case attendence of the wedding would be<br/>
limited to those levels 40+.  We may have a more mundane wedding, in which<br/>
case I would like to invite everyone to attend.  I think a nice alternate<br/>
wedding spot would be the erollisi sisters island, only I&#39;m worried some<br/>
of the guests would be KOS =/ Nothing makes a wedding suck more than NPCs<br/>
trying to kill your friends.<br/>
