<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879145117">Hello, everyone... I stole Gwyk&#39;s subject line because I thought it was<br/>
appropriate to me, hehe...<br/>
<br/>
Well, it&#39;s been a month now since I&#39;ve stopped playing EQ, and really the only<br/>
thing I miss is the people.  I started playing in Beta 4, so that was over a<br/>
year ago, so maybe I just got burned out?  This is primarily information for<br/>
Judy, but might have a new perspective to offer my other fellow women gamers...<br/>
<br/>
I was a ranger the entire time, although I did try rolling up a couple of other<br/>
classes.  My heart just has always been with the AD&D ranger, and that&#39;s what I<br/>
wanted to play.  Well, I don&#39;t know how many others here play rangers, but there<br/>
gets to be a point where it just doesn&#39;t work well unless you have the right<br/>
combination party.  I won&#39;t go into the details, but suffice to say, if you&#39;re<br/>
curious, go to any of the ranger boards and you&#39;ll get an &#39;earful&#39; =P.<br/>
<br/>
I even re-rolled my ranger and started over, which (for someone who doesn&#39;t play<br/>
more than ten or fifteen hours a week) represented a huge investment of time.<br/>
Why?  Two reasons, one of which was I thought Aelwesara went better with my soon<br/>
to be last name than Sara. =P  And also, I had bought the &#39;agility&#39; lie, and<br/>
pumped all my stat points into agility for my first ranger... finding out later<br/>
that agility is no where NEAR the important stat Verant originally told us it<br/>
was.  But, you see, this was my primary, my only.  I know people advise not to<br/>
have just one character, but even with pencil-and-paper games, I liked to have<br/>
one character for a series of campaigns, build her a history, imbue her with a<br/>
strong personality, yada yada... so for me, I typically only have one high level<br/>
character at a time, and I become attached to her. &lt;blush&gt;  So I want her to<br/>
have all the advantages I can give her, and proper statistics distribution<br/>
seemed to be one.  As it turns out later, I was still wrong...<br/>
<br/>
But I could have kept playing my ranger, since I was fortunate to have a great<br/>
many friends, and I probably could have succeeded, although it would have been<br/>
largely due to their largesse and that of senior rangers who passed everything<br/>
they could down to me and Celedhros.  My partner (also a ranger) and I were very<br/>
knowledgeable players, really because we did a lot of research and reading and<br/>
listening and exploring and experimenting.  But I think my big problem was not<br/>
with the fact that my class changes drastically in its abilities at level 45,<br/>
causing such a change in paradigm that it was shocking; I think my problem was<br/>
with Verant&#39;s response to the player base concern over these changes.  Odd that<br/>
customer service played such a big decision in my desire to leave, but there it<br/>
is. &lt;snort&gt;  I mention this only because I know Judy was thinking of putting<br/>
something together, and I thought you might like that info... over thirty people<br/>
I  know of have quit over this issue.  That might not be a large number to<br/>
Verant yet, but those are the people I know of... what about the others?  And<br/>
more have stopped playing high-level rangers than any other class.  When a<br/>
strong percentage of clients say, &#39;Hey, that&#39;s not right&#39;, it might be better to<br/>
do more than give a token answer and let them struggle...<br/>
<br/>
I, too, suffered watching my server Povar turn into a miniDiablo server.  I&#39;ve<br/>
politely told people, &quot;Nay, I do not have the Spirit of the Wolf yet&quot; (rangers<br/>
don&#39;t get it til level 39) and had them cuss me out and call me a liar and<br/>
announce to the zone that I wouldn&#39;t give sow (I hate that word now, by the way<br/>
=) )... impugning the honor of someone they&#39;ve never met because it&#39;s their<br/>
God-given right to have whomever they demand cast that spell on them.  My<br/>
favorite response to those zone-wide shouts was, &#39;Have you ever met a druid IN<br/>
GREEN ARMOR???&#39;  But I shouldn&#39;t have had to resort to defending myself, should<br/>
I? I mean... anyone could have done a /who all Aelwesara and found out for<br/>
himself... but no, here I am with my name plastered across the darned zone...<br/>
&lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have responded to people, &#39;I cannot leave my party to track a monster for you,<br/>
and even if we find it, you are too low level to fight it...&#39; only to discern<br/>
that they wanted me to find it, fight it, and let them loot it, usually for<br/>
about 10 plat.  At that point, I have to deal with, &#39;Oh, come on, if you don&#39;t<br/>
suck it won&#39;t take very long, why don&#39;t you want to help me I lost everything I<br/>
had...&#39; and most of the time, it&#39;s not even an item for one of their classes&#39;<br/>
quests (for example, the fire heart in Solusek A, being requested by... a<br/>
magician?? C&#39;mon...).  I remember not being able to muster the desire to go<br/>
hunt, because everything that we knew of that was level-appropriate had a<br/>
waiting list, mostly filled by higher levels wanting to kill a mob for a rare<br/>
drop in order to sell it so they could amass more money...  of course, Ruins of<br/>
Kunark made that a lot better, and it was the only thing that kept my interest<br/>
for a while, but my poor PII 233 has such a problem handling the graphics (it<br/>
can&#39;t be my card, can it? I mean, I have a Voodoo 3 2000, which works fine for<br/>
Diablo and Starcraft and Tribes...) that at times the lag was lethal... my<br/>
problem, not Verant&#39;s, but I&#39;m a starving student and my next upgrade has to<br/>
wait for my loan refund. &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I decided I wanted to leave before I had a cleric call me a mana-sink for the<br/>
first time, which has happened to several of my senior brethren.  I decided I<br/>
wanted to leave before I got frustrated with competing with other classes for my<br/>
quest items (also has happened).  I wanted to keep Aelwesara fresh and strong<br/>
and powerful, as in over twenty years of role-playing she has been my favorite<br/>
avatar.<br/>
<br/>
Point is, I can&#39;t tell if my decision was swayed by overall burnout from having<br/>
played a game for almost 16 months, or if it really is primarily a question of<br/>
game mechanics and customer service.  I&#39;m giving you this information, Judy,<br/>
because I know you&#39;ve expressed a desire to have it, and if you can solve some<br/>
of these problems, it might help your project.  I mean, I played AD&D steadily<br/>
for what... almost fifteen years, not counting the breaks? Granted, there were<br/>
things there that I didn&#39;t agree with, but most DMs were amenable to editing the<br/>
rules to suit their individual campaigns (and as long as you didn&#39;t take a<br/>
character out of their &#39;world&#39; it worked just fine), and they had the physical<br/>
ability to do so... not all of those changes favored me, so I don&#39;t think my<br/>
dissatisfaction here is founded in mere pique... and I&#39;m not the kind of person<br/>
who is usually very demanding of my play environment...<br/>
<br/>
I try to make the best of wherever I find myself, and did so in spite of rampant<br/>
pkilling in Ultima Online for over a year (the old, pre-expansion days there),<br/>
and even though I didn&#39;t like alot of the game mechanics (tank mages? C&#39;mon...)<br/>
because they weren&#39;t traditional, I made the most of it and honestly put up with<br/>
quite a bit to prove that I could stick to it.  And really--if we want to talk<br/>
about player rudeness and vileness and general ickyness, UO and Diablo have been<br/>
where I&#39;ve met the absolute worst... so it&#39;s not the people in EQ, is it?  Not<br/>
the majority, anyway?<br/>
<br/>
So, Judy, here&#39;s the data... don&#39;t know what you want to do with it... &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
I&#39;m just providing it.  My apologies, Christina, if this sounds like a rant and<br/>
is inappropriate to the forum.  I do have alot of positive experiences (I can<br/>
tell ya how to have a great wedding, what to look for in a guild, yada yada)<br/>
that I would still love to share but haven&#39;t recently because I didn&#39;t know if I<br/>
should since I wasn&#39;t playing.  I think Everquest has the best platform for the<br/>
most classes/races that is currently on the market, and I would strongly urge<br/>
other players to take my experiences with a grain of salt.  I was not a power<br/>
leveler, I was a roleplayer.  I did manage to get a decent number of levels on<br/>
me, but that was never the goal.  Some of my senior rangers say it&#39;s possible to<br/>
power level a ranger to 45 within a matter of less than a month, because the<br/>
class really rocks for most of those levels if you play it well.  It all depends<br/>
on what you&#39;re looking for.  If I may be allowed to &#39;lurk&#39; here and comment from<br/>
time to time, I would love to do so.  I&#39;ve enjoyed this list for what...? Since<br/>
before I moved to Maryland, I know that, and that was last July... I&#39;m thinking<br/>
May, Christina?  Anyway, I&#39;ve loved being part of it, and would love to continue<br/>
to do so.  Regardless, I wish you all the best experiences you could have,<br/>
wherever you are (and I LOVE the idea of a female halfing warrior--more power to<br/>
ya!).  Tunare bless.<br/>
