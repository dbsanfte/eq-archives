<div id="ygrps-yiv-87018639">Greetings! I am Beth Moursund, player of Windsong Wanderer, a female wood <br/>
elf bard on Solusek Ro.  Windsong is currently struggling through the &quot;hell <br/>
level&quot; 35, and has about one and an eighth bubbles to go.  (Players under <br/>
level 30 may not have heard of &quot;hell levels.&quot;  For some reason known only <br/>
to Verant, experience progression at levels 30, 35, 40, and 45 slows to a <br/>
crawl.  On the levels in between it returns to normal.)<br/>
<br/>
I also have a female human monk and a male troll shaman, both currently at <br/>
9th level.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m interested in hearing from other female players.  Also, I&#39;m happy to <br/>
give any advice and tips I can that may be helpful to newer players.<br/>
<br/>
  - Beth &quot;BethMo&quot; Moursund</div>
