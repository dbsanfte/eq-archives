<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-141502247">I&#39;m throwing out a topic ladies, just want to see what experiences you<br/>
have had.....<br/>
<br/>
Flirting<br/>
<br/>
My character is the biggest flirt!  I discovered early in the game that<br/>
most males (no matter what race) liked the look of my character, a<br/>
half-elf.  Many flirted with her before she even knew she was cute.  It<br/>
was in-character for Genneth (a bard) to flirt, so she is constantly<br/>
engaging in flirting.  <br/>
<br/>
And to add to it, Genn has herself somewhat of a boyfriend in the game,<br/>
another member of her guild, Teban. (&#39;Course she still flirts with<br/>
others, but he understands that she is mostly committed to him ;) So,<br/>
has this phenomenon hit anyone else?  Do you get flirted with?  Have<br/>
you found yourself a steady??<br/>
<br/>
Just curious<br/>
<br/>
