I envy you being a 14 lv druid,  when I tell people I am ONLY lv 6,<br/>
nobody wants to group with me!  :(<br/>
As far as grouping,  I have only been in 3 different groups for any<br/>
length of time (1-6 hours)<br/>
The first group didn&#39;t know what they were doing.  Of course, neither<br/>
did I but they abandoned me in Lesser Feydark AND didn&#39;t split the loot<br/>
fairly.<br/>
The second group I was with was great!  They were mostly lowbies (more<br/>
experienced players with fairly low level characters).  Lots of fun, and<br/>
they really helped me out with strategies and not getting lost (dumb<br/>
blonde syndrome!)  I don&#39;t believe in twinking (sp?) but it is nice to<br/>
get advice from more experienced folks.<br/>
The third group didn&#39;t go so well.  Each person had their own agenda,<br/>
and couldn&#39;t agree on where to go and what to hunt.  I didn&#39;t stay with<br/>
them long.<br/>
<br/>
My advice for grouping-make sure everyone agrees on plan of action<br/>
before you start-including where to go, what to hunt, any quests people<br/>
are on, and order of looting.<br/>
