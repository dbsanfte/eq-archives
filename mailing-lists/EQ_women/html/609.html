<div id="ygrps-yiv-804883119">Playing with your real life partner can be very convenient!<br/>
<br/>
My (ex) boyfriend and I played together from levels 20-47 with our<br/>
Ranger/Cleric combo. We hunted very efficiently. It was nice because we<br/>
could log in and hunt for half an hour effectively, we didn&#39;t have groups.<br/>
It&#39;s kind of like soloing, but you&#39;re actually with someone.<br/>
<br/>
Also with a real life partner you can communicate much better. No typing,<br/>
just talk, you&#39;d be amazed how much that can help =)<br/>
<br/>
We would still do social grouping as well. I had another high level<br/>
character (enchanter) so we could do the cleric/enchanter combo while<br/>
grouping. That was very nice, it was easy to form groups, by just adding<br/>
in a couple casters and tanks. I could also play my ranger instead of my<br/>
enchanter if we needed a tank more than an enchanter.<br/>
<br/>
One bad thing was I became very dependant on playing with him. If I wanted<br/>
to play and he didn&#39;t want to play I would get snippy. Having to find a<br/>
competant healer to replace him was always a pain! So if you have<br/>
different playing styles, it can cause problems.<br/>
