<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838709933">Hello fellow questers.  This is my first post since joining the group. I am a 24 year old female from New Jersey who will be married in Oct.  I am a Everquest addict.  I was wondering how many here also play on Xeqony?  Also, I play a druid her name is Renaya, I just leveled to 12.  Does anyone here have helpful hints for where there is good hunting for druids?<br/>
