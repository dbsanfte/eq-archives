<div id="ygrps-yiv-881136723">First, thanks to everyone who answered my flood of newbie questions - it&#39;s nice to have a forum where you&#39;re not flamed for being basic.  ^_^<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m starting to get a clearer picture of guilds from all these posts.   There seem to be big &quot;barshing&quot; guilds centred on slaying (very attractive to teen boys I imagine), some guilds centred on helping others... are there also trade guilds?<br/>
