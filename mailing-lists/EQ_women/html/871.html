<b>Subject:</b> Hello I&#39;m New <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1058272124">I think the title of the subject says it all. I&#39;ve been playing EQ <br/>
for a little over 4 years. Basically my BF talked me into playing my <br/>
Druid and next thing I knew I was hooked. All my charcters would be <br/>
high lvl but I have a life outside of EQ too... Hahahaha!<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to meeting you all (online), chatting, learning new <br/>
things, and playing EQ.<br/>
<br/>
