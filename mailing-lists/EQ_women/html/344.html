<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025679068">Well, first question I have is, do you have a full set of patchwork? That<br/>
is one of the first things you should try to get.<br/>
<br/>
Next, if you can afford it, buy a minotaur axe.  Those run 4pp, but are<br/>
well worth it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d try hunting on Orc Hill.  Orc Hill is near the orc lift, which is the<br/>
lift in Kelethin that is on an incline.  If you follow the path from<br/>
there, continuing on after it ends, you should see a hill surrounded by<br/>
orc tents.  This is a great place to hunt up to level 9.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of orcs on orc hill.  The most important thing to know is<br/>
how to run to the guards, if you have orcs on you.  That will save your<br/>
life.  With your speed song, you should be able to outrun the orcs.<br/>
<br/>
When you get an orc, try and run on top of the hill, so other orcs won&#39;t<br/>
wander by and join in on the fight.  They all spawn at the bottom of the<br/>
hill.<br/>
<br/>
Level five is a hard level in greater faydark, but once you get to level 6<br/>
you&#39;ll find things a lot easier, that&#39;s when you get your healing song.<br/>
