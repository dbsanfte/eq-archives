<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041537431">NOOOOOOO... I missed another wedding! =(  I had company in town all last week and<br/>
didn&#39;t check my eMail once (missed out on alot of other things too).  I&#39;m so<br/>
sorry.  How was it? Did it go over well? What little details do you wish you&#39;d<br/>
planned ahead of time? What advice would you give someone planning a wedding in<br/>
the near future? *clears her throat and grins shyly*<br/>
<br/>
And how many people would be interested in attending a wedding on Povar? And what<br/>
are some sites you all would recommend for a wedding for two 20th level<br/>
characters?  Please, anyone feel free to answer.  I have absolutely no ideas at<br/>
the present (course I still have a couple levels to go, and we level slowly, so<br/>
it could be late December before we actually hit 20) and would welcome ANY.<br/>
