<div id="ygrps-yiv-2045946289">Getting to level 50 takes time.  I had about 40 days of played time on my<br/>
character by the time she made level 50.  Do /played sometime and see<br/>
where you stand.  It does take a long time to get to 50.  I play this game<br/>
way too much, and I know it.<br/>
<br/>
Real power leveling is really very boring.  I hunted levels 17-38 in aviak<br/>
city in south karana.  Levels 38-42 I got in lower guk running the bedroom<br/>
circuit (there is a nice cyclic path you can do over and over again that<br/>
is very good xp).  Levels 42-48 I got killing dwarven NPCs in<br/>
butcherblock.  Levels 48-50 I got killing freeport guards in freeport.  I<br/>
should note that none of this NPC/guard farming put newbies in danger.  In<br/>
all cases there were guard NPCs left that they could run to when they<br/>
needed protection.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t just do boring, repetitive, killing to get xp.  I also grouped<br/>
and had fun and did cool stuff, but probably 75% of my xp came from these<br/>
repetitive XP farming activities.  If your goal is to get to 50th level<br/>
fast (mine was) you should try stuff like this, if you are trying to have<br/>
fun you should just try and have fun =)<br/>
<br/>
Starting new characters is always fun and exciting.  With a little bit of<br/>
twinking they can usually have a fairly easy time at those early levels,<br/>
and advance very quickly.  You get to try fighting in new fun ways.  You<br/>
get new ability quickly.  It&#39;s great!<br/>
<br/>
Rangers are really fun to play, and up to level 22 they get new abilities<br/>
really fast.  They solo very well, and they are I think the most<br/>
interesting tank to play.<br/>
<br/>
For a level 35 necro, if you have good friends for grouping I would say<br/>
hunt in lower guk.  I don&#39;t know how crowded your server is, but necros<br/>
are great in guk.  Start at the zone entrance and kill the froggies there.<br/>
Eventually move in deeper.  Lower guk is great xp for a necro up to level<br/>
45 or so, and you can even get to 50 just hunting there.  I understand on<br/>
most servers lower guk is really overcrowded and has many trains though.<br/>
On my server (brell) it&#39;s still relatively uncrowded.  Try it though,<br/>
because necros totally rule in lower guk.<br/>

&gt; I have been playing from the date of release last year, I have 5 chars that<br/>
&gt; I like to play; but in the beginning I could not decide on a race/class - so<br/>
&gt; I started and deleted about 6 chars (geeze what a waste of time!)  Anyway I<br/>
&gt; have two main chars one is a lvl 35 DE Necro named Karrma Sutra and one is a<br/>
&gt; DE Cleric named Kilanna.  My question is how in the heck to you guys get to<br/>
&gt; lvl 50 so fast?  I don&#39;t see 50 in my future for months and months!  But of<br/>
&gt; course I play an average of 2 hours a day, except on weekends - that may<br/>
&gt; have something to do with it!  Any suggestions?  Also I have a ranger that<br/>
&gt; was recently started - I totally love playing her! But she is still a baby. </span></blockquote></div>
