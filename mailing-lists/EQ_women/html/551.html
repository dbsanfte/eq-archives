<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I swore off camping Efreeti after a string of 
horrific luck the final straw being a server crash in whic I was late getting 
back in (was afk) and logged in dead while everyone else walked into the Efreeti 
room before the zone popped.&nbsp; Included was someone not on the original raid 
when the server crashed.&nbsp; We did the druid duel/summon corpse/res thing to 
get me into the raid and then everyone, including our &quot;just showed up without 
being invited&quot; guest won the rolls for boots except me.</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt><br>Hey Icei,<br><br>Those plat necklaces have about a 20% 
  success rate.&nbsp; In other words, you<br>need five black sapphires on 
  average to make one.&nbsp; I can try it for you<br>for sure, but can&#39;t 
  guarantee success.<br><br>Eboots, eboots, eboots.&nbsp; Why not just camp 
  them? I guess I don&#39;t know how<br>hard it is to camp eboots these days.&nbsp; 
  If you want I&#39;d be happy to help<br>you camp them some time.&nbsp; I am not 
  playing EQ much right now, but basicly<br>if you wanted to set up a time in 
  email I can dutifully log in and help<br>out.&nbsp; I&#39;m pretty sure one full 
  group of level 50+ people would be<br>sufficient.&nbsp; You + me + sylvanar 
  would be a good start.&nbsp; Ideally bring<br>along as few people as possible 
  who actually need boots, you know how it<br>goes =)

  <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was a master smith and a grandmaster jewler, 
  here is some of the stuff<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;ve learned.<br>&gt; 
  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tailoring is a great starter skill, it requires little 
  investment to make<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; patchwork armor.&nbsp; However, if you 
  want to continue on to high end stuff<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; (reinforced leather, 
  10-slot bags) it requires considerable time and money<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  investment.&nbsp; You can make good newbie-level money doing tailoring 
  in<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; greater faydark.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smithing 
  requires about a 200pp investment to master (less if you 
  are<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; optimal).&nbsp; Smithing I found to be very rewarding 
  early on in my server&#39;s<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; life, there were lots of tanks who 
  wanted armor.&nbsp; For various reasons<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; though, it can get 
  boring.&nbsp; To make small or large armor you have to<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  travel a lot to get your molds and metals and such.&nbsp; To make medium 
  armor,<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; you can do it in freeport, where all the materials 
  are fairly available.<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smithing is quite enjoyable I found 
  though eventually it becomes tedious.<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can make good 
  low level money smithing in freeport or greater fay.<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; This 
  will probably work best if you are level 20 or under as you will 
  be<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; able to hunt in the near vicinity to freeport where 
  people who will want<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; your wares will hang out.<br>&gt; 
  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh I almost forgot, smiths can make weapons now.&nbsp; 
  They couldn&#39;t when I<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; smithed.&nbsp; I don&#39;t get the 
  impression that forged weapons are a<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; very competitive 
  business though.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Baking and brewing are both more 
  &#39;fun&#39; trades.&nbsp; All the skilled bakers and<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; brewers I 
  know are druids, which makes sense because getting your 
  goods<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; requires a lot of travel.&nbsp; These two skills 
  require little investment to<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; start, but a lot of work and 
  travel to master.&nbsp; These are nice because you<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; can 
  give people alcohol or food, I still remember with joy the day 
  my<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; druid friend gave me chocolate! You won&#39;t make money 
  doing this.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jewlery is one of the few trades you 
  can make serious money in but it is<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; also fairly 
  competitive.&nbsp; In order to make money in jewelcraft you 
  usually<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; need a sizible investment.&nbsp; Maxing your 
  jewelcraft to 200 will cost<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; several thousand plat.&nbsp; 
  On the other hand, 50pp will get you able to make<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; some 
  jewelry.&nbsp; If you are not an enchanter you will have to pay to 
  get<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; your metal bars enchanted which is a pain.&nbsp; If 
  you have a close enchanter<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; friend you could do ok though 
  =)<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alchemy is shaman only and you have to be 
  fairly high level to do it.<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shrink and SOW potions are 
  pretty cool though, but they require a sizible<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; investment 
  (thus the high level).<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meow meow<br>&gt;
