Sever politics hits when you get to higher levels.  It has to do with scheduling raids, loot rules, etc.  Once the server matures to a certain point there are more people wanting to go on raids than spots to accomodate them.  On Brell it was at the point that guilds camped the boards to be the first person to sign up for the next raid right as the clock rolled over.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what &quot;the boards&quot; are, but I can understand the concept of too many people wanting to go schmuck the same dragon/lich whatever at the same time.  (would these be guild boards on the web?)  EQ seems so vast to me right now, that fighting for space never occurred to me.  ^_^  So I take it different guilds squabble over times, and this is where guild wars come from?<br/>
<br/>
Then there are cliques of people who won&#39;t play with people.  <br/>
<br/>
KINDERGARTEN! SANDBOX!  I&#39;m getting a mental image here... ^_^<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s fighting about loot (I think that is the worst - I HATE it so much).  <br/>
<br/>
see above<br/>
<br/>
By 50 everyone knows everyone else.  People have formed friends and enemies and your reputation makes a HUGE difference (HUGE!!!!) in how you get to play.  <br/>
<br/>
damn.  Sounds like a lowly newbie may never catch up. ^_^  I suppose one could start a fresh character on a new server?  Does Verant ever start up new servers?  (I know they split them).<br/>
<br/>
