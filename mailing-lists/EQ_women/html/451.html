<div id="ygrps-yiv-713838935">Well, I don&#39;t really like telling any of the other<br/>
characters I meet that I really am a woman so it<br/>
doesn&#39;t become an issue that often. I find that when I<br/>
have told them in the past, they become overly<br/>
flirtatous and it gets in the way of what I find fun<br/>
in the game. If I&#39;m taken for a guy, I just go with<br/>
it. BTW, all my characters are female just because<br/>
that&#39;s what I feel comfortable with. :)<br/>
I don&#39;t really flirt with any of the other characters<br/>
either unless they start it because I have been<br/>
accused in the past of being homosexual (Like that&#39;s a<br/>
really horrible thing to begin with...)because the<br/>
other person just wouldn&#39;t believe I was a female,<br/>
which bothered me just because I really am female, you<br/>
know?. <br/>
I&#39;d rather just be called bro and leave it at that. :)<br/>
