<div id="ygrps-yiv-2134905837">I only got three votes! I&#39;m hoping that means everyone else was ok with<br/>
all the times.  I am nervous setting the time for the meeting based on<br/>
only three votes.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to wait another couple days to let people vote.  If all times<br/>
are ok with you, please send me an email saying that.  That will let<br/>
reassure me that people will come 8)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll post new times, based on feedback from people who can&#39;t attend,<br/>
and the delay of another vote taking.  I really hope people will come!<br/>
<br/>
Meeting times: <br/>
  - Saturday 14th 10am-12pm PST<br/>
  - Monday 16th 6-8pm PST<br/>
  - Tuesday 17th 6-8pm PST<br/>
<br/>
I hope these times work out for people.  Please send in your vote or<br/>
&#39;all of them are fine&#39; 8) <br/>
<br/>
If you would like to join the guild before that, Luna and Briei (Beth&#39;s<br/>
character) are both capable of adding people.<br/>

Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
As you may recall Suzanne was organizing an online meeting for mailing<br/>
list.  We chatted and agreed that Brell Serelis would be a great server to<br/>
have the meeting on.  This way we can all meet eachother, and also have a<br/>
subsequent guild event.  The subsequent event would be a newbie hunt,<br/>
during which newbies could hunt critters, and higher level guild members<br/>
could help them out.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to hold a brief vote on the time and place of the meeting on<br/>
brell.  The time matters because we all have different schedules.  The<br/>
place only matters in terms of where the newbie hunt will take place.<br/>
Please respond to this email if you have a preference (if you don&#39;t care,<br/>
you dont need to respond).  If any given meeting time is impossible for<br/>
you, please say that, I&#39;ll try and minimize those conflicts.<br/>
<br/>
Meeting places:<br/>
    - Greater Faydark stone ring (kelethin newbie zone)<br/>
    - East Freeport newbie zone<br/>
<br/>
Meeting times:<br/>
    - Tuesday August 10th 6pm-8pm PST<br/>
    - Thursday August 10th 6pm-8pm PST<br/>
    - Saturday August 14th 10am-12pm PST<br/>
<br/>
Vote will be closed friday at 6pm PST and I&#39;ll post the results that<br/>
evening.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to use the guild chat feature to make our meeting easier.  Even<br/>
if you&#39;re not planning on playing on Brell, you can make a newbie and join<br/>
the guild, to use this feature.  It allows us to send tells to our entire<br/>
guild, so we can hear conversation even if we&#39;re not exactly in the same<br/>
physical area.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also like to suggest an unofficial guild hunt Saturday August 7th at<br/>
noon PST.  The location will be wherever the official one will be held<br/>
(results posted Friday evening).  This is for those of us who&#39;d like to<br/>
get into playing together ASAP.<br/>
<br/>
