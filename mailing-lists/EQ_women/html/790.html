It appears if you are not bound that you appear either<br/>
near where you are currently standing, back at your<br/>
starting place, or somewhere unknown, although this<br/>
may change at some level.<br/>
<br/>
When I first started I was not bound but kept<br/>
reappearing when I died somewhat near where I had been<br/>
killed. Of course, all this was at my starting poing,<br/>
so I&#39;m not sure what was going on.<br/>
<br/>
The interesting thing was that I was traveling with a<br/>
10th lvl bard the other day in BB which is when I<br/>
upped from 9th to 10th lvl and the guy didn&#39;t know<br/>
anything about where or how to soul bind.<br/>
<br/>
He kept dieing and I would ask where he was and he<br/>
would say I can&#39;t explain it but I&#39;ll be back in a<br/>
little bit, so I would hang around and wait and sure<br/>
enough he&#39;d show up in a couple minutes. After that we<br/>
went to Keledim, and he was saying he wanted to stay<br/>
in that area even if he died because we were getting<br/>
some good exp and plat from the Greenbloods. <br/>
I said that was fine with me so let&#39;s go see the soul<br/>
binder and he didn&#39;t know what I was talking about.<br/>
Anyway, we went and I got bound and he kept saying the<br/>
wrong thing. Finally, I had to &quot;hold his hand&quot; and<br/>
walk him through it step by step. Anyway, the only<br/>
point was that it made me think that sometimes I&#39;ve<br/>
journed a ways from where I was bound and the got<br/>
killed before finding a place to get bound again and<br/>
had to make that long trip all over again, sigh. So I<br/>
wondered if I could sort of pull up roots and maybe I<br/>
would stay on the same continent until I could find a<br/>
place to bind. Anyway, it was just a thought.<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
Of course, we agreed to meet there at 7:00 PM my time<br/>
7::00 his time, the next night and he didn&#39;t show . .<br/>
. men!<br/>
<br/>
:o)<br/>

&gt; Your soul needs to be bound somewhere, that<br/>
&gt; determines where you appear <br/>
&gt; when you die. If you weren&#39;t bound anywhere, I guess<br/>
&gt; you wouldn&#39;t appear, <br/>
&gt; and that would suck!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You can always tell where you are bound with<br/>
&gt; /charinfo.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you don&#39;t like where you&#39;re bound, you can bind<br/>
&gt; somewhere else!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Thanks for the note.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Is there a way to unbind your soul so that it&#39;s no<br/>
&gt; &gt; longer bound to any specific location.<br/>
