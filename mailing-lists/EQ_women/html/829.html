<div id="ygrps-yiv-4656913">Salutations All!<br/>
<br/>
I have not posted for a while, and I know everyone was probably <br/>
relaxing a little and here I am again.<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
EQ has been progressing prettry good for me I think. I&#39;ve made a <br/>
couple of good friends who are more experienced then me and don&#39;t <br/>
seem to mind giving advice or helping out so that&#39;s very nice.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also been trying to learn more about my role as a Ranger in <br/>
Norrath. I just found out last week what a handy thing taunt can be <br/>
when trying to keep a mob off your healer? OK, I&#39;m slow but I&#39;m <br/>
getting there I think. And I&#39;ve gotten duel wield and double attack <br/>
now so that&#39;s interesting to play with.<br/>
<br/>
Last night a Druid friend and I went to Paudal Cavern for my first <br/>
trip there. I would have died twice during the first fight we had I <br/>
think if they had not been there to keep me from deaths door. That <br/>
was a tough mob and red all the way for me at lvl 19 (20 now).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, enough ramblin, so it&#39;s question time:<br/>
<br/>
1.) I have been asked to get married and have said yes. :o) Any good <br/>
suggestions on locations that would be nice but not to hard for <br/>
guests to get to? He has a place in mind, I forget the name, but it <br/>
sounds like it might be hard for lower level characters to even <br/>
reach. I have not traveled over much of Norrath still so I&#39;m not <br/>
sure. Anyway, if anyone has ideas I&#39;d love to hear them.<br/>
Also, when things are set, which may be a while I&#39;ll post a note here <br/>
letting everyone know. You are all invited, of course, feel free to <br/>
come if you have a character on the Xegony server, of if you want <br/>
just create a quick one at the proper time and come anyway. I&#39;d love <br/>
to meet anyone who might do me the honor of coming.<br/>
<br/>
2.) Can anyone give me advice on how to find a guild that might be <br/>
interested in letting a Ranger in the low 20&#39;s join? Would it be ok <br/>
to just kind of start asking around? Is there a way to tell a better <br/>
guild from one not as good?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I hope everyone had a nice Thanksgiving.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs<br/>
