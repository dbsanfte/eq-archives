<b>Subject:</b> Re: making female friends <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-446191695">Maybe its a guild thing, but on Tunare I have made many female friends,<br/>
some who are females in RL and some who are males.  I even have one<br/>
friend who is a super high level female druid who plays a woman so<br/>
convincingly, I forget he is really a Samuel.  Still, the majority of<br/>
the people I have on my friend list are males and I am frequently the<br/>
only female in a group....it is interesting to note that I am usually<br/>
the group&#39;s leader by consent or default even if I don&#39;t invite all the<br/>
group members....do you think that is a female thing?<br/>
