Dear Friends.<br/>
<br/>
My station name is (Edited).<br/>
<br/>
I am writing because Everquest has changed too much from the game <br/>
that I originally purchased to play. I have also purchased several <br/>
expansion packs.<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, there seems to be this occurrence called &quot;nerfing&quot; where Sony<br/>
limits a game feature by either discontinuing or severely limiting it,<br/>
when in the past it was widely available.<br/>
<br/>
Specifically, I play a druid character that has been rendered <br/>
essentially<br/>
useless because of changes in the way the game is applied to the <br/>
character and its level (spells, etc). I only play that character <br/>
and am not interested in starting another from scratch just because <br/>
someone reprogrammed the game. I&#39;d rather quit.<br/>
<br/>
Second, I have heard that Sony is trying to &quot;level out the playing <br/>
field&quot; with respect to these changes. What you have done is leveled <br/>
my character o the point that I cannot play without finding a large <br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
I did not intend to play with large groups, now or ever. And even <br/>
when I do find a large group, my character&#39;s group value is useless <br/>
to them. I can offer them nothing of value because my character now <br/>
cannot contribute<br/>
anymore either by direct attack or by &quot;buffing&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the general feature called &quot;mana&quot; is severely defective <br/>
in that it takes eons to regenrate. To counter this defect, I relied <br/>
on a spell that helped &quot;mana&quot; regenerate faster, named Kodiaks <br/>
Endless Intellect. This spell has recently been &quot;nerfed&quot; to work <br/>
only on high level characters. Now, I sit and stare at a computer <br/>
screen, bored out of my mind. Where&#39;s the pleasure in playing your <br/>
game when all I do is sit. Its a waste of my time.<br/>
<br/>
Third, the issue of &quot;mana&quot;, and the amount of &quot;mana&quot; that spells <br/>
require should be reassessed. The game is for fun. I am not having <br/>
fun. I can only cast 3 or 4 spells before the &quot;mana&quot; runs out. Then, <br/>
it takes a lifetime to regenerate &quot;mana&quot;. I could go fry up a pound <br/>
of bacon before my &quot;mana&quot; regenerates (I did that last night).<br/>
<br/>
Either make &quot;mana&quot; regenerate faster, make spells use less &quot;mana&quot;, or <br/>
let us &quot;pay&quot; for Kodiaks Endless Intellect. Whatever you do, you&#39;ve <br/>
got to do something, I am reluctant to play anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Fourth, it appears that many NPC&#39;s have been enhanced in some way. <br/>
Many things that used to &quot;con&quot; light blue or green now &quot;con&quot; dark <br/>
blue. And in the past, I used to be able to kill these NPC&#39;s by <br/>
myself, even without Kodiaks Endless Intellect. Now, I die every <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, overall, I believe that the game&#39;s features should remain <br/>
static. One plans and strategizes based on the parameters of the <br/>
game. When the parameters continually change, as they have been, one <br/>
cannot strategize and the game becomes a waste of time and money.<br/>
<br/>
The way I look at it, I am a customer that is now not getting what I<br/>
originally paid for. Please correct these problems. If you would <br/>
like a comprehensive list of other problems, I can compile it for <br/>
you. The ones that Im complaining about are the worst offenders.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; OK, but you spell like an man, so let me proofread it first.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Frankly, I don&#39;t WANT realism in my games.  I LIKE being able to go<br/>
&gt; to the bank and have the same things everywhere. I LIKE teleporting<br/>
&gt; and jumping off of high places and gliding in over KC for a<br/>
&gt; landing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a RL if I want realism.<br/>
