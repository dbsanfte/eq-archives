<div id="ygrps-yiv-216869872">Oh dear. Well, all I can say is don&#39;t get too attached. I have a friend<br/>
who plays a female on Rodcet but in Rl he is a guy so we flirt a bit<br/>
(very little) in tells and icq whenever we see each other on. I know a<br/>
bit about his life and he knows a bit about mine. I finally got sick of<br/>
playing my cleric so I moved to the Brell server. I play a Bard named<br/>
Dusky there. He said he was going to start a new character there so we<br/>
could play together again but I didn&#39;t see him in the game nor recieved<br/>
any other communication. So I missed him terribly for about a week on<br/>
Brell as he was the only real friend I had in the game. I recently<br/>
started a new job where I don&#39;t have hardly any time to play EQ anymore<br/>
so I guess I&#39;m spared having to play with no friends. :P The whole week<br/>
on Brell anyone I met who called me Darlin caused an acute twist in my<br/>
heart. :( And this pain is caused from only a friend without any real<br/>
romantic involvement. I guess what I&#39;m saying is be careful. If I were<br/>
you I wouldn&#39;t exchange any rl info and I&#39;d keep it all contained to<br/>
roleplay. If we were talking about me however, I would have had my real<br/>
life all over the tells as I no longer am as interested in rolplaying<br/>
so go figure. Hmm, I guess what I&#39;m really saying is don&#39;t get in too<br/>
deep because I think you&#39;ll just get hurt. I&#39;m definitely not telling<br/>
you to ruin your fun though! *grin* I&#39;m sure I wouldn&#39;t mind<br/>
roleplaying with some romantic minded fellow myself. (At least someone<br/>
who appeared so in game) I guess I&#39;m middling more on the powergamer<br/>
side of the divide between that and rping. *sighs* I&#39;ve been thinking,<br/>
that doesn&#39;t sound like that&#39;s acceptable in the guild though....<br/>
<br/>
*For all on the list*---&gt;Feel free to give me a tell in game if you<br/>
want and you&#39;re not a strict rper.<br/>
<br/>
 I think my bard is level...um.. (it&#39;s been days since I got a chance<br/>
to play! *sadness* )around level 7. If she&#39;s not level 7 yet, I&#39;m sure<br/>
she&#39;s pretty darn close. :) Bloodless will be at the wedding, but<br/>
she&#39;ll have to turn in early since I have to get up early for work the<br/>
next day. I work in a sweatshop and I need all the rest I can get! haha<br/>
It&#39;s only till school starts thank goodness. Btw, I&#39;m 25 since you<br/>
wanted to know from people who had a few seasons under their belts. :P<br/>
Good luck all! *smiles*<br/>
