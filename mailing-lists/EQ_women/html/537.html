<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Okay, what about most fun you&#39;ve had lately.&nbsp; 
Being in the 50s is kind of a PITA because it takes a minimum of 12 people and 
preferably 18 to do most of the really fun stuff.&nbsp; I&#39;m in the process of 
changing guilds to one with more high level players.&nbsp; The top 5 ME players 
are fed up with being the only high level players on and we&#39;re hoping to all 
move together but who knows.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Sebilis exit room with 2 druids, 1 shaman, 1 
enchanter, 1 bard, and 1 necromancer.&nbsp; Basically, the bard is a very light 
tank so my druid got to tank (ooooh, I love tanking and Mufat is my hero though 
Sylvanar has lots of strong opinions &lt;wouldn&#39;t let me loot a hangman&#39;s noose 
and gave it to a rogue who happened to be in the neighborhood&gt;).&nbsp; 
Needless to say, this was a hard group to play.&nbsp; The only player that could 
taunt was the necro&#39;s pet.&nbsp; But with 3 healers, as soon as the bard broke 
mes, we started chain healing the enchanter until we got the mob off of 
her.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Sebilis Trakanon outer courtyard (no idea what this 
place is really called, but if you pull wrong Trak comes out and it&#39;s EVAC EVAC 
EVAC!).&nbsp; 3 group raid, our group was 1 cleric, 3 druids, and a bard.&nbsp; 
We laughed about balance and then proceeded to take 90% of the kills.&nbsp; It 
was hysterical (esp. since everyone but the bard was female - he kept calling us 
his &quot;kill stealing ladies&quot; and &quot;ladies, no go get me some experience&quot;.)&nbsp; 
Amazing how much damange a cleric can do when she doesn&#39;t have to heal.&nbsp; 
And all of us druids had our KS timing down pat ;-)</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">So I am having the most fun in totally unbalanced 
groups where the play isn&#39;t the traditional &quot;snare, dot, med&quot;.&nbsp; It&#39;s fun to 
not be sure if you&#39;ll live (and not living as often as not, thank Tunare for 
those 90% experience rez&#39;s).&nbsp; It&#39;s fun feeling like you actualy have to pay 
attention to the game.&nbsp;&nbsp; And while I&#39;m sure my target doesn&#39;t 
appreciate it, there&#39;s an adrenaline rush to watching the targets health go down 
while your spell is casting and praying the spell goes off before the bar turns 
purple.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Another suggestion for another thread is &quot;tips on 
playing&quot; where maybe we can help the newer players learn the strategies we learn 
at the higher levels.&nbsp; I am going INSANE playing my 26 bard in Cazic Thule 
running into players like a ranger that won&#39;t snare, a druid as healer who dumps 
his entire mana bar casting DDs and a) has no mana to heal, and b) expects us to 
wait after every mob for him to meditate up to full, a warrior that kept moving 
behind the rogue for mellee, and an SK who&nbsp; insisted on targeting the mob 
with his mouse instead of /assisting (enchanter went balistic and rightfully 
so).</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt><br>Hey Sandy,<br><br>I&#39;m on Brell Serilis.&nbsp; Best 
  class and race depends a lot on your playing<br>style, they are all fun in 
  different ways =)<br><br>I&#39;m in a guild called Rain which my ex-boyfriend runs 
  (ack, we just broke<br>up last week, I&#39;m still not used to calling him my ex 
  =( We are still<br>friends but I don&#39;t know how things will work out for us 
  and the guild in<br>the long run.&nbsp; <br><br>I have a level 54 
  enchanter.&nbsp; I love enchanters because they tend to act<br>to alter combat 
  more than to actually kill mobs.&nbsp; They mesmerise things,<br>they speed 
  things up, they slow things down, I guess I&#39;m a bit of a<br>control freak =) 
  My enchanter is a female high elf named Luna.&nbsp; Enchanters<br>are not much 
  fun at low levels though.&nbsp; Most of their spells become more<br>useful at 
  high levels, at low levels they are mostly a waste of mana.<br><br>I also have 
  a level 52 wood elf rangers.&nbsp; Rangers are I think one of the<br>most fun 
  tank classes. They are very versatile.&nbsp; I&#39;m finding at level 52<br>that 
  being a ranger isn&#39;t as fun as it used to be though, rangers seem to<br>peak 
  at around 40 I&#39;d say. <br><br>Tina<br><br>Other fun classes:<br>&nbsp; Bards, 
  at low levels they are basicly tanks with neat abilities.<br>They get healing 
  song and speed song fairly early<br>&nbsp; Druids, they get lots of fun spells 
  fairly early, and are good for both<br>grouping and soloing pretty much 
  forever<br>&nbsp; Necromancers, very powerful, and have lots of neat 
  tricks.&nbsp; Pets are<br>fun.<br>&nbsp; Monks, don&#39;t need a lot of equipment, 
  and very effective in battle.<br>Fairly simple to play as well.<br><br>On Fri, 
  30 Jun 2000, Sandy Wright wrote:<br>&gt; Tina,<br>&gt; I can only speak for 
  myself, but as a newbie, there are lots of things I would<br>&gt; like to see 
  on this list.<br>&gt; First of all, what server everyone plays on and 
  why?<br>&gt; What is the best class and race everyone has ever played?<br>&gt; 
  Are you in a guild, which one, and any other guild info?<br>&gt; Stories about 
  great RP adventures and worst mistakes.<br>&gt; General chatting and 
  fun.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I guess I will start with my basic info.<br>&gt; I play 
  on the Torvonnilous server, mostly because it has the fewest players<br>&gt; 
  usually.<br>&gt; My current fav character is a lvl 5 Druid Woodelf named 
  Linenu.<br>&gt; I usually play the &#39;good&#39; characters vs. the &#39;evil&#39; but i can 
  see where they<br>&gt; would be fun.<br>&gt; I have never tried the PvP 
  servers, and probably won&#39;t.<br>&gt; I am not in a guild but would like to be 
  someday.<br>&gt; Latest fun-last night I played for over 6 hours on and around 
  Orc hill with 3<br>&gt; other char.&nbsp; Kicked some major Orc booty!&nbsp; 
  and had fun talking and flirting<br>&gt; with the guys in my group. (I was the 
  only woman!)<br>&gt; Biggest mistake (so far!)-not putting all my ability 
  points into Wisdom for my<br>&gt; Druid when I started this character.<br>&gt; 
  In Real Life, I am a Kindergarten teacher in her late 30&#39;s.&nbsp; My 15 year 
  old<br>&gt; son is the one who started this game and then got me hooked.&nbsp; 
  Since I am out<br>&gt; of school for the summer, I have lots of time to 
  play.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know what I<br>&gt; will do in August when I go back to 
  work!!&nbsp; I wonder if I can play EQ during<br>&gt; recess and 
  lunch???!!!&nbsp; lol<br>&gt; I hope to hear from others on this list.<br>&gt;
