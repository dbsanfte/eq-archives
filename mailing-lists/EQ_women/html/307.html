<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683367468">Sorry -  wedding is on Quellious server, Temple of Marr in N. Freeport (we&#39;re elves and a<br/>
lot of my friends havn&#39;t gone past Faydwer yet while most of his live in HighHold).<br/>
Sunday, Aug. 7 at 5PM PDT (6PM Mountain, 7PM Central, 8PM Eastern).<br/>
<br/>
And I finished the last critical installment to the story before the wedding (there&#39;s a<br/>
couple of minor events including a rather petulant moment on my part lost and naked in N.<br/>
Karana *smile* and my friendship with a Troll which haven&#39;t been written up yet but they<br/>
may not get done until after the wedding).<br/>

&gt; I responded to this off Road Runner&#39;s so, this is just to say that I&#39;m 29.  &lt;giggles&gt;<br/>

&gt; Sara, Povar<br/>
&gt; And still looking forward to attending your wedding! I forgot to ask, where is it<br/>
&gt; going to be held at?<br/>

&gt; &gt; As my character is marrying on Sunday I must confess to a few minor qualms.  In<br/>
&gt; &gt; particular, er, how does one roleplay a honeymoon *smile*.  Unlike many who<br/>
&gt; &gt; develop relationships in Norrath, my beloved and I are unknown to one another in<br/>
&gt; &gt; RL.  For all I know he weighs 300 pounds, guzzles beer, and is hygenically<br/>
&gt; &gt; challenged *smile*<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There are times if I wonder if this is a positive thing to be doing.  I mean,<br/>
&gt; &gt; what if he is some starry eyed adolescent and I ruin him for life *grin*.  I know<br/>
&gt; &gt; MY lines are clearly drawn in fuzz (okay, I think I know the difference between<br/>
&gt; &gt; reality and fantasy though I swear I saw a Pixie Trickster in the airport the<br/>
&gt; &gt; other day *grin*).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, this is all fun and games and I am having fun.  But there is this part in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the back of my mind that wonders.  Because unlike reading romance novels (blech -<br/>
&gt; &gt; persish the thought) there is another person involved in my little fantasy and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; must never forget that.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Any other hard core role players out there struggle with these ridiculous<br/>
&gt; &gt; issues?  Any other players over the age of 25, for that matter *smile*<br/>
