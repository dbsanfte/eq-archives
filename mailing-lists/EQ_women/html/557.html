<div id="ygrps-yiv-557650819">I must agree, been playing it awhile and love it... have a 16 necro and a 18 <br/>
sorceress, necro is my favorite :-)<br/>
<br/>
The multiplayer isnt too bad... there are a few problems<br/>
<br/>
you can play on battlenet in 2 ways... Open games, and Realm games...<br/>
<br/>
Open games are played basically like Diablo 1 and open to all the cheating <br/>
you can imagine.<br/>
<br/>
Realm games are on Battlenet servers, your charcter are stord on th server <br/>
and games are ran on th server to prevent cheating.  The problem with this <br/>
though, they hav sub standard servers... and its basically impossible trying <br/>
to play on servers designed for a few thousand people when 50,000 is trying <br/>
to get on them...  I only play the single player, and direct conecting <br/>
TCP/IP with friends and forget the battlenet problems and cheaters<br/>
<br/>
but i startd playing this game over a week ago, nd hvent played EQ since... <br/>
thats kinda hard after being addicted to EQ since beta<br/>
