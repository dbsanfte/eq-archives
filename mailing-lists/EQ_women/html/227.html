<div id="ygrps-yiv-1417877787">What page is that on? I&#39;d be interested in taking a look at it.<br/>
<br/>
No worries.  I&#39;m still trying to find out whether people want to have it on<br/>
the first or the sixth? And it should last long enough for you to come join<br/>
us.......... =)<br/>

&gt;  Btw, have you<br/>
&gt; guys been to that page where EQ players can have their pics put up? I<br/>
&gt; went and had a look around and to my suprise half of the pics up there<br/>
&gt; were women! I&#39;m thinking maybe we aren&#39;t as rare as I had thought! :) I<br/>
&gt; just sent mine in today so maybe he will have it up in a couple days.<br/>
&gt; You guys have to go look at it, they&#39;re funny I promise. Ok, two of<br/>
&gt; them should make you laugh. One definitely will. *snickers*<br/>
&gt; I have a char already on Quellious and would be thrilled to get<br/>
&gt; together with ya&#39;ll. I hope the time is ok, I have a volunteer project<br/>
&gt; going on from July 26th to the 6th of August and won&#39;t be home until<br/>
&gt; after 6 those nights. If I can&#39;t make it, maybe we can plan for another<br/>
&gt; time again later? *Smiles* Happy Hunting!<br/>
