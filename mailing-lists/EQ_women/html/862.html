<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi, Muriel.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I&#39;m actually a lurker; I quit EQ two years ago, 
now... wow.&nbsp; Didn&#39;t realize so much time had passed.&nbsp; I was an early 
EQ&#39;er and made it through the first expansion pack, and then I went back to 
college, and decided I could do one or the other... not both.&nbsp; So I started 
Diablo 2 and a couple of other shooter-types to have something on which to take 
out my frustrations.&nbsp;&nbsp;You would&nbsp;be surprised at where you find 
women. ;-)&nbsp; I can frag with the best of &#39;em!</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I hesitate to give you advice on how to find a 
girlfriend for your son.&nbsp; I assume that you&#39;re talking about an online 
roleplay partner; there are some guilds that are active in roleplaying and 
someone might be intrigued by the idea.&nbsp; I&#39;d probably check out the 
different EQ sites to see if there are guild listings available still (I know I 
used to go to the Stratics sites a lot for Ultima Online, early EQ, and 
Asheron&#39;s Call, but haven&#39;t been there in a year or so).&nbsp; If there are, 
check out their charters and send an email to the membership officer to see if 
any of the members are interested.&nbsp; That&#39;s the best advice I can give 
you.&nbsp; Someone else may have other ideas--but either way, good 
luck!</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>Hi, I just joined.&nbsp; <br><br>My sons got me started 
  playing.&nbsp; The two oldest are much higher level <br>and not on my 
  server.&nbsp; My character is Leerah on Quellious because <br>that&#39;s where 
  some of my old D&amp;D buddies were.&nbsp; Level 33 wizard, just <br>started 
  in October of 2002.&nbsp; Two of my sons are lower level.&nbsp; One 
  <br>doesn&#39;t play because of his cerebral palsy.<br><br>I am looking for a 
  girlfriend for my 18 yr old son who plays a druid <br>(57) on Karana.&nbsp; He 
  has unrealistic expectations for a girlfriend and <br>I figure he isn&#39;t gonna&#39; 
  meet anyone with his nose in the computer all <br>the time.&nbsp; He also 
  plays Diablo3.&nbsp; I bet there are no women on there!<br><br>Muriel
