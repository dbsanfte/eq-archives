<div id="ygrps-yiv-19599413">Using the new interface you can create a window and then filter that <br/>
channel into that window. You can also set the default channel for that <br/>
window to be the chat channel. This sounds complex, but what it means is <br/>
you have a window just for talking to and listening to the chat channel.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t played eq in a while so I can&#39;t give more exact instructions <br/>
than this !<br/>
