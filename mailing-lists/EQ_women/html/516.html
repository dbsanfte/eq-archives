<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054879132">Hello again,<br/>
I hope I am not being a pest, but I would like some info on Guilds.<br/>
What exactly do they do?  How do you find out which one is right for<br/>
you?  Should a newbie consider joining one, or wait until higher level.<br/>
BTW, someone said they started playing this game after their boyfriend<br/>
got them hooked.  Well, My 15 year old son is the one who got me<br/>
started!  Pretty sad, huh? lol<br/>
Thanks for your help,<br/>
<br/>
