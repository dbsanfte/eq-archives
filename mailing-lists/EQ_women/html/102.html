<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374825214">Just remember when twinking your lowbies that their corpse will decay in a half<br/>
hour after death until you&#39;re level 6.. There are almost no situations where the<br/>
GM&#39;s can reimburse your stuff, even if you lose your stuff to a bug all they&#39;ll<br/>
give you is a &quot;leg up&quot; kit which is probably going to be cloth armor.. so I<br/>
suggest not even giving them any &#39;goodies&#39; except money to buy spells with until<br/>
then.  I&#39;ve seen tooooo many people lose good stuff this way.<br/>
