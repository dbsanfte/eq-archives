<b>Subject:</b> Petition for less revealing clothing? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1818378824">As most of you know an Everquets expansion is going to come out around<br/>
Christmas.  One of the things I&#39;d like to set up is a petition to get<br/>
less revealing clothing options for everquest characters.  In particular,<br/>
I think you should be able to set your newbie (naked) clothing to be something<br/>
better than, for example, a dark elf bikini.  It would also be nice if you<br/>
didn&#39;t have to wear plate mail before you could get armor that didn&#39;t look<br/>
like fine mesh with an exposed neckline.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d want this to be an online petition, maybe associated with one of the<br/>
Everquest websites.  Does anyone know if any of those sites have those<br/>
sorts of things? I&#39;ve seen lots of &#39;polls&#39; (but really I don&#39;t want to do<br/>
this as a poll, otherwise all the 16 year old boys will vote no).  I want<br/>
something where you can submit a form I guess.<br/>
