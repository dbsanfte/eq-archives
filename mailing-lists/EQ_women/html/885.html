<div id="ygrps-yiv-30420110">Soooooooo... what was the question?  The generation gap causing difficulties<br/>
later on?  That&#39;s really the only thing you have to think about.  I dated<br/>
someone 14 years older than me and since our life experiences were so<br/>
different, and our aims and goals so different, we were unable to resolve<br/>
our disparity.  Of course, we couldn&#39;t tell that at the beginning of the<br/>
relationship.  It took three years out of our lives and caused a great deal<br/>
of anguish, as neither of us could forgive the other for not bridging that<br/>
gap more perfectly.  Like I said (IMO), that&#39;s the big question.  The only<br/>
question, actually.<br/>

Subject: [EQ_women] Perfect place for this question<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Ok, to keep with this same line of thought ~ of &quot;hooking up&quot; on EQ.<br/>
&gt; I am 43 and have been playing EQ for about a year. A friend got me<br/>
&gt; into the game, and I played it just as a game. I don&#39;t think I<br/>
&gt; realized how much I looked forward to running into certain<br/>
&gt; friends/characters in the game. I have made what I feel to be many<br/>
&gt; good friendships. Ok to the question. One friend that I felt very<br/>
&gt; close to became closer. We talked on the phone and kept in touch<br/>
&gt; almost everyday. I am divorced and single and he is single. He came<br/>
&gt; to Arizona to visit me and sure one thing led to another and the<br/>
&gt; rest is history. We are both wildly happy and in love, want to spend<br/>
&gt; the rest of our lives together and fade into the sunset happily ever<br/>
&gt; after. Here is my dilema ~ like I said I am 43, a young 43 (and its<br/>
&gt; not me saying that) my picture is on my profile ~ he is 20, a very<br/>
&gt; mature, responsible 20 but none the less 20. What in the hell do I<br/>
&gt; do??? Most of me wants to say screw what others might think and just<br/>
&gt; be happy with him, but the rest of me says leave him to live his<br/>
&gt; life. When I discuss that with him he just says stop trying to find<br/>
&gt; excuses why we can&#39;t be together and just be happy. How can I argue<br/>
&gt; with that??? Some advice ladies?? please<br/>
