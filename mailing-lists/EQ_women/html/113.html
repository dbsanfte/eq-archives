<div id="ygrps-yiv-299334235">Greetings! I play on Povar, myself; a wood elf ranger named Sara. Level 12 was tough for me, but I was on Feydwer most of the time, so I did Crushbone and beat up on the bandits in Lesser Faydark.........always grouped. &lt;grins&gt;<br/>

&gt; Hello fellow questers.  This is my first post since joining the group. I am a 24 year old female from New Jersey who will be married in Oct.  I am a Everquest addict.  I was wondering how many here also play on Xeqony?  Also, I play a druid her name is Renaya, I just leveled to 12.  Does anyone here have helpful hints for where there is good hunting for druids?<br/>
