<div id="ygrps-yiv-183698987">Hi ya&#39;ll. My character&#39;s name is Guerilla, currently a level 9 human <br/>
Paladin on the Tunare server. The name is a Spanish one, like all the chat <br/>
and character names I use on online, including my other EQ characters. I <br/>
was raised in South America where I learned to speak Spanish fluently. <br/>
French is my third language.<br/>
<br/>
	Guerilla has a double meaning, Literally it means small war, but it also <br/>
connotes the term &quot;guerilla fighters,&quot; those who, often against <br/>
overwhelming odds, fight repressive governments on behalf of the poor and <br/>
defenseless. This suits my EQ game character, a paladin, well. It also <br/>
represents my poltical ideals in real life where I have spent the last 25 <br/>
years working in and with high poverty schools in my role as a teacher, <br/>
principal, and (most currently) educational reformer. It&#39;s often me, the <br/>
little guy (gal), against the giant,  the school or educational system I&#39;m <br/>
trying to reform so that poor, non-English speaking, and other <br/>
disadvantaged children can have a real chance in life.<br/>
<br/>
	I love role playing games because they remind me of the legends and fairy <br/>
tales I passionately devoured as a child. EQ is the first one I&#39;ve played <br/>
online. I&#39;ve noticed that the many male characters react differently to me <br/>
than they do to each other. Sometimes that&#39;s good because I do enjoy the <br/>
occasional light flirting, the compliments, small gifts, the being saved <br/>
from danger, etc. but sometimes it&#39;s bad because they over-protect and do <br/>
not let me kill the monsters I can handle myself, often under-estimating my <br/>
capabilities. Also, sometimes I know the answer to questions and problems <br/>
but some, (not all) male characters do not listen well to me because they <br/>
do not expect me to know. Just like real life, huh, sisters?<br/>
<br/>
	As for the flirting, romantic side of the game, as a 48 year old married <br/>
woman with a 16 year old son, I wonder what the guys would think if they <br/>
knew my age and/or marital status. Probably most of them are half my age <br/>
and single. Actually they seem more interested in the age issue. No one has <br/>
ever asked me if I&#39;m married, but the first person I ever contacted online <br/>
asked me my age. He turned out to be 13. On EQ if they ask I usually tell <br/>
them, &quot;I&#39;m too old for you. Just call me mom.&quot; Most reply ROFL and we go <br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
	Do you, the rest of my sisters, get regular questions about your age and <br/>
marital status? What do you reply? The truth, a lie, none of your business? <br/>
Interested in hearing how you deal with the issue.<br/>
