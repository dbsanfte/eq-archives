<b>Subject:</b> Crossdressing in Eq... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1682329235">I know this issue has been covered before, but I recently read an <br/>
article by a student studying psychology (www.students.haverford.edu) <br/>
based on his own survey of players. He calculated that half the <br/>
female characters on EQ at any time are played  by males, but very <br/>
few women play male personae. This seems odd, but I have to say that <br/>
I have very little interest in playing male characters, and it seems <br/>
that I am far from alone in this. Is our researcher correct, do you <br/>
think?<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, I wondered if I could tell which females were  male, and <br/>
I conclude that, on the whole, I can&#39;t, if they don&#39;t want me to. <br/>
Sure, there are boys who give the game away with abuse and bad <br/>
language (or am I just stereotyping boyish behaviour?) and a <br/>
proportion making their gender clear (the surname Crossdresser was a <br/>
giveaway,I though ;), but on the whole, I have no idea. To be honest, <br/>
the only ones I really assume to be women are those who keep going <br/>
afk to deal with domestic issues; more stereotyping?<br/>
<br/>
Just a few thoughts, if anyone is still there.....<br/>
Love,<br/>
