What I did was call my bank and find out what day my card was charged...
it took them five days from the date I ordered it to even acknowledge that
they processed me, and then it took another 5 days to receive it.&nbsp;
Now, that didn&#39;t surprise me, because I requested Ground, but it came Next
Day Air?? That better be free...

all the way through to getting to hold at the 800 number.&nbsp; This after
3 days of calling, once getting through to be told &quot;everyone will get their
order&quot; and then hung up on.
<p>Oh, and just called.&nbsp; They have no record of my order.&nbsp; However,
I cannot order again because I&#39;ve already ordered and no, the shipping
company people can&#39;t do anything, I have to call Sony.&nbsp; But, of course,
Sony can&#39;t do anything I have to call the shipping company.
<p>Sorry, this IS a rant.&nbsp; I have had a lot of respect for Verant
in the past, but the way they have handled Kunark is totally and completely
unacceptable.&nbsp; A valuable lesson in how NOT to handle customer support.
