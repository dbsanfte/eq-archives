<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081257442">If only there were more hours in the day.... My DAOC account is <br/>
witting woefully unattended right now =( All my time is spent raiding<br/>
with my 60 ranger on Tholuxe. It&#39;s fun, but I would love to try<br/>
DAOC some. Some of my friends who quit EQ are level 40 now in DAOC!<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m playing Dark Ages of Camelot now for a change of pace and FINALLY picked<br/>
&gt; my primary character - an Armswoman.  She&#39;s my first tank and it&#39;s really fun<br/>
&gt; to have hit points and actually care about armor and weapons.  I am one last<br/>
&gt; step away from my crossbow quest but still need 3 levels to acquire the skill.<br/>
&gt;  I play in Albion on Percival.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, and Christina, I did get my Warden to 4 on Morgan Le Fay, but after my<br/>
&gt; frist RvR experience, gonna try to settle on one character until I can do some<br/>
&gt; damage.  Hibernia took two of our keeps and made an assault on Snowdonia<br/>
&gt; Station so there was a massive call to arms.  At 11 all I could do was<br/>
&gt; interrupt their lowest caster and I didn&#39;t succeed in doing that more than<br/>
&gt; once *sigh*  Our RvR leadership is PATHETIC!  But it was a lot of fun<br/>
&gt; nonetheless.<br/>
