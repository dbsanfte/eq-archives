<br/>
I have been playing EQ on my PC for about a year. I am 43, mother of <br/>
3 grown kids and have always been a gamer. I also play EQ ~ PS2 as I <br/>
was involved in the beta on that one. <br/>
<br/>
I often think the people I&#39;m grouped with are all 14 or 15 only to <br/>
find out that I&#39;m wrong and most of the group is my age let alone <br/>
there being a female in the bunch. <br/>
<br/>
I too have built both of my PC&#39;s only because I couldnt really find <br/>
one that had what I wanted in it for less that and arm and a leg. <br/>
Nope not into tech in the real world, I&#39;m a full time Paramedic~ so <br/>
I guess that&#39;s why I save lives one day and kill the next =)<br/>
<br/>
I play on Brell and Torvonnilous ~ anyone here play on those??<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to grouping with some of you<br/>
<br/>
