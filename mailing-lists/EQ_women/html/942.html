&gt;Dave,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is the way I look at the situation...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-Your wife played 18 hours a day, neglecting life in<br/>
&gt;general, not sleeping or communicating with her<br/>
&gt;husband or family, or pretty much avoiding them.  Did<br/>
&gt;it occur to you that there was likely a problem before<br/>
&gt;she started playing EQ?  As with any sort of game,<br/>
&gt;book, or even television, it can be a wonderful tool<br/>
&gt;to relax and get away from the trials of life.  Some<br/>
&gt;people get carried away with it and you must look at<br/>
&gt;it from an outside view.  What made her feel like life<br/>
&gt;was so much more bearable in the EQ world?  Have you<br/>
&gt;considered that there may have been a communication<br/>
&gt;problem before she started playing?  That maybe<br/>
&gt;something was bothering her?  Did you even ask?  Or<br/>
&gt;perhaps you did...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As for snooping through her files...  This tells me<br/>
&gt;that you had lost trust for her and beyond that,<br/>
&gt;communication.  As far as I am concerned, this problem<br/>
&gt;really had nothing to do with EQ other than it being<br/>
&gt;the medium she used to escape whatever the problem<br/>
&gt;was.  It could have been anything, really.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Instead of hopping on an EQ forum tossing out advice<br/>
&gt;or warning, consider what it is that you really are<br/>
&gt;telling us.  Buecause I am not so sure that it occures<br/>
&gt;to you that 9 chances out of 10 the problem was hidden<br/>
&gt;there far before she started playing EQ and it just<br/>
&gt;then became noticable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have been happily married for 7 years and during<br/>
&gt;that time, I have found myself getting deep into<br/>
&gt;something (Artwork, reading, webpages... never EQ)<br/>
&gt;when I was experiencing trials in my marriage.  After<br/>
&gt;we would work things out and get our communication<br/>
&gt;back, I found that those things were not nearly as<br/>
&gt;intriguing to me and I would much rather spend time<br/>
&gt;with my Husband.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So tossing the medium (EQ in this case) aside, a far<br/>
&gt;better warning would be &quot;Be careful not to let<br/>
&gt;communication and happiness with your family slip<br/>
&gt;through the cracks for so long that you get wrapped up<br/>
&gt;in another world&quot;.  Instead of saying, &quot;She turned<br/>
&gt;away from her family because of EQ!&quot;  Say &quot;We stopped<br/>
&gt;communicating and grew unhappy so she turned to EQ&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is not putting the blame on you, for<br/>
&gt;communication takes 2 or more people.  It is just as<br/>
&gt;much her fault as your own.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; I pour out my life story of my marriage to an EQ<br/>
&gt; &gt; fiend, who stopped<br/>
&gt; &gt; everything else in her life for a game...and you<br/>
&gt; &gt; find my snooping to<br/>
&gt; &gt; be disturbing??  All depends on your point of view,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I guess...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Never found any evidence of any online or RL affairs<br/>
&gt; &gt; (as many EQ<br/>
&gt; &gt; widows and widowers have experienced); just line<br/>
&gt; &gt; after line of<br/>
&gt; &gt; insipid dribble about ports, spells, gear, etc,<br/>
&gt; &gt; occassionally<br/>
&gt; &gt; puncuated by a nasty reference to me (&quot;Hubby getting<br/>
&gt; &gt; upset again<br/>
&gt; &gt; better log soon :( &quot;)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Oh, and as for the Lexus...sorry, can&#39;t help you<br/>
&gt; &gt; there.  In fact,<br/>
&gt; &gt; when ours is done, we&#39;ll likely have to replace it<br/>
&gt; &gt; with a Toyota or<br/>
&gt; &gt; Nissan; since she quit her $30K job back in 2000 to<br/>
&gt; &gt; play UO (then EQ)<br/>
&gt; &gt; fulltime, some cutbacks have become necessary.<br/>
