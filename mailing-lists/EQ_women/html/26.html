<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941520250">I&#39;m a level 41 gnome Rogue on Rathe.  I used to get flirted with a lot but<br/>
mostly guys talking about how &quot;cute&quot; I am since I&#39;m so tiny, but a fierce<br/>
little fighter.  I&#39;m married to a wonderful Wood Elf Ranger named Kinien now<br/>
and most everyone who knows me knows that I&#39;m married, but my friends still<br/>
flirt with me a bit. =)  When most people see me they comment on my cuteness<br/>
and level, but since I&#39;m not one of the &#39;sexier&#39; races getting I rarely get<br/>
flirted with right away =)<br/>
I do get hit with &quot;r u a girl in RL?&quot; a lot though =) Usually by the time they<br/>
inspect my equipment and see that wedding ring they realize I&#39;m &quot;off limits&quot;<br/>
