<div id="ygrps-yiv-160270609">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
First, thanks to everyone who showed up last night to help get the guild<br/>
creation process going.  The guild still needs to be approved, and that<br/>
might take another week.<br/>
<br/>
I think I may have jumped the gun a little in moving the guild creation<br/>
process forward so quickly, but I wanted to get us all able to play as<br/>
quickly as possible.  I&#39;d like to encourage continued discussion of what<br/>
we want as a guild.  In the mean time, I&#39;d like to use the Sisterhood of<br/>
Erollisi as our guild.  If ultimately there is a clear message that this<br/>
is not a good guild for us, we can then all move to a different guild<br/>
(hopefully just getting our named changed).  I encouage people to post<br/>
alternative names to this list for consideration.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been very interested by the discussion of the historical context of<br/>
being a priestess of a love goddess.  I have a few comments with regards<br/>
to this.<br/>
<br/>
First, I&#39;ve heard expressed concern that being a Sister of &#39;Love&#39; will<br/>
spark inane comments from little boys.  This is a valid concern, but in<br/>
and of itself I don&#39;t think it&#39;s sufficient to invalidate the suitability<br/>
of the name.  I don&#39;t like restricting what I do based on how I feel<br/>
inane little boys will act.  Lets face it...little boys are little boys.<br/>
<br/>
Second, regarding the mythological context of Erollisi, I think there is a<br/>
lot of room for us to define for ourselves what it means to be a follower<br/>
of Erollisi.  I don&#39;t feel we&#39;re locked into being ritualistic<br/>
prostitiutes.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding chastity, I think it&#39;s fairly clear that the guild members don&#39;t<br/>
want to have any assumption or implication of chastity on them from a role<br/>
playing context.  To this regard I&#39;d like to withdraw my suggestion of<br/>
chastity as a basis in role play.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding Men, I also think it&#39;s clear that people don&#39;t want them seen as<br/>
the protectors of the sisters.  I&#39;d like to withdraw that proposed role<br/>
for them, and the title of Warder which might imply it (I&#39;ll try to come<br/>
up with another title).<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, discussions can go on forever and eventually become pointless 8)<br/>
To that regards I&#39;d like to put a limitation on the discussion of guild<br/>
name and guild charter to Saturday.  I&#39;ll do my best to listen to what is<br/>
said on this list, and reflect it in the name and charter of the guild.<br/>
<br/>
The real purpose of this guild is to give us an environment with which to<br/>
play EverQuest together, so lets not forget that! 8)<br/>
