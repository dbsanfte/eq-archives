<div id="ygrps-yiv-739196736">About the cleric thing here. I play a level 10 cleric. With one group I was<br/>
told I would do NOTHING but sit back and heal the tanks. Well you can<br/>
imagine how that went over with me. With my current group (my husband and an<br/>
RL friend of ours [all playing females mind you]) I get right in there with<br/>
them and fight when I am needed and then I back out and heal their happy<br/>
little fannies when that is needed. I am also pretty good with that<br/>
strike/fuor and root hot keys. They see me more than just a healer and I am<br/>
glad of that because my husband doesn&#39;t like sleeping on the couch all that<br/>
much. It took a lot of fighting to prove that I can do both but now I feel<br/>
like I am an intrigal part of the group because I CAN fight and heal at the<br/>
same time.<br/>
