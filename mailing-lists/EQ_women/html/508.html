<div id="ygrps-yiv-2120108820">One simple way to measure the effectiveness of a weapon is by its<br/>
damage/delay ratio.  For example, a fine steel two handed sword is 12 dmg<br/>
43 delay for a ratio of 0.28.  A fine steel longsword is 6 damage 28 delay<br/>
for a ratio of 0.21.  This means you&#39;ll do about 30% more damage on<br/>
average with the two handed weapon.  Bashing does help to close that<br/>
difference, but my experience has been that it&#39;s a small amount of your<br/>
total damage output.<br/>
<br/>
At high levels (50+) it gets much more complicated because the minimum<br/>
damage a weapon can do is based primarily on your level, and not on the<br/>
weapon, which gives an advantage to small fast weapons.<br/>
