<b>Subject:</b> RE: Re: Ideas for Womens Guild <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819540814">I&#39;ve started a couple of characters on Brell (I like the idea of being on an<br/>
RP server independent of the guild).  So far I&#39;m not sure what I have would<br/>
fit in with a &quot;Sisters of Erollisi&quot; concept.  Though female .. none are<br/>
&quot;love&quot; oriented, though only one is truely evil.<br/>
<br/>
I should be able to be in the chat tonight ... perhaps when I see the mix<br/>
of other races/classes I&#39;ll come up with something to compliment that will<br/>
fit.  But I do wonder how we will manage a bunch of &quot;Sisters of Love&quot; ;P  I<br/>
also have disagreement with how EQ set up the current Sisters from an RP<br/>
angle (well said already), but I don&#39;t want to inherit that confusion.<br/>
While I like the structure of the guild proposed ... would it be possible<br/>
to be Sisters of {Something Else}?  Then we could set up our own RP angle<br/>
without confusion with an existing NPC order?   I also think harassment<br/>
from non-RPing males may be enhanced if our charter mentions the<br/>
(non-chaste Sisters of Love), since as already said, historically that<br/>
meant public sex, or prostitution, usually religiously done in the name of<br/>
fertility.  As well, the NPC sisters are wood elf warriors who follow<br/>
Erollisi, interestingly not a PC option.  And another RP oddity I noticed<br/>
... the Marr twins created Barbarians, and planted &quot;the seed&quot; from which<br/>
humans evolved from Barbarians, however Barbarians cannot worship the<br/>
Marr&#39;s, though most humans can.  (Sorry, a good friend of mine was in<br/>
charge of &quot;consistency&quot; for many plays ... she got me in the habit of<br/>
spotting these little odd things).  I just think EQ didn&#39;t think the<br/>
existing sisters out as well as Christina Norman did :P .  <br/>
<br/>
Tunare is the only other female godess ...<br/>
or what do we stand for?  Love?  Goodness?  Comraderie?  Valor?  Triumph?<br/>

&quot;The female is always the more deadly ...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the chastity thing comes from Roman warrior&#39;s beliefs.  And it only<br/>
applied to MALES.  Though the commanders were probably correct in the<br/>
belief.  Chaste warriors had nothing to come home to so *should* on average<br/>
fight more valiantly than one who wanted to live to see his child born :)<br/>
The concept spread through Europe and the knighthoods due to early Roman<br/>
cultural influences and the fact that &quot;adapting&quot; it to a religious<br/>
requirement of knighthood gave the early Christian Church as stronger basis<br/>
in the military (a must for political survival).  But mixing this with a<br/>
bunch or warriors of love?</div>
