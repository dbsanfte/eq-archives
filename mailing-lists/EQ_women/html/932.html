<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737993215">lol you gave him more courtesy than i would have...  dude, you sound like an <br/>
utter loser (not u dr. mom, dave...)  i am QUITE happy spending time on EQ <br/>
rather than w/ my family...  i am 25 years old and the only person my age <br/>
smart enough not to have children when i didnt want them (or couldnt take <br/>
care of them because of my drug/booze/sex problem)...  As far as MY mother <br/>
goes, she&#39;s recently divorced (and i had to go to her 47th cake-and-icecream <br/>
birthday party w/ HER parents this weekend) and quite insane.  Her <br/>
self-worth comes from &quot;knowin&#39; that when i walk into a bar that i&#39;m the best <br/>
lookin&#39; woman there&quot; and sleeping with as many drunken mechanics as she can <br/>
in one weekend...  My 21 year old brother who still lives with her is on <br/>
some HEAVY ass drugs (they can make him walk home from a 70mph collision and <br/>
go to sleep, but make him angry when the police wake him up to come clean up <br/>
the dmg done..*amazingly no charges were pressed in that matter*)...  My <br/>
dear sister...  well i promised never to talk about her hehehehe....  really <br/>
i did...  Anything I write about her has to be approved for public <br/>
release...  even a yahoogroup...  Now...  What I&#39;m doing when I should be <br/>
tending to my family...  I am lvling a necro of course, and also GOING TO <br/>
COLLEGE so that i wont make the thrilling 2.17 an hour of a waitress for the <br/>
rest of my accursed days.  So shame on us!  Shame on us women who have less <br/>
than perfect families where mothers are sluts and brothers fight cops and <br/>
husbands whine like toddlers over the slightest diversion of a wife&#39;s <br/>
attention.  Shame on us for needing an escape!  (btw, my bf has a 63 cleric <br/>
*yes RL bf we live together and life is good*)....  Doc, i wouldnt give this <br/>
&quot;dave&quot; fellow any more info...  he&#39;s obviously in the wrong group.....  <br/>
TAKING SUGGESTIONS FOR WHAT GROUP DAVE SHOULD JOIN!!!  I would vote...  <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are several lists on Yahoo for family members who feel that<br/>
&gt;their loved one has an internet addiction.  Apparently, she felt<br/>
&gt;that she was needed more online than off.  You probably made her<br/>
&gt;feel as if you didn&#39;t care about her anymore.  Her guildies did.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Frankly, at 47 yrs old, I have seen enough fireworks (twice a year<br/>
&gt;off my back deck.)  I have no other family alive except the hubby<br/>
&gt;and the kids.  (And his family is in California.  I don&#39;t go along<br/>
&gt;because 5 hour plane rides are bad for my health.)  And parades are<br/>
&gt;just flat-out boring.  I DO have hot, fresh food every night for<br/>
&gt;the boys.  I am a substitute teacher, part-time grad. student,<br/>
&gt;computer repair technician, run 17 yahoo groups and do nutritional<br/>
&gt;consulting.  I got into EQ so I would have something to talk about<br/>
&gt;with my boys who are also bored by parades.  Maybe the real world<br/>
&gt;just isn&#39;t as challenging as learning to &quot;swim&quot; underwater in a 3-D<br/>
&gt;castle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Having them at their father&#39;s, on the weekends, really helps my<br/>
&gt;relationship with my husband and allows me to have a really clean<br/>
&gt;house for two days a week.  He just lets them sit around and watch<br/>
&gt;tv all the time.  At least when they are playing EQ, they are<br/>
&gt;thinking.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Your reminder is well-taken though as my hubby does sometimes feel<br/>
&gt;neglected because I am not ready when he is.<br/>
