<div id="ygrps-yiv-1384695626">So anyway, I missed the darned guild meeting. &lt;sighs&gt; I really need to plan<br/>
my vacations better.  Someone please tell me how it went and whether we will<br/>
be doing a get together every Monday, because I&#39;d really like to get a<br/>
character going on Brell for that purpose.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t gone to Tallon Zek yet.  As most of you know, I&#39;ve got a character<br/>
on Rallos Zek, and I have had great fun playing her, but truth to tell, I<br/>
haven&#39;t played her in a loooong time and haven&#39;t leveled her to the point<br/>
where PvP becomes reality.  Has anyone played Tallon to any extent? My<br/>
primary is going through some pretty heavy stuff, and I don&#39;t really have<br/>
the time for another char, but if it&#39;s something we all want to explore, I<br/>
will...<br/>

&gt;&gt;It&#39;s been a little quiet here lately so I&#39;m going to suggest a little Q&A<br/>
&gt;&gt;to get some chatter going. </span></blockquote></div>
