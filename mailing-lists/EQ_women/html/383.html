<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334766298">I have yet to take a character over 15, so I probably shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
responding to this post, but I&#39;m bored and wanted &#39;someone to talk to&#39;.<br/>
;)  I don&#39;t play very much, and I used to be a roleplayer extreme.  I<br/>
took my main character, Sara, gave her a great story line, including the<br/>
reason a Wood Elf had a human name, and then decided to roleplay it<br/>
out... which meant re-starting her with her Elven name so that when the<br/>
original character completed a certain quest, she would earn the right<br/>
to be called by her Elven name.  So I stopped Sara at 15 and started<br/>
this one (Aelwesara), who is currently 13.  So, if I think of how<br/>
serious an effort my online partner and I have put into getting my new<br/>
one up to 13... I could have been level 25, 26? Maybe higher?  &lt;sighs&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m having fun, and indulging what I like best.  If I never get a<br/>
character higher than 20, and I am still enjoying myself, I&#39;ll consider<br/>
my ten bucks a month well-spent.<br/>

&gt; forever to earn experience and one death can take away hours and hours<br/>
&gt; of playtime gaining that experience.  The equipment is extremely<br/>
&gt; exepensive IF you can find it, and the places where you can get good<br/>
&gt; loot drops are heavily camped.  Kill Stealing is not a game I like to<br/>
&gt; play, though my wizard is very good at it *grin*.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How do you get past the boredom at 20 stage enough to move forward<br/>
&gt; into the higher levels where there isn&#39;t so much overcamping and<br/>
&gt; competition?<br/>
