<div id="ygrps-yiv-674120089">I know I have no interest in playing a boy at all.  I don&#39;t like the way<br/>
boys relate to eachother.  I know a bit about this because I have<br/>
interacted with people who assumed I was a boy (even though I was playing<br/>
a girl character).  I just get weird vibes whenever a boy is relating to<br/>
me in an obvious &quot;boy&quot; way.  I don&#39;t know why, it&#39;s just icky.<br/>
<br/>
If you play a boy and act girly, you come off as being fruity, and in<br/>
Everquest this is something that people either find funny or annoying, but<br/>
it&#39;s not something I think that can be just ignored.  A few times I have<br/>
played my boyfriend&#39;s cleric, and continuing to act like myself, it&#39;s just<br/>
weird I think.<br/>
<br/>
I think if you are a &#39;quiet&#39; type, it can be easier.  I&#39;ve noticed that<br/>
some of the boys who play girls who do it the best are the quiet types.<br/>
If you&#39;re not constantly emoting your feelings, or actively stimulating<br/>
conversation, you don&#39;t send out as many gender cues.  I theorize thus<br/>
that a quiet person will probably find it easiest to play the other<br/>
gender, and will not cause waves when they do so.<br/>
<br/>
I am not a quiet person.  I am constantly emoting, talking, chattering,<br/>
whatever.  If I have to stay still for very long I usually end up running<br/>
around in circles for no reason.<br/>
<br/>
I once played a friend&#39;s bard for a Nagafen raid.  I decided to have some<br/>
fun with that and played him in a very stereotypically gay way.  I made<br/>
sure everyone knew I was playing him.  I didn&#39;t do anything rude, I just<br/>
phrased things in a sterotypical way, expressed a lot of affection to<br/>
other boys, made positive comments about hair and clothing to girls, silly<br/>
stuff like that.  People generally went along with it and had some fun,<br/>
though I probably made some of the boys uncomfortable.  I think it is kind<br/>
of funny that even if we know the gender of the person behind the<br/>
character, we still tend to relate to them strongly as the gender of the<br/>
character.  I believe someone else commented on that, saying that they<br/>
didn&#39;t feel comfortable flirting with their husband when he was playing a<br/>
female character.  Kind of interesting.<br/>

&gt; contemplated giving it a try, but to be perfectly honest, I&#39;m not sure I<br/>
&gt; want to explore trying to RPG a male.  I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s a good<br/>
&gt; thing.  I think it may represent a very real limitation on my take of<br/>

&gt; Anyone out there try? </span></blockquote></div>
