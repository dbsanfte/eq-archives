<br/>
Another question for you or anyone.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard that once you reach 10th lvl that dieing<br/>
becomes more of an issue in that when you die you have<br/>
to find your body within a certain time frame (7 days)<br/>
or you lose all the stuff you had on.<br/>
:o/<br/>
Right now I&#39;m 9th lvl but this has got me a little<br/>
worried. Are there any good tricks to make sure that I<br/>
will be able to find myself after 10th lvl?<br/>
:o)<br/>
Also, what happens if you die in the ocean.<br/>
<br/>
The other day my wood Elf was exploring near Freeport<br/>
and this Dark Elf was standing there next to the wall.<br/>
When I got near they attacked me. I tried to swim for<br/>
it back to where I knew some guards were but they hit<br/>
me while I was swimming and I woke up next to the soul<br/>
binder. :o)<br/>
What would happen once I am 10th level. Would I have<br/>
to go deep sea diving?<br/>
Just curious?<br/>
<br/>
:o)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I sent a long post the other day and hoped on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; list today only to <br/>
&gt; &gt; realize that it had not made it to this list at<br/>
&gt; all.<br/>
&gt; &gt; In fact, <br/>
&gt; &gt; apparently my last couple of posts didn&#39;t make it<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the list.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Sometimes I can be so dumb . . . but I can&#39;t help<br/>
&gt; &gt; but wonder where I <br/>
&gt; &gt; sent the crazy things.<br/>
&gt; &gt; :o)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, a little question for anyone who might<br/>
&gt; think<br/>
&gt; &gt; about <br/>
&gt; &gt; answering . . .<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Is there a level limit you need to be to get<br/>
&gt; married<br/>
&gt; &gt; in EQ? What are <br/>
&gt; &gt; the advantages and or disadvantages of tying the<br/>
&gt; EQ<br/>
&gt; &gt; knot?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; :o)<br/>
