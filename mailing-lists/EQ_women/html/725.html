<div id="ygrps-yiv-109457408">Hmm ok all about Luclin in a few easy words.<br/>
<br/>
Beautiful new graphics. Friendly kitties. Beastlords. If you don&#39;t have a<br/>
lot of time to play, I would suggest making a new Vah&#39;shir Beastlord, that<br/>
way you get to experience the new class, the friendly kitties, and the new<br/>
graphics all at once.<br/>
<br/>
Luclin is seriously hard on your computer system, but hey, wasn&#39;t it about<br/>
time you upgraded anyway? =o<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re on a budget, and need to upgrade, I can make some<br/>
recommendations.<br/>
<br/>
1. Geforce 2MX graphics card. You can get these for like $50-100. They<br/>
are low end for Luclin but they will get the job done. If you have money<br/>
get a Geforce 3 TI 200, or a ATI Radeon 8500.<br/>
<br/>
2. Ram. You can get 256mb of ram for about $25 these days. You want to<br/>
upgrade to 512mb or so (which is about $50). For most people you just want<br/>
to buy one 512mb memory chip and stick it in your computer. Some computers<br/>
don&#39;t like mixing ram, but that&#39;s ok, just throw out whatever was in there<br/>
originally. Of course, not all kinds of computers use the same ram, so you<br/>
may have to go back to the place you bought it for the upgrade to make<br/>
sure you get the right ram.<br/>
<br/>
The most fun I have had in luclin honestly has been playing with my<br/>
character&#39;s look =) Looks like it&#39;s going to be fun though.<br/>
