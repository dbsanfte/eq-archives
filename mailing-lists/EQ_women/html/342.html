<b>Subject:</b> Questions? Answers? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1601852364">It&#39;s been a little quiet here lately so I&#39;m going to suggest a little Q&A<br/>
to get some chatter going.<br/>
<br/>
So, anyone have any questions? Any wisdom to share? <br/>
<br/>
My best area of expertise is probably Enchanters and Druids.  So for<br/>
example if anyone has questions about playing those, I could probably<br/>
help<br/>
