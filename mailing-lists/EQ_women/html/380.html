<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-425285974">Oh, wow, congratulations!!!!  This is wonderful news.  Please let us know when<br/>
you finalize your plans.  A friend of mine just recently got married in the<br/>
forest outside Erud, and we kept having to kill an NPC necromancer.  During<br/>
the ceremony.   =P<br/>
Anyway, congrats again!<br/>
Love,<br/>
Aelwesara/Sara, Povar<br/>

&gt; I never intended to get married in EQ, but somehow it has happened.  Luna<br/>
&gt; my 50th level enchanter will be marrying Duna a 45th level monk on Brell<br/>
&gt; Serelis. Details of the wedding have not been finalized, but it will<br/>
&gt; probably happen in about two weeks.  I&#39;ll try and post more information to<br/>
&gt; the list when I get it.  We may be married in the throne room of King<br/>
&gt; Tranix the fire giant, in which case attendence of the wedding would be<br/>
&gt; limited to those levels 40+.  We may have a more mundane wedding, in which<br/>
&gt; case I would like to invite everyone to attend.  I think a nice alternate<br/>
&gt; wedding spot would be the erollisi sisters island, only I&#39;m worried some<br/>
&gt; of the guests would be KOS =/ Nothing makes a wedding suck more than NPCs<br/>
&gt; trying to kill your friends. </span></blockquote></div>
