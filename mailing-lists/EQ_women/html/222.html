<div id="ygrps-yiv-499714452">Hi everyone! I&#39;ve been reading the list for a while and I wanted to <br/>
introduce myself. My main character is Elahana (Eudrite cleric)on the Bertxo <br/>
server. I play with my boyfriend and my other roommate. We have a really <br/>
great group. My boyfriend plays a human monk and my roommate plays a Edurite <br/>
wizard. It seems like we&#39;ve been all over the world. Most recently we&#39;ve <br/>
been to Unrest and to BlackBurrow. I really enjoy playing Everquest. It&#39;s <br/>
not at all like the other rpgs I have played. Most of the ones I played were <br/>
text based. (gemstone) Anyway, If anyone else is on the Bertox server I <br/>
would love to hear from you!<br/>
<br/>
Elahana (Romney)</div>
