<div id="ygrps-yiv-1612266916">Gift giving amongst guildmates is NOT twinking, unless a level one ends up<br/>
with a screaming mace and complete banded...hehe....I just got to the point<br/>
where I could &quot;pay back&quot; my brothers for gifting me with some of my armor<br/>
and my bow.  I figured Dvinn&#39;s dagger for our resident rogue was a cool<br/>
return. =)  And it really made me feel good to share the wealth, as it<br/>
were.  Our rogue was thrilled, and I felt like I was finally contributing.<br/>
I agree--that&#39;s not twinking; that&#39;s part of why we join guilds.<br/>

&gt; Most of the twinking I&#39;ve seen done is male characters switching from<br/>
&gt; one to another.  I have seen female characters begging for things<br/>
&gt; either free or for less than the going price...saw this yesterday and<br/>
&gt; was VERY verbal to the young lady as she was not only a half-elf, but<br/>
&gt; also a bard...Needless to say that Genneth got quite righteous!  (but<br/>
&gt; totally in character)  As for myself, most of the things that I have<br/>
&gt; been given came from guildmembers either passing along outdated items<br/>
&gt; (which I have also done for newer guild members)or just being nice<br/>
&gt; because a bard is always poor (I have a Qeynos guard shield that was<br/>
&gt; such a gift).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t consider this gift giving twinking.  And if someone in my guild<br/>
&gt; gave me a full set of armor, I would take it and when I earned enough<br/>
&gt; to replace it with better, I would pass the gift along...I never sell<br/>
&gt; gifts...<br/>
