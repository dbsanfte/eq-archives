<b>Subject:</b> neglecting our families? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930844378">There are several lists on Yahoo for family members who feel that<br/>
their loved one has an internet addiction.  Apparently, she felt<br/>
that she was needed more online than off.  You probably made her<br/>
feel as if you didn&#39;t care about her anymore.  Her guildies did.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, at 47 yrs old, I have seen enough fireworks (twice a year<br/>
off my back deck.)  I have no other family alive except the hubby<br/>
and the kids.  (And his family is in California.  I don&#39;t go along<br/>
because 5 hour plane rides are bad for my health.)  And parades are<br/>
just flat-out boring.  I DO have hot, fresh food every night for<br/>
the boys.  I am a substitute teacher, part-time grad. student,<br/>
computer repair technician, run 17 yahoo groups and do nutritional<br/>
consulting.  I got into EQ so I would have something to talk about<br/>
with my boys who are also bored by parades.  Maybe the real world<br/>
just isn&#39;t as challenging as learning to &quot;swim&quot; underwater in a 3-D<br/>
castle.<br/>
<br/>
Having them at their father&#39;s, on the weekends, really helps my<br/>
relationship with my husband and allows me to have a really clean<br/>
house for two days a week.  He just lets them sit around and watch<br/>
tv all the time.  At least when they are playing EQ, they are<br/>
thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Your reminder is well-taken though as my hubby does sometimes feel<br/>
neglected because I am not ready when he is.<br/>
