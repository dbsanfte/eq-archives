<b>Subject:</b> Ideas for Womens Guild <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-183239269">A couple of comments on the guild ideas as given... first, why would sisters <br/>
dedicated to the Goddess of Love be chaste?  The idea seems wrong to me; the <br/>
opposite seems much more likely.  The other thing that bothers me is the idea of <br/>
<br/>
the Warders - why do a group of warrior women need men to protect them?  Kind of <br/>
<br/>
implies that even tough warrior women need a big strong man to help them, you <br/>
know?  Maybe we could come up with some other way men could belong?  Maybe the <br/>
men could belong to a brother order, The Brothers of Mithaniel, with a close <br/>
association with the Sisters of Erollisi?<br/>
Other than those two quibbles, I think the idea in general is sound and I would <br/>
enjoy belonging to this guild on a new server.<br/>
