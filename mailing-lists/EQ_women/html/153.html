<div id="ygrps-yiv-48253747">My Highest Lvl char is a lvl 16 Cleric, I love playing a cleric, we are very<br/>
popular in groups thats for sure!  Depending upon what my group is fighting<br/>
at the time I usually jump in and help beat on the critter until my life<br/>
falls down about two bubbles, then I back off.  Usually by this point one or<br/>
two in the group will need heals, and there I am.  So I can have my cake and<br/>
eat it too.  =)<br/>

&gt; Yah!  What she said! &lt;points&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I believe a cleric&#39;s first priority is the safety of her party, but<br/>
that, to me, is the nature of clerics, and it may not be to everyone (and<br/>
for sure I don&#39;t attribute it to a maternal instinct).  Now, this does not<br/>
limit her to healing everyone, as Christina said, but imbues her with the<br/>
judgement call--do I cast an offensive spell that will drop the critter to a<br/>
quarter of its health and make it easier for the tanks, or do I cast a<br/>
healing spell to keep the tanks alive?  Decisions, decisions.  Or does my<br/>
&gt; hatred for my foe overcome me, til I need to get in there and bash away?<br/>
In the case of the Undead, one of our clerics really does seem to feel the<br/>
need to wreak his vengeance. It seems to be a RP thing, with the stuff he<br/>
snarls out of the corner of his mouth (honest!), and we all know we have to<br/>
watch our own butts a little more closely when fighting them.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Some people do see clerics as just healers, and indeed standard<br/>
power-gamer strategy for high level groups is that the cleric spends all<br/>
their time healing and meditating.  The theory is that it&#39;s better for a<br/>
cleric to heal a tank (so the tank can fight longer) than it is for the<br/>
cleric to tank herself.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There are lots of ways you can play a cleric who doesn&#39;t just heal<br/>
though! Here are a few.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; First, during the first 20 levels clerics can tank pretty good.  It&#39;s<br/>
only at really high levels, when the warriors have dual wield, double<br/>
attack, and much higher weapon skills, that the clerics start to fall way<br/>
behind.  If you&#39;re not a power gamer, you may find that you can have most or<br/>
all of your fun playing your character up to level 20 or so, tanking away.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Second, you can hunt in the undead dungeons like Unrest and Befallen.<br/>
These dungeons are amazing for clerics--it turns you basicly into a wizard<br/>
who can heal and wear plate mail.  In fact, your spells do more damage and<br/>
cost less mana than those of wizards the same level as you! So wade straight<br/>
into combat with those undead.  Smack them with your hammer, burn them with<br/>
your magic.  Submissive? I don&#39;t think so.  It&#39;s hard to be submissive when<br/>
everyone in the dungeon is pleading with you to join their party.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Druids have also been mentioned as a great alternative to clerics.<br/>
Druids have some of the highest damage spells in the game.  Our stinging<br/>
swarm spells pack serious punch.  Our bolts are second only to those of<br/>
wizards.  At high levels we can transform ourselves into wolves and get an<br/>
attack bonus.  We can even transform our party tanks into wolves so they get<br/>
an attack bonus. We also can heal very well, though not as good as clerics.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Paladins are another great option.  These girls can tank, dealing out<br/>
damage toe on toe with warriors (well, almost quite toe on toe).  We have<br/>
the added bonus of decent healing spells, some undead burn, and the<br/>
incredible lay-on-hands that lets us &#39;emergency&#39; heal a party member for up<br/>
to 1000 points of damage.  That&#39;s not bad for an ability you can use for<br/>
free every 90 minutes.  You can be sure if you&#39;re a Paladin, no one is going<br/>
to ask you to go med while other people fight.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Last and perhaps most importantly of all, if you don&#39;t like medding<br/>
during combat, don&#39;t do it.  Tell your party members you&#39;re not here to be a<br/>
walking bandaid, and you&#39;re going to be tanking because you like to tank.<br/>
