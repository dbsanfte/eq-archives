<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460445604">Hey...Ranalla, you mentioned that everyone was shouting for SoWs when you<br/>
were in fp when you got to 14. My Barb Shaman (Kalara on the Veeshan server)<br/>
got her SoW spell at lvl 9 and ever since then I&#39;ve essentially been a SoW<br/>
whore (lol might be a bit crude, but apt). The big difference now that i&#39;m<br/>
lvl 21 is that no one pays me for the SoW. They just come up to me (and<br/>
pretty soon you&#39;ll know what I mean...they&#39;ll come up, sort of stand there<br/>
and before they can ask for the SoW I am already mid-spell to just get them<br/>
to go away). They literally assume that it is for free, say thanks and walk<br/>
away. Drives me nuts when they do it right after I&#39;ve just fought a mob, am<br/>
at half-life, oom and my party is the same or worse. That&#39;s usually the only<br/>
time that I&#39;ll turn them down.<br/>
<br/>
Most people just say thanks (but often not even that) and leave. Others,<br/>
usually the higher levels, will  give me buffs and that I can always<br/>
appreciate.<br/>
<br/>
My in-game fiance (hey...THAT is a great topic, in-game marriages...anyone<br/>
know of a good place in Norrath to tie the knot?) is an enchanter and he<br/>
gets asked for breezes far more than I do and they pay him...and often pay<br/>
him well. Hey, I have often paid several plat to get a good breeze or<br/>
clarity. Can&#39;t live without my new addiction!  And seriously, I can&#39;t tell<br/>
you how great it is to have a perpetual sow and breeze when you are in a<br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
My guild is a pretty big one but there is a big disparity between high level<br/>
characters and lower ones. You can really tell the difference between the<br/>
ones that came into the guild at a later time and the ones that have been<br/>
there for awhile. Most of them are lvl 30+ and then the next group is pretty<br/>
much right around 20, then it drops to a few new secondary char of people in<br/>
the guild who are really low levels. It sort of sucks because the guild<br/>
raids are mostly planned by the higher levels and excludes a lot of people.<br/>
But it&#39;s growing and new people are coming on board all the time. I&#39;m<br/>
finding that I hang out mostly with people in my guild and it is a lot of<br/>
comradarie. It also doesn&#39;t hurt that 70% of the guild are druids (weird,<br/>
huh?) and so getting a port is never a problem.<br/>
<br/>
I play for the social aspects, but I love the questing and learning skills.<br/>
I have half my totemic armor already and the getting it has been most of the<br/>
fun...travelling all over, getting help from people. I&#39;m a lvl 68 in baking<br/>
(funny because I&#39;m not a domestic sort in real life...I can cook well but<br/>
don&#39;t like to so much). Baking is an awesome skill to have because once you<br/>
buy a spit, you can bake while you meditate! And fresh meat there is<br/>
aplenty. I find it funny though that there aren&#39;t many bakers around. My<br/>
friends always laugh when I present them with beer braised lion or pickled<br/>
gator. The food is also lighter than regular food (monks love that) at .01<br/>
and it lasts a lot longer.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I&#39;m rambling...brought up lots of things we can use for topics later<br/>
(guilds, skills, weddings, social stuff). :-)<br/>
