Subject: [EQ_women] EQ2, or perhaps not....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; In the previous thread, noone addressed the question of whether they <br/>
&gt; planned to play any of the upcoming online games. I don&#39;t know too <br/>
&gt; much about them, but there seem to be some interesting ones, like <br/>
&gt; Neverwinter Nights, which will not be massively multiplayer, but <br/>
&gt; allow you to adventure with a few friends like AD&D, or  Shadowbane <br/>
&gt; (sounds to PK-friendly to me) and Dark Age of Camelot. I know there <br/>
&gt; are others, including futuristic ones. And then, of course, there is <br/>
&gt; EQ2.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does anyone know anything about them? Anyone in the betas?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
