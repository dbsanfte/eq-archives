<div id="ygrps-yiv-701253586"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;In order to create the guild, I need at least nine people to join me in<br/>
&gt;the EQ chat tonight to go through the automated guild creation process.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ll arbitrarily ask that people show up at 10:30 EST in the Brell<br/>
&gt;Serilis chat room.  I&#39;ll then create a &quot;Sisters of Erollisi&quot; chat room<br/>
&gt;which we will move to, and the automated guild creation process will<br/>
&gt;begin.  I will then add players within the game as you send me tells.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would love to, but I already have plans for that time tonight.  But I will <br/>
look around for you all tomorrow, I guess.<br/>
Btw, are they also still processing guilds via email, or do they all have to be <br/>
made in a chat room like that?  Do you know?<br/>
