<br/>
It&#39;s sad that you&#39;ve had these experiences, and there is a reason my group<br/>
and I don&#39;t ever try to &#39;camp&#39; for valuables.  None of us have the time or<br/>
patience to &#39;work&#39; at something that is supposed to be an escapist source of<br/>
relaxation and self-indulgence, and it would definitely be work to try and<br/>
get something neat when all of Norrath wants the same thing..  We are also<br/>
some of the oldest players (made characters ON release day, most of us were<br/>
beta 3 and 4), and our primaries are only in their mid-twenties,<br/>
level-wise.  Why?<br/>
<br/>
Well, we tend to roleplay a bit too much, and we do quests.  Not so much for<br/>
faction gain or the experience but because they&#39;re there and they can be<br/>
done and that&#39;s what roleplaying is built around.  And my gosh, we have<br/>
fun.  The last few nights my partner and I (and whichever of our friends<br/>
were on) have been exploring the Swamp of No Hope and the Lake of Ill Omen.<br/>
Why? They&#39;re there!  We&#39;ve found some really cool things that we&#39;ll be going<br/>
back to visit.  Tonight we&#39;re exploring the Field of Bone--why? (you know<br/>
the answer, hehe)  We do it in character, and we do it in style, and people<br/>
tend to gravitate toward us, hang out for a bit, and then check in with us<br/>
weeks down the road when they&#39;re ten levels above us but still remembering<br/>
the fun they had. =)<br/>
<br/>
I digress.  Point is, most of our oldest friends are twenty levels above us<br/>
(at least), and we never see them anymore.  This has been sad, but it&#39;s also<br/>
allowed us to make new friends, and since we don&#39;t feel compelled to keep<br/>
up, we&#39;ve seen more of Norrath than most.  That&#39;s one of the things we enjoy<br/>
about this game--the graphics are lush and the zones are intriguing (the new<br/>
ones especially).  Some of the quests need a bit of work, and that&#39;s<br/>
disappointing (obviously alot more time and effort is put into weapon<br/>
balancing and armor than into quests) to my particular group.  We like the<br/>
fact that as long as you&#39;re not hunting the &#39;big name&#39; monsters, there are<br/>
still things to do and money to be made, and we wish there was more.  Or<br/>
more roaming monsters, or harder to find &#39;big name&#39; monsters.  When a &#39;big<br/>
name&#39; monster is needed for two or three different quests involving two or<br/>
three different classes, it makes it difficult to achieve one&#39;s goals (ie,<br/>
inferno goblin wizard gets camped by wizards as well as us rangers).  We<br/>
don&#39;t like that, and try to avoid it, but obviously there are some things<br/>
we&#39;re not going to be able to avoid hunting... urrr, camping. &lt;looks glum&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Would a game slanted toward roleplayers fill a demand? Indeed, yes.  Would<br/>
it be commercially successful? Dunno.  There&#39;re a lot more power-levelers<br/>
out there than roleplayers.  Would it be a critical success?  That depends<br/>
partially on the level of programming that goes into it, and partially on<br/>
whether there are any roleplayers left at the fanzines. ;)  Letting the<br/>
underdog win? I think that first word says it all... &#39;let&#39;... Instead of<br/>
basing &#39;winning&#39; situations on who can hack and slash best and having<br/>
underdogs who are weaker but get rewarded for that weakness, what if there<br/>
were some reward for cunning and intelligence?  Solving a riddle, finding<br/>
traps, that sort of thing.  Make stats count for something--agility isn&#39;t<br/>
worth nearly as much as strength in this game, which is kinda skewed (hard<br/>
to hit something that won&#39;t hold still, isn&#39;t it?), luck is non-existent,<br/>
rogues are just another version of the light tank...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my two cents&#39;. &lt;grin&gt;<br/>

&gt; I haven&#39;t played EQ all week and it is the second paragraph that really<br/>
&gt; sums up why.<br/>
&gt; Does anyone else feel this?  Is it just the people I&#39;ve been hanging out<br/>
&gt; with lately being more &quot;thing&quot; than &quot;people&quot; oriented and I should go<br/>
&gt; find some new friends?  Or is it that not being the target market of the<br/>
&gt; game I just don&#39;t get it and getting the coolest things is really what<br/>
&gt; the game is about?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; More importantly, if there were an RP style game tweaked more toward<br/>
&gt; people than things, would you play it?  If the game gave points for<br/>
&gt; storyline and sometimes favored the underdog (letting the least equipped<br/>
&gt; defeat the most equipped like a David and Goliath kind of story) and<br/>
&gt; promoted group dynamics with more &quot;realistic&quot; story effects - would that<br/>
&gt; be of any interest?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just doing a bit of &quot;market research&quot; here.  And, yes, I do have an idea<br/>
&gt; up my sleeve &lt;grins&gt;.<br/>
