&gt; I can tell you that I met my RL husband some years ago on something called<br/>
&gt; Sierra On Line.  Our characters roleplayed together and we were married<br/>
&gt; on-line, at the time I was married in real life (but not happily).  After<br/>
&gt; time, we became RL friends (though we never met) and then I got a divorce<br/>
&gt; and we met in real life. He moved to where i live and we have been<br/>
together<br/>
&gt; for 5 years and got married just last year.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have known people that have gotten really involved in their characters<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; it has spilled into real life and has caused divorces, great marriages,<br/>
&gt; great friendships etc. I think if you and the person you are roleplaying<br/>
&gt; with have a clear understanding that this is JUST a roleplay thing<br/>
&gt; (especially if you are married or in another serious relationship in real<br/>
&gt; life) then you will be fine.  Your partner in real life may not understand<br/>
&gt; this roleplaying relationship either and it can cause a great deal of<br/>
&gt; jealousy.  Roleplaying the honeymoon can enter dangerous territory. I<br/>
&gt; probably dont need to say much more on that subject, unless you both<br/>
&gt; understand what you are doing.  Roleplaying (no matter what people say)<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; create alot of emotions for you in real life that you may not want.  For<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; it was a very positive experience that lead to me meeting my best friend,<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; husband.  It was not what I was looking for, but I am sure my husband at<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; time thought it was the worst thing I ever got involved in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry to ramble on, and some may not agree.. but in the end if you both<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; an understanding I think you will be okay.  It is alright in my mind to<br/>
say<br/>
&gt; ooc that you are married, engaged, single etc. so that if someone has the<br/>
&gt; idea that since you are roleplaying a romantic relationship it can become<br/>
&gt; something more, they will know what to expect.  And yes, you never know<br/>
who<br/>
&gt; is behind the character!  Hope this helps some!<br/>

&gt; &gt; As my character is marrying on Sunday I must confess to a few minor<br/>
&gt; qualms.  In<br/>
&gt; &gt; particular, er, how does one roleplay a honeymoon *smile*.  Unlike many<br/>
&gt; who<br/>
&gt; &gt; develop relationships in Norrath, my beloved and I are unknown to one<br/>
&gt; another in<br/>
&gt; &gt; RL.  For all I know he weighs 300 pounds, guzzles beer, and is<br/>
hygenically<br/>
&gt; &gt; challenged *smile*<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There are times if I wonder if this is a positive thing to be doing.  I<br/>
&gt; mean,<br/>
&gt; &gt; what if he is some starry eyed adolescent and I ruin him for life<br/>
*grin*.<br/>
&gt; I know<br/>
&gt; &gt; MY lines are clearly drawn in fuzz (okay, I think I know the difference<br/>
&gt; between<br/>
&gt; &gt; reality and fantasy though I swear I saw a Pixie Trickster in the<br/>
airport<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; other day *grin*).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, this is all fun and games and I am having fun.  But there is<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; part in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the back of my mind that wonders.  Because unlike reading romance novels<br/>
&gt; (blech -<br/>
&gt; &gt; persish the thought) there is another person involved in my little<br/>
fantasy<br/>
&gt; and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; must never forget that.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Any other hard core role players out there struggle with these<br/>
ridiculous<br/>
&gt; &gt; issues?  Any other players over the age of 25, for that matter *smile*<br/>
