<br/>
I think many of us have played pen-and-paper RPGs.  I&#39;ve also played RPGs since I was 11 (starting with the original Basic D&D).  I actually ran an RPG zine for a while, and wrote a module for Dungeon magazine.  I&#39;ve also reviewed TSR/GURPS material prior to publication (translation: I knew a guy who wrote for them, and I reviewed his manuscripts).  At one time I seriously considered becoming a full time RPG writer, but then I saw my friend who did it full time still lived with his parents, and I decided to be a computer programmer instead 8)<br/>

My favorite pen and paper RPG is without a doubt Ars Magica.  I can&#39;t figure out why it hasn&#39;t become the most popular RPG ever actully.  The thing I like the most about it is its magic system, which ... well I won&#39;t go into the whole thing but it&#39;s super cool.  Wait, here is a link which describes it, so you can read about it if you want.  <br/>

What I really like about this system is that it is a two dimensional system.  In Everquest, for example, a spell is an &#39;Evocation&#39; spell (and you have an evocation skill).  In Ars Magica, if you wanted to throw fireballs around you&#39;d have to train up &#39;Creo&#39; (create) and &#39;Ignem&#39; (fire).  But, as a side benefit, you&#39;d also be better at extinguishing fire, and creating water.  This makes for interesting and complex magical dynamics.<br/>
