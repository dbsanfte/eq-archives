<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-3038314">I pour out my life story of my marriage to an EQ fiend, who stopped <br/>
everything else in her life for a game...and you find my snooping to <br/>
be disturbing??  All depends on your point of view, I guess...<br/>
<br/>
Never found any evidence of any online or RL affairs (as many EQ <br/>
widows and widowers have experienced); just line after line of <br/>
insipid dribble about ports, spells, gear, etc, occassionally <br/>
puncuated by a nasty reference to me (&quot;Hubby getting upset again <br/>
better log soon :( &quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and as for the Lexus...sorry, can&#39;t help you there.  In fact, <br/>
when ours is done, we&#39;ll likely have to replace it with a Toyota or <br/>
Nissan; since she quit her $30K job back in 2000 to play UO (then EQ) <br/>
fulltime, some cutbacks have become necessary.</div>
