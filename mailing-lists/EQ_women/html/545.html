<br/>
Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been playing on E&#39;ci for just over a year now.  Unfortunately, wicked<br/>
things like work get in the way and prevent me from playing as much as I&#39;d<br/>
like!  I started because one of my roommates played, and I used to be<br/>
an avid MUD&#39;der.  So it was natural for me to fall into EQ.  And I&#39;m<br/>
addicted to starting newbies as well. Currently I have:<br/>
<br/>
Rixte, level 42 monk - human<br/>
Ereen, level 24 magician - human<br/>
Meika, level 24 druid - um, wolf?<br/>
Jaxiana, level 15 paladin, high elf<br/>
Irdith, level 10 necromancer - erudite<br/>
Sarizy, level 9 shaman - leezard<br/>
Heike, level 8 warrior - barbarian fisher and baker<br/>
Megany, level 5 bard - wood elf<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I love my Rixte the best.  There is nothing like the sheer glory of a<br/>
monk.  And all three of my higher levels now live in<br/>
Kunark - only Meika ever touches home soil, and that&#39;s usually to run<br/>
errands for everybody else.   <br/>
<br/>
Rixte and Ereen are both in the same guild, Caer Sidi.  Rixte usually<br/>
plays with guildmates.  Meika (and sometimes Ereen) are really for playing<br/>
with RL friends who also EQ.  I&#39;m an officer in Caer Sidi, and it really<br/>
is a great guild - it&#39;s quite small and closeknit.  Because of differences<br/>
in levels we often don&#39;t get to group together anymore (when we started<br/>
the guild, everybody was about the same level) but it&#39;s always nice to<br/>
talk to everybody on /guild.  When it comes to guilds, there are so many<br/>
different choices in what kind of guild to go with.  For me, it&#39;s about<br/>
the people in the guild.  Not about twinking, camping, raiding, but just<br/>
about people who really care when you hit that next level.  <br/>
<br/>
Rixte is an adventurer and explorer.  Camping mobs just isn&#39;t as much fun<br/>
as exploring new dungeons!  Although mind you, there&#39;s nothing like<br/>
spending 2 hours and 20 real life minutes feigned on the floor of Kaesora<br/>
while your group attempts to mount a rescue party...all because you got<br/>
impatient with waiting and, um, fell down a big hole with lots of nasty<br/>
spiders who wanted monk for dinner.   That was a great day!   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*waves hello to everybody*<br/>

I like the idea of a topic of the week.  We all have our favorite things<br/>
and our pet peeves about the game.  It&#39;d be nice to have a forum to<br/>
discuss such things!</div>
