<br/>
This last weekend was &quot;full&quot; I will give it that. Friday we went to <br/>
Steven&#39;s grandparent&#39;s and his grandfather took us all out to dinner. <br/>
We had a party of 10 (counting Steven, my son, and myself). <br/>
Afterwards we went back to their house. Steven, his uncle, aunt, <br/>
cousin, (her BF that finally got off of work), and the baby went <br/>
bowling. I stayed at the grandparent&#39;s house with my son. They ended <br/>
up stay awake past their bedtime to chat with me and of course my son <br/>
was getting tired and acting out. Than we all went and had ice cream. <br/>
That night we returned home (11pm) and the power was out. Candle <br/>
light until it cam back on (10 blocks out). My son is like me and <br/>
can&#39;t sleep without the TV so I had him lie on the couch and chat <br/>
with me until the power turns back on. <br/>
 <br/>
Saturday sucked. There are no other words to describe it. <br/>
<br/>
Sunday Steven went to the &quot;Giants&quot; game in the Bay Area. I was at his <br/>
grandparent&#39;s house all day long with only 2 hours of sleep the night <br/>
before. They must have thought I was moving in with all the things I <br/>
packed. I even came with my own coffee pot. I drink my coffee strong <br/>
and it&#39;s what I am used to. I even packed lunch for my son and <br/>
myself. I had a great time there and returned home about 9pm. <br/>
<br/>
I came home last night to listen to all the messages on the answering <br/>
machine. Friends and family called and we weren&#39;t even home. The <br/>
thing is everyone knew we wouldn&#39;t be here. The first call was my <br/>
sister and she had no clue if I was home or not. She says on the <br/>
machine that she had my niece almost 3 weeks ago!! Out of all of us <br/>
children she is the first to have a little girl. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Lilianna&quot; was born April 15th, 6:53pm, and weight was 3lbs 13 oz. <br/>
<br/>
Now I have to wait until this weekend to go to the hospital to see <br/>
her. I&#39;m so nervous and have no plans to touch her and possibly give <br/>
off germs from me. So was due June 6th, 2003. My sister said she went <br/>
to the mall to buy more baby clothes and went into labor. She started <br/>
crying because she wasn&#39;t due yet and thankfully &quot;her&quot; sister was <br/>
there to help. I&#39;m an auntie to a little girl! I can&#39;t wait until she <br/>
is old enough to take for weekend trips. My sister said I could take <br/>
her anytime I want but I can&#39;t do it this little in my opinion┬à too <br/>
small and I don&#39;t want to screw up. <br/>
