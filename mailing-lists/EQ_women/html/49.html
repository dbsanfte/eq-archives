<div id="ygrps-yiv-2132439663">Hello!  I am also one of the older women playing EQ, I am 32.  My husband<br/>
and oldest daughter (12) also play.  We love to play to together, and since<br/>
we do have two computers, at least two of us play every day.  Now that<br/>
school is out my daughter is doing great and making some wonderful friends<br/>
in Norrath. My main character is a level 15 dark elf Cleric named Kilanna on<br/>
Veeshan. I also have  a high elf, wood elf, human, and I want to make a<br/>
gnome.<br/>
As far as the on line romance thing, I tend to concentrate more on having<br/>
fun and being as helpful to as many people as I can.  I have made wonderful<br/>
friends.  I am not a huge flirt but it happens &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>
I love to group with all kinds of people and see where it leads me.<br/>
I love reading the list and look forward to it now everyday!  When you are<br/>
on Veeshan give me a tell.<br/>

&gt; Hi<br/>
&gt; I am Kyrah and I am a 12th lvl human Paladin on Veeshen. In answer to your<br/>
&gt; question about getting married online, I have a RL husband who is my<br/>
online<br/>
&gt; protector. He is a Barbarian Shaman and he is online with me 99% of the<br/>
&gt; time. So I don&#39;t really face that problem. Most people know that we are<br/>
&gt; married.:-)<br/>

&gt; Hey everyone,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I play Ardynn, a 6th-level Wood Elf Druid on the Povar server. I am fairly<br/>
&gt; new to online roleplaying but I&#39;ve been addicted to many computer RPGs in<br/>
&gt; the past. So, I&#39;m still working on developing Ardynn as a character. (It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; been tough, with all those orcs chasing me all the time!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a question for those of you who are getting &quot;married&quot; online, or<br/>
&gt; have gotten married online in the past. Do any of you have offline<br/>
&gt; boyfriends (or husbands)? If so, do they mind if you have an online<br/>
&gt; significant other?<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; p.s. I think when we reply to messages on the list, we should not hit<br/>
&gt; &quot;reply&quot; but instead use the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:EQ_women@onelist.com">EQ_women@onelist.com</a> address - otherwise we&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; get a lot of copies of old messages in the digests.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; glad to be here! looking forward to meeting all of you.<br/>
