<div id="ygrps-yiv-592274597">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been playing since Christmas 1999..a little over<br/>
a year...and my Paladin just hit Level 50. It was a<br/>
very exciting moment for me. I am still to this day<br/>
amazed at the lands I&#39;m just beginning to explore and<br/>
the creatures that I&#39;m just now &quot;old&quot; enough to kill.<br/>
I never have a difficult time finding a group nor does<br/>
my level 50 Ranger fiancee. The game is really a lot<br/>
about networking. Very much like the real world. At<br/>
higher levels you will go into a zone and say &quot;Hello<br/>
Karnors Castle&quot; (for example) and half the castle will<br/>
holler back &quot;Hello Lily!&quot;. I never thought I would<br/>
have so many friends and acquaintances. To me that&#39;s<br/>
what EQ is about. The people I&#39;ve met and the good<br/>
times I&#39;ve had with them. I don&#39;t see EQ ending for me<br/>
because it&#39;s not only a game. These folks are my<br/>
friends. Just to let you know I am able to balance EQ<br/>
and RL. I have a full time job and a family that lives<br/>
close by and I even clean my house! :-) I&#39;m 38 years<br/>
old and I&#39;ve found something that keeps me young at<br/>
heart. EQ.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Short intro - I&#39;m a 40 something woman (natch)<br/>
&gt; sequestered in the Frozen North aka Ontario, and I<br/>
&gt; just started playing EQ a few weeks ago.  Life as I<br/>
&gt; knew it is over;  My time is now divided into EQ,<br/>
&gt; and all that other stuff I have to take care of<br/>
&gt; before I get back to EQ.  ^_^   This will wear off<br/>
&gt; as the snow melts I hope, but now I understand why<br/>
&gt; they call it &quot;Evercrack.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m so new I squeak (just hit 5th level with my<br/>
&gt; druid and monk last night), but one of the main<br/>
&gt; attractions to me right now is exploration.  (I<br/>
&gt; guess I&#39;m still in the gee whiz stage ^_^)  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know how the game will appear to me once I run out<br/>
&gt; of places to explore.  I&#39;m going to try trades as<br/>
&gt; well, and that will add another dimension, but I<br/>
&gt; think at some point Verant may have to offer<br/>
&gt; something new to keep the longer term players<br/>
&gt; involved.  Expansion packs will fill the need for<br/>
&gt; now, but eventually an overhaul of the graphics and<br/>
&gt; terrain of the original world should be considered. <br/>
&gt; That might refresh things for people a bit.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All this is, of course, in my extremely humble,<br/>
&gt; low-level, can&#39;t-even-run-my-scared<br/>
&gt; little-newbie-past-West Commons opinion.  ^_^  Who<br/>
&gt; know what I&#39;ll be thinking when I&#39;m a veteran.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; cheers!<br/>

&gt; p.s.  At what point do your non-eq women friends<br/>
&gt; start rebelling now that conversations invariably<br/>
&gt; turn to the interesting and new way you found to die<br/>
&gt; last night?<br/>

&gt; I have been playing EQ since the day it came out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Still addicted. hehehe.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Got Diablo2 and that swayed me a little but not for<br/>
&gt; long<br/>

&gt; &gt; I just wondered how long the shelf life of EQ is?<br/>
&gt; I have played since <br/>
&gt; &gt; 24 August 2000, and I tend to feel that I could<br/>
&gt; carry on playing for <br/>
&gt; &gt; around a year, so long as I could get groups. EQ<br/>
&gt; does not strike me <br/>
&gt; &gt; as a game I could easily play casually though, so<br/>
&gt; I probably wouldn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; &gt; play fewer hours per week over a longer period.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I think the decisive factor would be in-game; it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; a miserable <br/>
&gt; &gt; occupation if you can&#39;t play as part of a group,<br/>
&gt; so if it comes to <br/>
&gt; &gt; the point where my ranger cannot get into groups,<br/>
&gt; it will probably be <br/>
&gt; &gt; time to move on. I suppose I might try another<br/>
&gt; class, but I am not <br/>
&gt; &gt; that interested in doing so.<br/>
