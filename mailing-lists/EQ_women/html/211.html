<div id="ygrps-yiv-640075324">Things that I have become aware of:<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re still connected to your ISP when you drop from EQ, than you could<br/>
have a bandwidth problem (too much stuff streaming through too small a<br/>
connection, essentially), a resource allocation problem (video or RAM memory<br/>
overload), or a connect with too many hops along the way.  What is your connect<br/>
speed, video RAM and RAM size, and have you noticed any sluggishness when<br/>
you&#39;re connected at those times with your browser or other &#39;Net applications?<br/>
I personally need a new processor, because the amount of data I&#39;m getting<br/>
through a very fast connect with a good ISP is bogging my system down (even<br/>
though the rest of my computer is &quot;rodded&quot;, memory, graphics card,  and<br/>
HDD-wise).  So I occasionally dump too.<br/>
