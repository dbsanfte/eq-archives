<b>Subject:</b> Re: fun after 40--how you tell who the kids are <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620166611">As I said before, I am probably one of the oldest at 54 women (55 in <br/>
September) on EQ.  I know of one other on Fennin Ro who is older than I am <br/>
and a women in RL.  Mature people have a love of gaming, too.  I get a lot <br/>
of pleasure from playing any game, puzzle, or challenge.  I work off <br/>
aggression with my slashing and hacking, get satisfaction in achieving <br/>
small goals like acquiring items, making skill or experience levels and in <br/>
discovering and exploring the EQ environment.<br/>
<br/>
Us old geezers have the time and the patience (and the money) for many <br/>
on-line activities, as well as having highly developed computer-related <br/>
skills.  I have found that women have done very well in information <br/>
management/computer science careers and I have been involved since the <br/>
middle 1960&#39;s with large corporations on the west and east coasts.<br/>
I am retired now and only do a little consulting to keep my skills and <br/>
marketability up.  This leaves me much time for day playing and all night <br/>
sessions, if I want.  I am a borderline compulsive when I play this game. <br/>
 It is so immersive and addicting.  When a good group forms, I like to stay <br/>
together as long as I can for the session and the companionship.<br/>
<br/>
I played Realm before EQ.  But a family member was a beta tester for EQ and <br/>
showed it to me last year.  So I was on the distribution list for the <br/>
production software by New Years of this year and started playing the first <br/>
day of production.  I have found that my knowledge of the game is only now <br/>
beginning to surpass the beta testers and I am considering volunteering for <br/>
guide duty.  I think older women would make excellent guides.  If anything, <br/>
age teaches patience, wit, skin thickening and a little teaching skills, <br/>
which I think are essential attributes for a good guide.<br/>
<br/>
I can always spot the youngest players.  They are the ones always shouting <br/>
for help with corpse retrieval, free food, free items, screaming &#39;gimme, <br/>
gimme, gimme&#39;.  They can&#39;t seem to stand still.......ever.  They never <br/>
bother with Sense Heading skill development, never learned the value of <br/>
saving up their coins for something they want, and seem very self-centered <br/>
in every thing they do.<br/>
<br/>
So, here is a new mail list thread idea:<br/>
<br/>
You can always spot the kids when they<br/>
<br/>
1) Beg for favors all over the zone<br/>
2) twink<br/>
3) solo power game<br/>
4) are on most people&#39;s ignore list<br/>
5) bully other players with their own greediness<br/>
6) brag too much about their race, class, level, wealth or items<br/>
7) answer every question about game secrets with shouts across the zone to <br/>
show off what they know (and don&#39;t know, hehe)<br/>
8) chatter incessantly about inanities<br/>
9) complain the loudest about others not helping them<br/>
10) ..................[you fill in your favorite here]<br/>

computer games.  How did you happen to start playing Everquest?<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I&#39;m 35.  My mother is over 60, and she plays some computer<br/>
games.  She has a Macintosh, though, so I can&#39;t introduce her to Everquest.<br/>
