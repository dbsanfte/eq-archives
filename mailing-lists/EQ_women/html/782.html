<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869776524">It is probably best to join an existing guild, an existing guild will have <br/>
more experienced players who can help you learn the game. Running a guild <br/>
is a lot of work!<br/>
<br/>
Retrieving bodies when you are level 10 or higher can be difficult. If you<br/>
think you&#39;re going to die it&#39;s a good idea to quickly type<br/>
<br/>
/l<br/>
<br/>
this will tell you your current location. When you die, write down the <br/>
number, then you can use /l to see how close you are to that location <br/>
while you&#39;re trying to find your body.<br/>
<br/>
Bards, Necromancers, and Shadow Knights can locate corpses with spells. If <br/>
there is one in the zone they will often help you if you are polite. <br/>

&gt; Salutations!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can anyone give me information about starting a guild, is that <br/>
&gt; possible, or do you have to join an existing one?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can anyone give me some sewing tips? I&#39;ve figured out how to take a <br/>
&gt; ruined wolf pelt and certain patterns and put them in the small <br/>
&gt; sewing kit to make tunics, boots, etc. but what about other things. I <br/>
&gt; have not gotten anything to work in my large sewing kit at all yet, <br/>
&gt; keeps saying it&#39;s the wrong stuff. The instructions for sewing large <br/>
&gt; items say use a ruined bear pelt and an appropriate pattern which <br/>
&gt; patterns would those be?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Finally, for now I was with someone who died the other day and we <br/>
&gt; were haveing a lot of trouble finding her body so she could get her <br/>
&gt; stuff back. After a while she said that someone else had gotten the <br/>
&gt; stuff for her. How does this work? If I die and can&#39;t find my body <br/>
&gt; how do I get my stuff back? How can I do this for someone else?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for any help ya&#39;ll can give,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
