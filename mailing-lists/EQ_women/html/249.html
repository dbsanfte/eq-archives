<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139068632">As I mentioned a while before, I thought it would be a good idea for us to<br/>
form an guild on a new server at some point.  The purpose of forming the<br/>
guild would be to allow those of us who wish to to play with their EQ<br/>
sisters.  The purpose in forming it on a new server would be so no one<br/>
would be directly advantaged by already having characters and contacts on<br/>
their current server which they could carry over to this new server.  Here<br/>
are some further ideas I have about how this guild might operate.  Please<br/>
give me feedback!<br/>
<br/>
Participation<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I&#39;d like to stress that I&#39;d see participation in this guild<br/>
as voluntary.  I&#39;d also like to stress that I wouldn&#39;t be asking anyone to<br/>
drop their existing characters to play in this guild.  Many of us already<br/>
have really good characters in really good environments, and we don&#39;t want<br/>
to give this up!<br/>
<br/>
To facilitate participation in this guild, I&#39;d probably thus suggest two<br/>
unofficial times each week which would be guild play times.  While you can<br/>
play any time, you&#39;d be encouraged to try and play during guild times.<br/>
This would ensure a reasonable number of us playing at those times, so we<br/>
can group.  Example guild times might be Wednesday evening, and Saturday<br/>
morning.<br/>
<br/>
Roleplaying Background:<br/>
<br/>
Ever good guild should have a nice robust role playing background, that<br/>
those of us who wish to roleplay can work into our characters.  One such<br/>
background might be as follows:<br/>
<br/>
Erollisi Marr is the goddess of love.  Here is her description from the<br/>
player manual: Followers of Erollisi Marr cling to the belief that love<br/>
conquers all. It should be pointed out that while love is a generally<br/>
peaceful concept, Erollisi worshippers are not pacifists. They would like<br/>
to live in a world where everyone loves everyone else and violence does<br/>
not exist but they are not naive enough to think that Norrath is that<br/>
world. They have passionate loves of people, places and ideas and are more<br/>
than willing to fight and die to preserve those things. The dream of every<br/>
follower of Erollisi is to die in selfless defense of someone or something<br/>
they love. Many Paladins hear the true calling of their hearts and<br/>
follow Erollisi Marr. <br/>
<br/>
From my own playing I think Erollisi bears a great resemblence to Artemis<br/>
the greek goddess of the hunt.  Evidence to this includes the Sisters of<br/>
Erollisi, a warrior-cult of women who live in the Ocean of Tears.  These<br/>
chaste (except when they stray) warrior women seem to me to be a great<br/>
basis for a guild.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to see us take &quot;Sisters of Erollisi&quot; as our guild name.  This<br/>
would afford us the great opportunity to use the island of Erollisi in the<br/>
ocean of tears as our guild home.  Few guilds can have a whole island<br/>
to themselves.  It would also give our guild a strong tangible connection<br/>
to the game.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to allow males to be in the guild (when sponsored by a female<br/>
member) and suggest incorporating them (from a roleplaying perspective) as<br/>
&quot;Warders&quot; (I&#39;m stealing the concept from Robert Jordan&#39;s Wheel of Time<br/>
series).  A Warder would be a male who pledges his life to the protection<br/>
of a Sister of Erollisi.  Each sister could have only one warder.  A<br/>
Warder would most obviously be a Paladin, but could be of any class.  An<br/>
obvious line of roleplaying courtship might involve a male courting a<br/>
Sister to first become her Warder, and perhaps even one day her husband.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of races/classes allowed, I would like to have no restrictions on<br/>
that.  We all have different playing interests.  Obviously a Shadow Knight<br/>
or Necromancer doesn&#39;t fit in very well with the Sisters of Erollisi.<br/>
With proper thought, and a well crafted story, it could be done.<br/>
<br/>
Rules:<br/>
<br/>
I like keeping rules to a minimum.  The main reason for this is so no one<br/>
will feel they don&#39;t want to be a part of the guild, because it has<br/>
restrictive rules.<br/>
<br/>
The only rule I can think of is that female players should play female<br/>
characters, and male players should play male characters.  This will allow<br/>
us to more easily recognize other women in the guild.  Even this rule I&#39;d<br/>
be willing to bend if someone had a good reason they couldn&#39;t abide by<br/>
this rule.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone think of any other obvious, required, rules?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Men in the guild:<br/>
<br/>
I think men should be allowed in the guild, but they should be sponsored<br/>
by a female guild member.  While I think a truly women-only guild would be<br/>
cool, it seems unnecessarily restrictive (there are nice guys out there<br/>
after all).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hierarchy:<br/>
<br/>
Guild hierarchy can be a fun thing, but it can also be annoying.  I&#39;d like<br/>
to see hierarchy so those of us who enjoy it can take part.  I&#39;d also like<br/>
those of us who aren&#39;t interested in hierarchy to be able to play without<br/>
it.  <br/>
<br/>
The only actual benefits from being higher in the hierarchy, as I see it,<br/>
should be from a role playing perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Here is an example hierarchy we might use:<br/>
<br/>
Sister<br/>
<br/>
This is the introductary level at which all Sisters of Erollisi would be.<br/>
This afford one the right to vote and participate in guild events.  All<br/>
Sisters have the responsility to aid other Sisters in need.<br/>
<br/>
Acolyte<br/>
<br/>
One becomes an Acolyte of Erollisi by achieving at least level 15, and<br/>
then completing a quest as dictated by a Priestess.  An Acolyte has the<br/>
responsibility to aid, advise, and watch over all Sisters.  Early on the<br/>
level requirements might be restricted.<br/>
<br/>
Priestess<br/>
<br/>
One becomes a Priestess of Erollisi by achieving at least level 25, and<br/>
the completing a quest as dictated by the Hand of Erollisi.  Implicit in<br/>
being offered the rank of Priestess is a history of good guild conduct.<br/>
A Priestess has the responsibility to organize guild events and hunts.  A<br/>
Priestess can be of any class.  Early on the level requirements might be<br/>
restricted.<br/>
<br/>
Hand of Erollisi<br/>
<br/>
The Hand of Erollisi is the leader of the Sisters of Erollisi.  It is her <br/>
responsibility to organize guild meetings, induct new members, and oversee<br/>
any guild issues.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Warder<br/>
<br/>
Male members of the guild would all inducted warders.  They would be sworn<br/>
to protect an indivual Sister of Erollisi.  They would not have any voting<br/>
power.  Warders would gain title as the sisters they protect gain title.<br/>
Warders could not vote, but his valued opinion would be rightly<br/>
considered by the Sister he is sworn to protect.<br/>
    Sister&#39;s Rank      Warder&#39;s Rank<br/>
    Sister             Warder<br/>
    Accolyte           Knight   <br/>
    Priestess          Guardian<br/>
    Hand of Erollisi   Sword of Erollisi<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dues:<br/>
<br/>
Many guilds have dues.  I don&#39;t really see the need for them.  Anyone have<br/>
any good reasons why Dues should be part of this guild?<br/>
<br/>
Comments?<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know what you think about any or all of these ideas.<br/>
