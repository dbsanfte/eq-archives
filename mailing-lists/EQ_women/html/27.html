<div id="ygrps-yiv-829249781">Hey everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I play Ardynn, a 6th-level Wood Elf Druid on the Povar server. I am fairly<br/>
new to online roleplaying but I&#39;ve been addicted to many computer RPGs in<br/>
the past. So, I&#39;m still working on developing Ardynn as a character. (It&#39;s<br/>
been tough, with all those orcs chasing me all the time!)<br/>
<br/>
I have a question for those of you who are getting &quot;married&quot; online, or<br/>
have gotten married online in the past. Do any of you have offline<br/>
boyfriends (or husbands)? If so, do they mind if you have an online<br/>
significant other?<br/>
<br/>

p.s. I think when we reply to messages on the list, we should not hit<br/>
&quot;reply&quot; but instead use the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:EQ_women@onelist.com">EQ_women@onelist.com</a> address - otherwise we&#39;ll<br/>
get a lot of copies of old messages in the digests. <br/>
<br/>
glad to be here! looking forward to meeting all of you.</div>
