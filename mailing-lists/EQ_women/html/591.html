<b>Subject:</b> Hello everyone <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128102539">Now that I know I can post to the board, I&#39;d like to introduce <br/>
myself. I&#39;m Liz, and I started playing EQ just over a month ago, with <br/>
a ranger (no, they do not suck; perfect newbie class) on <br/>
Quellious.She is called Gyngermynx (it sounded like a clever at the <br/>
time, but how will I ever think of a surname to go with it?)<br/>
<br/>
I live in the UK, so I lose a lot of sleep trying to group with my <br/>
new friends from the US and my guildmates, the Fremen, a new and <br/>
friendly little guild; what about Frewomen, though ;).<br/>
<br/>
If you see me, do please say hello :)<br/>
<br/>
Liz</div>
