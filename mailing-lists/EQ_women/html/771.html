<div id="ygrps-yiv-170661318">Generally what you do is plan the place and time of your ceremony in <br/>
advance. Then petition a few hours early for a GM/Guide to wed you. <br/>
Depending on the availability of someone to do it, they will either just <br/>
change your last name, or they will perform the whole ceremony. It&#39;s a <br/>
good idea as a backup plan to have a friend able to perform the ceremony <br/>
(probably a cleric or druid) in case there are no GMs or guides available. <br/>
Try and hold your wedding during prime time when it&#39;s more likely a <br/>
GM/guide will be on.<br/>
<br/>
The ceremony is really what you make of it and what you want out of it. <br/>
You can always simply say you&#39;re married, and then petition for a last <br/>
name change. If you haven&#39;t taken a last name yet, you can just use the <br/>
surname command to give yourself your partner&#39;s last name.<br/>
