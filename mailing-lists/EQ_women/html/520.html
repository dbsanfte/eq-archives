<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035946048">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
As some of you may recall, I&#39;m the moderator of this mailing list.  I<br/>
created it because I noticed that Everquest was a boy-dominated game and I<br/>
thought it would be cool to create a list for women who play Everquest to<br/>
chat with eachother.<br/>
<br/>
But, this list is pretty quiet, though we do have 75 members.  So, my<br/>
question is, how can this list better serve the needs of its members?<br/>
<br/>
I would like to hear everyone&#39;s ideas.  What would you like to see on this<br/>
list? How can this list better serve your needs?<br/>
<br/>
