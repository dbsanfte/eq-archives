Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I sent a long post the other day and hoped on the list today only to <br/>
realize that it had not made it to this list at all. In fact, <br/>
apparently my last couple of posts didn&#39;t make it to the list.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I can be so dumb . . . but I can&#39;t help but wonder where I <br/>
sent the crazy things.<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, a little question for anyone who might think about <br/>
answering . . .<br/>
<br/>
Is there a level limit you need to be to get married in EQ? What are <br/>
the advantages and or disadvantages of tying the EQ knot?<br/>
<br/>
