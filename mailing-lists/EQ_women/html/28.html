<div id="ygrps-yiv-1955859440">Interesting question about having on-line marriages and/or boyfriends. <br/>
In my real life I am married and my husband REFUSES to play EQ with me<br/>
though we could if we wanted.  If he&#39;d play, in game as well as life, I<br/>
would be with him.  BUT he doesn&#39;t play and in game I have a steady<br/>
love interest from my guild.  He knows i&#39;m married in RL, my husband<br/>
knows I have been &quot;seeing&quot; this other elf on line, and I know that my<br/>
on-line boyfriend is also married, and his wife knows that he is seeing<br/>
my character on line.  Does that make sense?  <br/>
<br/>
Other characters who have flirted with Genneth seriously also know that<br/>
I am married.  I try to be honest about that to the guys out there who<br/>
see a cute bardic lass and don&#39;t connect her to the woman behind her. <br/>
If I think they are flirting really hard and are misinterpreting Genn&#39;s<br/>
in character responses, I always tell them so there will be no<br/>
misunderstandings.<br/>
