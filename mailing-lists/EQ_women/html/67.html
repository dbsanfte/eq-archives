<b>Subject:</b> Flirting <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1976054094">When I went on to everquest I was concerned that there<br/>
might be a lot of flirting, and that it might get out<br/>
of hand.  I accordingly played my character with a<br/>
cold exterior (not hard for a dark elf necromancer).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve come to warm up to flirting a bit, though I<br/>
still don&#39;t do it very much.  I&#39;ve generally found that most guys are fairly polite, or at worst a bit boisterous.<br/>
<br/>
My wood elf druid gets hit on more than my other <br/>
characters.  My dwarven paladin is hit on very consistently by dwarves (but not other races).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve made lots of friends throughout Mithanial Marr, but I&#39;m hoping as well to join a decent guild at some point, for the increased socialization, and group hunting.<br/>
