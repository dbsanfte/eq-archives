<div id="ygrps-yiv-490900961">Yeah, he is a great one for tricks.  He had lev on a friend, and bound him<br/>
in the air over PoK.  Then he told him to click off the lev.  The guy fell<br/>
to the ground, died, came back IN MID AIR, died again and again and again.<br/>
I am not sure how they got out of it.  I think they had to petition to<br/>
change his bind spot!<br/>
<br/>
I have never gone to the arena in Quellious.  I do know a couple of women<br/>
on my server who are most crazy than I am.  I figured it was a guy thing.<br/>
I mean, no exp?  What&#39;s the point?<br/>
<br/>
Beware of dueling druids and necros.<br/>
<br/>
I played my nephew&#39;s wiz once with Bryn.  He was supposed to be PLing me.<br/>
I have a policy against moving wizards when they are OOM.  He ran off and<br/>
left an orc get me.  Never going to play with him again.<br/>
<br/>
Aubrey, Dreadtouch is a nice boy.  I recommend him.<br/>

____&gt;oh my that is too funny, a friend of mine called me up and said<br/>
____&gt;come <br/>
____&gt;to the arena and help us take down this necro, im like ok. I get <br/>
____&gt;ther and we finish off a 50 pally and my friend says go take down <br/>
____&gt;briyn (lol he goes anon so i had no idea what lvl he was) so i walk <br/>
____&gt;into the arena and attack and 5 seconds later i was dead. He <br/>
____&gt;snared , rooted dotted whatever. It is funny how small the world is <br/>
____&gt;that&#39;s for sure. My friend was like oh my god i was joking hes a 65. <br/>
____&gt;But i learned a few valuable lessons that day. while i would love to <br/>
____&gt;spy on him i am now fearful of his capabilities lol.<br/>
