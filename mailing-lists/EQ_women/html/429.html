Some bard-specific advice from a seasoned Bard...  (BTW, great<br/>
descriptions, Dnaisha, though I don&#39;t know if I necessarily agree with your<br/>
classification of a bard as a healer....the bard kind of fits outside your<br/>
categories).  To the bard, your charisma is your life... at lower levels,<br/>
you get phenomenal prices for the items you sell and buy and it makes a<br/>
great difference.  Where your charisma really kicks in is when you get your<br/>
Lullybye song (which puts the mobs your group is NOT fighting to sleep and<br/>
therefore helps with crowd control) and really increases the effectiveness<br/>
of most of your songs.  Your second most important stat as a bard is<br/>
Dexterity... for the reason that you miss your song notes less often,<br/>
increase your instrument skills faster based on your dex (starting with<br/>
percussion at lvl 5, then string at lvl 8, brass at 12 and wind at 14).<br/>
Using instruments increase the effectiveness of your songs.<br/>
<br/>
Strength is also a primary stat for a bard.  I really wouldn&#39;t worry a huge<br/>
amount about it.  Put it at around 80 or 85 so that you can wear some<br/>
decent armor and still be able to carry stuff (I would still suggest to<br/>
stick with banded armor and not bronze until you are ready to quest for the<br/>
lambent armor around lvl 30 or so...lambent armor is the special bard-only<br/>
quest armor).<br/>
<br/>
Your songs are your life.  Sing them ALWAYS (chant of battle will be your<br/>
first and is a great song for increasing party strength and effectiveness<br/>
in combat) to keep your singing skill maxed.  Also, learn how to &quot;twist&quot; or<br/>
&quot;medley&quot; your songs so that you can have the effects of more than one at a<br/>
time.  I have a fast connection to the internet and therefore when there&#39;s<br/>
no server lag can twist 3 and sometimes 4 songs at a time easily.  Others<br/>
with slower connections or lots of lag can only get 2 going...whatever the<br/>
number, you as the bard can greatly help out any party with your songs.<br/>
<br/>
The great thing about a bard is that you can pretty much solo through the<br/>
first 12 levels or so without a problem.   Until about 16th level, you will<br/>
have decent melee skills and you will be able to stand toe-to-toe with the<br/>
tanks.  After that, however, and you will really start to become pathetic<br/>
in combat and will find yourself sometimes switching to become and<br/>
all-instrument bard when your party has enough tanks.  <br/>
<br/>
Parties love you because you are so versatile.  You can get them around<br/>
quickly with Selo&#39;s accelerando.  You can tank when needed to or pull out<br/>
your instruments for an extra punch.  You can pulse-heal hit points with<br/>
Hymn of Restoration.  You can increase attack speed with Anthem de Arms.<br/>
You can also increase group magic resistance with your songs among other<br/>
things such as : slow down attack speed and AC of your enemies, root, fear,<br/>
charm, etc. (at higher levles--these abilities come in the 20&#39;s).  I often<br/>
get tells from people in my zone asking if I am grouped and would I like to<br/>
group (I don&#39;t go anon most of the time).  <br/>
<br/>
There will be items you can buy or trade for that increase your<br/>
stats...right now my bard, with items, has a 110 charisma, 104 dex and 88<br/>
strength.  So, if your stats are not what you like when you start, you can<br/>
adjust them with items, however I do suggest you do what I suggested<br/>
above... You can always re-roll your character when she is still low level<br/>
...it hurts a lot less than those who get to, say, 10th level and wish they<br/>
had done one thing or another with their stats and end up re-rolling their<br/>
characters then and have to do all 10 levels over again.<br/>
<br/>
What I most love about the bard is that it is a really fun class to<br/>
play..it has a complexity to it and your strategies change with each new<br/>
level and new song.  It is always interesting and there&#39;s always something<br/>
new to look forward to with the advancement of levels.  I really think that<br/>
the bard is one of the most strategically complex classes in the game.<br/>
