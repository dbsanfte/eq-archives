Judy, <br/>
<br/>
Have you played Asheron&#39;s Call.  I played it for a little while but <br/>
really hated some of the major gameplay (fighting) interface issues.  <br/>
Namely, when you go to loot you have to pick up each item <br/>
individually.  As well, there isn&#39;t an easy way to target or auto-<br/>
attack.  As well, corpse deterioration was VERY (far too) quick and <br/>
people would take your items (limited left on corpse).  It is just <br/>
frustrating dealing with scavengers.  Finally, their skills system is <br/>
very complex, it offers some nice options, but it is mostly just <br/>
confusing.  I have since deleted my account.<br/>
<br/>
However, they had some really nice things that play balance well.  In <br/>
particular, the economy seems stable and self-sustaining.  Each <br/>
vendor has a base of items and the only &quot;enhanced&quot; items they sell <br/>
have been sold to them by players.  I really like the &quot;note&quot; system <br/>
where you pay a little extra money and get a note instead of carrying <br/>
around tons of money.  Their trade skills offer experience!!! And <br/>
trades like cooking actually have rewards such as mana or hp gain.  <br/>
This unto itself was fantastic for RP value!  I believe it is open <br/>
ended leveling.  You continue to get experience even off the level 1 <br/>
creatures, although it would take you a RL year to level on them <br/>
*grin* but this means there are always things to kill, however <br/>
small.  As well, exp is granted based on damage done.  Loot rights <br/>
are given to the individual who did the most overall damage.  Because <br/>
each person who does damage gets exp, this alleviates KS and <br/>
contention between spawn camping, but sometimes leaves healers at a <br/>
disadvantage.  As I mentioned, they have a complex skill system where <br/>
even a warrior can learn to use magic over time.  This is nice for <br/>
the really high level folks I imagine.  I also like the way equipment <br/>
is handled, but it could be simplified.  If you don&#39;t have the game, <br/>
check out the ebay auctions because many have pictures of the details <br/>
on the equipment they offer.  The rest I have explained, but you may <br/>
wish to check it out yourself for the purposes of market study.<br/>
<br/>
I, too, have noticed so many folks THING oriented.  It really got <br/>
nasty for a while on Veeshan with KS and people being generally <br/>
nasty.  The server split not long after Kunark came out and things <br/>
have been FAR better there.  We used to have an average of 2600 <br/>
people online during prime time and now it is down to 1800 or so with <br/>
many more zones to explore. <br/>
<br/>
One thing I have done to keep my interest high is play multiple <br/>
characters.  I have several characters in their 20s and none that are <br/>
any higher because I spend time exploring, mastering trade skills or <br/>
generally hanging out with my fantastic guild.  <br/>
<br/>
Speaking of... for anyone interested, I am the Guild Elder and <br/>
Assistant Guildmaster of the Storm of Blades Guild on Veeshan.  We <br/>
are a small, close-knit guild that values friendship above all else.  <br/>
we welcome new members who seek the same values as we do.  Please let <br/>
me know if you have interest in joining.  I realize that for most it <br/>
would mean starting over, but we will be happy to help out with gear <br/>
and leveling (not necessarily power leveling) if anyone transitioned.</div>
