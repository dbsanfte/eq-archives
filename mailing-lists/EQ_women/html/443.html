<b>Subject:</b> balancing EQ with real life :) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385871730">I was just wondering how you all balance playing EQ with real life<br/>
roles/duties.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not actually a EQ player myself, but my husband is.  Since he started to<br/>
play EQ (over 6 months ago), we haven&#39;t done as much as we used to together.<br/>
Before EQ he played Ultima Online but was able to log whenever he felt like<br/>
it in that game.<br/>
<br/>
With EQ it seems like he has to be on longer to get anywhere in the game and<br/>
he isn&#39;t able to log whenever he wants to.  He is a level 50 ranger and is<br/>
in the Plain of Fear a lot right now.  Due to the spawn rates he has to stay<br/>
up late, and be online every day.  He even has taken off work periodically<br/>
to be in the game more.<br/>
<br/>
I know a lot of the game just because it is mostly all of what we talk about<br/>
right now.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I understand online role playing as I ran my own computer BBS for over 5<br/>
years.  I was an avid MUD/MUSH player myself for a while and did play Ultima<br/>
Online for a bit too.   My husband and I actually meet on my BBS when I was<br/>
on college dated for about 3 years and have been married 3 1/2 years.  We<br/>
are both avid computer game players.  Due to life/new hobbies/etc. I haven&#39;t<br/>
been in online games myself for the past 3 years.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t mind him playing EQ as I know it is what he likes to do.  We<br/>
have an understanding that I let him play EQ and I spend my free time doing<br/>
SCA (medieval re-inactment group) activities.<br/>
<br/>
For Christmas all he wanted was anything EQ related.  He also tells me if I<br/>
want to spend more time with him, that I should get a EQ account myself (we<br/>
have a home network which would make this possible). :)<br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering how others balance their life with their significant<br/>
others and EQ playing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
