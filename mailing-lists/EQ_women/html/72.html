<b>Subject:</b> On flirting and getting stuff <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576934523">Hello all sisters...<br/>
Well, after playing a goodie-two-shoes cleric since I first got into the<br/>
game, I decided recently to check out how the other side lives and started a<br/>
female troll shadow knight. The swamp was a new experience alright, and so<br/>
was the famed troll regeneration (watch those HPs zoooom up!). But the<br/>
funniest thing was when I flirted with an ogre warrior in Grobb (some big<br/>
bad &#39;un with a last name). After all the recent discussion here on flirting<br/>
and females getting items, I decided to try out my trollie charms on this<br/>
ogre. All I did was to comment (in my well spoken troll dialect) on what a<br/>
fine basher he seemed to be and emote &quot;:bats her eyelashes at [player]&quot; and<br/>
all of a sudden I received 1 platinum! For a lvl 2 trollie SK, this was<br/>
indeed a fine gift... I guess trollie women have something to teach my<br/>
dwarven cleric when it comes to turning mens heads because my cleric never<br/>
received such a fine gift... :)<br/>
After this encounter, my trollie character is convinced she is indeed<br/>
attractive, but I doubt she will carry her flirting further than the<br/>
eyelashes at the moment. Still it&#39;s proof that it&#39;s not just the wood elves<br/>
that can make a killing by flirting... :) /em smiles fiercely<br/>
