<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648825796">The game averages $50.  Monthy it&#39;s $10, I paid $26 (I think) for 3<br/>
months at a time.  You can pay for larger periods of time for a<br/>
slightly lower per month charge.  My husband and I liked the game so<br/>
much we bought a second copy and networked the computers so we could<br/>
play together.  My 10 year old daughter enjoys playing, also, though I<br/>
know she won&#39;t get very high level wise.  Go to<br/>

&gt;&lt;&lt; Hi there, and welcome to EQ Women!  This mailing list is for women who <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Salutations!<br/>
&gt;I am sorry to come on here but I have a question.<br/>
&gt;I am about to buy this game and I wanted to get some opinion from some of you <br/>
&gt;who are in it about it and how good it is and whether it is worth the cost.<br/>
&gt;I was also curious if someone could tell me what the cost is, after the <br/>
&gt;initial expense of buying the game. The game at the local Best Buy does not <br/>
&gt;give the monthly charge on it at all.<br/>
&gt;I have never been in an online game before so this will be a first.<br/>
&gt;Please feel free to contact me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Brangvyne@...">Brangvyne@...</a> if you can answer any of <br/>
&gt;these questions.<br/>
&gt;And don&#39;t worry, I wont clutter your list up with any other posts until I&#39;m <br/>
&gt;officially a member of the game.<br/>
&gt;:o)<br/>
