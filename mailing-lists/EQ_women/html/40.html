<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527307414">Hi all,<br/>
 I just bought EQ yesterday and haven&#39;t gotten to play<br/>
it yet, however I have already came up several<br/>
characters that I would like to play. As to which<br/>
servers....don&#39;t know yet. My boyfriend and I live<br/>
with each other and are both gonna play EQ. We decided<br/>
that for our first set of characters, we will play<br/>
identical twin sisters. That is so we can watch out<br/>
for each other and learn the game easily without the<br/>
jealousy issue. Hope to see ya soon. The twins are<br/>
Katia and Katya Nadine. If ya see us, see if you can<br/>
tell which is which. Hope to hear from ya&#39;ll soon.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; As for significant others I was quite amazed to<br/>
&gt; read that some that are <br/>
&gt; married don&#39;t &quot;play&quot; that in EQ &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I really dont find it that amazing, but then I am<br/>
&gt; one of the ones that dont <br/>
&gt; RP that relationship with my RL husband in game.  In<br/>
&gt; game we RP brother and <br/>
&gt; sister.  The main reason that came about was (no<br/>
&gt; lectures please ::chuckles) <br/>
&gt; we fought so much initially about the game.  He<br/>
&gt; would die...and get upset <br/>
&gt; with me.  I would level past him...he would get<br/>
&gt; upset with me.  Basically <br/>
&gt; what Im saying is that, though we love each other<br/>
&gt; deeply, we are also <br/>
&gt; entirely too competitive with each other.  Another<br/>
&gt; reason was, we have <br/>
&gt; complete opposite styles of RP (personality wise)<br/>
&gt; and if i spend too long <br/>
&gt; with him in game i want to do something (like give<br/>
&gt; him the biggest wedgie of <br/>
&gt; his life) to make him lighten up.  He can be a bit<br/>
&gt; stuffy.  Needless to say, <br/>
&gt; it makes me want to pull my hair out.  So we<br/>
&gt; determined a very long time ago <br/>
&gt; that our characters were not meant to be together in<br/>
&gt; &quot;that&quot; way.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It actually works very well for us.  And, from the<br/>
&gt; brother and sister <br/>
&gt; standpoint, we actually work very well.  We can also<br/>
&gt; climb in bed at night <br/>
&gt; without the danger of a &quot;game&quot; sending us off to<br/>
&gt; sleep angry with each other. <br/>
&gt;  And we DO get together from time to time to help<br/>
&gt; each other out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In Light,<br/>
