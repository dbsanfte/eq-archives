<b>Subject:</b> Re: Real females on Rallos Zek? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068315807">My RL friend plays on Rallos Zek. He doesn&#39;t SAY he wants me to play there,<br/>
but he keeps asking about the character I made on that server.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway Saturday I spent level 2 being chased by a &quot;female&quot; character named<br/>
Typehere in the newbie area outside Kelethin. It was annoying, though<br/>
there&#39;s no reason to whine and complain if you are playing on Rallos Zek.<br/>
But I just no for certain that Typehere was NOT a real female.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m asking if there ARE any real females on Rallos Zek. I told my friend<br/>
no, he said he thought there were.<br/>
Anyone here play there? How do you put up with the annoyances? I&#39;m as tough<br/>
as anyone, but the game is challenging enough as it is, without worrying<br/>
about &quot;Typeheres.&quot;</div>
