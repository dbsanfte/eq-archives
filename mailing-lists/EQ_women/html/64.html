<b>Subject:</b> Re: Twinking?? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1055211712">I was had been playing on Bristlebane when I found out some real life<br/>
friends were playing on Cazic-Thule. I switched to Cazic-Thule because I<br/>
felt it was good to be around some folks I knew.  These fellow are guys I<br/>
know from our paper and pencil role playing group.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway we made arrangements when I first made my character. My friend<br/>
brought me an entire set of cloth armour. He was a wizard so basically he<br/>
just handed me his clothing. At level 1 I had a cracked staff, then later my<br/>
friends brought me a fine steel staff. I was about level 5 then.<br/>
<br/>
This mini-twinking did make it easier for me to advance. I did not die half<br/>
as many times as I had as my first bristlebane character. I was able to more<br/>
quickly save up for patchwork. A &quot;female&quot; player gave me a good deal on a<br/>
set of patchwork when I was level 4.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think this was serious twinking. And I don&#39;t think I got the stuff<br/>
because I was &quot;female.&quot; I  think they would have given it to a friend<br/>
regardless.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, no one has given me anything. Maybe these other &quot;females&quot;<br/>
are asking for stuff?<br/>
<br/>
By the way, one of my male friends plays a female high elf. He said he plays<br/>
her because he likes to inviso people to killl their pets and likes the<br/>
reaction he gets to his &quot;female&quot; self. Heh. Weird guy.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;  I have lot of different characters, but my two main ones are Dyrlia<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;  As far as flirting goes, I am a notorious flirt and I&#39;ll flirt with<br/>
