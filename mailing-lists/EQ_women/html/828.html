<br/>
&lt;&lt; It sounds like you&#39;re doing a great job for being<br/>
so new to the game. :) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thank you. I am learning new things in EQ all the time<br/>
and having fun, but I still have a lot to learn as<br/>
things come up all the time that I dont understand.<br/>
It&#39;s unfortunate that some people don&#39;t want to &quot;play<br/>
nice&quot; sometimes like a buch of little kids on line,<br/>
but I&#39;ve met some nice people and made some friends<br/>
too.<br/>
;o)<br/>
<br/>
Last night my companion, a lvl 29 bard who was helping<br/>
heal me etc. while I fought in CB and some other guy<br/>
got in a big fight. They were calling each other names<br/>
and saying how they were reporting the other one. Then<br/>
this other guy started instantly killing any creature<br/>
I tried to fight to try to get at my friend. I was<br/>
just telling my friend look, lets just go back to town<br/>
and sell our stuff etc. it&#39;s not worth fighting over.<br/>
Even when my friend explained what was going on later<br/>
in Kelethin it was so silly to be arguing over.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just rambling.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Asking questions actually helps everyone too. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
:o)<br/>
Sometimes I wonder if I&#39;m the only one who does not<br/>
know these things.<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Anytime I can help you, just ask. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, you are a kind person. I always try to help<br/>
people when I can. It&#39;s kind of interesting that<br/>
recently, I get different attention when I&#39;m in game<br/>
than I used to. I finally completed by newbie quest<br/>
armor and everyone is always looking at it and then<br/>
they are asking me to give them money, or armor, or<br/>
buffs, or something. I try to be nice and buff as much<br/>
as I can and I&#39;ve given away more than a few pp but I<br/>
never have extra armor. It&#39;s funny someone told me<br/>
when I first got on that it was considered rude to ask<br/>
people to give you stuff but that apparently does not<br/>
stop a lot of people. I&#39;ve never asked anyone for<br/>
anything that I didn&#39;t offer to pay for in some way. I<br/>
have been given a few things but never asked for any<br/>
of it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve toyed with starting toons on other servers<br/>
just for fun, so if I do, I&#39;ll make sure to look you<br/>
up. :) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you ever start one let me know, I&#39;ve offered before<br/>
that I would be happy to start up a character and<br/>
travel with anyone on list interested and see how well<br/>
we could work as a team. Race, class, server dont<br/>
matter that much if anyone is ever interested in that<br/>
either. I got the idea from my nwn group. There are 4<br/>
- 6 of us that meet most Friday nights at 7 my time<br/>
and play nwn online for 3 - 4 hours. Thought getting a<br/>
group like that for EQ would be interesting to try.<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Happy Hunting, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, you too.<br/>
