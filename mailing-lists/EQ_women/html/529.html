<div id="ygrps-yiv-91707996"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I envy you being a 14 lv druid,  when I tell people I am ONLY lv 6,<br/>
&gt; nobody wants to group with me!  :(<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is sick.  I can&#39;t belive folks would do that.  And then when you<br/>
get to 14 they will be begging you to group to get SOW&#39;s.  Heck I had<br/>
folks tell me to dump my husband ( the only one I really group with now<br/>
) and group with them and then have a fit when I tell them no.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As far as grouping,  I have only been in 3 different groups for any<br/>
&gt; length of time (1-6 hours)<br/>
&gt; The first group didn&#39;t know what they were doing.  Of course, neither<br/>
&gt; did I but they abandoned me in Lesser Feydark AND didn&#39;t split the &gt;loot fair<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OW!!!  Then they wounder why you don&#39;t want to group with them or why<br/>
you want to loot to.  I have gotten &quot;why do you want it, you can&#39;t use<br/>
it&quot;  I tell them to sell so I can buy those great spells you want me to<br/>
cast on you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The second group I was with was great!  They were mostly lowbies (more<br/>
&gt; experienced players with fairly low level characters).  Lots of fun, &gt;and they really helped me out with strategies and not getting lost &gt;(dumb blonde syndrome!)  I don&#39;t believe in twinking (sp?) but it is &gt;nice to get advice from more experienced folks.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*giggles* I&#39;m have red hair and I get lost all them time.  Got lost big<br/>
time in Lavastorm the other night.  All I can say is that the Wood Queen<br/>
( can&#39;t remember the goddess of druids name ) for SOW and Lev.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My advice for grouping-make sure everyone agrees on plan of action<br/>
&gt; before you start-including where to go, what to hunt, any quests &gt;people are on, and order of looting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is the best advice I have heard in a long time.  And I&#39;ll give one<br/>
too.  When someone new comes into a group and you have broken the spawn<br/>
( ex - the small Drev camp in North Ro ) Don&#39;t get talked into moving by<br/>
them.  I have died more times because the others wanted to follow a fool<br/>
like that.<br/>
