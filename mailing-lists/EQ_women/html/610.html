Hi, Sanna, nice to see you here. <br/>
<br/>
I assume your husband has a separate account and PC, or there could <br/>
be some ugly scenes in store as the addiction grips....<br/>
<br/>
How does playing with your RL partner work? My boyfriend thinks I am <br/>
a half-crazed addict, and plans to stick to the odd blast of Quake <br/>
and Unreal, but I rather imagine it to be nice to hunt together. That <br/>
said, there are earlier threads on the board saying the opposite, as <br/>
well as supporting the idea.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, can anyone tell me why my very first post appeared under my <br/>
name, while subsequent ones appear under my e-mail address?<br/>
