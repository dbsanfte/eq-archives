<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233603798">I actually played male characters for decades (starting in pencil &<br/>
dice games).  I started because female chars in chainmail and D&D<br/>
had some penalties .. rolled an 18 00 strength, cut your bonus in<br/>
half or decide your character changes sex ... ummm change sex!<br/>
<br/>
Since I ran an all-girl Roleplaying group ... several of us would<br/>
sometimes play guy chars to liven it up.  We even had a few &quot;play&quot; <br/>
romances, all in fun.  But more we just decided a pair was a couple<br/>
and skipped RPing the romance.<br/>
<br/>
When on-line MUDs first started, being the only female on could be<br/>
quite a distraction. :p  So much so, I sometimes died in &quot;scroll&quot; when<br/>
so many people were commenting &quot;OMG its a female!&quot; I couldn&#39;t see the<br/>
text battle messages fast enough :(  They were all text-based.  Not <br/>
to mention, if only half of the males were interested in a romantic <br/>
story line .. that made about 100 with you the only viable target.<br/>
Eeeeeeeeee.  Since I&#39;d done it before ... I just played males chars for<br/>
breaks.  Then I could actually PLAY the game and SEE it. :)<br/>
<br/>
I still do it when a class or character idea I come up with just &quot;works&quot;<br/>
as a male.  I&#39;m allright in a &quot;male&quot; environment, I was the only girl<br/>
on the farm (and nearby ones) when I grew up, and work in mostly all-male<br/>
fields (only female to 19 men in my dept. today).  So I handle guy stuff OK,<br/>
and have been told I am capable of fitting in with a group of guys well<br/>
enough to become &quot;one of the guys&quot; if we are on a work team long enough.<br/>
I also test as highly agressive and mechanical (and still high when my<br/>
scores are ranked against male scores), so its no surprise I have been<br/>
told I&#39;m believable as a guy in an RPG where they can&#39;t see me and I do no<br/>
 OOC chatting. But, I have to pick my interactions and definitely come up <br/>
with an IC way of avoiding romances.  Its when women hit on me when I&#39;m <br/>
playing a guy  that I get uncomfortable.  There&#39;s no parallel to what I&#39;m<br/>
used to since there is no hitting on me allowed at work!  Of course, now its<br/>
probably a guy playing a girl who&#39;s hitting on a guy played by a girl to &quot;see <br/>
what its like&quot;. Isn&#39;t THAT a twist!  Run awaaaaaaay .....<br/>
<br/>
I do find that now that female characters are plentiful, my first choice is<br/>
to play a female and my male/female char ratio is about 1 to 10 in favor of<br/>
playing women.  And my male characters generally get played for shorter<br/>
periods<br/>
than the females as well.  Most of my male characters nowadays are<br/>
&quot;adopted&quot; by<br/>
my son, who is too young to play.  And he is allowed to help make action<br/>
choices.  <br/>
So they sort of end up male-played by proxy.<br/>
<br/>
There is a male troll warrior out there tonight who was being played by a<br/>
co-op of a grey-haired lady and her 1st grade son. Muhahaha.  Ungh? is a<br/>
fairly<br/>
sexless response ... <br/>
<br/>
FYI<br/>
womengamers is planning on doing a survey on women playing men in the future.<br/>
(they&#39;re based in my hometown!)<br/>
