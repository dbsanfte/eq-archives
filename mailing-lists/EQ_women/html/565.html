<div id="ygrps-yiv-785453729">Interesting thought - &quot;deterred by fantasies&quot;.   For me &quot;fulfilled by<br/>
fantasies&quot; is a better phrase I think.<br/>
<br/>
I have a psychological &quot;challenge&quot; due to events that happened to me as a<br/>
toddler.  One therapist&#39;s view was &quot;Well, if someone asked me how to ruin a<br/>
person&#39;s life, I&#39;d tell them to do what happened to you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so I can sit back and feel sorry for myself and let my life be ruined,<br/>
or I can go out and take the bull by the horns and wrestle it to the ground.<br/>
I have chosen the latter.  I know what the deficit is.  I know what triggers<br/>
the extreme reactions.  And I have, through the help of some highly talented<br/>
professionals, developed an arsenal for dealing with my &quot;ruined life&quot; events<br/>
when they get triggered.<br/>
<br/>
This is not something that will ever go away.  The best I can do is manage<br/>
it.  And one way I can manage it is by filling that great void inside of me<br/>
through fantasy.  This is not something I can ask my husband to fulfill as<br/>
doing so would warp our marriage.  This is not something I want my kids to<br/>
even see (though they know sometimes Mom is really struggling and as they<br/>
get older they learn a bit more about why).<br/>
<br/>
So, by examining how my relationship with Sylv filled this void and<br/>
recognizing it was not wanting that part of the fantasy to go that was<br/>
causing the pain, we were able to find a &quot;win/win/win&quot; situation for all<br/>
three of us.  I could not emotionally handle having a tragic ending to my<br/>
little romantic comedy.  Ending the romance left Ice homeless and unloved<br/>
and, well, who wants to play THAT?!?!?!?<br/>
<br/>
So we backed the story up to the night when he decided to &quot;throw propriety<br/>
to the wind&quot; and we started our romance.  This time, he makes a different<br/>
choice.  He adheres to propriety and instead of having an affair with me, he<br/>
adopts me.  I still mother his orphaned newborn twins (their mother commited<br/>
suicide and they were ripped from her womb by an eagle).  He still comforts<br/>
me through the death of my fiancee (his son - which is why there was a major<br/>
propriety issue) while I comfort him through the death of his wife.<br/>
<br/>
No sad endings.  And the paternal relationship, which was a major part of<br/>
our romance anyway, still lives.  There is just no underlying romance.  I<br/>
wish he weren&#39;t so dedicated to the Empress (boy, does that story line<br/>
suddenly fit ;-) but my childhood crush will be replaced by a more<br/>
appropriate relationship eventually.<br/>
<br/>
Great RP, a good story, and doesn&#39;t threaten his girlfriend.  I&#39;m actually<br/>
quite proud of this solution.  And we were laughing ourselves silly last<br/>
night as we kicked off the new RP (he had to pick himself up off the floor<br/>
when I told him that I thought it was time to stop mourning Cian&#39;s death and<br/>
start dating - he&#39;s even giving me advice on who he thinks would be good for<br/>
me to go out with).<br/>
<br/>
It also answers her question about his first marriage in Norrath.  &quot;How can<br/>
you say those things to another woman when you haven&#39;t said them to me?&quot; .<br/>
Because IRL you can&#39;t go back and rewrite your story when things go awry.<br/>
In Norrath you can!<br/>
<br/>
And when things get tough, I can still close my eyes and have him hold me<br/>
and tell me there is nothing to be afraid of.  All the anxiety is from a<br/>
past that is over and won&#39;t repeat itself.   And since this is one of the<br/>
major tools in my aresenal against allowing my childhood to ruin my life,<br/>
keeping it is important.<br/>
<br/>
Ice<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  Yes, he knows about the issues I face and he knows his role in my<br/>
dealing with them.  It would be dishonest not to tell him.  And it makes him<br/>
feel good that he helps.  Because, after all, isn&#39;t that what friends are<br/>
for?<br/>
