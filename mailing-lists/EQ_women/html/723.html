<div id="ygrps-yiv-817929353"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; So is everyone having fun in Luclin?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Didn&#39;t know it was out.  Can you tell us a bit about it?  Getting a little<br/>
bored in Albion *sigh*.  Are there new classes and races one can try out? <br/>
That might bring me to Luclin for a bit to see.  <br/>
<br/>
Trying to play an MMORPG with only 3-10 hours a week is a challenge.  It&#39;s<br/>
hard to stay connected to the community with that little time.  And I will<br/>
never again have the time to devote to a plane raid.  Hmmm... maybe I don&#39;t<br/>
have the lifestyle for this anymore *cries pitifully*  <br/>
