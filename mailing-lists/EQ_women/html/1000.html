<br/>
Weddings in EQ can be a lot of fun as well as other<br/>
non exp grinding events. We had a trivia contest and<br/>
kind of a scavenger hunt once in my old guild for<br/>
prizes. It was fun. I&#39;ve seen dueling contests in<br/>
guilds set up by levels and even contests in things<br/>
like swimming. All fun for me, but then I get tired fo<br/>
grinding exp all day.<br/>
<br/>
I had my cleric&#39;s wedding in the big chruch looking<br/>
building on the moon . . . don&#39;t even remember the<br/>
zone name off the top of my head. When my cleric got<br/>
married it was by the sleeping dragon. This one was<br/>
really planned out with each of us and the cleric<br/>
having a number of pre set buttons for certain parts<br/>
without having to type so much on the spot. I wrote<br/>
out vows and customized them for EQ and for our<br/>
classes . . . cleric and ranger. It was fun.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; I go to all the weddings I can.  (Weddings and<br/>
&gt; babies are my only female<br/>
&gt; interests.)  At one, the cleric knew what to say and<br/>
&gt; the couple exchanged<br/>
&gt; rings and everything.  (He got a turtlebone ring. <br/>
&gt; Think she planned to<br/>
&gt; throw him in the fountain.)  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The prettiest one was held by the stream in Sanctus<br/>
&gt; Seru.  People brought<br/>
&gt; cake, we all drank.  Then they retired to duel!  The<br/>
&gt; only bad spot was<br/>
&gt; during the mass buffings frenzy, one person turned<br/>
&gt; into a doggie.  The NPC<br/>
&gt; near there didn&#39;t like that.<br/>
