<div id="ygrps-yiv-432370504">A language instructor was explaining to her class that French nouns,<br/>
unlike<br/>
  their English counterparts, are  grammatically designated as  masculine or<br/>
  feminine. Things like &quot;Chalk&quot; or &quot;Pencil,&quot; she explained, would have a<br/>
  gender association although in English these words were neutral.<br/>
<br/>
  Puzzled, one student raised his hand and asked, &quot;What gender is a<br/>
computer?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  The teacher wasn&#39;t certain which it was, and so divided the class into two<br/>
  groups and asked them to decide if a computer should be masculine or<br/>
  feminine. One group was comprised of the women in the class, and the other<br/>
  of men. Both groups were asked to give four  reasons for their<br/>
  recommendation.<br/>
<br/>
  The group of women concluded that computers should be referred to in the<br/>
  masculine gender because:<br/>
  1)  In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.<br/>
  2)  They have a lot of data but are still clueless.<br/>
  3)  They are supposed to help you solve your problems, but half the time<br/>
  they are the problem.<br/>
  4)  As soon as you commit to one, you realize that, if you had waited a<br/>
  little longer, you could have had a better model.<br/>
<br/>
  The men, on the other hand, decided that computers should definitely be<br/>
  referred to in the feminine gender because:<br/>
  1)  No one but their creator understands their internal logic.<br/>
  2)  The native language they use to communicate with other computers is<br/>
  incomprehensible to everyone else.<br/>
  3)  Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for  later<br/>
  retrieval.<br/>
  4)  As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending<br/>
half<br/>
  your paycheck on accessories for it.</div>
