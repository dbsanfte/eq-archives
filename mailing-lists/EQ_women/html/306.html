<div id="ygrps-yiv-571348168">Christina, thanks!  I am still heavy into Povar, but have almost completely<br/>
dropped my character on Rallos Zek.  She was a bitch, and she was fun, but I<br/>
don&#39;t really have the time for more than one primary.  However, I do have a<br/>
character on Quellios to attend Dnaice&#39;s wedding with, and I do indeed plan to<br/>
create a &quot;sister&quot; on Brell to play with you lovely ladies. =)<br/>
<br/>
Sara, Povar<br/>
