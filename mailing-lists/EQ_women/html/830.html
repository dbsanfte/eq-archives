<br/>
Does anyone know if I have two computers in my house<br/>
with seperate axcess to EQ if I could run the same<br/>
copy of EQ on both? Assuming I have access for both to<br/>
the internet at the same time which I dont but soon<br/>
will could I run the same copy of EQ at the same time<br/>
and have two characters online controled by two<br/>
people? Or, would I have to have two paid accounts to<br/>
do this?<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering if anyone might know the answer to<br/>
that. If no one knows the answer for sure does anyone<br/>
have any suggestions of places to start looking for an<br/>
answer, or who I should contact?<br/>
<br/>
