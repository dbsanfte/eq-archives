<br/>
Iceiallana the first was a 54 Druid on Brell.  She rescued a Highalander who<br/>
was lost in the fairy world and he named his first and only daughter after her<br/>
:-)  She has chosen to study the healing arts and sneaks into the basement of<br/>
the Acadamy where Merlin&#39;s old scrolls are hidden to learn more of the<br/>
Goddess.  She is now in Avalon Marshes researching her mother&#39;s religious<br/>
affiliations and will become a priestess of both her God and the Goddess<br/>
which, in all likelihood, will have her branded a heretic somewhere down the<br/>
lines.<br/>
<br/>
*giggles*  Nice to be playing again :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Greetings everyone!  I have been playing EQ for almost a year now.  <br/>
My main character is Deikkena Stormreaper, a level 41 halfling druid <br/>
on the Solusek Ro server.  I&#39;m glad to see that there are more women <br/>
who play EQ out there-sometimes I feel kinda alone!  :)  /wave<br/>
