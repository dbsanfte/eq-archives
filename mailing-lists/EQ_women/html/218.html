<div id="ygrps-yiv-878246121">My husband and his friends that he groups with routinly are moving to the<br/>
race wars server when it comes up. They asked me what I will do when they do<br/>
that. There is no question in my mind what I will do, I will not move with<br/>
them. I will keep my character on Rodcet Nife. I am not a PVP person in any<br/>
way shape or form, and I am not saying anything bad about those that are<br/>
PVP, it is just not my thing. I don&#39;t care what forum PVP is presented it is<br/>
just not my thing. I don&#39;t mind going around killing the mean evil nasty<br/>
things that infest our world, but when it comes to a real PC, I just can&#39;t<br/>
do it. :)<br/>
