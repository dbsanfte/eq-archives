<b>Subject:</b> Re: balancing EQ with real life :) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086838477">Dear Jennifer:<br/>
<br/>
I am a single parent going to college and working part time.  I play EQ with my<br/>
boyfriend (separate computers, different cities, hehe) about two hours a night.<br/>
I put the kids to bed, and the time is mine.  I do not play during the day on<br/>
weekends unless my kids are with their dad.<br/>
<br/>
I have brought one character to 15, and one character to 21, and I have a couple<br/>
of other newbies that I grew tired of.  I play essentially one character, and<br/>
it&#39;s enough for me.  Before my boyfriend and I started dating, we both played<br/>
ALOT more than we do now (my kids were usually asleep by the time I got home)...<br/>
fancy that! &lt;grin&gt; I know for a fact it was a nice little escape world for me.<br/>
<br/>
I do not care that I have been playing this game for almost a year now (more if<br/>
you count beta) and I am still at level 21.  But then, I have competition in<br/>
alot of other areas in my life, and it&#39;s nice that this is one place I don&#39;t<br/>
have to worry about refreshing my house every day or keeping up with my MUD<br/>
mail.  My boyfriend and I usually find someone to hunt with, or we meet new<br/>
people and make new friends, or if we really CAN&#39;T find anyone (very rare), we<br/>
do a quest.<br/>
<br/>
BUT we also do not play when the kids are awake, during work hours, or on<br/>
weekends when we have special plans.  And if he had ever told me to come to<br/>
Norrath if I wanted to see him, I would probably not be dating him.  Bit<br/>
different when you&#39;re married, though. =(</div>
