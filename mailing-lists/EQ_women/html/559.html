<div><font face="Arial" size="2">First of all I&#39;m irate at Verant.&nbsp; Apparently 
they not only keep text logs of all text in the game, they allow these logs 
outside the company (or, at least ONE employee has distributed them).&nbsp; 
</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I have been playing an in-game love story for about 
the last 4-5 months.&nbsp; I&#39;m married and he has a serious, though out of town, 
girlfriend.&nbsp; It is purely fantasy RP.&nbsp; But it&#39;s fun.&nbsp; Well, 
apparently his RL GF has a friend at Verant who gave her access to all the text 
files that he has generated  - i.e., she has read large quantities of his 
private conversations.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Bottom line is that she sees me as a threat and so 
the in-game romance/relationship is off.&nbsp; I can&#39;t fault him for caring more 
for his real life girlfriend.&nbsp; But it leaves me with this huge empty hole 
inside.&nbsp; It is the RP aspect of EQ that I enjoy the most.&nbsp; Cute little 
wood elf druid in love with adorable half elf ranger.&nbsp; We ran our guild 
together.&nbsp; We had a full blown fantasy and it&#39;s gone and I don&#39;t want it to 
be.&nbsp; I have no choice.&nbsp;&nbsp; But Norrath is filled with memories that 
now feel sort of sour.&nbsp; After all, we were planning our in-game 
wedding!&nbsp; </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">This is not the first RP relationship I&#39;ve 
had.&nbsp; It&#39;s the third with the first ending on a good, though sad, note when 
he left because he had pulled his life together.&nbsp; The second one I 
ended&nbsp; because I didn&#39;t like the way I was treated - my player feelings 
being subjugated to the RP for the sake of the RP.&nbsp; And now this.&nbsp; 
</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">What&#39;s sad is that if anything I help her since I 
know this man&#39;s idiosyncracies and come down on him for some of them.&nbsp; In 
fact, I had told him something in our relationship which he took into theirs and 
it made him more attentive to her needs and less self-absorbed in his own 
thoughts.&nbsp; He told me about it.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Anyway, I&#39;m not going to change the current 
situation.&nbsp; He has to do what he feels necessary and right, wrong, or 
indifferent she feels threatened by his having a relationship in-game.&nbsp; 
I&#39;ll still be his friend, but playing together isn&#39;t going to work out the 
same.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">My husband had the best response.&nbsp; &quot;You need a 
new game.&nbsp; Too bad there aren&#39;t any out there&quot;.&nbsp; I tried Diablo 2 and 
blech.&nbsp; To me EQ is all about the people and it is the people that I 
enjoy.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">So I am sitting here wondering if I have what it 
takes to try again.&nbsp; I know at least four players who were more than 
thrilled to lend me a shoulder to cry on.&nbsp; I am well loved in the game and 
that&#39;s nice.&nbsp; I&#39;m sure I could build a new romance.&nbsp; I&#39;m just 
wondering if it&#39;s worth it emotionally.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I get attached to my characters (when I played with 
my first partner I would cry when he decided he didn&#39;t want to play a character 
anymore and even though it was the same partner, the loss of that character hurt 
).&nbsp; </font><font face="Arial" size="2">I cry at sad movies.&nbsp; I cry at the 
end of good books.&nbsp; That kind of attachment to characters is part of who I 
am and I wouldn&#39;t want to change it.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">But my heart has gone out of the game with 
this.&nbsp; I&#39;m scheduled for a raid tonight and they are voting on my 
membership in a new guild this week and I don&#39;t want to shoot myself in the foot 
by just stopping right now.&nbsp; He&#39;s sorting out where he feels the boundaries 
are since he wants our friendship (we both do) but isn&#39;t sure what violates his 
promise to his GF and what doesn&#39;t.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Anyway, I&#39;m just trying to sort through what is 
healthy and not healthy for me wrt to EQ now.&nbsp; I&#39;m happily married for 15 
years and have 2 kids and that&#39;s what MATTERS.&nbsp; But I&#39;ve always had an 
active fantasy life and having people to populate it with thier own independent 
input has just been a delight.&nbsp; But Norrath is transient and people come 
and people go.&nbsp; And each loss hurts.&nbsp; Some more than others.&nbsp; 
Each is the loss of&nbsp;a friend (Brell isn&#39;t the same without Luna, for 
example).</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Anyway, insights and perspective are welcome.&nbsp; 
</font></div>
