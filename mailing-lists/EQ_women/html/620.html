<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268598635">Has anyone played a male persona for any length of time? I have <br/>
started them, but don&#39;t seem to get far before I lose interest; I <br/>
don&#39;t think I can easily explain this. The experience is not vastly <br/>
different from playing a newbie female, since, on the whole, people <br/>
are willing to help and give you things. I wonder if it is different <br/>
at higher levels? Does a female playing a male come across as camp? <br/>
Do the male players react to that? What would you need to do to carry <br/>
off playing a male more convincingly?<br/>
<br/>
I certainly notice some, not all, groups being somewhat patronising <br/>
(eg assuming a male player will pull, when I am plainly better <br/>
equipped and more experienced in the locality), but the same groups <br/>
tend to be more likely to be protective towards me too. I suppose <br/>
that is an advantage, but one I do not seek or welcome. Like anyone <br/>
else, I want to play with a trustworthy, competent group, and fulfil <br/>
my role in it. Perhaps the oddest thing is that the patronising type <br/>
of group often doesn&#39;t know whether I am female, but merely goes from <br/>
the skin I wear.<br/>
<br/>
Most of you have far more experience than me, and must have tried <br/>
this out more extensively. <br/>
