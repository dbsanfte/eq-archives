&gt;&gt; here ya go - i get that irl &gt;=P<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;I guess I do too, but my husband saids I got that look ( I&#39;m from the<br/>
&gt;south and we live near DC ) so folks back off and leave me alone.  He<br/>
&gt;told me I&#39;m like a mama bear protecting it&#39;s young :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i just get people who say i&#39;m a really great friend, conversationalist,<br/>
mature, etc...then they would find out my age (i was usually a few years<br/>
younger) and then i suddenly was an immature child *scowls* bastages<br/>
<br/>
hehe<br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; i&#39;ve always been told the lookout tower in the middle of lake rathe<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now that sounds cool.  But are there lots of stone skeletons there? I<br/>
&gt;have tried to stay on the shore as much as possible when I have gone<br/>
&gt;there.  Heck I get more times than anyone in the guild.  That the makers<br/>
&gt;of EQ for Gate :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i&#39;ve only been on the island in lake rathe once. i saw a few aqua gobbies<br/>
and then the mean mofo boss aqua gobbie. i can&#39;t remember what lev i<br/>
was...prolly below 21. if you have enough people i&#39;m sure you can keep the<br/>
place clean *G*<br/>
<br/>
as to how for marriages - i&#39;ve heard mention of getting a hold of a gm (to<br/>
get the name change and ceremony), make an appt (remember to book a bard for<br/>
singing, a baker for treats, a brewer (or buy lots of booze) for the guests,<br/>
yadda yadda), and then have the ceremony. i was actually to be the bard at<br/>
one friends wedding but the bugger forgot to tell me WHEN other than - when<br/>
she hits lev 25. hehe. and now he finds out married life ain&#39;t so great ;) LOL<br/>
<br/>

&gt;I got to 14 with the cleric I played.  Got to love Bind :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*beams* thanks to ex-partner (now 34 enc) he showed me befallen and i should<br/>
have had 16 last night other than we died (yes, it&#39;s possible for someone<br/>
that high to die in that dungeon). i&#39;m really trying hard not to be a<br/>
powerleveller but no one will beleive me ;)<br/>
