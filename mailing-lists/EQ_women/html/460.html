 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry, I deleted the original e-mail so I don&#39;t remember all the<br/>
details, but maybe you can do something like what I did.  My boyfriend<br/>
and I both have computers strategically placed side by side, and we used<br/>
to play both EQ and Ultima Online together.  It&#39;s great for grouping<br/>
because the communication is instant and direct.  I know that this<br/>
wouldn&#39;t work for you since he is level 50 and you would be a newbie if<br/>
you started a new account.  I had a similar situation though because I<br/>
decided that I like EQ better, and he likes UO better, so we each chose<br/>
our favorite game and quit playing together.  We still play our<br/>
different games side by side, which is nice.  We don&#39;t talk nonstop, but<br/>
it&#39;s still fun because we can each see what the other is doing and<br/>
sometimes we ask for updates.  I still feel like we are sharing our time<br/>
together.  Also, when one of us gets up for a drink, we do things like<br/>
get drinks for the other person at the same time.  It&#39;s fun to lean over<br/>
and watch the other person too - especially if you play a caster and you<br/>
are meditating for mana.  It gets boring sometimes to just sit around<br/>
even if for a few seconds.<br/>
<br/>
Also, another person on the list said something about maybe reading<br/>
while he plays.  I do this as well.  I take night classes, so I cannot<br/>
play as much as I&#39;d like, but my boyfriend has all the time in the world<br/>
so he does play while I study.  He takes breaks from time to time to go<br/>
to the bathroom or get a drink, so he always makes sure to come over and<br/>
see how I am doing.  I do the same thing.  I walk up to him as he is<br/>
playing to check out the gaming situation, and sometimes I ask him what<br/>
is going on.  It seems to work for us.  Oh, I study in the same room as<br/>
he plays so it helps.  Just being near him is good.  Yes, sometimes I am<br/>
distracted by the game sounds or if he gets excited and types a little<br/>
faster, but I like being there and somehow, I don&#39;t feel as if I am<br/>
missing out so much this way.  At the same time, he is happy because he<br/>
can play the game.<br/>
<br/>
Another person also suggested a &quot;date night.&quot;  We do this once a week as<br/>
well.  We usually go to the beach or a movie on Saturday or Sunday.  One<br/>
day is not a lot of time away from the game (and it&#39;s not even a full<br/>
day), so if either of you are addicted to your computer, it&#39;s not so<br/>
much time away at all.  He may not have a problem with playing a newbie<br/>
character sometime just to hang out with your new character if you get<br/>
one, but since he is collecting his ranger armor, he may want to focus<br/>
on this for awhile too.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that this helps!<br/>

<br/>
p.s. I play on both E&#39;ci and Veeshan and have a hard time finding people<br/>
to group because I only play once a week at the most.  Most my chars are<br/>
low level (around 5) and I have one level 16 mage &quot;Meilani&quot; on E&#39;ci, so<br/>
if anyone ever wants an extra person in their group, please let me know!</div>
