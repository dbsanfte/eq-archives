<div id="ygrps-yiv-395118188">Hi Everyone!  Well I just wanted to comment on a few things - the flirting<br/>
in game - well I think that is up to you, I flirt a good bit myself - but I<br/>
am a very strong willed Dark Elven Necromancer and most men just can not<br/>
handle that heh - oh and I am finally level 49 woohoo!  But my husband also<br/>
plays and we generally play online together.  We are in a guild and are 2 of<br/>
the 3 in power; everyone in our guild knows we are married in real life<br/>
because we keep in constant contact through our web site and email - and a<br/>
little yahoo messanger also.  Most of the guys think of me as a sister and<br/>
would never dream of flirting with me.<br/>
<br/>
The second comment is - yes there are very young players online - my 11 year<br/>
old girl plays as much as her school and chores will permit - but she plays<br/>
a male character - she did not like the guys flirting her (severe tomboy).<br/>
Again she is in our guild and everyone knows who she is and watches out for<br/>
her so I never worry as far as that goes.<br/>
<br/>
Third - the online addiction - geeze I also played Ultima Online, which was<br/>
my first online game.  The reason I played was because my husband created me<br/>
a character so I would want to play and would not tell him to get off<br/>
constantly.  Well it worked and then I bought EQ and convienced him to<br/>
switch.  Yes it is a battle to balance R/L and game in my opinion.  But the<br/>
thing is you just have to remember what is really important in your life and<br/>
make that first.  Some weeks I rarely play we are so busy or just want to<br/>
veg out together - other weeks we eat sanwitches and pizza and play every<br/>
single day, with no housework getting done.  But everything balances itself<br/>
out I think.  We work very hard not to lose sight of what is really<br/>
important!<br/>
<br/>
See you in game!!<br/>
