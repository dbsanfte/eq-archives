&gt; &gt;Oh dear.  At level 3 you only get 1/2 hour to get your corpse...after<br/>
&gt; &gt;level 6 that&#39;s when you get a week...what were you doing in High Pass?<br/>
&gt; &gt;Someone lead you astray.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wanted to go, and the group I was with did very well at keeping me<br/>
&gt; safe...until I got separated. I wanted to go. It was my choice. It&#39;s boring<br/>
&gt; staying in the same place all the time. I really didn&#39;t have anything that<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t be easily replaced. It was nice seeing new surroundings. :)<br/>
