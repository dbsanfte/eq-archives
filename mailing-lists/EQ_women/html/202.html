<div id="ygrps-yiv-1964984639">Okay, how about this? August 6th, on the Quellios server, in the Freeport Arena?<br/>
Starting time, say 7 PM PST (that&#39;s 10 PM for you East coasties, if that&#39;s too<br/>
late for a Friday night, just let me know and we can negotiate. &lt;grins&gt;)? I&#39;ll<br/>
make a character and let you know what your &quot;hostess&#39;s&quot; name is...... =P<br/>

&gt; &gt; Subject: Hello!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; New subscription to the list here.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know what&#39;s usual for an introduction, but here goes:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m an (alost) middle-aged computer person/working mom.  I&#39;ve been RPGing<br/>
&gt; &gt; since I was 11 years old (started in pre D&D era), and since D&D, AD&D,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Traveller, ICE, GURPS etc ... all came out when I was in high school to<br/>
&gt; &gt; college I pen & paper RPed/GMed/DMed a lot back then.  I ran an all-female<br/>
&gt; &gt; group around 20 years ago in my college hometown which at one time<br/>
&gt; included<br/>
&gt; &gt; my then 80-90-year-old (passed away now) conservative German immigrant<br/>
&gt; &gt; grandmother.  She would visit and I really got to ask &quot;Canasta or D&D?&quot;.<br/>
&gt; :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;  I also ran mixed and male-only (except for me) groups.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Due to time contraints of job and children I haven&#39;t done pencil & paper<br/>
&gt; &gt; games for at well over a decade, but do play on-line!  I&#39;ve played other<br/>
&gt; &gt; on-line RPGs (but not UO for more than 1 week) for years, and am now<br/>
&gt; &gt; playing in EQ.  Since I never have enough time ... my characters &quot;never<br/>
&gt; &gt; amount to much&quot;.  But I have fun!  My almost teen daughter has played<br/>
&gt; &gt; on-line with me in two other RPGs (supervised), and helps with the EQ<br/>
&gt; &gt; character creation.  If I can ever get ADSL here, we&#39;ll be a mother &<br/>
&gt; &gt; daughter team on-line. :) Sometimes I think we have as much fun coming up<br/>
&gt; &gt; with the ideas for a character as actually playing them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I like to experiment with character ideas and right now have no &quot;main&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; character.  So far I like Enchanter & Bard.  Though my Necromancer is<br/>
&gt; &gt; surprisingly fun to play.  I sort of enjoy the amazement (do they even<br/>
&gt; &gt; belive me?) when I claim that it REALLY is a female player behind this<br/>
&gt; &gt; female character.  I know thay don&#39;t belive me when I tell many of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; college age males that I&#39;ve been playing/running RPGs longer than they&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; been alive (and I&#39;m female). ;)  I mainly play on Erollisi Marr, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; occasionally play on the Test Server.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; - Lora<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; P.S.<br/>
&gt; &gt; My husband tolerates us well (he&#39;s not an RPGer), and I&#39;m waiting to see<br/>
&gt; if<br/>
&gt; &gt; my son got &quot;the gene&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; At the moment:<br/>
&gt; &gt; Starling, Lisonja, Ainsley, Meute, Mitte, Shaelie & Leontine<br/>
&gt; &gt; on Erollisi Marr<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; group around 20 years ago in my college hometown which at one time<br/>
&gt; included<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; my then 80-90-year-old (passed away now) conservative German immigrant<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; grandmother.  She would visit and I really got to ask &quot;Canasta or D&D?&quot;.<br/>
&gt; :)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  I also ran mixed and male-only (except for me) groups.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Due to time contraints of job and children I haven&#39;t done pencil & paper<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; games for at well over a decade, but do play on-line!  I&#39;ve played other<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; on-line RPGs (but not UO for more than 1 week) for years, and am now<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; playing in EQ.  Since I never have enough time ... my characters &quot;never<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; amount to much&quot;.  But I have fun!  My almost teen daughter has played<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; on-line with me in two other RPGs (supervised), and helps with the EQ<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; character creation.  If I can ever get ADSL here, we&#39;ll be a mother &<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; daughter team on-line. :) Sometimes I think we have as much fun coming<br/>
&gt; up<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with the ideas for a character as actually playing them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I like to experiment with character ideas and right now have no &quot;main&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; character.  So far I like Enchanter & Bard.  Though my Necromancer is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; surprisingly fun to play.  I sort of enjoy the amazement (do they even<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; belive me?) when I claim that it REALLY is a female player behind this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; female character.  I know thay don&#39;t belive me when I tell many of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; college age males that I&#39;ve been playing/running RPGs longer than<br/>
&gt; they&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; been alive (and I&#39;m female). ;)  I mainly play on Erollisi Marr, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; occasionally play on the Test Server.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I know I&#39;ve accidently dropped something...my back pack... and then it was<br/>
&gt; gone, and that was really all there was to it. Tough luck for me. The way I<br/>
&gt; accidently dropped something was having all my slots full as I was looting<br/>
&gt; my corpse and mistakenly trying to pick up something else with a right<br/>
&gt; click. I shouted and ooced a bit asking if anyone had seen my backpack with<br/>
&gt; my newbie club in it, but there was no answer. Forget it. Tough pattoooties<br/>
&gt; on me.<br/>

&gt; &gt;     Hi everyone,<br/>
&gt; &gt;     I have a question for You all, i dont know if anyone else has<br/>
&gt; experianced this but well here goes.  I wont go in to which server and what<br/>
&gt; characters but on the server that i play on a friend of mine was accused of<br/>
&gt; stealing from another player, they say they didnt see the other person in<br/>
&gt; the room and the other party involved swears on them sitting on top of this<br/>
&gt; item for some reason they have dropped in the floor.  Now for the reasons<br/>
&gt; this was in the floor i still dont understand.  Now this is me but if<br/>
&gt; something is laying there its open for the taking people drop unwanted stuff<br/>
&gt; all the time.  I wont go into all the deltails but there was a big todo<br/>
&gt; about it and i was trying to talk my friend into giving it back and had them<br/>
&gt; talked into it when the other party in question and their friends started<br/>
&gt; threating.  Ok now this makes me angery be cause they threaten them with<br/>
&gt; having a GM friend delete their character.  By this point i am angery one<br/>
&gt; because i do what ever i can to help people, so i let them know how stupid i<br/>
&gt; though this whole matter was to try to get someone deleted.... this lovely<br/>
&gt; female if she was inturn desided she wanted to call me a bitch while all<br/>
&gt; along i am trying to get her her things back in which i did.  Now i will<br/>
&gt; take alot but that was something that was uncalled for me knowing if all of<br/>
&gt; them had just kept their mouths shut i could have gotten the stuff back with<br/>
&gt; out any furth happenings other than what had gone on before i logged on.<br/>
&gt; Has this happened to anyone else or is my server just full of rude Arse<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve had people who have yelled at me when I was trying to help them as<br/>
&gt; well.  I think their are a lot of reasons why this kind of thing happens:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Many people are instinctively untrusting of other players because they<br/>
&gt; expect them to kill steal, cheat, lie, and do anything they can to get more<br/>
&gt; XP/loot.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Many people don&#39;t feel that the social rules of normal society apply to<br/>
&gt; online society, especially when they are playing a character.  They feel<br/>
&gt; disassociated from social responsibility because it&#39;s all not real.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; All you can do in this situation is state factually &quot;I&#39;m trying to help<br/>
&gt; you, whether you believe it or not&quot;.  If they&#39;re still abusive, they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; really not worth helping! It sounds to me like your approach was quite<br/>
&gt; reasonable.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My own recent abusive story was as follows.  I was fighting an aviak<br/>
&gt; avocet in south karana, and I had to leave the zone, so I shouted &#39;avocet to<br/>
&gt; lake rathe zone&#39;.  On the way out, the avocet got distracted and jumped on<br/>
&gt; two people fighting a rook.  I turned around, went into hand to hand combat<br/>
&gt; to get the avocet off of them (taking massive damage in the process).  I<br/>
&gt; then ran the avocet away, doubled back, and bolted their rook to death<br/>
&gt; because I knew, after the avocet was on them, they&#39;d probably be too weak to<br/>
&gt; finish this.  After the fact, they accused me of trying to train the avocet<br/>
&gt; onto them, and then trying to STEAL THEIR ROOK KILL (which I didn&#39;t).  What<br/>
&gt; really annoyed me was one of these people was someone I&#39;d had a pleasent<br/>
&gt; conversation or two with in the past.  Luckily, most people in that zone<br/>
&gt; know I&#39;m a nice person (probably because I have a general policy of helping<br/>
&gt; out anyone I see in hand to hand with an aviak, and I heal people who are<br/>
&gt; badly hurt while fighting!<br/>
&gt; &gt; ).  So, when they started yelling in OOC about what they thought I was<br/>
&gt; doing, people believed me when I explained what had really happened.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; On a last and completely unrelated note, I must admit with some<br/>
&gt; embarassment that I accepted an expensive gift from a higher level druid<br/>
&gt; last night.  He gave me mamoth leggings and...I just couldn&#39;t turn them<br/>
&gt; down.  One rule I have which makes something like that much easier to bare,<br/>
&gt; is that I will never sell any gift I&#39;m given.  Instead, I will try and give<br/>
&gt; it to some worthy newbie (by worthy I mean untwinked and capable of role<br/>
&gt; play).  So, when I get those gator scale leggings, some druid newbie is<br/>
&gt; going to get a nice surprise.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hey Lora!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think many of us have played pen-and-paper RPGs.  I&#39;ve also played RPGs<br/>
&gt; since I was 11 (starting with the original Basic D&D).  I actually ran an<br/>
&gt; RPG zine for a while, and wrote a module for Dungeon magazine.  I&#39;ve also<br/>
&gt; reviewed TSR/GURPS material prior to publication (translation: I knew a guy<br/>
&gt; who wrote for them, and I reviewed his manuscripts).  At one time I<br/>
&gt; seriously considered becoming a full time RPG writer, but then I saw my<br/>
&gt; friend who did it full time still lived with his parents, and I decided to<br/>
&gt; be a computer programmer instead 8)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My favorite pen and paper RPG is without a doubt Ars Magica.  I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; figure out why it hasn&#39;t become the most popular RPG ever actully.  The<br/>
&gt; thing I like the most about it is its magic system, which ... well I won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; go into the whole thing but it&#39;s super cool.  Wait, here is a link which<br/>
&gt; describes it, so you can read about it if you want.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://azathoth.gg.caltech.edu/troupe/ars/magic.html">http://azathoth.gg.caltech.edu/troupe/ars/magic.html</a><br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; What I really like about this system is that it is a two dimensional<br/>
&gt; system.  In Everquest, for example, a spell is an &#39;Evocation&#39; spell (and you<br/>
&gt; have an evocation skill).  In Ars Magica, if you wanted to throw fireballs<br/>
&gt; around you&#39;d have to train up &#39;Creo&#39; (create) and &#39;Ignem&#39; (fire).  But, as a<br/>
&gt; side benefit, you&#39;d also be better at extinguishing fire, and creating<br/>
&gt; water.  This makes for interesting and complex magical dynamics.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Glad to know i am not the only one who has been through it *the person<br/>
&gt; causing the stink was twinked to btw*  Anyway i have to say i dont sell<br/>
&gt; gifts either i pass them along to my needed guild members and with my wizard<br/>
&gt; i have never been so lucky but i started a paladin bout a week ago and<br/>
&gt; someone came up and ask me how they spoke with the shopkeep to sell, and i<br/>
&gt; told them *they had been away for a long while* as i turned to leave they<br/>
&gt; gave me all their armor and gold, i was floored when He started giving me<br/>
&gt; the armor i told Him there was no way i could give him anything in return<br/>
&gt; for the fact was i had nothing.  Just the other day i had a person come up<br/>
&gt; out of no where and give me a mino axe after asking me what weapon i was<br/>
&gt; using.  I have never been so lucky with one character :o)<br/>

&gt; play).  So, when I get those gator scale leggings, some druid newbie is<br/>
&gt; going to get a nice surprise.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other person in the room and the other party involved swears on them<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sitting on top of this item for some reason they have dropped in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; floor.  Now for the reasons this was in the floor i still dont<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understand.  Now this is me but if something is laying there its open<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the taking people drop unwanted stuff all the time.  I wont go<br/>
&gt; into<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all the deltails but there was a big todo about it and i was trying to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; talk my friend into giving it back and had them talked into it when<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other party in question and their friends started threating.  Ok now<br/>

&gt; &gt; Ok, so I&#39;ve never been twinked but I *have* gotten expensive gifts before.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Last weekend in Unrest I had a &#39;regular customer&#39; who was paying me *way*<br/>
&gt; too much for my SOWs and at one point he came up and dropped a FS Staff on<br/>
&gt; me. Granted, he was way overweight, but I was overwhelmed!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Then last night, he gave me 10plat as &#39;advance payment&#39;. I told him I<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t going to be around long  and asked if he wanted 8plat back (2 plat<br/>
&gt; per sow. see what I mean about overpayment?) Anyway, he just said &#39;No&#39; and<br/>
&gt; let me keep it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I tell ya know, if I have a line of customers, I know who&#39;s getting it<br/>
&gt; first and who has to wait for me to med.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Glad to know i am not the only one who has been through it *the person<br/>
&gt; causing the stink was twinked to btw*  Anyway i have to say i dont sell<br/>
&gt; gifts either i pass them along to my needed guild members and with my wizard<br/>
&gt; i have never been so lucky but i started a paladin bout a week ago and<br/>
&gt; someone came up and ask me how they spoke with the shopkeep to sell, and i<br/>
&gt; told them *they had been away for a long while* as i turned to leave they<br/>
&gt; gave me all their armor and gold, i was floored when He started giving me<br/>
&gt; the armor i told Him there was no way i could give him anything in return<br/>
&gt; for the fact was i had nothing.  Just the other day i had a person come up<br/>
&gt; out of no where and give me a mino axe after asking me what weapon i was<br/>
&gt; using.  I have never been so lucky with one character :o)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;ve had people who have yelled at me when I was trying to help them as<br/>
&gt; well.  I think their are a lot of reasons why this kind of thing happens:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Many people are instinctively untrusting of other players because they<br/>
&gt; expect them to kill steal, cheat, lie, and do anything they can to get more<br/>
&gt; XP/loot.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Many people don&#39;t feel that the social rules of normal society apply to<br/>
&gt; online society, especially when they are playing a character.  They feel<br/>
&gt; disassociated from social responsibility because it&#39;s all not real.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; All you can do in this situation is state factually &quot;I&#39;m trying to help<br/>
&gt; you, whether you believe it or not&quot;.  If they&#39;re still abusive, they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; really not worth helping! It sounds to me like your approach was quite<br/>
&gt; reasonable.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; My own recent abusive story was as follows.  I was fighting an aviak<br/>
&gt; avocet in south karana, and I had to leave the zone, so I shouted &#39;avocet to<br/>
&gt; lake rathe zone&#39;.  On the way out, the avocet got distracted and jumped on<br/>
&gt; two people fighting a rook.  I turned around, went into hand to hand combat<br/>
&gt; to get the avocet off of them (taking massive damage in the process).  I<br/>
&gt; then ran the avocet away, doubled back, and bolted their rook to death<br/>
&gt; because I knew, after the avocet was on them, they&#39;d probably be too weak to<br/>
&gt; finish this.  After the fact, they accused me of trying to train the avocet<br/>
&gt; onto them, and then trying to STEAL THEIR ROOK KILL (which I didn&#39;t).  What<br/>
&gt; really annoyed me was one of these people was someone I&#39;d had a pleasent<br/>
&gt; conversation or two with in the past.  Luckily, most people in that zone<br/>
&gt; know I&#39;m a nice person (probably because I have a general policy of helping<br/>
&gt; out anyone I see in hand to hand with an aviak, and I heal people who are<br/>
&gt; badly hurt while fighting!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ).  So, when they started yelling in OOC about what they thought I was<br/>
&gt; doing, people believed me when I explained what had really happened.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; On a last and completely unrelated note, I must admit with some<br/>
&gt; embarassment that I accepted an expensive gift from a higher level druid<br/>
&gt; last night.  He gave me mamoth leggings and...I just couldn&#39;t turn them<br/>
&gt; down.  One rule I have which makes something like that much easier to bare,<br/>
&gt; is that I will never sell any gift I&#39;m given.  Instead, I will try and give<br/>
&gt; it to some worthy newbie (by worthy I mean untwinked and capable of role<br/>
&gt; play).  So, when I get those gator scale leggings, some druid newbie is<br/>
&gt; going to get a nice surprise.<br/>

&gt; &gt; you dont have to put up with that crap...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If someone is talking to you insulting you or being vulgar, take a<br/>
&gt; &gt; screenshot in fullscreen and windowed mode of what they said.  Never hurts<br/>
&gt; &gt; to have proof when you petition... GMs will give you a email address you<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt; send the screenshots to so they can see them.  And if you dont know how to<br/>
&gt; &gt; take a screenshot... its the - key (minus key) on the number key pad.  It<br/>
&gt; &gt; will tell you whenever you take a shot.  it will save the pictuire in your<br/>
&gt; &gt; everquest folder and they will be called EQ000001.bmp... EQ000002.bmp....<br/>
&gt; &gt; etc.... if you are going to email them, be nice cuz they are 901k in<br/>
&gt; size...<br/>
&gt; &gt; zip them or change them to jpgs (zip is better, doesnt mess up the picture<br/>
&gt; &gt; any)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; i always have tons of sceenshots, of anything that happens... if someones<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;she was inturn desided she wanted to call me a bitch while all along i<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;am trying to get her her things back in which i did.  Now i will take<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;alot but that was something that was uncalled for me knowing if all of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;them had just kept their mouths shut i could have gotten the stuff back<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;with out any furth happenings other than what had gone on before i<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;logged on.  Has this happened to anyone else or is my server just full<br/>

&gt; &gt; actually, EQ spells are more complex then you make them look... yes a<br/>
&gt; spell<br/>
&gt; &gt; that said it uses evoc does use that skill, but there is also a hidden<br/>
&gt; skill<br/>
&gt; &gt; with each spell... the more you use one spell the better you get with it,<br/>
&gt; &gt; not just the skill type... which i kind of like<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Hey Lora!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I think many of us have played pen-and-paper RPGs.  I&#39;ve also played RPGs<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;since I was 11 (starting with the original Basic D&D).  I actually ran an<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;RPG zine for a while, and wrote a module for Dungeon magazine.  I&#39;ve also<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;reviewed TSR/GURPS material prior to publication (translation: I knew a<br/>
&gt; guy<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;who wrote for them, and I reviewed his manuscripts).  At one time I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;seriously considered becoming a full time RPG writer, but then I saw my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;friend who did it full time still lived with his parents, and I decided<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;be a computer programmer instead 8)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;My favorite pen and paper RPG is without a doubt Ars Magica.  I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;figure out why it hasn&#39;t become the most popular RPG ever actully.  The<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;thing I like the most about it is its magic system, which ... well I<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;go into the whole thing but it&#39;s super cool.  Wait, here is a link which<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;describes it, so you can read about it if you want.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://azathoth.gg.caltech.edu/troupe/ars/magic.html">http://azathoth.gg.caltech.edu/troupe/ars/magic.html</a><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;What I really like about this system is that it is a two dimensional<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;system.  In Everquest, for example, a spell is an &#39;Evocation&#39; spell (and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;you have an evocation skill).  In Ars Magica, if you wanted to throw<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;fireballs around you&#39;d have to train up &#39;Creo&#39; (create) and &#39;Ignem&#39;<br/>
&gt; (fire).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  But, as a side benefit, you&#39;d also be better at extinguishing fire, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;creating water.  This makes for interesting and complex magical dynamics.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
