<div id="ygrps-yiv-1109957623">You know, I&#39;m one of the few women too in groups.  Was looking at my <br/>
guild roster (I&#39;m still a dedicated, not full member yet) and there <br/>
are only three listed.  All of us are wives or girlfriends of the men <br/>
in the guild.  Hmmm... but it is fun though. Any Paladins on this <br/>
list?  I&#39;m always looking for Paladin advice.  What sort of weapons <br/>
are best... and should I practice 2H blunt?  My Cleric bf says no... <br/>
but he also admits he&#39;s a cleric and never played a fighter class.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
