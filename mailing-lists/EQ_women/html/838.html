<div><font face="Arial" size="2">You CAN do it that way, but since you have to buy 
the CDs for each account anyway, it is more a matter of personal 
preference.&nbsp; On our home network, we keep each unique CD and key with each 
computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; That way there&#39;s no guesswork as to who&#39;s got which 
key.&nbsp; Just my method; but I&#39;m dealing with kids, not roommates, so they&#39;re 
a bit more territorial about their PCs. ;-)</font></div>

  <p>Since you don&#39;t need the cd to run the game you can use one CD to load the 
  game onto all of your computers, and run EQ on as many computers as you have 
  at once. (Get up to 5 games of eq going at once in my house!) The problem is 
  that you cannot run the same account on more than 1 computer at a time, and 
  you have to reqister a differnet CD for every account. Example: When PoP came 
  out we had to buy 5 copies of the game because we have 5 accounts (me plus 4 
  roomates), but we only used one of the CD&#39;s to install the expansion onto the 
  computers. When it came time to register our expnasions we opened the rest of 
  the boxes and each grabbed a cd so that we would each have our own 
  registration code.</p>
