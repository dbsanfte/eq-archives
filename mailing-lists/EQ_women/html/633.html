<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555521061">Unfortunately the politics begin to occur when you get<br/>
into a guild. Especially at higher levels. In talking<br/>
with players across other servers it is server wide.<br/>
For example, the power struggles between &quot;uber&quot;<br/>
guilds, the planes and dragon rotations, also the egos<br/>
of many players once they hit the higher levels.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve gone back to my old server to visit and that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; nice, I always run<br/>
&gt; into some old friends who say hi and chat with me.<br/>
&gt; There are people I<br/>
&gt; still care about on that old server. But, it seems<br/>
&gt; like I have a barrier<br/>
&gt; that prevents me from playing there. I just know if<br/>
&gt; I play there that<br/>
&gt; server politics will rear its ugly head again.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So for now I will power level my little enchanter on<br/>
&gt; Tholuxe, and see what<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s like playing there. <br/>
