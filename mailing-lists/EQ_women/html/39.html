&lt;&lt; As for significant others I was quite amazed to read that some that are <br/>
married don&#39;t &quot;play&quot; that in EQ &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I really dont find it that amazing, but then I am one of the ones that dont <br/>
RP that relationship with my RL husband in game.  In game we RP brother and <br/>
sister.  The main reason that came about was (no lectures please ::chuckles) <br/>
we fought so much initially about the game.  He would die...and get upset <br/>
with me.  I would level past him...he would get upset with me.  Basically <br/>
what Im saying is that, though we love each other deeply, we are also <br/>
entirely too competitive with each other.  Another reason was, we have <br/>
complete opposite styles of RP (personality wise) and if i spend too long <br/>
with him in game i want to do something (like give him the biggest wedgie of <br/>
his life) to make him lighten up.  He can be a bit stuffy.  Needless to say, <br/>
it makes me want to pull my hair out.  So we determined a very long time ago <br/>
that our characters were not meant to be together in &quot;that&quot; way.<br/>
<br/>
It actually works very well for us.  And, from the brother and sister <br/>
standpoint, we actually work very well.  We can also climb in bed at night <br/>
without the danger of a &quot;game&quot; sending us off to sleep angry with each other. <br/>
 And we DO get together from time to time to help each other out.<br/>
