<br/>
If someone is talking to you insulting you or being vulgar, take a <br/>
screenshot in fullscreen and windowed mode of what they said.  Never hurts <br/>
to have proof when you petition... GMs will give you a email address you can <br/>
send the screenshots to so they can see them.  And if you dont know how to <br/>
take a screenshot... its the - key (minus key) on the number key pad.  It <br/>
will tell you whenever you take a shot.  it will save the pictuire in your <br/>
everquest folder and they will be called EQ000001.bmp... EQ000002.bmp.... <br/>
etc.... if you are going to email them, be nice cuz they are 901k in size... <br/>
zip them or change them to jpgs (zip is better, doesnt mess up the picture <br/>
any)<br/>
<br/>
i always have tons of sceenshots, of anything that happens... if someones <br/>
rude, mean, anything.... just in case i ever need it.<br/>

&gt;Hi everyone,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have a question for You all, i dont know if anyone else has<br/>
&gt;experianced this but well here goes.  I wont go in to which server and<br/>
&gt;what characters but on the server that i play on a friend of mine was<br/>
&gt;accused of stealing from another player, they say they didnt see the<br/>
&gt;other person in the room and the other party involved swears on them<br/>
&gt;sitting on top of this item for some reason they have dropped in the<br/>
&gt;floor.  Now for the reasons this was in the floor i still dont<br/>
&gt;understand.  Now this is me but if something is laying there its open<br/>
&gt;for the taking people drop unwanted stuff all the time.  I wont go into<br/>
&gt;all the deltails but there was a big todo about it and i was trying to<br/>
&gt;talk my friend into giving it back and had them talked into it when the<br/>
&gt;other party in question and their friends started threating.  Ok now<br/>
&gt;this makes me angery be cause they threaten them with having a GM friend<br/>
&gt;delete their character.  By this point i am angery one because i do what<br/>
&gt;ever i can to help people, so i let them know how stupid i though this<br/>
&gt;whole matter was to try to get someone deleted.... this lovely female if<br/>
&gt;she was inturn desided she wanted to call me a bitch while all along i<br/>
&gt;am trying to get her her things back in which i did.  Now i will take<br/>
&gt;alot but that was something that was uncalled for me knowing if all of<br/>
&gt;them had just kept their mouths shut i could have gotten the stuff back<br/>
&gt;with out any furth happenings other than what had gone on before i<br/>
&gt;logged on.  Has this happened to anyone else or is my server just full<br/>
&gt;of rude Arse people?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
