<div id="ygrps-yiv-882299231">I don&#39;t flirt because this is just a game to me, but for some reason,<br/>
when other characters find out that I am really a woman, they want to<br/>
know more about me (i.e. where I am from, how old I am, do I have a<br/>
boyfriend, can I be their girlfriend, etc.).  I get this often too. I<br/>
usually just tell them that my boyfriend plays the game and I already<br/>
have a partner (even though he quit playing) because it&#39;s easier than<br/>
dealing with all these personal questions from strangers.  My boyfriend<br/>
tells me that it&#39;s because they think it&#39;s great to meet an actual woman<br/>
gamer.  Isn&#39;t this interesting?<br/>
