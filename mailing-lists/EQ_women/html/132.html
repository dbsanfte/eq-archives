&gt;I&#39;ve disabled attachments on the mailing list.  Sorry that I didn&#39;t know to <br/>
&gt;do so before!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is ok. No harm done. I&#39;ve run mailing lists for the past 5 years, and not<br/>
allowing attachments saves alot of aggravation on the part of the list<br/>
owner; and it&#39;s not just viruses that become a problem. I have never run a<br/>
mailing list off a service such as onelist before, but I don&#39;t believe<br/>
onelist had this option until the last few months with this Happy99 virus<br/>
and then with the Melissa virus. <br/>
<br/>
I know some people on the EQ lists like to share screenshots from the game,<br/>
but the best way to do that is display it on a website and send out the<br/>
address, or tell the list you have one and then send it through private<br/>
email to those that ask for it. <br/>
<br/>
The best rule is what I&#39;ve read from others already, never open<br/>
attachments. If you get something that you requested, you still need to<br/>
virus check it before opening it. <br/>
