Just wondering if it&#39;s the same group.<br/>

for being a tanking druid.  I remember my Shaman friends being able to do <br/>
crowd control when there was no enchanter.  Tanking all the time.  Apparently <br/>
the only time Shaman really is boring and kinda sucks is when you&#39;re doing <br/>
buffing circles and they have to spend hours and hours buffing people.  <br/>
Plus, they get alchemy which sounds REALLy fun!<br/>
<br/>
I hope you have fun with your shaman!<br/>
