<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936602832">Hello Everyone.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Tbaald, only a level 3 Half-Elf Ranger on the Prexus Server. Ever need<br/>
a Tracker, give me a tell. Right now that&#39;s about all I can offer a group.<br/>
:) I&#39;m trying to make my way back to High Hold Pass to retrieve my corpse.<br/>
( I believe I have a week of real time while I&#39;m below Level 5 or 6. ) The<br/>
group I was with got separated from me while zoning and I subsequently had<br/>
no protectors when a Lion decided to take me out. I also had no one to loot<br/>
my corpse for me and bring back my stuff. <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to getting to know everyone here, and in the game.<br/>
<br/>
Tbaald</div>
