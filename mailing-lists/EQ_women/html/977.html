<div id="ygrps-yiv-437812477">Way higher?  Level?  Heck, the only other people I know who play are my<br/>
kids and their friends and they aren&#39;t real people yet!  Maybe in a few<br/>
years.<br/>
<br/>
Ph.D. in breast-feeding.  MS in pregnancy.  Be a shame to let all the XP go<br/>
to waste!  I have two bachelors and still haven&#39;t got a full-time job yet.<br/>
Working on getting teaching certification in secondary biology or English.<br/>
Also doing a masters in Special Ed.<br/>

____&gt;Salutations &quot;Dr. Mom&quot;!<br/>
____&gt;<br/>
____&gt;OK are you a doctor like an MD or a PhD. College was<br/>
____&gt;something I had trouble with as well. OK, I did get a<br/>
____&gt;bachlors but I changed majors four or five times and<br/>
____&gt;it took forever. Then I worked on my masters but I<br/>
____&gt;kind of bounced back and fourth on that and never<br/>
____&gt;finished it. I did end up with enough credit for a PhD<br/>
____&gt;though plus some if I had ever stayed on one thing<br/>
____&gt;long enough.<br/>
