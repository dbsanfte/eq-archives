<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508031332">My betrothed and I were discussing this last night, and he brought up a good<br/>
point... you can always turn off /shout and /ooc.  You see, we really want to get<br/>
married in the Faydark, because that&#39;s where it all started (we&#39;re wood elf<br/>
rangers).  I just didn&#39;t like the idea because a)  people could always wander by<br/>
and interrupt things and b) there is SO much talking traffic going on.  If,<br/>
however, you find a spot where there isn&#39;t anything to kill for as far as the eye<br/>
can see, you should be relatively safe. ;)  So, we&#39;re thinking about one of the<br/>
highest, most secluded platforms in Kelethin.  Against the background of the sky,<br/>
we should be able to get some lovely screen shots.<br/>
<br/>
Tina, how did that catering thing go? What kinda goodies did you have?<br/>

&gt; Thank you, Suzanne.  I have actually decided to postpone the nuptuals for a<br/>
&gt; bit longer so that I may prep better.  I think I have decided on the Arena.<br/>
&gt; That way everyone can attend with little or no extra ooc talk.  O how I would<br/>
&gt; love to be able to wear a wedding dress *sigh* maybe someday they will<br/>
&gt; include that in the game and then I will have to renew my vows.<br/>
