<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127231011"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;     I recently tossed around the idea of making a<br/>
&gt; new character, exactly like my<br/>
&gt; primary but with my &quot;true&quot; elven name (Sara just<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t sound very wood<br/>
&gt; elvish).  A friend offered to hold my stuff and give<br/>
&gt; it to my new character.<br/>
&gt; Now, I have full banded, a combine, an ash bow, the<br/>
&gt; works.  My dilemma is<br/>
&gt; this--I don&#39;t believe in power gaming or twinking. <br/>
&gt; Granted, it&#39;s the same exact<br/>
&gt; character, stats and all, just a different<br/>
&gt; name......the stuff I have would just<br/>
&gt; help me get to my current experience level quicker;<br/>
&gt; at which point I would<br/>
&gt; delete my current primary.  So, to twink, or not to<br/>
&gt; twink?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sara, Povar<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I say Twink....make up a story to go with it...my twin sister died to<br/>
give these to me....I was given these by my mother who was<br/>
dying....Whatever you think would justify a level 1 to have banded...<br/>
Another thought is to work the new chacter up to 3-4 and then twink...<br/>
