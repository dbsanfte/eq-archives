<div id="ygrps-yiv-1671511639">Well, I thought about OOT, since Kelethin, the place I really wanted to hold it, is<br/>
like, spam city... but unlike Luna, who IS a Sister of Erolissi *grins*, I don&#39;t really<br/>
have an RP reason.  I found a really pretty glade in Lesser Faydark, but again there&#39;s<br/>
some ooc and shout traffic.  The Arena in Lake Rathe is a really good spot!  I think<br/>
you&#39;ll have a beautiful wedding, Wendy.<br/>
<br/>
You see, we&#39;ve been betrothed since June.  We had certain things we wanted to<br/>
accomplish, and we&#39;re almost there, but it&#39;s been a long wait.  So I want everything to<br/>
be beautiful and perfect and all that good stuff. =)  When I was playing UO, it was<br/>
different... you could have a wedding dress, and bridesmaid&#39;s colors, and colored armor<br/>
for the guys, and we even had a red carpet in our castle, hehe.  Flowers and food and<br/>
wine set out and alla that good stuff.  I don&#39;t know how to make it special here.<br/>

&gt; The wedding was awesome! We had a wonderful ceremony by Imaryn the head<br/>
&gt; guide of the server.  After the ceremony we had a celebration with<br/>
&gt; friends.  I hired a caterer who served us some exotic treats, and the wine<br/>
&gt; flowed freely.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think the big ingredient in a fun wedding is having the ceremony<br/>
&gt; performed by someone who is friendly and can do it well, and a bunch of<br/>
&gt; alcohol and food.  Not too deep but that&#39;s it ;) Location is the most<br/>
&gt; important thing to think of.  I chose ocean of tears so we wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; spammed by lots of OOC talk (and the sisters isle was just so perfect for<br/>
&gt; Luna).<br/>
