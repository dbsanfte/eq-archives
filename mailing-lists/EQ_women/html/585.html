<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Do yourselves a favor - get two accounts.&nbsp; I&#39;m 
serious.&nbsp; I had an EQ friend who got divorced and lost his EQ account in 
the settlement.&nbsp; I know it SOUNDS funny (well, it does) but it 
wasn&#39;t.&nbsp; </font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">You&#39;re a druid - you don&#39;t need groups!&nbsp; One 
word - KITE!&nbsp; Not that it isn&#39;t more fun to have groups but the advantage 
of being a druid is you can teleport to all over Norrath and get your name out 
there, and while waiting for a group you can solo.&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">And when you get really good you can start playing 
with multiple kiting.&nbsp; You have to get the mobs lined up for the snares 
which is hard, but then you just use your AoE and you take down 2 to 4 yellows 
at once.&nbsp; </font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Druids are easy to level ;-)&nbsp; That&#39;s why there 
are so damn many of us at 54+.</font></div>
