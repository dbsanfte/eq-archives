<div id="ygrps-yiv-815741829"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="1">Well, I am a 44th Dark Elf Shadowknight on Brell Serilis. &nbsp;I am one of 
<br>Violent Harvest&#39;s three leaders. &nbsp;In fact, all three of us are RL females. &nbsp;
<br>My character is male, but that is only because I really enjoy playing men. &nbsp;
<br>Don&#39;t know why, I just have more fun being an aggressive male figure, 
<br>particularly an evil one like Khasirath.
<br>
<br>I never saw the EQ Women Site, but would be interested in the URL if someone 
<br>has it...
<br>
<br>So if any of your are on Brell, or stop by, send me a tell! I&#39;m hunting 
<br>mostly in Velious right now, but will probably develop wanderlust soon.
<br>
<br>Shadows guard thee,
<br>
<br>Khasirath S`Therik
<br>Knight of Innoruuk&#39;s Will
<br>Thresher of the Violent Harvest
