<div id="ygrps-yiv-1855228718">Salutations!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Happy New Year to all &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
To you too. Sorry about my late response.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I&#39;m new to EQ women and love the fact that<br/>
something like this is out there. Soooo tired of<br/>
trying to talk EQ talk with guys. Even in the game<br/>
they speak a different language. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t they though. That&#39;s part of what I love about my<br/>
guild though. There are a few women in it who play a<br/>
lot and we&#39;ve all adopted each other as sisters. Were<br/>
a wild and crazy bunch but we have a blast. I&#39;m pretty<br/>
new to EQ as well since I&#39;ve only been on about 3 - 4<br/>
months but I&#39;m additcted for sure and get on most<br/>
nights for at least a little while.<br/>
:o)<br/>
Feel free to chat here. I love to talk so I&#39;ll be glad<br/>
to chat with you.<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; My name is Sue, I am 43 mother of 3<br/>
(grown&amp;gone) kids and have been a gameaholic for<br/>
the better part of 25 years. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My name is Brangvyne . . . just like my characters<br/>
name. It&#39;s one nice thing about having a wierd name<br/>
like me, you can use it for things like this.<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I have a lvl 38 Shaman Vah Shir - Nofreesowforu, a<br/>
lvl 6 Human Warrior - Diixii, and a lvl 9 Cleric -<br/>
Pletora. All on the Berrel Server. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
All I have is my wood elf lvl 33 ranger on Xegony and<br/>
a 2nd lvl Bard on Chazic Thule (sp)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Oh and like all of us I have a &quot;mule&quot; in the<br/>
Bazaar. Send me a tell and let the killing begin &#39;)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a mule in the bazaar. Can&#39;t keep one up<br/>
with my dial up. Maybe someday.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>
Bran<br/>
