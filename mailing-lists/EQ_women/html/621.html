  <div><tt>That theory falls in line with a lot of stereotyping. Why would you 
  afford a<br>female character more advantage than a male? Personally, I don&#39;t 
  care WHAT<br>sex the character is, it&#39;s whether or not they can play the 
  game.</tt></div><tt></tt></blockquote>

  <div><tt><font face="Arial">Actually, the &quot;advantage&quot; theory comes from other 
  men noticing that their peers will give stuff to and help female types more 
  readily than they will other male types.&nbsp; And this is something I&#39;ve seen 
  time and time again, to be quite frank.&nbsp; My partner (in and out of games) 
  grumbles about it alot; I always got offered stuff and if I asked for help, 
  I&#39;m more likely to receive it if the other person thinks I&#39;m female.&nbsp; I 
  used to believe that alot of that has to do with personality--I&#39;m very 
  friendly--but my guy friends don&#39;t think so. &lt;wry grin&gt;&nbsp; SO, this 
  doesn&#39;t have anything to do with what *we* think! 
  &lt;laughing&gt;&nbsp;</font></tt></div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font><br><br>Another thing, people always 
  assume that you are male. Whenever I&#39;m in wolf<br>form, people always say &quot;Ask 
  Soril, he&#39;s got food.&quot; Or &quot;I&#39;m waiting for him<br>to get back&quot;...I always 
  laugh. My name to me, doesn&#39;t even SEEM male.</div>

 face="Arial" size="2">Well, I had played Asheron&#39;s Call briefly, before school 
  started back up for me, and I played a female character that was very taciturn 
  and didn&#39;t speak much (although she wasn&#39;t rude or anything; just a quiet 
  type).&nbsp; I had people refer to me as a &quot;he&quot; and &quot;him&quot;, even though my 
  graphic was a female!&nbsp; It&#39;s funny.&nbsp; When Horizons is finally 
  released (and Neverwinter Nights too), I plan to have at least one male 
  character and see how people respond to him.&nbsp; I played one in D&amp;D way 
  back when, and it&#39;s just not the same when everyone can see you&#39;re a 
  girl.&nbsp; I thought I did a very credible job with Dirk, too.&nbsp; Like I 
  said, we&#39;ll see!</font><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font><br><br>Regardless, I could care less, I 
  just want to play with people who can play<br>the game.<br><br>Soril<br></div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">You said it!&nbsp; I still keep in touch with 
  some of the people I met in EQ and of course, I lurk around in here as well. 
  &lt;grins at Christina&gt;&nbsp; I&#39;ve been playing D&amp;D lately and have 
  rediscovered the fun I had when I was a kid and a teenager, and I tell all the 
  ex-UO and EQ people I know to check it out again.&nbsp; My partner is chomping 
  at the bit, waiting for the next MMORPG, but between school and our weekly 
  gaming group, I am content to sit back in my corner by the fire and listen to 
  the rest of the room share their tales.</font></div><font face="Arial"
