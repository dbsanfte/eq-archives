<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-465462736">OOOH I wish I could have been there.  Since Dnaisha is no longer<br/>
Innoruuk&#39;s pawn (grins broadly) having fallen in love with a Wood Elf<br/>
I&#39;ve been trying not to level her, though.  The WE is 4 levels behind<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, I did want to mention that the Brell board on www.eqvault.com is<br/>
VERY active if you are into roleplaying.  All the stories are there.<br/>
Hopefully last nights ambush in the Arena where my love and I were taken<br/>
down by the Blade for my &quot;heresy&quot; will be written up.  I stupidly forgot<br/>
to bind myself and spent most of the time after I died waiting for<br/>
resurrection so I wouldn&#39;t have to travel from Cazic Thule.<br/>
<br/>
So, for any of you really into roleplay and stories, this is a great<br/>
board to visit.  We do some fabulous roleplay and some not so fabulous<br/>
(those DE men just start fighting at the drop of a hat when words could<br/>
be SO much more effective &lt;grins darkly&gt;).<br/>

&gt; About 40 level 46-50 people were involved.<br/>
