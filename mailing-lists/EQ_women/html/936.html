<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985888172">Her older sister (38) was fired from her previous job after obtaining <br/>
cash advances on her company credit card to play video slot machines  <br/>
(she lost over $5K).  Her younger sister (31) is - my guess - about <br/>
250 lb. and frequently travels for sexual flings with men she meets <br/>
online.  They both have (as does my wife) several 60+ level EQ <br/>
characters.  Neither have ever been married; both still live with <br/>
their mother and stepfather.  Their biological father was arrested a <br/>
couple of years ago (charges later dropped) for sexually abusing his <br/>
teenage stepdaughter.<br/>

&gt; I also am glad that you didn&#39;t leave her and you guys worked<br/>
&gt; through it.  One of my degrees is in psychology and I spend a fair<br/>
&gt; amount of online time telling men and women what their priorities<br/>
&gt; should be.  I have helped many people.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Interesting that her sisters are also addicts.  Must be a<br/>
&gt; personality weakness.  I wonder what %age of EQ players now are<br/>
&gt; female?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Grats on your masters!  (Are you sure running isn&#39;t addictive?)<br/>
