<b>Subject:</b> Ring of Fire in Acrylia <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-851123412">I thought I&#39;d just briefly share my experiences with a cool new Luclin<br/>
encounter called Ring of Fire.<br/>
<br/>
Essentially you go into Acrylia, which is this cavern filled with<br/>
grimlings (tiny cave people). You step into the sacred ring of fire and<br/>
guardians spawn. As long as you have a person standing in the ring of<br/>
fire, guardians will spawn fairly regularly.<br/>
<br/>
After a while eventually a boss spawns, who when you kill, he drops some<br/>
cool loot.<br/>
<br/>
If you stay in the ring of fire more powerful bosses will eventually<br/>
spawn.<br/>
<br/>
After about two hours a boss spawns that takes about 24 level 60s to <br/>
kill. He drops some really neato stuff, including a 50 ac chain <br/>
breastplate, and a flowing thought 3 ranged item, and an all/all<br/>
flowing thought 3 mask with 100 hp/mana and a bunch of stats and 7 resist<br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
The next boss is even tough, requiring about 40 people to kill. He drops<br/>
the same loot as the previous boss.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve never managed to make it to the next boss, we may try tonight.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway it&#39;s pretty fun, and it&#39;s a neat idea, I suspect there are things<br/>
like this all throughout Luclin :)<br/>
