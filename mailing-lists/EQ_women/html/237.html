<div id="ygrps-yiv-1350318106">Hey, all!  I am 24, and live in Houston, Texas.  I play Ilieriena, a 9th level <br/>
Erudite wizard on Fennin Ro.  I have also been putting a lot of effort into <br/>
organizing a roleplaying-intesive guild on Fennin Ro, and I am sending off the <br/>
petition to become official today, so I am pretty excited about that.  Anyway, <br/>
looking forward to meeting you all and chatting!<br/>
<br/>
