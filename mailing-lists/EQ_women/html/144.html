<div id="ygrps-yiv-925573101">I got the nicest compliment last night.  One of my clerics told me,<br/>
&quot;Boy, I have MISSED having you tank for me.&quot;  That makes it all<br/>
worthwhile, doesn&#39;t it?<br/>

&gt;                  I play a 31 wood elf warrior on the karana server.I<br/>
&gt; feel it is alot of fun being the center of attention...I stand and get<br/>
&gt; hit all the time and slash away at the badies while others heal me.<br/>
&gt; Getting buffs from the casters in the group really makes things<br/>
&gt; nice.Since I am the one protecting everybody i put my self in the<br/>
&gt; position and state of mind that .I am a mother protecting my<br/>
&gt; children.And it really gives me a nice feeling inside.Being a warrior<br/>
&gt; has been very satisfying for me.It is always nice to do things you<br/>
&gt; couldnt otherwise do in real life..I have always fantasized about<br/>
&gt; being a warrior in those dark days.And herein eq i can do just that.<br/>
