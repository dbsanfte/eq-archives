&gt;I would just like to tell everyone out there who is a Cleric that they<br/>
&gt;just might like to try out a shaman. I spent 18 levels being a Cleric<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I *love* being a shaman! But it&#39;s made me so *spoiled!* I don&#39;t think I could play a class without SOW anymore! I love being able to heal my group, yet get in there and fight it out by their side. I enjoy buffing my friends and debuffing the bad guys, and then there&#39;s always panic-burn. A Shaman can do *anything!*<br/>
<br/>
Though I&#39;ve been grouping with these two *wonderful* little wood elves lately and they make me feel uncomfortably tall....<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and 5 being a Shaman so far. I was always frustrated with my<br/>
&gt;limitations as a Cleric and took on way too much responsibility for<br/>
&gt;other people&#39;s lives, which made grouping a very un-fun experience. I<br/>
&gt;love being a Shaman so far. ( I&#39;ve made 2 new characters in Quellios.<br/>
&gt;Bloodless and Blacksatin) Go ahead and laugh at the names, it&#39;s the<br/>
&gt;best I can do on such short notice! I agonized believe me. Someone even<br/>
&gt;called me &quot;campy&quot;!- whatever that means. I&#39;m only 25, that term&#39;s<br/>
&gt;before my time. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a definition of campy, but, as a friend of mine put it &quot;I know camp when I see it.&quot; So some good examples of campy are Xena: Warrior Princess and The Mummy. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have noticed that a lot of us have said that we play clerics, it<br/>
&gt;seems more than any other class. (Or maybe I only notice the clerics<br/>
&gt;because I play one.)I hope this doesn&#39;t offend you all, but I wonder if<br/>
&gt;we have chosen to play one because we are by nature nurturing and<br/>
&gt;helpfull, or because we have been raised in our society to act servile<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think being a healer is servile.. on the contrary, I feel a small surge of power when I keep someone from dying! I think &quot;If it wasn&#39;t for me, that person would have a long run for his corpse.&quot;<br/>
