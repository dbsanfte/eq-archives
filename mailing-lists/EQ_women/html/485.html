&gt; The online store was shut down because basicly the company Verant<br/>

&gt; Whether you purchase RoK through the online store, or from a store, you<br/>
&gt; get the same CD and the same kind of account key.  The only difference is<br/>
&gt; that the retail version has a box and a manual, while the upgrade version<br/>
&gt; has just the CD (and maybe the cloth map?).<br/>
