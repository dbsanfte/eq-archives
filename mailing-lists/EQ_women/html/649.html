<div id="ygrps-yiv-27696997">In the previous thread, noone addressed the question of whether they <br/>
planned to play any of the upcoming online games. I don&#39;t know too <br/>
much about them, but there seem to be some interesting ones, like <br/>
Neverwinter Nights, which will not be massively multiplayer, but <br/>
allow you to adventure with a few friends like AD&D, or  Shadowbane <br/>
(sounds to PK-friendly to me) and Dark Age of Camelot. I know there <br/>
are others, including futuristic ones. And then, of course, there is <br/>
EQ2.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know anything about them? Anyone in the betas?<br/>
