&gt;<br/>
&gt; As some of you may recall, I&#39;m the moderator of this mailing list.  I<br/>
&gt; created it because I noticed that Everquest was a boy-dominated game and I<br/>
&gt; thought it would be cool to create a list for women who play Everquest to<br/>
&gt; chat with eachother.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But, this list is pretty quiet, though we do have 75 members.  So, my<br/>
&gt; question is, how can this list better serve the needs of its members?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would like to hear everyone&#39;s ideas.  What would you like to see on this<br/>
&gt; list? How can this list better serve your needs?<br/>

I can only speak for myself, but as a newbie, there are lots of things I would<br/>
like to see on this list.<br/>
First of all, what server everyone plays on and why?<br/>
What is the best class and race everyone has ever played?<br/>
Are you in a guild, which one, and any other guild info?<br/>
Stories about great RP adventures and worst mistakes.<br/>
General chatting and fun.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I will start with my basic info.<br/>
I play on the Torvonnilous server, mostly because it has the fewest players<br/>
usually.<br/>
My current fav character is a lvl 5 Druid Woodelf named Linenu.<br/>
I usually play the &#39;good&#39; characters vs. the &#39;evil&#39; but i can see where they<br/>
would be fun.<br/>
I have never tried the PvP servers, and probably won&#39;t.<br/>
I am not in a guild but would like to be someday.<br/>
Latest fun-last night I played for over 6 hours on and around Orc hill with 3<br/>
other char.  Kicked some major Orc booty!  and had fun talking and flirting<br/>
with the guys in my group. (I was the only woman!)<br/>
Biggest mistake (so far!)-not putting all my ability points into Wisdom for my<br/>
Druid when I started this character.<br/>
In Real Life, I am a Kindergarten teacher in her late 30&#39;s.  My 15 year old<br/>
son is the one who started this game and then got me hooked.  Since I am out<br/>
of school for the summer, I have lots of time to play.  I don&#39;t know what I<br/>
will do in August when I go back to work!!  I wonder if I can play EQ during<br/>
recess and lunch???!!!  lol<br/>
I hope to hear from others on this list.<br/>
