<div id="ygrps-yiv-142002988">I am 27 and I have an on-line &quot;love&quot; in the game too.  We are both<br/>
firmly aware of the person behind the character.  He is a man with 2<br/>
kids and a wife.  I am a woman with a husband.  We are just<br/>
role-playing our characters.  <br/>
Sometimes I still feel a bit &quot;wrong&quot; about our flirtation, but really,<br/>
I know there is nothing to it and we live in totally different<br/>
countries (he is from Canada).  So.  I really don&#39;t know if I have<br/>
helped or not.  I say make sure you and he are both aware of the real<br/>
person behind the pixels on the screen.<br/>

&gt; As my character is marrying on Sunday I must confess<br/>
&gt; to a few minor qualms.  In<br/>
&gt; particular, er, how does one roleplay a honeymoon<br/>
&gt; *smile*.  Unlike many who<br/>
&gt; develop relationships in Norrath, my beloved and I<br/>
&gt; are unknown to one another in<br/>
&gt; RL.  For all I know he weighs 300 pounds, guzzles<br/>
&gt; beer, and is hygenically<br/>
&gt; challenged *smile*<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are times if I wonder if this is a positive<br/>
&gt; thing to be doing.  I mean,<br/>
&gt; what if he is some starry eyed adolescent and I ruin<br/>
&gt; him for life *grin*.  I know<br/>
&gt; MY lines are clearly drawn in fuzz (okay, I think I<br/>
&gt; know the difference between<br/>
&gt; reality and fantasy though I swear I saw a Pixie<br/>
&gt; Trickster in the airport the<br/>
&gt; other day *grin*).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, this is all fun and games and I am having<br/>
&gt; fun.  But there is this part in<br/>
&gt; the back of my mind that wonders.  Because unlike<br/>
&gt; reading romance novels (blech -<br/>
&gt; persish the thought) there is another person<br/>
&gt; involved in my little fantasy and I<br/>
&gt; must never forget that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any other hard core role players out there struggle<br/>
&gt; with these ridiculous<br/>
&gt; issues?  Any other players over the age of 25, for<br/>
&gt; that matter *smile*<br/>
