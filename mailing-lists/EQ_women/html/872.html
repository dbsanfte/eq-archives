<div id="ygrps-yiv-1643275868">The Annual Stella Awards<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;Stella&#39;s&quot; are named after 81-year-old Stella Liebeck who spilled<br/>
coffee on herself and successfully sued McDonald&#39;s because there was <br/>
no warning on the cup advising that the contents may be hot. That <br/>
case inspired the Stella Awards for the most frivolous successful <br/>
lawsuits in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
The following are this year&#39;s candidates: <br/>
<br/>
1. Kathleen Robertson of Austin, Texas, was awarded $780,000 by a <br/>
jury of her peers after breaking her ankle tripping over a toddler <br/>
who was running inside a furniture store. The owners of the store <br/>
were understandably surprised at the verdict, considering the <br/>
misbehaving little toddler was<br/>
<br/>
Kathleen Robertson&#39;s son.<br/>
<br/>
2. A 19-year-old, Carl Truman of Los Angeles, won $74,000 and medical<br/>
expenses when his neighbor ran over his hand with a Honda Accord. Mr.<br/>
Truman apparently didn&#39;t notice there was someone at the wheel of <br/>
the car when he was trying to steal his neighbor&#39;s hub caps.<br/>
<br/>
3. Terrence Dickinson of Bristol, Pennsylvania, was leaving a house <br/>
he had just finished robbing by way of the garage. He was not able <br/>
to get the garage door to go up since the automatic door opener was <br/>
malfunctioning. He couldn&#39;t reenter the house because the door <br/>
connecting the house and garage locked when he pulled it shut. The <br/>
family was on vacation, and Mr. Dickinson found himself locked in <br/>
the garage for eight days. He subsisted on a case of Pepsi he found, <br/>
and a large bag of dry dog food. He sued the homeowner&#39;s insurance <br/>
claiming the situation caused him undue mental anguish. The jury <br/>
agreed: to the tune of $500,000.<br/>
<br/>
4. Jerry Williams of Little Rock, Arkansas, was awarded $14,500 and <br/>
medical expenses after being bitten on the buttocks by his next door <br/>
neighbor&#39;s beagle. The beagle was on a chain in its owner&#39;s fenced <br/>
yard. The award was less than sought because the jury felt the dog <br/>
might have been just a<br/>
little provoked at the time by Mr. Williams who was shooting it <br/>
repeatedly with a pellet gun.<br/>
<br/>
5. A Philadelphia restaurant was ordered to pay Amber Carson of <br/>
Lancaster, Pennsylvania, $113,500 after she slipped on a soft drink <br/>
and broke her coccyx. The beverage was on the floor because Ms. <br/>
Carson had thrown it at her boyfriend 30 seconds earlier during an <br/>
argument.<br/>
<br/>
6. Kara Walton of Claymont, Delaware, successfully sued the owner of <br/>
a night club in a neighboring city when she fell from the bathroom <br/>
window to the floor and knocked out her two front teeth. This <br/>
occurred while Ms. Walton was trying to sneak through the window in <br/>
the ladies room to avoid paying the $3.50 cover charge. She was <br/>
awarded $12,000 and dental expenses.<br/>
<br/>
7. This year&#39;s favorite could easily be Mr. Merv Grazinski of <br/>
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Mr. Grazinski purchased a brand new 32-foot <br/>
Winnebago motor home. On his first trip home, having driven onto the <br/>
freeway, he set the cruise control at 70 mph and calmly left the <br/>
drivers seat to go into the back and make himself a cup of coffee. <br/>
Not surprisingly, the RV left the freeway, crashed and overturned. <br/>
Mr. Grazinski sued Winnebago for not advising him in the owner&#39;s <br/>
manual that he couldn&#39;t actually do this. The jury awarded him <br/>
$1,750,000 plus a new motor home. The company actually changed their<br/>
manuals on the basis of this suit, just in case there were any other <br/>
complete morons buying their recreation vehicles<br/>
