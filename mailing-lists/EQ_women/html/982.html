<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965963463"><div>I enjoy doing trade skills very rarely.&nbsp; I will however get in these moods where I will want to do them.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been working on my cleric&#39;s faction to start her shawls.&nbsp; She was ally with giants for a long time while my guild was hunting in Ntov (kael armor).&nbsp; Two ring wars later and a bunch of dead giants I think I am ready to begin serious trade skilling for that shawl.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>

<div>Baking has always been my favourite of all the trades.&nbsp; Its fairly easy, a lot of the components for&nbsp;the great stat food come from some wonderful exp spots, and the food you can make is very beneficial!&nbsp; I haven&#39;t tried smithing but <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eqtraders.com">www.eqtraders.com</a> may be a spot to look if you haven&#39;t heard of that website!</div>

As someone who recently hit 62<br>myself we seem to be taking the same road. Last night<br>I took my 21% into 62 and my 65 ranger hubby and went<br>to HoH. Why HoH instead of BoT. Well simple. He can<br>solo there bow kiting the mobs till they die. It&#39;s a<br>bit slow but I keep him healed and toss in a few 1100<br>point nukes to speed the process and its not bad at<br>all. The two of us were killing mobs with between 30K<br>and 75K hp. So my recipie now is BoT if I can get a<br>good group, HoH if I&#39;m duoing, and trade skills etc.<br>when I&#39;m alone. Working out pretty
 good.<br><br>Finished my fourth coldain shawl yesterday, but I need<br>to get my tailoring up some more before I try that 5th<br>one. Only 101, and although I know it trivs at 115 I<br>think I&#39;m going to triv Wu&#39;s armor at 158 before I<br>make the attempt. After all it will need to be higher<br>later anyway, so might as well get it on up now.<br><br>Do we have any others who like to do that trade stuff<br>on the list. I do it a lot when it&#39;s slow. Just work<br>on this or that to pass the time. I like the easy<br>recipies though even if they cost me more. After all<br>it&#39;s not hard to make a few thousand plat if I really<br>need to. And along that line, does anyone know a<br>simple smithing recipie to use from 88. I just made<br>shields till 88. It was easy and all the parts could<br>be gotten in one convient spot. Now I&#39;m looking for<br>something simple. But baking is the easiest to raise<br>if you&#39;re bored and don&#39;t mind sitting around for a<br>while. Fish cakes to 135 (a hearty
 meal), I caught the<br>fish and bought the bat wings. Storm salmon to 202<br>(stat food) but I&#39;m forgetting what I have to put with<br>it. That&#39;s a lot of fish I&#39;ll tell you though. Again<br>you just have to have the patience for the fishing in<br>PoS. Anyway just my cooking tip of the day.<br>:oP<br><br>/Hugs<br>Bran<br><br>--- &quot;Dr. Mom&quot; &lt;drmom5@...&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; I am considering foster parenting.&nbsp; But the local<br>&gt; agency never calls me<br>&gt; back.&nbsp; Hmmm.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Time management, secret shopping has taught me<br>&gt; organizational skills!&nbsp; But<br>&gt; online forms don&#39;t let you mess up.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Ding 62 this afternoon.&nbsp; Now I put it all in AA and<br>&gt; go to BoT tomorrow AM.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; ____&gt;situation.
