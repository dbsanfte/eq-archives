 </span></blockquote>Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I have been on this list for a very long time.. but not ever actually <br/>
posted.. mainly because I gave up playing eq for about 2 years or maybe <br/>
more... Just recently I tried it again though .. and wow!!! its nice <br/>
again!!! I gave up at lvl 54, somewhere along the line the game had changed <br/>
for me and I had lost the feeling I first had on being chased by a giant to <br/>
the bridge in the karanas.. I had started a few months after the game first <br/>
came out.. when they still announced when people made 50 and there were no <br/>
expansion packs. I had gained a new husband through the game and we had <br/>
decided we wanted to move on to other games (but no they were never as fun. <br/>
I tred daoc, Anarchy on line and went back to first person shooters.. but <br/>
nothing grabbed me..) Then I had a go on eqemu.. noticed verant were <br/>
offering me a free week on real eq . and .. went on line on my old server <br/>
Innouruuk again.. well that seemed much the same, and my characters were <br/>
all still there and that wouldnt have caught my attention. but then I <br/>
noticed there were some new Euro serevers so I tried the new server and <br/>
made a cat person.. (ooh . I had bought the luclin expansion and never <br/>
bothered to install it before..) and before you can say boo I loved it <br/>
again. and.. so many changes for the better!!!!! I became a froglock and <br/>
all my family have joined in .. the server is near empty and all the people <br/>
friendly . no loud arguments in ooc ..  we didn&#39;t have the awful horror of <br/>
corpse searching at low lvls so we have been runing around exploring and we <br/>
can easlily move from one newbie zone to another via pok.. Its great!!!! <br/>
Loads of new places to explore. and much much easier to play .. and the <br/>
atmosphere seems to have changed back to how it was.. with much <br/>
friendliness and many people willing to buff a small frog who croaks a <br/>
lot.. I don&#39;t know if the game has been destroyed for high end play as I <br/>
have no intention at this time of playing my enchanter and having to play <br/>
for hours on end and join in massive raids that keep me up all night.. nor <br/>
do I wish to hear endlessly about server politics and the best way to share <br/>
spawns and zones.. What I do want is what I have found, a family orientated <br/>
game (my partner, myself and my kids of 14 and 11 play as a group) where <br/>
all of us can lvl up together and explore zones, get the occasional heart <br/>
stopping scare as we walk through some dangerous cavern with beasts in it <br/>
we haven&#39;t seen before, chat in friendly way with people we meet and.. <br/>
relax.. Verant appear to have made the low lvl game much much easier but at <br/>
the same time have enough areas where you haven&#39;t been before to make <br/>
exploring scary and fun. Mind you I would love a horse but that seems to be <br/>
something I would have to work to hard to get...<br/>
<br/>
anyway hello all :)</div>
