<div id="ygrps-yiv-464916257">Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
  I have lot of different characters, but my two main ones are Dyrlia <br/>
RaverSong, a level 24 bearded Dwarven Cleric on Innoruuk server, and <br/>
Dandara, a level 13 Human ShadowKnight on Cazic-Thule server.<br/>
<br/>
  I have never been asked if I am a woman in real life, which I find rather <br/>
odd, but count my blessings for. I&#39;m sure it will happen someday, but it <br/>
hasn&#39;t so far. (Crosses fingers).<br/>
<br/>
  As far as flirting goes, I am a notorious flirt and I&#39;ll flirt with anyone <br/>
at any time. That&#39;s the way I am in real life, so I guess I can&#39;t help it in <br/>
EQ. I think human interaction is one of the best parts of the game, and <br/>
flirtation is one of the oldest of human interactions &lt;grin&gt;. If you and <br/>
those you do it with enjoy it, by all means have fun with it.<br/>
<br/>
  The thing that irks me to no end (and I&#39;ll be honest here and admit that I <br/>
believe most of these &quot;women&quot; to be played by men)is the female characters <br/>
that you see once in awhile that shout something to the effect of &quot;I&#39;m a <br/>
cute, helpless, sexy, level four wood elf and I want someone to give me, for <br/>
free, an item or ten obtainable only by a full-group of level 40+ people. <br/>
*bats eyelashes*.&quot; I&#39;m not saying its wrong or that they should be shunned <br/>
on site. I&#39;m not even sure exactly why it bothers me, but its incredibly <br/>
annoying. Maybe it&#39;s because I feel like they are taking advantage of male <br/>
hormones, and I don&#39;t feel right doing that so I&#39;m jealous &lt;G&gt;. Dandara did <br/>
ask someone of higher level once to bring her back an ice goblin from <br/>
Permafrost, but I don&#39;t exactly see that as being the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
