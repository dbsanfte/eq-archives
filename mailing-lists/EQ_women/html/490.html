Thanks!
<p>As I read some of your responses I realized maybe the change has also
come from moving up in levels.&nbsp; Let&#39;s face it, Druid is the easiest
class to level.&nbsp; When I&#39;m on the lists in SolB I just port to BB and
kill a few dwarves while I wait.&nbsp; When I&#39;m broke, I pop into Rathe
Mts. and kill some Hill Giants for ~30P per drop.&nbsp; So, is it any wonder
I ended up 50?&nbsp; LOL, I passed people who play as much as I do so I
know it&#39;s the ease of levelling (plus I have a Shadow Knight just to remind
me how awful levelling a hybrid is).
<p>And the game really IS different at the higher levels.&nbsp; Mostly
because there is a lot less to do (or was, thank Tunare for Kunark).&nbsp;
At 48 there was SolB, Lguk, SeaFuries, Cyndreela and guards and that was
IT for fighting so, of course, everything was camped.&nbsp; And plane raids
while fun were L_O_N_G (16 hours to clear all of Fear and kill Cazic).&nbsp;
And unless you were pulling or in the KS group, the ONLY reward was if
something dropped so I do see how the loot became king (and I would still
LOVE to get my tunic and pants and look like a ranger ;-).
<p>And, well, you sign up for game in a couple of years when the design
is finished and enough prototyping done to get some vulture capitalists
interested enough to fund the 2 year development process ;-)&nbsp; So,
moslty, the game design is a mental exercise for me.&nbsp; But I have 20
years in the OS business so it&#39;s not a long shot exercise.&nbsp; I solve
at least one major problem a day in creating what I want.&nbsp; But I doubt
I spend more than an hour a day doing more than just thinking about &quot;hmm,
how do you structure X, force Y, and encourage Z&quot;.
<p>I WOULD like to market it to the women who really don&#39;t enjoy the games
marketed to the 18-23 YO male population that dominates the game industry.&nbsp;
(surviving toilet humor on a 12 Hour Hate raid is one of the things that
made me running screaming from my system).&nbsp; So, if you come up with
any &quot;gee, I really wish EQ did this&quot; you want to pass along, I&#39;m open to
suggestions.
<p>Maybe you ladiess can help me keep focused and turn this from a fun
mental exercise into a reality.
<p>Ice

<p><tt>The saddest issue I&#39;ve had to come to terms with in EQ is my friends
who in the early days used to love to do all the above mentioned, but have

campers. From what used to be a friends list that was always crammed with
20 names, its down to low teens now as my friends have slowly turned away
from the fun playing times we used to have. A couple of &quot;Bless-Yer-Heart&quot;
friends have played as we always have and I thank the Gods for them, they&#39;ve
kept me playing EQ. The others I have learned to wish the best and let
them go their own way without any hurt feelings.</tt>
<p><tt>You know, the most amazing part to me is when I do group with strangers

<p><tt>So, would I play a RP-devoted on-line game. Where the heck do I
sign up?</tt>
