<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I think Neverwinter nights sounds good but it will 
be difficult if you don&#39;t know people since the games will be invites to people 
who know one another.&nbsp; I know a lot of EQ people want to play it so if you 
have friends from Norrath you might have no trouble getting set up there.&nbsp; 
I&#39;m just not sure how people who aren&#39;t going in fully friended will get into 
good games.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I think Shadowbane sounds great since what happens 
in the world and on the servers actually changes them.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, 
if your guild takes over a city then it doesn&#39;t just repop back to its old 
self.&nbsp; The world itself changes.&nbsp; </font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I don&#39;t know much about Camelot but it looks 
interesting as well.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Personally, I have joined SCA and am much more 
interested in real life play than on-line play right now.&nbsp; I may have to 
check them out, but I don&#39;t ever want to get re-addicted to a fantasy 
environment.&nbsp; Real life is SO much more interesting :-)</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>In the previous thread, noone addressed the question of 
  whether they <br>planned to play any of the upcoming online games. I don&#39;t 
  know too <br>much about them, but there seem to be some interesting ones, like 
  <br>Neverwinter Nights, which will not be massively multiplayer, but <br>allow 
  you to adventure with a few friends like AD&amp;D, or&nbsp; Shadowbane 
  <br>(sounds to PK-friendly to me) and Dark Age of Camelot. I know there 
  <br>are others, including futuristic ones. And then, of course, there is 
  <br>EQ2.<br><br>Does anyone know anything about them? Anyone in the 
  betas?<br><br>Love, Liz<br><br>aka Gyngermynx, Ranger of Tunare, 37 seasons
