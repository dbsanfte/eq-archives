<br/>
I, too, no longer play Everquest, but I still enjoy the fellowship I have<br/>
found on this list so I continue to lurk. ;-)  I love your character names!<br/>
I am guessing your druid is a Halfling?<br/>

Greetings!  I dont&#39; play anymore but I confess I do miss it terribly.<br/>
Still, I can&#39;t handle the addiction.<br/>

  Hi !<br/>
  I subscribe today to this mailing list and wanted to say &quot;Hello&quot; to all<br/>
others.<br/>
  I am playing Everquest since November 1999 and really love it. My husband<br/>
is playing to on a seperate PC.<br/>
  My favorite character is a druid, named &quot;Bandyleg Whompyknobber&quot; and my<br/>
alt char is a Monk with the name &quot;Yuanshih&quot;. Both on the Solusek Ro server.<br/>
  In RL i come from Austria in Europe, so you have to look over the Z and Y<br/>
i am changing. Cause the game doesnt support a german keyboard, and now i am<br/>
so used to switching thos two letters, that i have problems in E-Mails :-))<br/>
  Greetings<br/>
  Rita<br/>
