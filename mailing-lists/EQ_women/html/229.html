<div id="ygrps-yiv-1400041207">Wow, I never even thought about what all this is doing to the test server.<br/>
&lt;blushes&gt; Hopefully, as you said, things will settle down.  I foresee a great<br/>
number of the people I currently have on ignore suddenly leaving<br/>
Povar........heh.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I&#39;ve mentioned before that I have a character on the PvP server, Rallos<br/>
Zek.  I made her after a couple of my guild brothers scoped it out and decided<br/>
it was alot cooler than previously thought.  People who kill newbies are<br/>
ostracized and ridiculed.  I had others of my race calling me &quot;little sister&quot;<br/>
and giving me things that they had outgrown.  People who kill others of their<br/>
race (at least, the dark elves work this way) are also ostracized.  And I must<br/>
admit, with shame, that I had a great time hunting down humans in the forest<br/>
around Neriak.  I never actually killed one by myself, so I never looted, and I<br/>
probably wouldn&#39;t anyway.  The point is, it was a darker side of RP that I found<br/>
interesting to explore.  Will it change when the race server opens up?<br/>
Probably.  Will I check out the race war server? Probably.  Will that be my new<br/>
&quot;home&quot;? Decidedly not. I&#39;ve lived with pk&#39;s in MUDS, RPG&#39;s (UO for sure, plus a<br/>
couple other more obscure games), and even RTS&#39;s.  I like not having to deal<br/>
with them daily on EQ.<br/>

&gt; Had to speak up on this one.. I call test my home.. I&#39;ve always played there<br/>
&gt; and love helping out, making a new character to test whatever it is they are<br/>
&gt; requesting at the time.. giving feedback on new things.. that&#39;s what we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; there for.. but I totally disagree with what they have done to our server..<br/>
