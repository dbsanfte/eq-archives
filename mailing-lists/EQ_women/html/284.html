<div id="ygrps-yiv-177591382">As a female tank, I am looking forward to creating a character on our new<br/>
server.  Only problem is, I can&#39;t find any of my old emails telling me which<br/>
one you ladies decided on (I had to reformat my hard drive due to virus<br/>
infestation, caught immediately, so no harm done to anyone but me), and the<br/>
name of the guild that was created especially for us, by us.  Someone please<br/>
fill me in?  &lt;blushes&gt;<br/>
Sara, Povar<br/>
Valdaya, Rallos Zek<br/>
Ishtarre, Quellios, who will do her best to be in attendance at your<br/>
nuptials<br/>

&gt; Master Tarker Blazetoss invites you to attend the wedding of his<br/>
&gt; apprentice Dnaice with Corellon.  The wedding will take place on the<br/>
&gt; Quellious server Sunday, Aug.7 at 5 PM Pacifc, 8 PM Eastern Daylight<br/>
&gt; time at the Temple of Marr in North Freeport.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am Dnaice, a high elf wizard on Quellious server and, occasionally,<br/>
&gt; Trisango a human cleric on Brell Serilis.  My love, Corellon and I met<br/>
&gt; in  Norrath and know absolutely nothing about one another on any<br/>
&gt; dimension outside of Norrath which, we feel, makes this romance and<br/>
&gt; wedding extremely special.  Our tale, which I must complete today, is<br/>
&gt; posted on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://longroad.mpog.com">http://longroad.mpog.com</a> under Tales/ Dnaice&#39;s Tale.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tigeress and Swiftlion, who were wed last weekend will be in<br/>
&gt; attendance.  I was priveleged to see their wedding and it was most<br/>
&gt; spectacular.  If you have never attended one, you must come.  It is a<br/>
&gt; grand and glorious spectacle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I look forward to getting to know other women who play, particularly<br/>
&gt; roleplay.  I would dearly love to create an all female hunting party.  I<br/>
&gt; just meet very few female tanks *smile*.<br/>
