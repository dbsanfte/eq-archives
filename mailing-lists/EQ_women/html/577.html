<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-604300625">Thanks awfully for your replies folks :) and I&#39;m so sorry about <br/>
sending that message 5 times! My isp reallllly annoys me sometimes. <br/>
Yesterday night for example my little enchanter zapped up a pet, <br/>
buffed herself and it up and trotted out to see what she could find.. <br/>
went linkdead.. sighed.. got back, another pet, re-buffed.. went <br/>
linkdead.. came back.. dead. Ah well, at least my night got better <br/>
after that!!<br/>
<br/>
In re eq relationships, I spent my first 6 months or so in eq never <br/>
getting very close to anyone, and in some ways it was a very free way <br/>
to play.. The first person I got really close to was the one that <br/>
ended up &quot;not being ready for commitment, in rl OR eq..&quot;, saying he <br/>
still wanted to be friends.. and then never speaking to me again. I <br/>
was so angry with myself for falling in love with him and so scared <br/>
of it ever happening again that I made sure I was totally noncommital <br/>
about any boy/girl thangs for quite some time.. Actually.. to be <br/>
honest I went on a mad heartless flirting spree hehe ;) tho I always <br/>
made it clear I wasn&#39;t up for anything serious so as to try not to <br/>
hurt anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually I made friends with a guy and it started to become <br/>
something more.. He knew what had happened to me, and knew how wary I <br/>
was of giving my heart away too easily, and he never put any pressure <br/>
on me although he felt that he&#39;d fallen in love with me very early on <br/>
in our friendship. Well. We&#39;re still together after about 6 months, 2 <br/>
of our characters have been married to each other and we&#39;re still as <br/>
close and as happy as we ever were :)<br/>
<br/>
Only downside is him being in the US while I&#39;m in Australia, but we <br/>
talk on the phone about once a fortnight (oooh my longdistance <br/>
telephone bill!!) and I&#39;ll be getting to the US in 2002 and we plan <br/>
to meet and spend time together. I know from other girl-friends&#39; <br/>
relationships that that can be the real testing time - a relationship <br/>
that lasted with the distance of eq can fall apart when it comes to <br/>
actually meeting, but we&#39;re both trying to be aware of that and take <br/>
things as they come. If it doesn&#39;t work out we know that we care <br/>
about each other a great deal despite that.<br/>
<br/>
And the thing someone said about playing a male character being <br/>
liberating and not getting cracked onto by guys all the time.. oh my <br/>
I had a day and a half today! This barbarian guy that I kind of <br/>
cheekily drooled on once and called cutie started to get a bit... <br/>
full on.. Mentioned maybe presenting me with a ring next time he saw <br/>
me etc etc.. I just don&#39;t know what to do.. Because of the guy I&#39;ve <br/>
mentioned above I just don&#39;t feel comfortable with forming any sort <br/>
of relationship, even with my other characters, with someone else and <br/>
I&#39;ve got to think of a way to say that I guess! Another guy the other <br/>
day who gave me a bind started saying how lucky my boy was, and how <br/>
all the good ones were always taken.. oh lord... Sometimes I just <br/>
find it way too tiring to deal with!<br/>
<br/>
Think I&#39;ll go have a cup of tea and a good lie down now ;)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much again for your responses!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers all!<br/>
