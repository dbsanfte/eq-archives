<div id="ygrps-yiv-260829248">Hello<br/>
My name is Halle and I&#39;m an (almost) 9th level wood elf druid on the<br/>
Cazic-Thule server. I say almost because after I write this I&#39;m going to go<br/>
try and get the level today!<br/>
<br/>
There hasn&#39;t been a lot of flirting around me. I figured people were unsure<br/>
if I were a guy or a girl or something. I don&#39;t think flirting is much in my<br/>
character either. I do like going around healing folks in battles with orcs,<br/>
or snaring orcs so that the fighter can get away if need be.<br/>
<br/>
It will be nice getting to know you all.<br/>
Halle<br/>

&gt;Hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yes I do get flirted with quite often. I don&#39;t really flirt back because it<br/>
&gt;is not in character with my human Paladin. I really think it&#39;s the armor I<br/>
&gt;wear. I guess its OK as long as it does not get in the way of my killing.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m throwing out a topic ladies, just want to see what experiences you<br/>
&gt;have had.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Flirting<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My character is the biggest flirt!  I discovered early in the game that<br/>
&gt;most males (no matter what race) liked the look of my character, a<br/>
&gt;half-elf.  Many flirted with her before she even knew she was cute.  It<br/>
&gt;was in-character for Genneth (a bard) to flirt, so she is constantly<br/>
&gt;engaging in flirting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And to add to it, Genn has herself somewhat of a boyfriend in the game,<br/>
&gt;another member of her guild, Teban. (&#39;Course she still flirts with<br/>
&gt;others, but he understands that she is mostly committed to him ;) So,<br/>
&gt;has this phenomenon hit anyone else?  Do you get flirted with?  Have<br/>
&gt;you found yourself a steady??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just curious<br/>
