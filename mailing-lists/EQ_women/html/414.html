 </span></blockquote>Well, I am happy with my guild and with my story as it has evolved.  We are<br/>
heavily active on the Brell Serillis board in EQVault and it is fun to write<br/>
up the story much as I did when I met my first partner and wrote Dnaice&#39;s<br/>
story on Longroads.com.  Look for the story starting with &quot;So you want to know<br/>
Cabri&quot; followed by a post from Trucid about &quot;.. when I saw&quot; and followed by<br/>
&quot;Dnaisha&#39;s Dark Night of the Soul&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
So, the game is still fun and I don&#39;t miss the last month of the partnership. <br/>
But I DO miss the first month.  I guess it will always be like that.  My new<br/>
&quot;romantic interest&quot; is much less interested in the romantic story and much<br/>
more interested in the group story.  So be it.  Maybe I&#39;ll kill him afterall <br/>
