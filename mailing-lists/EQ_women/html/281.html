<div id="ygrps-yiv-432812959"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;First, thanks to everyone who showed up last night to help get the guild<br/>
&gt;creation process going.  The guild still needs to be approved, and that<br/>
&gt;might take another week.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Let us know!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I don&#39;t like restricting what I do based on how I feel<br/>
&gt;inane little boys will act.  Lets face it...little boys are little &gt;boys.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That I agree with.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Regarding chastity, I think it&#39;s fairly clear that the guild members don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;want to have any assumption or implication of chastity on them from a role<br/>
&gt;playing context.  To this regard I&#39;d like to withdraw my suggestion of<br/>
&gt;chastity as a basis in role play.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Regarding Men, I also think it&#39;s clear that people don&#39;t want them seen as<br/>
&gt;the protectors of the sisters.  I&#39;d like to withdraw that proposed role<br/>
&gt;for them, and the title of Warder which might imply it (I&#39;ll try to come<br/>
&gt;up with another title).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am sure we can all come up with something.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Lastly, discussions can go on forever and eventually become pointless 8)<br/>
&gt;To that regards I&#39;d like to put a limitation on the discussion of guild<br/>
&gt;name and guild charter to Saturday.  I&#39;ll do my best to listen to what is<br/>
&gt;said on this list, and reflect it in the name and charter of the guild.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The real purpose of this guild is to give us an environment with which to<br/>
&gt;play EverQuest together, so lets not forget that! 8)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, absolutely!  I made a couple of characters last night and I will see which I <br/>
<br/>
like better for the guild, partially due to how much I enjoy them and partly <br/>
based on what the general member ship looks like.  Anyway, they are Tamrissa, a <br/>
wood elf ranger, and Eliana, a high elven magician.  I wouldn&#39;t expect them to <br/>
get really high level, though, since I do still need to play my other character <br/>
on Fennin Ro, since I am a guildmistress myself.  But it would be nice to have <br/>
other women to play with and to be able to be a general member without having to <br/>
<br/>
do all the work of being a guildmistress all the time as well.  ^_^<br/>
