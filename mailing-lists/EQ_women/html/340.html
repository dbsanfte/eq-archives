<div id="ygrps-yiv-890994567">I can not wait to hunt with you all.  Although I do not play on this server<br/>
with my primary characters, I have made a Dwarven Paladin named Mytee to<br/>
hunt with you.   I had initally created a Dark Elven Necromancer named<br/>
Karrma (after my primary char) But decided that it was in my best interest<br/>
to make a character that will be able to travel with you all.  I look<br/>
forward to meeting you.  See you on Monday!!  PS I have not begun her<br/>
training as yet, but she has traveled to Freeport and been bound for the<br/>
first hunt. &lt;Claps hands excitedly&gt;<br/>

&gt; Hey Everyone,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The time for the meeting has been set for Monday August 16th at 6pm PST in<br/>
&gt; East Freeport on Brell Serelis.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The meeting is an opportunity for us all to meet eachother and chat.<br/>
&gt; You can either make a newbie character just to attend the meeting, or you<br/>
&gt; can use your existing Brell Serelis character.  While Evil races are not<br/>
&gt; allowed inside East Freeport, the newbie zone is not patrolled.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My character Luna will be hosting the event, and you can send her a tell<br/>
&gt; if you have any questions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After the chat, there will be a subequent newbie hunt for any who are<br/>
&gt; interested.  This will be an opportunity to group and hunt together.  East<br/>
&gt; Freeport has an excellent newbie zone.  North Ro, which borders East<br/>
&gt; Freeport, has numerous creatures levels 1-4 for hunting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please note the boat from Butcherblock takes about an hour in total travel<br/>
&gt; and waiting time, so be sure to boat early.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I realize not everyone will be able to attend during this time, but this<br/>
&gt; was the best match available.  I&#39;ll try to have another event, and make<br/>
&gt; sure that it works with the time schedule of those who can&#39;t attend.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Christina<br/>
