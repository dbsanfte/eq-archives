<b>Subject:</b> Re: Real females on Rallos Zek? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2024980953">I&#39;m glad to hear from a real female on Rallos Zek! I&#39;m glad you haven&#39;t had<br/>
too many problems. My  friend has dabbled with a dark elf necromancer, and<br/>
he says the dark elves are zealous about not pvping their own kind.<br/>
Unfortunately, the Wood elves do not have that sort of pack.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been annoyed enough to quit yet. But I was wondering. Thanks for<br/>
the information.<br/>
