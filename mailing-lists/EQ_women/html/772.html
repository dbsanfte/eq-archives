Cool!<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
Well the closest I&#39;ve been to anything like this is<br/>
not EQ but kind of interesting never the less.<br/>
My brother-in-law met his wife when he stopped over in<br/>
South Korea on the way to Japan a few years ago. She<br/>
is from the Phillipeans but I think was in korea<br/>
illegally at the time and he just happened to have<br/>
stopped there headed for anohter country. Now they are<br/>
married and have a little girl. You never know when<br/>
those things will happen.<br/>
I guess if it&#39;s going to happen it&#39;s going to happen,<br/>
but kind of neat to hear the stories.<br/>
<br/>
:o)<br/>

&gt; I &quot;met&quot; my fiance in EQ in March 1999. =)  We were<br/>
&gt; very good friends for a while and he helped me get<br/>
&gt; through some real transition in my life... started<br/>
&gt; dating in January of 2000, moved in together the end<br/>
&gt; of that year, and became engaged with our families&#39;<br/>
&gt; blessings in May this year.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What convinced us this would work is when we moved<br/>
&gt; in together, quit EQ and STILL stayed up til 1 AM<br/>
&gt; talking. *grin* <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;   That was a nice story and kind of neat and I<br/>
&gt; certainly<br/>
&gt;   hope things continue to work out for you as well<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt;   they are now or even better.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;   You just never know what might happen I guess,I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;   heard about people who met their special someone<br/>
&gt; on EQ<br/>
&gt;   but your the first I&#39;ve actually met.<br/>

&gt;   &gt; Hi I have a story about marrage and eq, My<br/>
&gt; cleric<br/>
&gt;   &gt; met an enchanter at lvl  17 while grouping in<br/>
&gt; oasis,<br/>
&gt;   &gt; we got talking and after a few nights realized<br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt;   &gt; had alot in common as real life ppl. We were<br/>
&gt; married<br/>
&gt;   &gt; in game  at the little dock in nro at sunset<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt;   &gt; takes you to IC when we   <br/>
&gt;   &gt; made lvl 20  and that was about a 1 1/2 ago. We<br/>
&gt;   &gt; spent almost every night eather grped or we<br/>
&gt; would<br/>
&gt;   &gt; talk in game, after about a month we started<br/>
&gt; talking<br/>
&gt;   &gt; over the phone, slowly our friendship grew in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt;   &gt; real world. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; The only problem was he was on the other side of<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt;   &gt; US from me so it was limited to just talking on<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt;   &gt; phone, the feelings for each other grew and we<br/>
&gt; found<br/>
&gt;   &gt; we had we had fell in love for real. we wanted<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt;   &gt; meet  but at that time it wasnt a thing we could<br/>
&gt; do.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; we continued to talk daily on eq and on the<br/>
&gt; phone<br/>
&gt;   &gt; for about a year. We then started to talk using<br/>
&gt;   &gt; netmeeting and did that for a few months. We<br/>
&gt; started<br/>
&gt;   &gt; both feeling<br/>
&gt;   &gt; of wanting to be togeather very strongly. we<br/>
&gt; then<br/>
&gt;   &gt; started making plans for him to come down so we<br/>
&gt;   &gt; could meet for real. This last July he spent 3<br/>
&gt; weeks<br/>
&gt;   &gt; here wiht me. we had so much fun and both of us<br/>
&gt;   &gt; realized how much we  loved being with each<br/>
&gt; other.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; We both realized how hard it was going to be for<br/>
&gt; him<br/>
&gt;   &gt; to go back home. We talked about him moving<br/>
&gt; here.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; At the end of aug he moved him self down here to<br/>
&gt;   &gt; move in with me.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; We are very happy togeather and cant imagine<br/>
&gt; what it<br/>
&gt;   &gt; would be to be wiht one an other now. He is a<br/>
&gt; very<br/>
&gt;   &gt; loving person and im very happy and feel very<br/>
&gt; luck<br/>
&gt;   &gt; to have found him. The odds of us meeting in<br/>
&gt; game<br/>
&gt;   &gt; are huge and the odds of us grping in the same<br/>
&gt; grp<br/>
&gt;   &gt; that night are even bigger. So we  feel it was<br/>
&gt;   &gt; totally ment to be. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; So see wonderful things can happen from playing<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt;   &gt; game and ingame marrage.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; so i guess that is my answer about getting<br/>
&gt; married<br/>
&gt;   &gt; in the game.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; Tyhana Storm<br/>
&gt;   &gt; 55 cleric<br/>
&gt;   &gt; Bertoxx <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Ps my cleric as preformed a few marrages now<br/>
&gt; also<br/>
&gt;   &gt; and those ppl are still very happy with there<br/>
&gt;   &gt; partner in the game.<br/>

&gt;   &gt; Hi!&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; I sent a long post the other day and hoped on<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt;   &gt; list today only to &lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; realize that it had not made it to this list at<br/>
&gt; all.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; In fact, &lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; apparently my last couple of posts didn&#39;t make<br/>
&gt; it to<br/>
&gt;   &gt; the list.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; Sometimes I can be so dumb . . . but I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; help<br/>
&gt;   &gt; but wonder where I &lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; sent the crazy things.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; :o)&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; Anyway, a little question for anyone who might<br/>
&gt; think<br/>
&gt;   &gt; about &lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; answering . . .&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; Is there a level limit you need to be to get<br/>
&gt; married<br/>
&gt;   &gt; in EQ? What are &lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; the advantages and or disadvantages of tying the<br/>
&gt; EQ<br/>
&gt;   &gt; knot?&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
