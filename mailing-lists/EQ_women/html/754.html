Greetings )<br/>
I would like to do this. I have just created a wiz on<br/>
the Cazic Thule server. If that&#39;s not convenient let<br/>
me know. Otherwise sure anywhere you wanna go is fine<br/>
with me.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve been playing some nwn recently with a few<br/>
&gt; friends on Friday <br/>
&gt; evenings and was wondering if there might be some<br/>
&gt; interest in forming <br/>
&gt; an EQ group to meet on one evening a week and<br/>
&gt; adventure together for <br/>
&gt; a while. We could start a set of new characters and<br/>
&gt; bring them up as <br/>
&gt; a group. I would be willing to meet on whatever<br/>
&gt; server and be <br/>
&gt; whatever class or race that was needed. We could<br/>
&gt; form a little party <br/>
&gt; and help each other out. I thought it might be fun.<br/>
&gt; Is there anyone <br/>
&gt; else who has any intrest in an idea like this.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If so let&#39;s discuss the details.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
