<div id="ygrps-yiv-142715858">Hi Allison....<br/>
<br/>
I saw the e-mail that you sent and noticed that you are a High-Elf Cleric. I play the same race/class (character name: Katheryn), however, I am only on level 5 (by the way, I am also on the Bristlebane Server). I was wondering if you could give me any tips that might help me out. Obviously, since your character is at a much higher level, you probably have a few bits of advice to throw my way! :-) Believe me, I would really, really appreciate it! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks...I look forward to hearing from you and I will look for you next time I play! <br/>
<br/>
