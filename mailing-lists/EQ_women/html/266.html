<div id="ygrps-yiv-910935868">I agree with the chaste thing. For the reason mentioned. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The brothers thing.... I don&#39;t like the concept of excluding men. I like<br/>
the concept of have them sponsored. They&#39;re not protectors or anything<br/>
just additional guild members.<br/>
<br/>
just my 2 cents.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; A couple of comments on the guild ideas as given... first, why would sisters<br/>
&gt; dedicated to the Goddess of Love be chaste?  The idea seems wrong to me; the<br/>
&gt; opposite seems much more likely.  The other thing that bothers me is the idea of<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; the Warders - why do a group of warrior women need men to protect them?  Kind of<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; implies that even tough warrior women need a big strong man to help them, you<br/>
&gt; know?  Maybe we could come up with some other way men could belong?  Maybe the<br/>
&gt; men could belong to a brother order, The Brothers of Mithaniel, with a close<br/>
&gt; association with the Sisters of Erollisi?<br/>
&gt; Other than those two quibbles, I think the idea in general is sound and I would<br/>
&gt; enjoy belonging to this guild on a new server. </span></blockquote></div>
