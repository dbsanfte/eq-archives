Well, a funny thing happened. I cranked up My half-elf Bard &quot;Brangvyne&quot; and <br/>
started playing and joined up with a kind lady who was starting to show me <br/>
the ropes which I was grasping at and all of a sudden the whole thing locked <br/>
up. My poor computer is now down for the count . . . Ouch! I can&#39;t get on, <br/>
and oddly enough when I plug in the modem the whole phone system in the house <br/>
is down until I unplug the modem.<br/>
Fortunately I have this system but unfortunately it does not meet the <br/>
requirements for EQ.<br/>
:o(<br/>
I&#39;ll hopefully get this thing figured out shortly. If not I&#39;ll have to <br/>
contact them and cancel until I can get back up and on line.<br/>
