<b>Subject:</b> New RP Server??? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1472151207">Okay, apparently Verant is seriously contemplating giving in and creating an<br/>
RP server.  A REAL RP server.  Changes in the playing rules and everything.  I<br/>
think that would be the one thing that could get me back in the game 100%.  <br/>
<br/>
I was also looking at the new Team server and wondering if anyone had tried<br/>
it.  I like the idea of good/evil/neutral alliances (are they taking something<br/>
from AO here?) and wondered if it was more fun or added a new dimension to the<br/>
game that way.  <br/>
