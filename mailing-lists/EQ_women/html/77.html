<b>Subject:</b> Re: Twinking?? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-507215720">Yes, these other &quot;females&quot; ARE asking for things.  One of them was auctioning<br/>
that &quot;she&quot; wanted a set of patchwork leggings.  I /who&#39;d her, and found out she<br/>
was level four, so I offered them to her for 1 gold (I was feeling generous).<br/>
She /tell&#39;d me back, saying, and I quote, &quot;Hell NO I&#39;m not paying for it =)&quot;  I<br/>
replied, &quot;huh?&quot; She replied, &quot;hehe watch and learn&quot;.<br/>
    I recently tossed around the idea of making a new character, exactly like my<br/>
primary but with my &quot;true&quot; elven name (Sara just doesn&#39;t sound very wood<br/>
elvish).  A friend offered to hold my stuff and give it to my new character.<br/>
Now, I have full banded, a combine, an ash bow, the works.  My dilemma is<br/>
this--I don&#39;t believe in power gaming or twinking.  Granted, it&#39;s the same exact<br/>
character, stats and all, just a different name......the stuff I have would just<br/>
help me get to my current experience level quicker; at which point I would<br/>
delete my current primary.  So, to twink, or not to twink?<br/>

&gt; I was had been playing on Bristlebane when I found out some real life<br/>
&gt; friends were playing on Cazic-Thule. I switched to Cazic-Thule because I<br/>
&gt; felt it was good to be around some folks I knew.  These fellow are guys I<br/>
&gt; know from our paper and pencil role playing group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway we made arrangements when I first made my character. My friend<br/>
&gt; brought me an entire set of cloth armour. He was a wizard so basically he<br/>
&gt; just handed me his clothing. At level 1 I had a cracked staff, then later my<br/>
&gt; friends brought me a fine steel staff. I was about level 5 then.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This mini-twinking did make it easier for me to advance. I did not die half<br/>
&gt; as many times as I had as my first bristlebane character. I was able to more<br/>
&gt; quickly save up for patchwork. A &quot;female&quot; player gave me a good deal on a<br/>
&gt; set of patchwork when I was level 4.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think this was serious twinking. And I don&#39;t think I got the stuff<br/>
&gt; because I was &quot;female.&quot; I  think they would have given it to a friend<br/>
&gt; regardless.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Other than that, no one has given me anything. Maybe these other &quot;females&quot;<br/>
&gt; are asking for stuff?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; By the way, one of my male friends plays a female high elf. He said he plays<br/>
&gt; her because he likes to inviso people to killl their pets and likes the<br/>
&gt; reaction he gets to his &quot;female&quot; self. Heh. Weird guy.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Grrrrrrrrr.  I&#39;ve been playing since Day one, and have noticed that most of<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt;guys I work with have switched to female characters, supposedly because<br/>
&gt; they get<br/>
&gt; &gt;free stuff.  I wasn&#39;t ever given (nor did I solicit any) stuff until I<br/>
&gt; joined a<br/>
&gt; &gt;guild.  Now, my brothers take care of me, but since I reciprocate, I feel<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;fair.  Every time I see a &quot;female&quot; character (especially wood elves since I<br/>
&gt; play<br/>
&gt; &gt;one) twinking, I /tell them....hehehe.......might not make me very popular<br/>
&gt; but I<br/>
&gt; &gt;feel better at night. =)<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; I was intrigued to see RPG weddings... I have a boyfriend in RL who plays<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Barbarian Shaman at a higher level than myself, on the same server.  So,<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; get some perks from that :)  He normally plays from work with other<br/>
&gt; friends<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; and his brother, so it&#39;s like a close knit family. They just play the<br/>
&gt; game,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; and that&#39;s what they are there for...hunting and quests, no on line<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; relationships.   I group with all males, which proves to be interesting.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Flirting does take place and all members have significant others that do<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; play EQ... soon to be single with the way the are on all the time!  I<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; been told most males will play female characters since they get more<br/>
&gt; things<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; and favors... I suppose I have noticed that.  I love the game and find I<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; look forward to going home from work to play... it&#39;s a whole other world!<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Hope to hear from y&#39;all.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Hello All,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  I have lot of different characters, but my two main ones are Dyrlia<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;RaverSong, a level 24 bearded Dwarven Cleric on Innoruuk server, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Dandara, a level 13 Human ShadowKnight on Cazic-Thule server.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  I have never been asked if I am a woman in real life, which I find<br/>
&gt; rather<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;odd, but count my blessings for. I&#39;m sure it will happen someday, but it<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;hasn&#39;t so far. (Crosses fingers).<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  As far as flirting goes, I am a notorious flirt and I&#39;ll flirt with<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;at any time. That&#39;s the way I am in real life, so I guess I can&#39;t help<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;in<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;EQ. I think human interaction is one of the best parts of the game, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;flirtation is one of the oldest of human interactions &lt;grin&gt;. If you and<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;those you do it with enjoy it, by all means have fun with it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  The thing that irks me to no end (and I&#39;ll be honest here and admit<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;believe most of these &quot;women&quot; to be played by men)is the female<br/>
&gt; characters<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;that you see once in awhile that shout something to the effect of &quot;I&#39;m a<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;cute, helpless, sexy, level four wood elf and I want someone to give me,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;for<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;free, an item or ten obtainable only by a full-group of level 40+<br/>
&gt; people.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;*bats eyelashes*.&quot; I&#39;m not saying its wrong or that they should be<br/>
&gt; shunned<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;on site. I&#39;m not even sure exactly why it bothers me, but its incredibly<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;annoying. Maybe it&#39;s because I feel like they are taking advantage of<br/>
&gt; male<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;hormones, and I don&#39;t feel right doing that so I&#39;m jealous &lt;G&gt;. Dandara<br/>
&gt; did<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;ask someone of higher level once to bring her back an ice goblin from<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Permafrost, but I don&#39;t exactly see that as being the same thing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Cheers,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
