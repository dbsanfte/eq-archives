<div id="ygrps-yiv-159897923">Guilds are wonderful... well, I guess if you get into a wonderful guild. :)<br/>
I&#39;m a dedicated to Ilsik Haucil on the Mith Marr server, and I&#39;ve had a<br/>
great deal of fun.  The people in the guild are helpful, will rez you if you<br/>
die, will support raids you want to go on, and will just play for fun<br/>
anytime. There are only about 35 members in this guild, very small, but a<br/>
wonderful bunch of people.<br/>
<br/>
They started the guild because a bunch of friends who happened to play on<br/>
line all the time wanted a more tight knit group.  They are that, indeed,<br/>
and I sure hope to become a full member soon.  I think to find a guild you<br/>
should probably group with people in certain guilds, ask them how their<br/>
guild is, and just find some friends who you like their playing style and<br/>
who you get along with.  With IH, whenever someone wants to play, there is<br/>
usually a guild member or two on line, so you never have to go alone. :)<br/>
Also with IH, though, they are very selective about who joins.  You have to<br/>
play with various members, get someone to sponsor you, and then play with<br/>
various players more so they can see if you&#39;ll fit in.  I like IH because<br/>
they don&#39;t let just anyone in... they have a certain play style which is<br/>
very efficient and organized, and I like that very much.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I&#39;m the one who&#39;s boyfriend got me hooked.  :) Only 1 bubble from<br/>
19!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

&gt; I hope I am not being a pest, but I would like some info on Guilds.<br/>
&gt; What exactly do they do?  How do you find out which one is right for<br/>
&gt; you?  Should a newbie consider joining one, or wait until higher level.<br/>
&gt; BTW, someone said they started playing this game after their boyfriend<br/>
&gt; got them hooked.  Well, My 15 year old son is the one who got me<br/>
&gt; started!  Pretty sad, huh? lol<br/>
&gt; Thanks for your help,<br/>
