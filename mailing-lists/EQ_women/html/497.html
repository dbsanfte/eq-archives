I bring my characters to life through my writing.&nbsp; Ice has a complete
history that described the moment of her &quot;birth&quot; into Norrath (when she
ran away from home to avoid an arranged marriage with a Wood Elf she loathed).&nbsp;
Each adventure became the next chapter in her life.&nbsp; I stopped writing
at some point, and that may be part of what happened.&nbsp; I was just
too busy playing and the group I had joined up with really didn&#39;t do a
lot of story writing like my previous group had (but there were lots of
OTHER problems with that group and it split up badly).
<p>At any rate, just for yucks and if you&#39;re interested, I just finished
the rest of Ice&#39;s tale up through my Religious Retreat and personal meeting
with Tunare (we laughed all night at what a foolish Druid Ice is, always
throwing away what she wants the most ;-).&nbsp; This coincided with my
taking a week hiatus to reconnect to my real life and, duh, start writing
again ;-)&nbsp; Writers write, they do not play EQ all day every day ;-P

<p>P.S.&nbsp; If you want, I&#39;ll be happy to send anyone the complete collection
of Ice stories.&nbsp; If I ever bring Dnaisha out of retirement she has
a rather sordid collection of her own.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;d love to play her
again, I just can&#39;t figure out hot to give her rebirth.

<br><tt>&gt;My EQ partner and I discuss these issues alot. We&#39;re both non-competitive,</tt>
<br><tt>have as much fun as you can, love-to-explore-and-do-quests kinda
gals. We&#39;ve</tt>
<br><tt>both been playing for well over a year and our primaries are still
low</tt>
<br><tt>thirties.</tt>
<br><tt>&gt;</tt>
<br><tt>&gt;The saddest issue I&#39;ve had to come to terms with in EQ is my friends
who in</tt>
<br><tt>the early days used to love to do all the above mentioned, but
have since</tt>
<br><tt>become power levellers and (shudders as she says it) *Kewl Lewt*
campers.</tt>
<br><tt>&gt;From what used to be a friends list that was always crammed with
20 names,</tt>
<br><tt>its down to low teens now as my friends have slowly turned away
from the fun</tt>
<br><tt>playing times we used to have. A couple of &quot;Bless-Yer-Heart&quot; friends
have</tt>
<br><tt>played as we always have and I thank the Gods for them, they&#39;ve
kept me</tt>
<br><tt>playing EQ. The others I have learned to wish the best and let
them go their</tt>
<br><tt>own way without any hurt feelings.</tt>
<br><tt>&gt;</tt>
<br><tt>&gt;You know, the most amazing part to me is when I do group with
strangers and</tt>
<br><tt>do my role-playing thing, within the hour, all but the hard-core
powergamers</tt>
<br><tt>are rp&#39;ing back with me and having a blast. Go figure.</tt>
<br><tt>&gt;</tt>
<br><tt>&gt;So, would I play a RP-devoted on-line game. Where the heck do
I sign up?</tt>
