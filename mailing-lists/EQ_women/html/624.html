<div id="ygrps-yiv-654729831">Happy New Year, ladies!<br/>
<br/>
I just wondered how long the shelf life of EQ is? I have played since <br/>
24 August 2000, and I tend to feel that I could carry on playing for <br/>
around a year, so long as I could get groups. EQ does not strike me <br/>
as a game I could easily play casually though, so I probably wouldn&#39;t <br/>
play fewer hours per week over a longer period.<br/>
<br/>
I think the decisive factor would be in-game; it&#39;s a miserable <br/>
occupation if you can&#39;t play as part of a group, so if it comes to <br/>
the point where my ranger cannot get into groups, it will probably be <br/>
time to move on. I suppose I might try another class, but I am not <br/>
that interested in doing so.<br/>
<br/>
Many of you have played far longer than me, and some have retired. I <br/>
should be very interested to know how this worked for you.<br/>
<br/>
One further point; are any of you intending to play any of the new <br/>
games slated to open up in 2001? eg Shadowbane, Dark Age of Camelot<br/>
<br/>
Love, <br/>
<br/>
