<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899266676">I must say that after 41 levels of EQ, I am a bit bored. It&#39;s a <br/>
wonderful game, but it doesn&#39;t seem to change, except that it <br/>
increasingly requires a long session and a good group to get <br/>
anywhere. <br/>
<br/>
DAoC looks very good, although I should be disappointed to find that <br/>
my EQ friends were on opposing teams and hence incommunicado to me. A <br/>
little planning required there. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone tried Anarchy Online? From what I have read, it looks highly <br/>
original.<br/>
