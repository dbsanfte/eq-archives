Hey, is EQ addictive or is it just me . . .<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, and that is not the last of my troubles/mishaps<br/>
(apparently I&#39;m not very good at this stuff) :o)<br/>
<br/>
Last night I took the master key and two orc eyes<br/>
needed to get the sword. I read the text again, I even<br/>
asked someone who had just completed that quest and I<br/>
made sure I had what I needed. I went back to the guy<br/>
and give him the stuff and he took it once again and<br/>
happily said, thanks and I got nothing once again. I<br/>
was so mad. It didn&#39;t help when I realized the fault<br/>
was entirely mine in that I had given the guy the key,<br/>
one Orc eye, and one firebeetle eye; instead of two<br/>
orc eyes. They looked the same and I was tired when I<br/>
did it. (Should have been in bed) :o)<br/>
<br/>
Finally, a 21st lvl Druid I talk to and have traveled<br/>
with a bit took pity on me, took me around, and sort<br/>
of &quot;held my hand&quot; and walked me through getting one of<br/>
the quest items step by step which was nice of him.<br/>
The point is, at least to me, the instructions were<br/>
not that clear unless you already had some kind of<br/>
knowledge of what was going on. At that point it seems<br/>
very obvious. But then perhaps I&#39;m just a bit dense.<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
Ah well, live and learn.<br/>
<br/>
:o)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; A good thing to do is before you hand in any quest<br/>
&gt; items talk to the NPC <br/>
&gt; again and listen very carefully to the exact<br/>
&gt; instructions. I am ultra <br/>
&gt; paranoid about this stuff, but I have never lost a<br/>
&gt; quest item. The <br/>
&gt; instructions are usually very precise.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Salutations Sinrianna!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; You don&#39;t even want to know what I did last night<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; that quest.<br/>
&gt; &gt; :o)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; But maybe someone will get a laugh out of my<br/>
&gt; &gt; stupidity.<br/>
&gt; &gt; :o)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I finally got together all the things I needed for<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; tunic. I never did find the forest drakling scale<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; &gt; I found someone who had one and offered to sell it<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; me and asked what I would give them. I told them<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t have any idea what anything cost but<br/>
&gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt; pay them whatever the fair price was. They told me<br/>
&gt; &gt; that they used to get 50pp but that they would<br/>
&gt; sell it<br/>
&gt; &gt; to me for 20pp and that to be nice they would let<br/>
&gt; me<br/>
&gt; &gt; have it for 10pp if that was all I could afford.<br/>
&gt; Well<br/>
&gt; &gt; I had the 20pp and I didn&#39;t want to take advantage<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyone so I gave it to them. (Yes, I&#39;m a sucker)<br/>
&gt; &gt; :o)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Then I took all my stuff back to the Ranger guild<br/>
&gt; &gt; house and gave it to the Ranger who gave me the<br/>
&gt; quest,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I forget the name. He took all the stuff, told me<br/>
&gt; &gt; thank you, and that was it. I didn&#39;t get anything,<br/>
&gt; no<br/>
&gt; &gt; tunic, no exp., no nothing. I was so upset I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; know whether to laugh or cry . . .<br/>
&gt; &gt; :o)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So, after standing there for a long time kicking<br/>
&gt; &gt; myself I asked them for the quest all over again.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Oddly, this time they gave me the box to put<br/>
&gt; &gt; everything in and they also gave me a pattern for<br/>
&gt; an<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;enchanted tunic&quot;? Not sure what that is all about<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; there are not enough slots in the box to fit the<br/>
&gt; stuff<br/>
&gt; &gt; and the tunic.<br/>
&gt; &gt; :o)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, I went back out and started gathering<br/>
&gt; stuff<br/>
&gt; &gt; again. Still need to regain a couple items,<br/>
&gt; including<br/>
&gt; &gt; that silly Forest Drakling Scale, but now I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; paranoid<br/>
&gt; &gt; about the exact approach to take to not lose<br/>
&gt; &gt; everything again. Apparently, I did or said<br/>
&gt; something<br/>
&gt; &gt; wrong last time.<br/>
&gt; &gt; :o)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Oh well, live and learn I guess, but it certainly<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t make me feel any better when I was telling<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone about the whole thing later and they told<br/>
&gt; me I<br/>
&gt; &gt; had been ripped off on the price of the Forest<br/>
&gt; &gt; Drakling Scale . . . ouch!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, just thought I&#39;d throw that out in case<br/>
&gt; anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; was interested at all.<br/>

&gt; &gt; PS - I came across a master key in CB last night<br/>
&gt; and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have the two Orc eyes for the sword. For any more<br/>
&gt; &gt; experienced rangers out there, is there anything<br/>
&gt; &gt; special I need to do to give this to the Ranger in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; guild and actually get the sword instead of losing<br/>
&gt; &gt; that too.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; LOL ... someone in guild was just complaining<br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that earlier today :) ... they&#39;re a pain but,<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; newbie armor quests are worth it in the long run<br/>
