<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664722027">Thanks, Elahana dear.  Well, the move was an adventure and a half (I moved from<br/>
the NW corner of the country to one of the SE states, so believe me on this<br/>
one), and I&#39;m glad to have it over with, but I did enjoy the scenery along the<br/>
way and it gave me lots of time to think.  I decided I&#39;m looking forward to it<br/>
being just me and my kids for a bit.  Sometimes concentrating on another adult<br/>
is just too much darned work. =)<br/>

&gt; Good luck on your move Sara. I hope you make it safely and I can relate.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s good that you have family to support you when you need them. =) We hope<br/>
&gt; to hear from you soon.<br/>
