<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291684491"><p>the sewing/smithing levels for all newbie armor is &lt;=20 but its also No Fail, which means you&#39;ll always suceed in your attempts at creating newbie armor. </p>
<p>Misty Thicket is the newbie zone for the Halflings they have a different type of drakling that they need scales from and only&nbsp;spawn every 30 minns and theres only about a 25% chance that the draklings will even have a scale let alone one of the&nbsp;3 different special types that you need, plus their pristine scales (the very rare drop off this rare spawn) is no drop so its much much harder to get the newbie tunics for rangers and rogues over there. So far I&#39;ve done just about all the newbie armor quests for almost every race/class combo so if anyone has questions just let me know.</p><p><br><hr size="1">Do you Yahoo!?<br>
