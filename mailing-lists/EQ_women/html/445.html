<div id="ygrps-yiv-800021800">If someone tells someone they are a girl in real life, when they are a<br/>
boy, that is deceptive.  If they try to act &#39;girlish&#39; and people believe<br/>
they&#39;re a girl, that&#39;s role playing, as far as I see it, and there&#39;s<br/>
nothing wrong with it.  Even if they rollplay a girl badly, and boys<br/>
believe them anyway =)<br/>
<br/>
Even if someone lies about being a girl in real life, I don&#39;t see it as<br/>
that big a deal.  I had that happen to me.  Someone I was friends with for<br/>
3 months who I totally thought was a girl, turned out to be a boy.<br/>
Initially, I was totally shocked, but it didn&#39;t take me long to realize<br/>
this was still the same person I was friend with.<br/>
<br/>
Even if someone is actively deceptive about their gender, I really do<br/>
think it&#39;s pretty harmless.  The Internet offers a great medium for people<br/>
to explore different things, in a way that is essentially harmless.  Until<br/>
it starts intruding on the real world, I think it&#39;s basicly harmless.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are a number of people on my own server who are unsure as<br/>
to my gender, or think that I&#39;m a boy.  That&#39;s just the way the Internet<br/>
works, it doesn&#39;t bother me.  I do tend to drop pretty overt gender cues,<br/>
most notably all my online friends know that my RL boyfriend is a player<br/>
on our server.  If someone thinks I&#39;m a boy though, it doesn&#39;t bug me.<br/>
<br/>
I know lots of nice &#39;girls&#39; online who may or may not be boys, I haven&#39;t<br/>
asked =) I must admit I wonder some time, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary<br/>
for me to pry.  I do know they&#39;re good friends, and I love grouping with<br/>
them.<br/>

&gt; I have a topic for discussion, actually.  Since this is a women&#39;s list what<br/>
&gt; better place to talk about the number of men that play women characters on<br/>
&gt; EQ? </span></blockquote></div>
