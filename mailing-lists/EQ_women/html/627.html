<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126587268">In March, I&#39;ll be playing for 2 full years.<br/>
<br/>
Since you&#39;ve asked, here&#39;s been my change in perspective on EQ, the good and the bad:<br/>
<br/>
(Disclaimer: All below is only MHO, no one has to agree with me, just how I see it)<br/>
<br/>
Good:<br/>
<br/>
1. Lots of new, challenging zones released often enough to keep me playing.<br/>
<br/>
2. Grouping with friends I&#39;ve known a long, long time and love hanging around with.<br/>
<br/>
3. Matured &quot;rules&quot; of the game. Such as random loot, &quot;play nice&quot; rules, easing up of KS&#39;ing. In the early days, I never did get a BS tunic with a name like &quot;Zuki&quot; and alpha loot order.<br/>
<br/>
4. Less populated servers because of all the new one added and splitting.<br/>
<br/>
Bad:<br/>
<br/>
1. The general &quot;socialness&quot; of the game has taken a deep dive down. In the early days, it was fun and exciting for everyone. Everyone learned stuff the hard way together. Now, it constant shouts for exp. res&#39;s and sow and clarity. Very little fun chit chat.<br/>
<br/>
2. Greediness has risen sharply. Farming. Begging. Camping items to twink a lower level character. All rampant.<br/>
<br/>
3. General &quot;safety&quot; of the game. Everyone knows what level creatures are in every zone. If you die, get an exp. res. Maps, locs, everything&#39;s available to you. There&#39;s no more exploring or serendipity to the game.<br/>
<br/>
4. &quot;Lather, Rinse, Repeat&quot; aspect of fighting and hunting. *Yawns*<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve cut back sharply on how much I play in the last 6 months. I cut back because the game isn&#39;t as challenging anymore. There is no &quot;end&quot;. You can&#39;t win it. There&#39;s no storyline to make you think and ponder and get stuck. It isn&#39;t a very mentally challenging game (IMHO), so after the &quot;physical&quot; thrill has worn off, it doesn&#39;t have much to offer me.<br/>
<br/>
I still enjoy playing and exploring with my friends, but now I&#39;m on for their company, not for the game.<br/>
