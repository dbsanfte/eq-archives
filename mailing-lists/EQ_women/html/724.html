<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168106208">i think its fantastic... but if you want to enjoy the full graphical nature <br/>
of it... you need a very nice computer... to see the new charcter models and <br/>
stuff, you need MINIMUM 256mb ram, recomended is 512mb... Geforce or better <br/>
video card etc.... but the graphics are amazing.  and all the old world and <br/>
previsous expansions are all retextured and looking good too.  there is a <br/>
new race, the Vah Shir (cat like people) and 1 new class (beast lord).  <br/>
There are also many special 51+ abilities also now... you get ability exp <br/>
besides normal exp, and you can tell what % of your exp you want to go to <br/>
abilities instead of level exp...  some really cool abilities... some <br/>
general ones are running speed, regen speed... base stats and resist <br/>
raising... then theres (at 55+) a cetegory based on if your a caster, melee, <br/>
priest type... etc... with cool skills... mana regen, crit hits chances(even <br/>
for non warriors) etc... then there are class specific abilities at 59+ ... <br/>
many are cool, like clerics get one thats 100% exp rez with full hps and <br/>
mana and no rez effects... and all kinds of powerful stuff... 2 people can <br/>
be level 60 now, and 1 can be twice as powerful as the other without even <br/>
looking at equipment...<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So is everyone having fun in Luclin?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Didn&#39;t know it was out.  Can you tell us a bit about it?  Getting a little<br/>
&gt;bored in Albion *sigh*.  Are there new classes and races one can try out?<br/>
&gt;That might bring me to Luclin for a bit to see.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Trying to play an MMORPG with only 3-10 hours a week is a challenge.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt;hard to stay connected to the community with that little time.  And I will<br/>
&gt;never again have the time to devote to a plane raid.  Hmmm... maybe I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;have the lifestyle for this anymore *cries pitifully*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ice<br/>
