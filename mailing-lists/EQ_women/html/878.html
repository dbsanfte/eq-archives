<div id="ygrps-yiv-716507437"><div>I am Justene Thyme. I had once guy flirting with me in the Nexus. I&#39;ve heard of people meeting people through EQ, meeting in RL, than living together. I&#39;ve had 4 sets of EQ friends do this in RL. With my luck I&#39;d end up in prison for meeting a minor (I have a BF and he&#39;s 30 I&#39;m 25 in RL). I have an 8 year old son so in view with &quot;mother eyes&quot; I can&#39;t do it. One guy flirted with my main for a long time (Alexandrah) saying he&#39;s buying a house, I seem like a great person, and so on... but I left it as flirting. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In RL I completed Microcomputer Operations and I&#39;m returning next month for Computer Programming. People say I&#39;m intelligent but I&#39;m normal in my eyes like any other person. I have many hobbies... my best activity is my family. </div>

<div>I think I saw Justene in Nexus.&nbsp; I remember because my 17 yr old loves a girl named Justene and she doesn&#39;t think about him, &quot;That Way.&quot;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have a bard level 5 named Winday.&nbsp; I am finding bardhood challenging.&nbsp;&nbsp; My sons play on Prex and Karana.&nbsp; They are not as nice on Karana.</div>
