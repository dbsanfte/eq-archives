&gt;&gt; nobody wants to group with me!  :(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That is sick.  I can&#39;t belive folks would do that.  <br/>

&gt;know of a good place in Norrath to tie the knot?)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Hey...Ranalla, you mentioned that everyone was shouting for SoWs when you<br/>
&gt;were in fp when you got to 14. My Barb Shaman (Kalara on the Veeshan server)<br/>
&gt;got her SoW spell at lvl 9 and ever since then I&#39;ve essentially been a SoW<br/>
&gt;whore (lol might be a bit crude, but apt). The big difference now that i&#39;m<br/>
&gt;lvl 21 is that no one pays me for the SoW. They just come up to me (and<br/>
&gt;pretty soon you&#39;ll know what I mean...they&#39;ll come up, sort of stand there<br/>
&gt;and before they can ask for the SoW I am already mid-spell to just get them<br/>
&gt;to go away). They literally assume that it is for free, say thanks and walk<br/>
&gt;away. Drives me nuts when they do it right after I&#39;ve just fought a mob, am<br/>
&gt;at half-life, oom and my party is the same or worse. That&#39;s usually the only<br/>
&gt;time that I&#39;ll turn them down.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>as a bard, our little thing to be begged for is corpse loc. thing is, unlike<br/>
just standing there and casting, we have to 1) wait for the (usually)whiner<br/>
to eventually get to us or run around while we try to find them. 2) have<br/>
them DEMAND that we protect them (never mind that everything is kos to them,<br/>
and they&#39;re lev 5 in a 16 dungeon with not armor (or something like that. 3)<br/>
go hunting for their body (and finally figure out that there are two corpses<br/>
in the zone (at least) and so you have to figure out which direction to<br/>
actually go. 4) HAVE to sit there while they loot 5) escort them back to<br/>
safety (since we&#39;ve already bent over backwards, how dare we say no, now)<br/>
and 6)get no thanks, no reimbursement for the time/effort/stress - even<br/>
though they said they would pay.<br/>
<br/>
a load of crap. i was getting harassed for it a long time before i got the<br/>
song. when i ask people, i go - can i buy a sow/breeze off of you so i can<br/>
run to town/practise skills. i don&#39;t just demand it and i always pay. i try<br/>
to give 1pp as that&#39;s usually more than i can afford. i try to give total<br/>
and utter appreciation (and try to make them smile too) for anyone who helps<br/>
me. just like i&#39;m perfectly willing to go cure a zone of disease *G* <br/>
<br/>
anyways...slight tangent *Grins* <br/>
<br/>
i was playing my cleric last night - just hit lev 15 *beams* that would be 5<br/>
levels in 3 days of my playing, 15 levels in 3 days of eq reckonning. i&#39;m<br/>
NOT a powerleveler or even a super twink. by my figuring, all my gear i<br/>
would be able to buy myself by now. but just goes to show you the power of a<br/>
damn good group. i was so lucky - i got great groups 4 out of 5 times. and<br/>
the bad group just wouldn&#39;t share loot. <br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m just so happy i thought i would share it with you. *grins*<br/>
<br/>
oh yeah - being a de, and loosing my lev b/c of this....how does one up your<br/>
faction with druids?<br/>
