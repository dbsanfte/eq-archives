<div id="ygrps-yiv-884942763">How about a topic once a week we can talk about?  Something like <br/>
grouping, beggers *shivers at them* and how to deal with them.<br/>
<br/>
Heck I got to level 14 with my druid yesterday, walked into Freeport<br/>
to get my spells out of the bank.  And guess what, I had folks calling<br/>
out for SOWS.  And one guy told me that he would wait for me to get my<br/>
spells at the bank so I could bind him.  I got 8pp out of that one.  But<br/>
still, Man I never seen stuff like that before.  <br/>
