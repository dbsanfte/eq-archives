<div id="ygrps-yiv-497265824">Hi, Melissa, and welcome to our &#39;sisterhood&#39;. =) We&#39;re trying to firm up a date for an all-women<br/>
meeting that I am hosting on Quellios, during the first week in August.  Please let me know what<br/>
days are good for you, if you&#39;re interested in attending.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, ladies, I&#39;m moving to MD tomorrow via cross-country truck *groans* so I will be<br/>
out of contact for a WHOLE WEEK. *sniffles*But I hope to have lots to read when I get my computer<br/>
set back up. (not so subtle hint) This is an interesting move for me because I&#39;ve quit my job and<br/>
left my significant other at the same time, so bear with me and my &quot;growing pains&quot; as I move back<br/>
in with my parents to go back to college full-time (me and my two kids).  Hope no one out there<br/>
can relate, but I&#39;m sure some of you can.  Anyway, good luck in your hunts, your friends, and your<br/>
fate, and I will see you all in about a week!<br/>
<br/>
Sara, Povar<br/>
Valdaya, Rallos Zek<br/>
