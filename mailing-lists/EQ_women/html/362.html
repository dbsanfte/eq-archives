<div id="ygrps-yiv-1303069842">Hey everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I recently got 36th level with my enchanter on Brell Serelis.  I&#39;m a<br/>
little in shock in I&#39;m only now starting to comprehend that I&#39;ve been<br/>
power leveling like crazy.  I think it&#39;s time for me to back off a bit,<br/>
because I&#39;ve been just way to into this character.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m currently doing jewelry on Brell and I&#39;m the only jeweler who can<br/>
make the coveted Platinum Ruby Veil (+7 wis +7 str) and Platinum Sapphire<br/>
Necklace (+7 int +7 str).  I never though I&#39;d be in that kind of position<br/>
on a server it&#39;s kind of weird.  It won&#39;t last for long, but for now, I&#39;m<br/>
the best jewler on the server.<br/>
<br/>
The guild is fairly slow.  We have probably 6 regular players I&#39;d say<br/>
(people who log in on a daily basis).  We have a few other more infrequent<br/>
members.  There is a wide range in the guild in terms of levels it seems.<br/>
I&#39;d like to encourage anyone interested in exploring things on a new<br/>
server to consider trying Brell.  Now that the server has been up for<br/>
almost two months it seems to have stabalized a bit.  The newbie zones<br/>
aren&#39;t as over hunted as they were.  Because there are less people on<br/>
brell, the hunting areas in general don&#39;t seem as camped.<br/>
<br/>
I plan on starting a new character on Brell soon, a ranger or bard I<br/>
suspect.  I&#39;m very tempted to make a ranger because I acquired a Gigantic<br/>
Zweihander in a trade (great 2-handed slashing weapon).  I really like the<br/>
spell-songs of bards as well though.  I see this character as being for<br/>
mainly grouping.<br/>
<br/>
I hope everyone is having fun playing!<br/>
