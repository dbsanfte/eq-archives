<div id="ygrps-yiv-987248609">I am Rosalind<br/>
<br/>
I have a level 31 Druid named Soril on Tunare.<br/>
<br/>
She just left her guild and joined a new one.  I was leader of the guild I <br/>
left but got tired of the crap.  hehehe.<br/>
<br/>
Knew it was time to leave when my husband asked me if I had a good time <br/>
playing and I said no.<br/>
<br/>
Last night was a bad Norrath night.  NO groups to be found.  Not in FM or <br/>
Cazic Thule.<br/>
<br/>
It was so annoying.<br/>
<br/>
I am only a bubble away from 32.  I&#39;m hoping to get it by the weekend.  I <br/>
have to go to NH for the weekend so I&#39;m not looking forward to a weekend of <br/>
no EQ.<br/>
<br/>
I recently got my husband Re-Addicted.  WHY?? lol.  Now I NEVER get to play <br/>
=(<br/>
<br/>
