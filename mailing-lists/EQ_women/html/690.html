<div id="ygrps-yiv-666828647">OOh OOOh... okay, I made a fixer on Rubi-Ka 2 but was surprised there were<br/>
never any other players on.  She&#39;s only 2 and I&#39;m sure I screwed everything up<br/>
so I&#39;ll probably restart her.  Clan, name Iceiallana (surprise there :-).  I<br/>
tried a Doctor on Rubi-Ka 1 last night, Omni-Tek Nano-human thingy.  Died in<br/>
my first mission but still figuring it out (think I got the program thingies<br/>
down, but I right clicked something in my inventory by accident and it went<br/>
away so I&#39;ll probably restart her too.  Her name is Caedusia (favorite cleric<br/>
name).  <br/>
<br/>
So those were my guesses based on EQ.  I played a tanking druid, much to the<br/>
amusement of all my friends :-)  I did love ranger when I started one, but<br/>
hated the exp. penalty.  Enjoy cleric and bard.  I really like the speed and<br/>
healing buffs, but I get bored if I just do the sit/med thing while the tanks<br/>
are having all the fun pulling. <br/>
<br/>
Suggestions?  From reading the boards I thought eventually I&#39;d play a<br/>
meta-nanophysicist neutral.  Looks like that will be a total bitch to play,<br/>
though, but what great RP :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m in Anarchy Online now and was in the beta.  Yes you really can do stuff<br/>
in an hour.  But - grouping probably isn&#39;t it, solo missions are great for<br/>
that time frame.  You also lose &quot;chat&quot; in solo missions at level 6 - and it<br/>
makes for a very lonely time after (high player turnover rate now too).<br/>
<br/>
I do like it though.   I&#39;m mainly on first dimension now since the second is<br/>
sooo empty during the day when I play.  Let me know who you are I&#39;ll send<br/>
you a tell ;0  And if you describe your playstyle I can give you a list of<br/>
classes to fit.<br/>

  Wow, I loved Brell.  If my characters havent&#39; been axed I still have some<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
  I promised my son when he turned 13 he could play EQ so he set up his<br/>
account last night.  He has a friend on Xev so I&#39;ll reactivate my acct. to<br/>
play with him (gotta stay in the loop with my teen).  But I WILL NOT GET<br/>
READDICTED!  Actually, my life is very full now and I don&#39;t think I have<br/>
time to get readdicted.  It&#39;s what I&#39;ll do when I have custody (yeah,<br/>
well... that&#39;s another story) and we want to play together.<br/>
<br/>
  Trying Anarchy Online too, as long as I&#39;m at it - see what it&#39;s like.  I<br/>
hear you can actually have a productive play session in only an hour so it<br/>
may work out better for me.<br/>
<br/>
  Gonna try enchanter... Luna, HELP!<br/>

    Well, I am a 44th Dark Elf Shadowknight on Brell Serilis.  I am one of<br/>
    Violent Harvest&#39;s three leaders.  In fact, all three of us are RL<br/>
females.<br/>
    My character is male, but that is only because I really enjoy playing<br/>
men.<br/>
    Don&#39;t know why, I just have more fun being an aggressive male figure,<br/>
    particularly an evil one like Khasirath.<br/>
<br/>
    I never saw the EQ Women Site, but would be interested in the URL if<br/>
someone<br/>
    has it...<br/>
<br/>
    So if any of your are on Brell, or stop by, send me a tell! I&#39;m hunting<br/>
    mostly in Velious right now, but will probably develop wanderlust soon.<br/>
<br/>
    Shadows guard thee,<br/>
