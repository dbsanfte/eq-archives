<b>Subject:</b> Getting into the raids <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-305718085">Luna, I noticed you organize the calendars for the FG, Dragon, and Plane<br/>
raids.  I have now hit my 40th season and am at the minimum level for<br/>
the FGs.  I am hoping within the next 3 weeks to be up to where I can<br/>
start doing more, but would dearly like to begin meeting and getting<br/>
involved so that when eligible I can be considered.<br/>
<br/>
What advice would you give for doing such.   From the outside it seems<br/>
the lists fill up quickly and it is necessary to either be in one of the<br/>
big guilds or be an under-represented class to get in (perhaps just fear<br/>
on my part).  While I have some friends who go, I&#39;d kind of like to get<br/>
myself in on my own (stubborn female pride, but I don&#39;t want to depend<br/>
on my man to take care of me nor do I want him to think I&#39;m only with<br/>
him because he can get me into raids).<br/>
<br/>
I found the board where the schedules are posted.  Do I just contact the<br/>
organizers and let them know I want to go?  Best to do that in tells<br/>
in-game?  Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Mithril Empire has a strong group now of 8 soldiers in the 40th<br/>
rank and above who  hunt together almost nightly.  Since I seem to be<br/>
the Guild&#39;s social director by default (not complaining, I think it&#39;s a<br/>
total rush to pull a bunch of people together and organize a dungeon<br/>
raid and clearly Druid is the prefect class for me as I can pick people<br/>
up to make sure everyone arrives), how would I go about, say, putting<br/>
together an ME based FG raid?  We would clearly need more players than<br/>
we.  And while Sylvanar has been, it would be nice to have other<br/>
veterans as well to guide us and show us the ropes (broad hint there<br/>
;-).  And I&#39;d like to include others who are just hitting the ranks as I<br/>
suspect my eagerness to try these areas is not unique.<br/>
