<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795945651">I did start a char on the Brell server so that I could join the guild<br/>
and play with you guys but my friends missed me on the Nife, so I&#39;ve<br/>
been playing there and don&#39;t have time to spend on more than one<br/>
character. :(<br/>
<br/>
I heard that there was going to be a quest so that characters could<br/>
change servers, but that it was going to be a long and involved quest<br/>
so that only the people who really want to change servers will actually<br/>
complete it. I&#39;m not sure how they are going to go about any conflict<br/>
of names that may occur. I heard that from now on, only one person<br/>
could have a name regardless of what server they are on so that name<br/>
conflict would not occur. I hope they impliment the quest soon, I got a<br/>
shaman I really like on a server I don&#39;t play on anymore. <br/>
