<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Guilds provide a &quot;family&quot; for playing.&nbsp; There 
are lots of guilds, some good and some bad.&nbsp; It all depends on what you 
want.&nbsp; A good guild, IMHO, has players who group together consistently, 
have a bit of horseplay in guildchat, and have a common goal </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">whether it be RolePlay, farming items for each 
other, exploring new dungeons, or trying new ways of conquering old 
places.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I would say the best way to choose a guild is to 
spend a lot of time playing in a group with people from that guild.&nbsp; As for 
when to join?&nbsp; I recommend being in the high teens at a minimum.&nbsp; Make 
sure you are sticking with this character.&nbsp; It takes about 1/10 the time to 
get from 1 to 20 as it does from 20 to 50 and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll EVER see 
60.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pick a character you like.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hint:&nbsp; if always being invited into raids is 
important to you, cleric, enchanter, monk, and after 51 rogue are the hot 
classes.&nbsp; Druids are great, but&nbsp;a dime a dozen so while there is 
always a druid or five on a raid, there&#39;s 50 to choose from while getting an 
enchanter is a high priority and very hard and no raid goes deep without at 
least 2 clerics (unless they have a necro and lots of cash for 
coffins).</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>Hello again,<br>I hope I am not being a pest, but I would 
  like some info on Guilds.<br>What exactly do they do?&nbsp; How do you find 
  out which one is right for<br>you?&nbsp; Should a newbie consider joining one, 
  or wait until higher level.<br>BTW, someone said they started playing this 
  game after their boyfriend<br>got them hooked.&nbsp; Well, My 15 year old son 
  is the one who got me<br>started!&nbsp; Pretty sad, huh? lol<br>Thanks for 
  your help,<br><br>--<br>Sandy-<br>ICQ- #9462081<br>AIM-
