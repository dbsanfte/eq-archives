<b>Subject:</b> Re: Wedding Invitation - Quellious Server <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882852637">I have a level 5 human cleric (Trisango) on Brel.  I don&#39;t play her often,<br/>
what with the wedding and all.  She and my partner are already married in this<br/>
story, though.  Uprooted from her home to follow her childhood sweetheart on a<br/>
ridiculous quest (he insisted he had to be a monk during his &quot;death&quot; on<br/>
Quellious) she is very lonely and hates Freeport and has fun aggravating her<br/>
spouse by flirthing with other men *grin*.  I like her a lot *smile*<br/>
<br/>
Can she join?<br/>

&gt; Hi Suzanne,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The server is Brell Serelis.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A brief update, my character Luna has reached 16th level on Brell.  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; pretty much given up on all my other characters to focus on her.  In part<br/>
&gt; this is so I can provide items cheap to my guildmates.  She is a Jewler<br/>
&gt; capable of making electrum and silver jewlery, and also a master smith.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll make items for the guild at cost.  I hope this will help everyone get<br/>
&gt; their characters jump started.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When the guild is official I will also try and organize newbie nights,<br/>
&gt; when we will hopefully be able to hunt together, make eachother patchwork,<br/>
&gt; etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Christina<br/>
