<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979238008">let&#39;s see...<br/>
<br/>
i play on e&#39;ci sever, though i&#39;ve been debating about leaving it as i&#39;m<br/>
tired of getting pressured to twink and keep up with everyone. i&#39;m against<br/>
twinking, though it&#39;s hard to refuse gifts ;)<br/>
<br/>
i have a 24/5, wood elf (she just lost it) bard called lynnara and i love<br/>
her to pieces - she&#39;s my baby. i&#39;ve kinda lost a little heart with her as i<br/>
created her to fight with my bf...but that&#39;s do. ne with and we have found<br/>
out that even as friends, we have a serious personality clash in-game. <br/>
<br/>
anyways...i digress ;)<br/>
<br/>
i also have a baby dark elf cleric. she&#39;s my latest toy and everyone insists<br/>
on bestowing gifts on her for some reason (might it be she looks like a<br/>
hooker?). she just hit lev 10 and is now less than a bub from 11 (gotta love<br/>
quests). <br/>
<br/>
i don&#39;t play eq for the quests, the faction (though i have to with a de now<br/>
=(  ), the items or even levels. everyone in my guild (lion&#39;s share) is up<br/>
in the 30s now, and i am just puttering along. hehe. i play for the social<br/>
aspect and it really is nice and relaxing then. <br/>
<br/>
my guild is not one for powerleveling, camping, or anything. if someone<br/>
wants help, and someone&#39;s willing to give it - cool. mostly, it&#39;s to harrass<br/>
each other and have a fun time.<br/>
<br/>
i have no best/worst moments other than i decided to practise safe fall and<br/>
leap from the top floor of the penthouse.......542 dmg with a grand total of<br/>
566 hp. *beams* i was so proud. good thing an avo wasn&#39;t on the ground<br/>
waiting for me. <br/>
<br/>
irl...i&#39;m a student for accountant and a clerk at a retail store. boring as<br/>
hell. *grins* i get paid to sit and tan, read, sew, write, sleep, etc ;) hehe. <br/>
<br/>
and i can&#39;t remember what else was supposed to be mentioned but hey - i<br/>
think i ramble quite nicely.<br/>
