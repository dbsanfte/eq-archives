That was a nice story and kind of neat and I certainly<br/>
hope things continue to work out for you as well as<br/>
they are now or even better.<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
You just never know what might happen I guess,I&#39;ve<br/>
heard about people who met their special someone on EQ<br/>
but your the first I&#39;ve actually met.<br/>
<br/>
:o)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hi I have a story about marrage and eq, My cleric<br/>
&gt; met an enchanter at lvl  17 while grouping in oasis,<br/>
&gt; we got talking and after a few nights realized we<br/>
&gt; had alot in common as real life ppl. We were married<br/>
&gt; in game  at the little dock in nro at sunset that<br/>
&gt; takes you to IC when we   <br/>
&gt; made lvl 20  and that was about a 1 1/2 ago. We<br/>
&gt; spent almost every night eather grped or we would<br/>
&gt; talk in game, after about a month we started talking<br/>
&gt; over the phone, slowly our friendship grew in the<br/>
&gt; real world. <br/>
&gt; The only problem was he was on the other side of the<br/>
&gt; US from me so it was limited to just talking on the<br/>
&gt; phone, the feelings for each other grew and we found<br/>
&gt; we had we had fell in love for real. we wanted to<br/>
&gt; meet  but at that time it wasnt a thing we could do.<br/>
&gt; we continued to talk daily on eq and on the phone<br/>
&gt; for about a year. We then started to talk using<br/>
&gt; netmeeting and did that for a few months. We started<br/>
&gt; both feeling<br/>
&gt; of wanting to be togeather very strongly. we then<br/>
&gt; started making plans for him to come down so we<br/>
&gt; could meet for real. This last July he spent 3 weeks<br/>
&gt; here wiht me. we had so much fun and both of us<br/>
&gt; realized how much we  loved being with each other.<br/>
&gt; We both realized how hard it was going to be for him<br/>
&gt; to go back home. We talked about him moving here.<br/>
&gt; At the end of aug he moved him self down here to<br/>
&gt; move in with me.<br/>
&gt; We are very happy togeather and cant imagine what it<br/>
&gt; would be to be wiht one an other now. He is a very<br/>
&gt; loving person and im very happy and feel very luck<br/>
&gt; to have found him. The odds of us meeting in game<br/>
&gt; are huge and the odds of us grping in the same grp<br/>
&gt; that night are even bigger. So we  feel it was<br/>
&gt; totally ment to be. <br/>
&gt; So see wonderful things can happen from playing a<br/>
&gt; game and ingame marrage.<br/>
&gt; so i guess that is my answer about getting married<br/>
&gt; in the game.<br/>

&gt; and those ppl are still very happy with there<br/>
&gt; partner in the game.<br/>

&gt; Hi!&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt; I sent a long post the other day and hoped on the<br/>
&gt; list today only to &lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt; realize that it had not made it to this list at all.<br/>
&gt; In fact, &lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt; apparently my last couple of posts didn&#39;t make it to<br/>
&gt; the list.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sometimes I can be so dumb . . . but I can&#39;t help<br/>
&gt; but wonder where I &lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt; sent the crazy things.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt; :o)&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, a little question for anyone who might think<br/>
&gt; about &lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt; answering . . .&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is there a level limit you need to be to get married<br/>
&gt; in EQ? What are &lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt; the advantages and or disadvantages of tying the EQ<br/>
&gt; knot?&lt;BR&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br/>
