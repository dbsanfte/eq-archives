<br/>
I&#39;ve been playing some nwn recently with a few friends on Friday <br/>
evenings and was wondering if there might be some interest in forming <br/>
an EQ group to meet on one evening a week and adventure together for <br/>
a while. We could start a set of new characters and bring them up as <br/>
a group. I would be willing to meet on whatever server and be <br/>
whatever class or race that was needed. We could form a little party <br/>
and help each other out. I thought it might be fun. Is there anyone <br/>
else who has any intrest in an idea like this.<br/>
<br/>
If so let&#39;s discuss the details.<br/>
<br/>
