<div id="ygrps-yiv-1115019905">Yes we have seperate accounts. At first we didnt , but i stay at home <br/>
with my daughter and he works. So i would play in the dy and he would <br/>
play at night. Now we just play together. I also think its a lot <br/>
easier. you don&#39;t have to look for a group, and talking is a lot <br/>
easier than typing when your in trouble. But yes there are times when <br/>
we get mad at each other over something in game , but we dont take it <br/>
to seriously. He plays more than i do but if he starts to get to far <br/>
ahead he lets me take all the exp. for awhile<br/>
   I also know couples who can&#39;t stand to play together. Mostly <br/>
because when they play its an escape. We wanted to play together so we <br/>
could ahve a common interest . I think i&#39;m ranting now so i&#39;ll shut up <br/>
 ;P  Hope to hear from more of you soon.</div>
