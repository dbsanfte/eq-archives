<br/>
Hey, I&#39;m just curious as to what are the best and<br/>
worst classes and races to play in EQ? Your personal<br/>
favorites. As a relative newcomer to the game I would<br/>
be especially interested in what some of you who have<br/>
been playing the game for a while think on that topic<br/>
as I&#39;m trying to decide on creating another character<br/>
and cant make up my mind.<br/>
<br/>
My principal 20th lvl character is Wood Elf Ranger<br/>
I also have a lvl one Iksar Shadow Knight but I&#39;ve<br/>
done nothing with them and may drop them.<br/>
Finally, I have a lvl 2 half elf bard. This toon was<br/>
actually made a long time ago when I first bought EQ<br/>
but could not get it to run properly. Oddly when I<br/>
finally did get it to work I found her still there as<br/>
first lvl. Anyway, any comments are appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs<br/>
