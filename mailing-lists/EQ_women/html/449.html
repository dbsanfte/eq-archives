<div id="ygrps-yiv-352990857">Is a woman using emotional deceit if she flirts with a 20 year old boy,<br/>
when she is 50, and doesn&#39;t tell him her age, allowing him to assume she<br/>
is around his age?<br/>

Is a woman using emotional deceit if she flirts with a boy, and doesn&#39;t<br/>
tell him her racial background, allowing him to assume she is white when<br/>
she is not?<br/>

Is a woman using emotional deceit if she flirts with a boy, and doesn&#39;t<br/>
send him a picture, so he&#39;ll know whether or not he&#39;d be attracted to her<br/>
in real life?<br/>
<br/>
Is a woman using emotional deceit, if she flirts with a boy, and allows<br/>
him to assume she&#39;s not married, when she is?<br/>
<br/>
What exactly must we disclose when we flirt with someone online before<br/>
we&#39;re being emotionally deceitful? Why do people get so worked up over<br/>
disclosing gender, in comparison with other qualities that define us?<br/>

&gt; My original rant wasn&#39;t so much about the fact that men play women, but<br/>

&gt; sexually suggestive relationships) without the honesty of who they really<br/>
&gt; are. Does that make more sense? It probably plays into the gender issues<br/>

&gt; Great site btw...refreshing to find. Thanks!<br/>

&gt; &gt; I found this article pretty neat.  It was based on a comprehensive survey<br/>
&gt; &gt; of men who play female characters, to see why they do it.<br/>
