<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880947670">Well, my son turned 13 and I promised he could play EQ.  I got Anarchy Online<br/>
as well, because I was so sick of EQ when I quit, but he wanted me to play<br/>
with him and being at that &quot;awkward adolescent&quot; age where mothers and sons<br/>
have a hard enough time finding things to talk about, seemed like I should.<br/>
<br/>
So I started my HE enchanter (never played enchanter past 7 and he wanted to<br/>
play Wood Elf Warrior) and eep, I got hooked all over again!!!!  She&#39;s 4 now<br/>
and I was having a blast mes&#39;ing cents, pulling pawns, and letting my pet kill<br/>
while I meditated *hurry up 35 so I can dump the stupid book*.<br/>
<br/>
Now I have to find all the EQ sites all over again because I threw absolutely<br/>
everything away.  Oh, but after 9 mos. of not playing, my level 54 druid was<br/>
still alive and well and virtually naked (on Brell) as I gave almost all her<br/>
good stuff away before quitting.  Oh, yeah, we&#39;re playing on Xev.  My son had<br/>
a friend in his Scout troup that plays there.  Know nothing about it yet other<br/>
than GFay is still a spam zone. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, played until 1 AM last night and beat myself up for it this morning,<br/>
but wasn&#39;t too sleepy and got my workout in and got to work on time so all&#39;s<br/>
well I hope.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, if anyone can figure out AO, it looks cool, but I don&#39;t really understand<br/>
the game yet.  Looking for web sites there as well.<br/>

this email group is alive after all. :-)<br/>
<br/>
my fiance and I both play on Veeshan. <br/>
I started out playing a druid on the Rathe, in July got her to about <br/>
level 11, and then decided that wasn&#39;t the profession for me.  We had <br/>
heard some good things about Veeshan, so we made the switch!<br/>
Having a wonderful time. Have met some very wonderful people, and had <br/>
the good fortune to join a guild, the Honorable Knights.<br/>
<br/>
He has a level 6 Barbarian Shaman called Tavvish, and my character is <br/>
a Level 7 (so close to 8 it is painful) High Elf Enchantress named <br/>
Nyndari.<br/>
<br/>
Send a tell and say hi if you are on!  *smile*<br/>
<br/>
We are currently in misty thicket, doing some adventuring.  I managed <br/>
to save a young halfling druid&#39;s life, and it turned out that it was <br/>
his alt, and he had a high level enchanter on hold, so I received a <br/>
rod of insidious glamour as a reward, I nearly died!<br/>
<br/>
p.s Enchanters Rock!!<br/>
p.p.s I am not addicted, I can stop playing anytime I want to,.... <br/>
um.. I just don&#39;t want to! *LOL*<br/>
Someone mentioned they didn&#39;t know how to get to the website? this is <br/>
the address:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EQ_women/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EQ_women/</a><br/>
