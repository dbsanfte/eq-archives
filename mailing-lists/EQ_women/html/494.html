 </span></blockquote>Well, my partner and I play wood elf rangers, and have played them steadily<br/>
together for over a year now.  We have a kind of Penn and Teller routine going,<br/>
and have given our characters quirks (he thinks he can fly or at least safe fall,<br/>
so he jumps off things alot, I always wince and announce to the zone, &#39;How many<br/>
times do I have to tell you rangers DON&#39;T FLY&#39; which always gets chuckles), I get<br/>
lost in dungeons and everyone indulges my slightly breathless and wide-eyed look<br/>
at life.  We&#39;re very efficient as a &#39;combat force,&#39; but alot of times we lose<br/>
track of fighting to trade oneliners. &lt;grin&gt;  We also toss insults at dark elves<br/>
(we tell them it&#39;s in character only, most are really wonderful) and oh, the fun<br/>
we&#39;ve been having with lizards.  And lots of them have been having fun back.<br/>
Mostly we like to point out the difference between succulent, tender, city-bred<br/>
high elves, and tough, stringy, hardworking wood elves.  One lizard even took<br/>
notes and confided that gnomes are wonderful hors d&#39;oeurves.<br/>
