<div id="ygrps-yiv-560001697">I was thinking of buying a pack myself, my husband and I play too.<br/>
And we fight all the time at who plays on the weekends.  I guess you<br/>
call the 1 888 for the code if you don&#39;t have it on the CD.<br/>

&gt; Hey there.... So, my mother (the one who has all the money in my house)<br/>
&gt; finally said I could order kunark the day it came out. I was amazingly<br/>
&gt; excited, since on Everlore they said they would be selling it into May.. so<br/>
&gt; I load up EQ, and the store button is GONE. Now tell me, is this an<br/>
&gt; AMAZINGLY stupid marketing tactic? Give them no way to order something, i.e.<br/>
&gt; giving them no way to PAY you?<br/>
&gt;     *Shakes head* it just seems incredibly odd to me.. So I went to<br/>
&gt; Wal-mart, and they has the new packs there, and I was wondering.. there was<br/>
&gt; only one CD inside. Do you call the 1 888 # for the kunark code then?<br/>
&gt; because I was going to give the actual EQ part of it (not kunark) to my<br/>
&gt; sister. I hope I can do that, or they had better get the store back.. *grr*<br/>
