&gt; I don&#39;t have a problem with twinking new characters as a way to more<br/>
&gt; quickly get them up to a level where they can interact with other existing<br/>
&gt; characters.  I&#39;ve personally just yesterday started one major twink.  We<br/>
&gt; always seem to have a shortage of clerics, so I created a dwarven cleric<br/>
&gt; and equipped it with my 36th level character&#39;s backup armor.  This means<br/>
&gt; several pieces of bronze (including chest and helmet), lizard cloak and<br/>
&gt; mantle, bear hide belt, and everything else banded.  And a mucking bit<br/>
&gt; 2handed blunt weapon called Midnight Mallet that I picked up at an auction<br/>
&gt; (11 damage, 44 delay, sometimes squashes 1st level monsters in one hit).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The dwarf&#39;s name is Staar. In the description area of the character I wrote<br/>
&gt; &quot;Twinkle twinkle little Staar, what a twinked-up Dwarf you are. Armored up<br/>
&gt; in shiny bronze -- that stuff&#39;s not from Orcish pawns!  - Windsong&quot;<br/>
