I thought we might also at some point try a women&#39;s guild on one of the new servers.  The basic idea would be to let anyone on this list who wants to, have the chance to all go to one new server to start characters to hunt and socialize together.  I figured I&#39;d wait a month or so before suggesting this, since I know a lot of us are very into characters we&#39;re playing now.  After a month, perhaps we&#39;ll all be ready for a change of pace!<br/>

&gt; It might be fun, actually, one of these days, for all of us to create 1st<br/>
&gt; level characters on one of the new servers and have a &quot;women only&quot; ingame<br/>
&gt; meeting....... :-p<br/>
