<b>Subject:</b> Re: [EQ_women] Crossdressing in Eq... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-31600017">I think the researcher is right on. <br/>
<br/>
I do think I&#39;m pretty good at detecting gender online, however by that I<br/>
don&#39;t mean I can tell if someone is a male or a female, it&#39;s more I can<br/>
tell whether I&#39;m confident about their gender. There are some women I&#39;ve<br/>
met in EQ who I am confident are women, and there are others who I&#39;m not<br/>
confident about but I don&#39;t really care so I&#39;m not going to challenge<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I have a few ideas why men tend to play women in these games:<br/>
  - it&#39;s novel, gamer society tends to be males playing males, if the<br/>
society was primarily females playing females more women might play for<br/>
the novelty, to differentiate themselves from their peers.<br/>
  - it&#39;s advantageous, numerous male players see themselves as getting<br/>
some kind of advantage from playing female characters<br/>
<br/>
A lot of more ideas are presented in the following article on<br/>

&gt; I know this issue has been covered before, but I recently read an <br/>
&gt; article by a student studying psychology (www.students.haverford.edu) <br/>
&gt; based on his own survey of players. He calculated that half the <br/>
&gt; female characters on EQ at any time are played  by males, but very <br/>
&gt; few women play male personae. This seems odd, but I have to say that <br/>
&gt; I have very little interest in playing male characters, and it seems <br/>
&gt; that I am far from alone in this. Is our researcher correct, do you <br/>
&gt; think?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As an aside, I wondered if I could tell which females were  male, and <br/>
&gt; I conclude that, on the whole, I can&#39;t, if they don&#39;t want me to. <br/>
&gt; Sure, there are boys who give the game away with abuse and bad <br/>
&gt; language (or am I just stereotyping boyish behaviour?) and a <br/>
&gt; proportion making their gender clear (the surname Crossdresser was a <br/>
&gt; giveaway,I though ;), but on the whole, I have no idea. To be honest, <br/>
&gt; the only ones I really assume to be women are those who keep going <br/>
&gt; afk to deal with domestic issues; more stereotyping?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just a few thoughts, if anyone is still there.....<br/>
