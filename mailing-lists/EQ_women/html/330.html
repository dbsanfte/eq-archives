<div id="ygrps-yiv-499375481">Greetings everyone! =)<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to introduce myself. I am Jax Elysium (or Jaxy) who<br/>
originated from Qeynos in the land of Karana, but recently have had a<br/>
change of heart and a sort of metamorphisis to an extremely sad and<br/>
lonely child of Innoruk on Vallon Zek.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t quite understand, but realize that sometimes the Gods dont&#39;<br/>
explain why or what they do when they play with their mortal children.<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping to find someone on this list who also serves the will of<br/>
the Dark Lord who would say Hi or something on Vallon Zek.<br/>
<br/>
Ooc:  otherwise I&#39;m a 29 year old newlywed! (got married July 1st) and<br/>
my husband and I met on meridian59 two years ago and are extremely<br/>
happy! Only problem is that we only have one computer, so we don&#39;t get<br/>
a chance to explore and play together =((<br/>
But we still watch each other play and we both love EQ!<br/>
<br/>
anyways just wanted to introduce myself to y&#39;all!!<br/>
<br/>
Jaxy (Jennifer)<br/>
