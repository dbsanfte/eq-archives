  <div><br></div><tt><br>I was a master smith and a grandmaster jewler, here is 
  some of the stuff<br>I&#39;ve learned.<br><br>Tailoring is a great starter skill, 
  it requires little investment to make<br>patchwork armor.&nbsp; However, if 
  you want to continue on to high end stuff<br>(reinforced leather, 10-slot 
  bags) it requires considerable time and money<br>investment.&nbsp; You can 
  make good newbie-level money doing tailoring in<br>greater 
  faydark.<br><br>Smithing requires about a 200pp investment to master (less if 
  you are<br>optimal).&nbsp; Smithing I found to be very rewarding early on in 
  my server&#39;s<br>life, there were lots of tanks who wanted armor.&nbsp; For 
  various reasons<br>though, it can get boring.&nbsp; To make small or large 
  armor you have to<br>travel a lot to get your molds and metals and such.&nbsp; 
  To make medium armor,<br>you can do it in freeport, where all the materials 
  are fairly available.<br>Smithing is quite enjoyable I found though eventually 
  it becomes tedious.<br>You can make good low level money smithing in freeport 
  or greater fay.<br>This will probably work best if you are level 20 or under 
  as you will be<br>able to hunt in the near vicinity to freeport where people 
  who will want<br>your wares will hang out.<br><br>Oh I almost forgot, smiths 
  can make weapons now.&nbsp; They couldn&#39;t when I<br>smithed.&nbsp; I don&#39;t get 
  the impression that forged weapons are a<br>very competitive business 
  though.<br><br>Baking and brewing are both more &#39;fun&#39; trades.&nbsp; All the 
  skilled bakers and<br>brewers I know are druids, which makes sense because 
  getting your goods<br>requires a lot of travel.&nbsp; These two skills require 
  little investment to<br>start, but a lot of work and travel to master.&nbsp; 
  These are nice because you<br>can give people alcohol or food, I still 
  remember with joy the day my<br>druid friend gave me chocolate! You won&#39;t make 
  money doing this.<br><br>Jewlery is one of the few trades you can make serious 
  money in but it is<br>also fairly competitive.&nbsp; In order to make money in 
  jewelcraft you usually<br>need a sizible investment.&nbsp; Maxing your 
  jewelcraft to 200 will cost<br>several thousand plat.&nbsp; On the other hand, 
  50pp will get you able to make<br>some jewelry.&nbsp; If you are not an 
  enchanter you will have to pay to get<br>your metal bars enchanted which is a 
  pain.&nbsp; If you have a close enchanter<br>friend you could do ok though 
  =)<br><br>Alchemy is shaman only and you have to be fairly high level to do 
  it.<br>Shrink and SOW potions are pretty cool though, but they require a 
  sizible<br>investment (thus the high level).<br><br>Meow
