<b>Subject:</b> Re: fun after 40--how you tell who the kids are <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-544881022">It&#39;s great to know that older people enjoy the game as well as I do, and all in<br/>
all i dont always feel young.  I am 29 (soon to be 29 in july) single mom of a<br/>
very energetic seven year old.  Right now my gaming time is short i have to<br/>
play at my moms because my computer needs some upgrading but i spend as much<br/>
time as i can.  At first i wasnt all that happy with the world i was a true<br/>
diehard MUDer for all of you who know bout the mud world, its a text based<br/>
rpg.  My current love got me into the game i bought it for Him for this<br/>
birthday back in May so that we could play together.  As far as romance on EQ<br/>
it is easy to tell they are Loves and we prolly soon will plan a wedding but<br/>
thats bout as far as it goes, we as of yet to play out anything more than<br/>
hugging or kissing.  (really dont see the need)  As far as jealousy it tends to<br/>
work out well he seems to get a laugh when someone is hitting on me.  Mayhaps<br/>
we are one of the few bout our characters just to together very well.  As far<br/>
as twinking goes i dont agree with it, i how ever am not above reciveing gifts,<br/>
in the game i do not ask for things of people, i may ask were someone got an<br/>
item that i see i like to store back for when i will be able to get it myself<br/>
but i never ask them to get it for me nor do i ask for anything for free.<br/>
*Smiles* I remember the first time my Mate and I went into the dwarven lands a<br/>
little dwarf came up out of no where and gave me a little doll i thought that<br/>
was just the sweetest thing, before i could even thank Him he ran off and sent<br/>
me a tell saying You can have it its a gift :o) i still carry the little doll<br/>
around with me, my boy friend laughs at me when i talk about my dollie.  Anyway<br/>
now that i have become long winded good gaming to You all and hope to meet up<br/>
with some of you in the game.<br/>

&gt; As I said before, I am probably one of the oldest at 54 women (55 in<br/>
&gt; September) on EQ.  I know of one other on Fennin Ro who is older than I am<br/>
&gt; and a women in RL.  Mature people have a love of gaming, too.  I get a lot<br/>
&gt; of pleasure from playing any game, puzzle, or challenge.  I work off<br/>
&gt; aggression with my slashing and hacking, get satisfaction in achieving<br/>
&gt; small goals like acquiring items, making skill or experience levels and in<br/>
&gt; discovering and exploring the EQ environment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Us old geezers have the time and the patience (and the money) for many<br/>
&gt; on-line activities, as well as having highly developed computer-related<br/>
&gt; skills.  I have found that women have done very well in information<br/>
&gt; management/computer science careers and I have been involved since the<br/>
&gt; middle 1960&#39;s with large corporations on the west and east coasts.<br/>
&gt; I am retired now and only do a little consulting to keep my skills and<br/>
&gt; marketability up.  This leaves me much time for day playing and all night<br/>
&gt; sessions, if I want.  I am a borderline compulsive when I play this game.<br/>
&gt;  It is so immersive and addicting.  When a good group forms, I like to stay<br/>
&gt; together as long as I can for the session and the companionship.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I played Realm before EQ.  But a family member was a beta tester for EQ and<br/>
&gt; showed it to me last year.  So I was on the distribution list for the<br/>
&gt; production software by New Years of this year and started playing the first<br/>
&gt; day of production.  I have found that my knowledge of the game is only now<br/>
&gt; beginning to surpass the beta testers and I am considering volunteering for<br/>
&gt; guide duty.  I think older women would make excellent guides.  If anything,<br/>
&gt; age teaches patience, wit, skin thickening and a little teaching skills,<br/>
&gt; which I think are essential attributes for a good guide.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I can always spot the youngest players.  They are the ones always shouting<br/>
&gt; for help with corpse retrieval, free food, free items, screaming &#39;gimme,<br/>
&gt; gimme, gimme&#39;.  They can&#39;t seem to stand still.......ever.  They never<br/>
&gt; bother with Sense Heading skill development, never learned the value of<br/>
&gt; saving up their coins for something they want, and seem very self-centered<br/>
&gt; in every thing they do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, here is a new mail list thread idea:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You can always spot the kids when they<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) Beg for favors all over the zone<br/>
&gt; 2) twink<br/>
&gt; 3) solo power game<br/>
&gt; 4) are on most people&#39;s ignore list<br/>
&gt; 5) bully other players with their own greediness<br/>
&gt; 6) brag too much about their race, class, level, wealth or items<br/>
&gt; 7) answer every question about game secrets with shouts across the zone to<br/>
&gt; show off what they know (and don&#39;t know, hehe)<br/>
&gt; 8) chatter incessantly about inanities<br/>
&gt; 9) complain the loudest about others not helping them<br/>
&gt; 10) ..................[you fill in your favorite here]<br/>

&gt; &gt;By the way, regarding the subject of &quot;older women&quot; playing EQ, I bet I am<br/>
&gt; &gt;one of oldest.  I will be 49 next month.  Not that it matters.   Maybe it<br/>
&gt; &gt;will give some of you young gals hope that there IS fun after 40.  Boy, is<br/>
&gt; &gt;there ever fun after 40.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s great!  You&#39;re certainly on the tip of the demographic curve for<br/>
&gt; computer games.  How did you happen to start playing Everquest?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; By the way, I&#39;m 35.  My mother is over 60, and she plays some computer<br/>
&gt; games.  She has a Macintosh, though, so I can&#39;t introduce her to Everquest.<br/>
