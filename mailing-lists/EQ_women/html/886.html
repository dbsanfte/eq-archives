<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202820970">I had the same experience.  I dated somebody 10 years<br/>
older than myself and after a short while into our<br/>
relationship, it caused problems.  I thought he was<br/>
the perfect person, and he was, however...  I was<br/>
young, just a few years out of High School and had<br/>
differant dreams and ambitions.  He had already<br/>
experienced those things 10 years earlier.  It became<br/>
a big problem because he wanted to move forward, have<br/>
kids, get a house, and everything.  Where as I wanted<br/>
to play, party, and generally be a 20 year old.  I<br/>
have seen some relationships work with that big of an<br/>
age gap, however, it is very very tough.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Ok, to keep with this same line of thought ~ of<br/>
&gt; &quot;hooking up&quot; on EQ.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am 43 and have been playing EQ for about a year.<br/>
&gt; A friend got me<br/>
&gt; &gt; into the game, and I played it just as a game. I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t think I<br/>
&gt; &gt; realized how much I looked forward to running into<br/>
&gt; certain<br/>
&gt; &gt; friends/characters in the game. I have made what I<br/>
&gt; feel to be many<br/>
&gt; &gt; good friendships. Ok to the question. One friend<br/>
&gt; that I felt very<br/>
&gt; &gt; close to became closer. We talked on the phone and<br/>
&gt; kept in touch<br/>
&gt; &gt; almost everyday. I am divorced and single and he<br/>
&gt; is single. He came<br/>
&gt; &gt; to Arizona to visit me and sure one thing led to<br/>
&gt; another and the<br/>
&gt; &gt; rest is history. We are both wildly happy and in<br/>
&gt; love, want to spend<br/>
&gt; &gt; the rest of our lives together and fade into the<br/>
&gt; sunset happily ever<br/>
&gt; &gt; after. Here is my dilema ~ like I said I am 43, a<br/>
&gt; young 43 (and its<br/>
&gt; &gt; not me saying that) my picture is on my profile ~<br/>
&gt; he is 20, a very<br/>
&gt; &gt; mature, responsible 20 but none the less 20. What<br/>
&gt; in the hell do I<br/>
&gt; &gt; do??? Most of me wants to say screw what others<br/>
&gt; might think and just<br/>
&gt; &gt; be happy with him, but the rest of me says leave<br/>
&gt; him to live his<br/>
&gt; &gt; life. When I discuss that with him he just says<br/>
&gt; stop trying to find<br/>
&gt; &gt; excuses why we can&#39;t be together and just be<br/>
&gt; happy. How can I argue<br/>
&gt; &gt; with that??? Some advice ladies?? please<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
