<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029668801">I&#39;ve kinda cheated and got one of my girlfriends from another RPG involved<br/>
in this one, so I&#39;ve pretty much always grouped with other women. =)  In<br/>
fact, I know three that I play with semi-regularly.  I got into RPG&#39;s<br/>
because the guys at work wanted me to play with them since I admitted I<br/>
missed AD&D groups.  So now they&#39;ve gone on to other things and I am hooked.<br/>
&lt;grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I play a ranger, so I can&#39;t help you, Piqa, but there are some really great<br/>
websites out there that can.  I watch EQForge, personally, but maybe one of<br/>
our sisters here could recommend a site for paladins?<br/>
<br/>
Welcome, Piqa, and well met, Tekire and Karranza!<br/>
