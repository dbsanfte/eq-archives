<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088891257">I&#39;ve been playing EQ for a year and a half now, and one thing that I&#39;ve come to believe is that the quality of guilds has definitely gone down hill. I&#39;ve always thought of a guild as a group of friends, people that want to play together, or chat or hang out. Just recently, I was on as a newbie character I have and someone I didn&#39;t know just walked up to her and invited her into a guild. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to join a small guild that everyone is friendly, that people get together for fun once in a while, no matter what their levels. <br/>
<br/>
So what do you all think, have guilds changed from what they once were?<br/>
