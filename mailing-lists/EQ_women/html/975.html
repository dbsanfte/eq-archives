<div id="ygrps-yiv-574972475">Salutations &quot;Dr. Mom&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
OK are you a doctor like an MD or a PhD. College was<br/>
something I had trouble with as well. OK, I did get a<br/>
bachlors but I changed majors four or five times and<br/>
it took forever. Then I worked on my masters but I<br/>
kind of bounced back and fourth on that and never<br/>
finished it. I did end up with enough credit for a PhD<br/>
though plus some if I had ever stayed on one thing<br/>
long enough.<br/>
<br/>
On the up side I have a very interesting education and<br/>
I have studied such things as Cinema, Biomedical<br/>
Engineering, Medieval Literature, Theology, and<br/>
Chemistry.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m way higher than anyone I know in RL who plays.<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m the only real addict. A couple are gaining<br/>
on me though.<br/>
<br/>
I like you already. Too bad you aren&#39;t on the Xegony<br/>
server. I would send you tells and bug you.<br/>
<br/>
