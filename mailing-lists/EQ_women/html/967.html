<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005599015">Salutations!<br/>
<br/>
My first character was my ranger but after I while I<br/>
got a bit tired of playing her because I don&#39;t like to<br/>
solo that much and it seemed like she was always<br/>
soloing. That&#39;s why I made Melwen. Melwen never had to<br/>
solo and spent 61 levels in duo or larger group mode.<br/>
I like playing her a lot. Recently, though I am<br/>
starting to go back to playing my ranger and I&#39;m<br/>
having fun with her as well. For me the others are<br/>
kind of fill in characters and the druid was mostly<br/>
leveled by a friend who quit the game and gave me her<br/>
account so I have not played them a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I have actually been in this list twice before but I<br/>
tend to come and go. I don&#39;t have a very long<br/>
attention span sometimes and I&#39;m not very patient.<br/>
It&#39;s part of the reason I have a terrible time with<br/>
Quests and none of my toons have an epic.<br/>
<br/>
I do like to talk though. Some people say that I talk<br/>
way to much, but I can&#39;t help it. And I have some<br/>
little problems that sometimes keeps me from playing<br/>
for a while or answering e-mail etc so that kind of<br/>
messes things up too, but I&#39;m always glad to be able<br/>
to face another day.<br/>
<br/>
As you see I&#39;m rambling already so I&#39;ll close for me.<br/>
<br/>
/Hugs<br/>
