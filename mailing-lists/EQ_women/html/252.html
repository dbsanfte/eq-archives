&gt;<br/>
&gt;As I mentioned a while before, I thought it would be a good idea for us to<br/>
&gt;form an guild on a new server at some point.  The purpose of forming the<br/>
&gt;guild would be to allow those of us who wish to to play with their EQ<br/>
&gt;sisters.  The purpose in forming it on a new server would be so no one<br/>
&gt;would be directly advantaged by already having characters and contacts on<br/>
&gt;their current server which they could carry over to this new server.  Here<br/>
&gt;are some further ideas I have about how this guild might operate.  Please<br/>
&gt;give me feedback!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Participation<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;First of all, I&#39;d like to stress that I&#39;d see participation in this guild<br/>
&gt;as voluntary.  I&#39;d also like to stress that I wouldn&#39;t be asking anyone to<br/>
&gt;drop their existing characters to play in this guild.  Many of us already<br/>
&gt;have really good characters in really good environments, and we don&#39;t want<br/>
&gt;to give this up!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To facilitate participation in this guild, I&#39;d probably thus suggest two<br/>
&gt;unofficial times each week which would be guild play times.  While you can<br/>
&gt;play any time, you&#39;d be encouraged to try and play during guild times.<br/>
&gt;This would ensure a reasonable number of us playing at those times, so we<br/>
&gt;can group.  Example guild times might be Wednesday evening, and Saturday<br/>
&gt;morning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Roleplaying Background:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ever good guild should have a nice robust role playing background, that<br/>
&gt;those of us who wish to roleplay can work into our characters.  One such<br/>
&gt;background might be as follows:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Erollisi Marr is the goddess of love.  Here is her description from the<br/>
&gt;player manual: Followers of Erollisi Marr cling to the belief that love<br/>
&gt;conquers all. It should be pointed out that while love is a generally<br/>
&gt;peaceful concept, Erollisi worshippers are not pacifists. They would like<br/>
&gt;to live in a world where everyone loves everyone else and violence does<br/>
&gt;not exist but they are not naive enough to think that Norrath is that<br/>
&gt;world. They have passionate loves of people, places and ideas and are more<br/>
&gt;than willing to fight and die to preserve those things. The dream of every<br/>
&gt;follower of Erollisi is to die in selfless defense of someone or something<br/>
&gt;they love. Many Paladins hear the true calling of their hearts and<br/>
&gt;follow Erollisi Marr.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;From my own playing I think Erollisi bears a great resemblence to Artemis<br/>
&gt;the greek goddess of the hunt.  Evidence to this includes the Sisters of<br/>
&gt;Erollisi, a warrior-cult of women who live in the Ocean of Tears.  These<br/>
&gt;chaste (except when they stray) warrior women seem to me to be a great<br/>
&gt;basis for a guild.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would like to see us take &quot;Sisters of Erollisi&quot; as our guild name.  This<br/>
&gt;would afford us the great opportunity to use the island of Erollisi in the<br/>
&gt;ocean of tears as our guild home.  Few guilds can have a whole island<br/>
&gt;to themselves.  It would also give our guild a strong tangible connection<br/>
&gt;to the game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would like to allow males to be in the guild (when sponsored by a female<br/>
&gt;member) and suggest incorporating them (from a roleplaying perspective) as<br/>
&gt;&quot;Warders&quot; (I&#39;m stealing the concept from Robert Jordan&#39;s Wheel of Time<br/>
&gt;series).  A Warder would be a male who pledges his life to the protection<br/>
&gt;of a Sister of Erollisi.  Each sister could have only one warder.  A<br/>
&gt;Warder would most obviously be a Paladin, but could be of any class.  An<br/>
&gt;obvious line of roleplaying courtship might involve a male courting a<br/>
&gt;Sister to first become her Warder, and perhaps even one day her husband.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In terms of races/classes allowed, I would like to have no restrictions on<br/>
&gt;that.  We all have different playing interests.  Obviously a Shadow Knight<br/>
&gt;or Necromancer doesn&#39;t fit in very well with the Sisters of Erollisi.<br/>
&gt;With proper thought, and a well crafted story, it could be done.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Rules:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I like keeping rules to a minimum.  The main reason for this is so no one<br/>
&gt;will feel they don&#39;t want to be a part of the guild, because it has<br/>
&gt;restrictive rules.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The only rule I can think of is that female players should play female<br/>
&gt;characters, and male players should play male characters.  This will allow<br/>
&gt;us to more easily recognize other women in the guild.  Even this rule I&#39;d<br/>
&gt;be willing to bend if someone had a good reason they couldn&#39;t abide by<br/>
&gt;this rule.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Can anyone think of any other obvious, required, rules?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Men in the guild:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think men should be allowed in the guild, but they should be sponsored<br/>
&gt;by a female guild member.  While I think a truly women-only guild would be<br/>
&gt;cool, it seems unnecessarily restrictive (there are nice guys out there<br/>
&gt;after all).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hierarchy:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Guild hierarchy can be a fun thing, but it can also be annoying.  I&#39;d like<br/>
&gt;to see hierarchy so those of us who enjoy it can take part.  I&#39;d also like<br/>
&gt;those of us who aren&#39;t interested in hierarchy to be able to play without<br/>
&gt;it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The only actual benefits from being higher in the hierarchy, as I see it,<br/>
&gt;should be from a role playing perspective.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here is an example hierarchy we might use:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sister<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is the introductary level at which all Sisters of Erollisi would be.<br/>
&gt;This afford one the right to vote and participate in guild events.  All<br/>
&gt;Sisters have the responsility to aid other Sisters in need.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Acolyte<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One becomes an Acolyte of Erollisi by achieving at least level 15, and<br/>
&gt;then completing a quest as dictated by a Priestess.  An Acolyte has the<br/>
&gt;responsibility to aid, advise, and watch over all Sisters.  Early on the<br/>
&gt;level requirements might be restricted.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Priestess<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One becomes a Priestess of Erollisi by achieving at least level 25, and<br/>
&gt;the completing a quest as dictated by the Hand of Erollisi.  Implicit in<br/>
&gt;being offered the rank of Priestess is a history of good guild conduct.<br/>
&gt;A Priestess has the responsibility to organize guild events and hunts.  A<br/>
&gt;Priestess can be of any class.  Early on the level requirements might be<br/>
&gt;restricted.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hand of Erollisi<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The Hand of Erollisi is the leader of the Sisters of Erollisi.  It is her<br/>
&gt;responsibility to organize guild meetings, induct new members, and oversee<br/>
&gt;any guild issues.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Warder<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Male members of the guild would all inducted warders.  They would be sworn<br/>
&gt;to protect an indivual Sister of Erollisi.  They would not have any voting<br/>
&gt;power.  Warders would gain title as the sisters they protect gain title.<br/>
&gt;Warders could not vote, but his valued opinion would be rightly<br/>
&gt;considered by the Sister he is sworn to protect.<br/>
&gt;     Sister&#39;s Rank      Warder&#39;s Rank<br/>
&gt;     Sister             Warder<br/>
&gt;     Accolyte           Knight<br/>
&gt;     Priestess          Guardian<br/>
&gt;     Hand of Erollisi   Sword of Erollisi<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Dues:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Many guilds have dues.  I don&#39;t really see the need for them.  Anyone have<br/>
&gt;any good reasons why Dues should be part of this guild?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Comments?<br/>
