<b>Subject:</b> Greetings all! I am a new recruit. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032913039">Hi! I thought I would take this opportunity to introduce myself. I <br/>
have characters on 4 servers, so the list may be a little long. ^_^ <br/>
I&#39;ll list them in the order I play the most. <br/>
<br/>
~~Sullon Zek~~ MIKIKY, level 8 (for now), warrior, Iksar, Cazic-<br/>
Thule. ~~Tunare~~ PINIDASY, level 8, rogue, Half-elf, Bristlebane. <br/>
~~The Tribunal~~ ZINFANDEL, level 42, druid, Wood-elf, Tunare. <br/>
MINAKOS, level 17, shadow knight, Iksar, Cazic-Thule. SETSUNA, level <br/>
21, warrior, Barbarian, Agnostic. SAUMON, level 17, cleric, <br/>
Bristlebane. YANWENIE, level 7, enchanter, High-elf. VILYANAU, level <br/>
8, wizard, Sollosek Ro. POMME, level 9, monk, human. ~~Test Server~~ <br/>
BUMKINS, level 3, warrior, gnome. Troll, shaman.<br/>
<br/>
*whew* Well that&#39;s the list. I forgot some info on some characters <br/>
since I hardly ever play them. I also only play girls. The guy models <br/>
are so ugly and I&#39;m a girl anyway so it makes sense! ^_^ <br/>
<br/>
I look forward to being an active member of this group!<br/>
<br/>
