<div id="ygrps-yiv-1544863726">Hello,<br/>
I thank all of you for your warm reception of me to your list.  I am <br/>
currently playing way to many characters *smile*.  I play mostly on The Rathe <br/>
server, but have started a druid on Brell. I will be joining the Sisterhood <br/>
with her as soon as im old enough to travel to Freeport.  I am determined to <br/>
stay near Kelethin until I reach 9th level.  I must get the ability to <br/>
meditate before traveling far (I cant stand not having it, makes me insane).  <br/>
So since it so close to a spell level I figure I mine as well do that as well <br/>
before leaving.<br/>
I was curious to know if the possibility of taking this guild to multiple <br/>
servers was ever considered.  I know that when my Husband started his <br/>
guild... he was told that once it was approved that he was welcome to start <br/>
his guild on &quot;any and all servers&quot;.  I ask simply because I find the whole <br/>
concept to be wonderfully rich in role-play potential, but people can never <br/>
really leave there main characters... admit it hehe if we leave them for to <br/>
long we feel guilty lol.<br/>
Anyhow it was just a thought :)  I look forward to seeing more of you in game <br/>
as well as here, until then safe travels and good hunting to all of you.<br/>
