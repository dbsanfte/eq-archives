<div id="ygrps-yiv-856110782">I&#39;m single in Real Life.  I used to get into Internet Relationships but I&#39;ve<br/>
found that they usually end badly. =(.. I&#39;ve spent too much time mourning over<br/>
lost Net-relationships, so unless I find someone online who I am TOTALLY<br/>
compatible with and who lives in a relatively close distance to me so a real<br/>
relationship is viable I&#39;m shying away from the whole thing. I tell anyone<br/>
who&#39;s interested in me that any relationship will stay on the &#39;net and no real<br/>
life feelings other than friendship and affection will be involved. =)<br/>
