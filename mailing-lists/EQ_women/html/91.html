<div id="ygrps-yiv-871914378">I feel the same way you do.  It is a great feeling to come upon some who is just about had it and shoot them a few heals and save them.  I find though I get a little offended if they don&#39;t thank me...don&#39;t know why guess because I was always taught you thank folks when they do something nice for you.  Newbies are the funnest to help and are usually the most grateful...I know I was and still am because the situation easily<br/>
reverses itself when you are in trouble.<br/>

&gt; I tend to heal anyone who is in danger of dying in<br/>
&gt; combat, but if a person is not in danger I generally<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t.  I haven&#39;t had a lot of people ask me for heals<br/>
&gt; though.  If I am asked for heals, I&#39;ll usually say I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; low on mana (if I am) or throw a single heal on them if<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m full.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the other hand, if I am full of mana and I&#39;m in the<br/>
&gt; mood, I sometimes heal or buff people randomly for no<br/>
&gt; reason at all.  It&#39;s an easy way to be nice to someone,<br/>
&gt; and make new friends.  People seem in particular to<br/>
&gt; appreciate getting Spirit of the Wolf.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I spent three hours last night in Kelethin disguised as<br/>
&gt; a tree.  I went about bolting orcs, healing, and buffing<br/>
&gt; newbies as they valiantly tried to face off orcs.  That<br/>
&gt; was a lot of fun.  I didn&#39;t get any XP, or any treasure,<br/>
&gt; but I had set asside the time to do it and it was fun.<br/>
&gt; A few newbies were freaked out by this moving tree.  Others speculated as to whether I was an enchanter or a druid.  I saved several people&#39;s lives, and they were very greatful.  A few newbies role played with me, as I presented myself as &#39;The Great Tree&#39;, a protective Kelethin forest spirit.  All in all, it was fun.  I recommend you healers and buffers give a shot at some community service some time, it can be rewarding 8)<br/>

&gt; been pretty fun a lot of the time, though it is getting boring having people ask for heals all the time. Every person I heal means I have to sit staring at that damn spellbook waiting for my mana to regen. I don&#39;t mind doing that for my partymembers because that&#39;s my job, but not if it&#39;s going to take out of my playing time and I get nothing out of it.<br/>
