<b>Subject:</b> RP Server in Test <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-617365287">For the RP lovers out there that have quit playing EQ, the new RP server,<br/>
Firiona Vie, is up and running in test (i.e., you have to use eqtst.exe to<br/>
play).  They have new rules: trivial loot, race/class/deity alignments that<br/>
prohibit grouping and guilding with non aligned players, language barriers (no<br/>
common tongue at all), everyone is ROLEPLAY ON, and only one character is<br/>
allowed.  <br/>
<br/>
I played it the last two nights and had a BLAST!  Everyone in Everfrost (never<br/>
did play Shaman past 9 before) was roleplaying.  I hear that wasn&#39;t the case<br/>
in GFay and Qeynos but that the RP&#39;ers were pretty strong and insistent and<br/>
the spam quieted down.  The chars will be wiped out once the server goes live,<br/>
but I kind of like Katrice and will probably keep her.  I love the Shaman<br/>
potions they can make now :-)<br/>
<br/>
A few powergamers have decided to come to FV to see how the new rules affect<br/>
people, and as long as they don&#39;t uber guild the server and camp the dragons<br/>
and make the high end game SUCK I don&#39;t mind.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the rumor is the server goes live the day DAoC is released.  I&#39;m<br/>
planning on getting DAoC, but I may just not cancel my EQ account quite yet. <br/>
AO, on the other hand, BIG YAWN!  Made it to 10 and quitting.  Good try, but<br/>
the game is just too buggy *sigh*.<br/>
