the main temple tree, with some help from the DM (the cleric there kept 
attacking him so he had to keep killing him, which was really funny and sort of 
par for our relationship).&nbsp; If it&#39;s going to be small, that&#39;s a very lovely 
location for it.</font></div>

one and Feydwer).&nbsp; But really, the people we ran into that way were some of

  <div><br></div><tt>Salutations Suzanne!<br><br>Thanks for the note. Do you 
  mean Surefall Glade? If so<br>that&#39;s where I&#39;m at right now in the game more 
  or<br>less. I&#39;m soulbound there anyway.<br>:o)<br><br>That could be an idea 
  though, it is kind of a neat<br>place. I&#39;m not sure how many people will even 
  come to<br>something like this. I expect it to be small. I&#39;m<br>fairly new to 
  the game and don&#39;t know lots of people<br>yet. He has played for much longer 
  but tends to be a<br>loner and solo a lot, at least before he ran into 
  me.<br><br>It might be an idea though. Funny I was right there<br>and didn&#39;t 
  even think of it. Of course, there are so<br>many places I haven&#39;t been 
  yet.<br><br>As for guilds I sort of have this feeling that its a<br>bit tacky 
  to go around asking. On the other hand I<br>really want to try that part of 
  the game out.<br>Maybe I don&#39;t have enough 
  escapades.<br>:o)<br><br>Hugs,<br>:o)<br>Brangvyne<br><br>--- &quot;Suzanne J.

  but<br>&gt; someone on the list should know of which I speak. <br>&gt; It&#39;s 
  very nice.&nbsp; If you have any concerns about<br>&gt; guests&#39; safety, ask 
  some of your &#39;wedding party&#39; to<br>&gt; be &#39;ushers&#39;, ie., escort your guests 
  from Qeynos. <br>&gt; Or have a wizard &#39;port &#39;em in.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; My 
  fiance and I were both rangers.&nbsp; We were very<br>&gt; effective at 
  taunting; once one&#39;d take too much<br>&gt; damage, the other would start 
  taunting madly. <br>&gt; &#39;Course, the roles may have changed in the 
  past<br>&gt; year...<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Guilds, eh... they&#39;re nice if you&#39;ve 
  joined one<br>&gt; because you regularly adventure with many of its<br>&gt; 
  members, but I never personally advertised for a<br>&gt; guild.&nbsp; I tended 
  to let my escapades take me where<br>&gt; they would (as an elven ranger when 
  Povar was first<br>&gt; new, there was A LOT of escapade) and ran into 
  my<br>&gt; guild brethren when hunting.&nbsp; When I began looking<br>&gt; for 
  them when I signed on, I knew I was finding a<br>&gt; &quot;home&quot;.&nbsp; Just my 
  two coppers&#39;.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Best regards,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Aelwesara

  Thoughts and Questions .<br>&gt; . .<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Salutations All!<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have not posted for a while, 
  and I know everyone<br>&gt; was probably <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; relaxing a 
  little and here I am again.<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; :o)<br>&gt; 
  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; EQ has been progressing prettry good for me I<br>&gt; 
  think. I&#39;ve made a <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; couple of good friends who are more 
  experienced<br>&gt; then me and don&#39;t <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; seem to mind giving 
  advice or helping out so<br>&gt; that&#39;s very nice.<br>&gt; 
  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;ve also been trying to learn more about my role<br>&gt; 
  as a Ranger in <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Norrath. I just found out last week what a 
  handy<br>&gt; thing taunt can be <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; when trying to keep a 
  mob off your healer? OK, I&#39;m<br>&gt; slow but I&#39;m <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; getting 
  there I think. And I&#39;ve gotten duel wield<br>&gt; and double attack 
  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; now so that&#39;s interesting to play with.<br>&gt; 
  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night a Druid friend and I went to Paudal<br>&gt; 
  Cavern for my first <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; trip there. I would have died twice 
  during the<br>&gt; first fight we had I <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; think if they had 
  not been there to keep me from<br>&gt; deaths door. That <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  was a tough mob and red all the way for me at lvl<br>&gt; 19 (20 now).<br>&gt; 
  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, enough ramblin, so it&#39;s question time:<br>&gt; 
  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.) I have been asked to get married and have 
  said<br>&gt; yes. :o) Any good <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; suggestions on locations 
  that would be nice but<br>&gt; not to hard for <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; guests to 
  get to? He has a place in mind, I forget<br>&gt; the name, but it 
  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; sounds like it might be hard for lower level<br>&gt; 
  characters to even <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; reach. I have not traveled over much 
  of Norrath<br>&gt; still so I&#39;m not <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; sure. Anyway, if 
  anyone has ideas I&#39;d love to hear<br>&gt; them.<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, when 
  things are set, which may be a while<br>&gt; I&#39;ll post a note here 
  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; letting everyone know. You are all invited, of<br>&gt; 
  course, feel free to <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; come if you have a character on the 
  Xegony server,<br>&gt; of if you want <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; just create a quick 
  one at the proper time and<br>&gt; come anyway. I&#39;d love <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  to meet anyone who might do me the honor of<br>&gt; coming.<br>&gt; 
  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.) Can anyone give me advice on how to find a<br>&gt; 
  guild that might be <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; interested in letting a Ranger in the 
  low 20&#39;s<br>&gt; join? Would it be ok <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; to just kind of 
  start asking around? Is there a<br>&gt; way to tell a better 
  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; guild from one not as good?<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Anyway, I hope everyone had a nice Thanksgiving.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Hugs<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; :o)<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bran<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; lvl
