<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801372738">The times are fine.<br/>
Kelethin is a bit of a problem since my &quot;goodie&quot; girls are in Qeynos, and <br/>
my chars in the Western Antonica area would not want to be within 20 feet<br/>
of a dying Crushbone Orc ;).  (without helping the orc of course).  Any<br/>
relief for the &quot;evil among you&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I do have a young Cleric I made with my last open slot that I&#39;m toying with<br/>
the idea of tagging her with the guild name, as per the suggestion of<br/>
communicating via guild chat.  However as I wanted her to worship Rodcet<br/>
Nife, she started in Qeynos and at 2 would be unable to traverse Highpass<br/>
:(.  Should I contanct Luna IG to get her tagged for chat though?<br/>
<br/>

(still abhors the name with its NPC connection, but loves the idea)<br/>
At least 3 of my &quot;bad&quot; girls intend to hunt the NPC sisters ;?<br/>
Though the irony of a female character named Deceit with the &quot;Sisterhood of<br/>
Erollisi&quot; guild tag hunting the NPC Sisters of Erollisi would be *very*<br/>
amusing.<br/>

&gt;I only got three votes! I&#39;m hoping that means everyone else was ok with<br/>
&gt;all the times.  I am nervous setting the time for the meeting based on<br/>
&gt;only three votes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m going to wait another couple days to let people vote.  If all times<br/>
&gt;are ok with you, please send me an email saying that.  That will let<br/>
&gt;reassure me that people will come 8)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ll post new times, based on feedback from people who can&#39;t attend,<br/>
&gt;and the delay of another vote taking.  I really hope people will come!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Meeting times: <br/>
&gt;  - Saturday 14th 10am-12pm PST<br/>
&gt;  - Monday 16th 6-8pm PST<br/>
&gt;  - Tuesday 17th 6-8pm PST<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I hope these times work out for people.  Please send in your vote or<br/>
&gt;&#39;all of them are fine&#39; 8) <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you would like to join the guild before that, Luna and Briei (Beth&#39;s<br/>
&gt;character) are both capable of adding people.<br/>

&gt;Hi everyone,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As you may recall Suzanne was organizing an online meeting for mailing<br/>
&gt;list.  We chatted and agreed that Brell Serelis would be a great server to<br/>
&gt;have the meeting on.  This way we can all meet eachother, and also have a<br/>
&gt;subsequent guild event.  The subsequent event would be a newbie hunt,<br/>
&gt;during which newbies could hunt critters, and higher level guild members<br/>
&gt;could help them out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d like to hold a brief vote on the time and place of the meeting on<br/>
&gt;brell.  The time matters because we all have different schedules.  The<br/>
&gt;place only matters in terms of where the newbie hunt will take place.<br/>
&gt;Please respond to this email if you have a preference (if you don&#39;t care,<br/>
&gt;you dont need to respond).  If any given meeting time is impossible for<br/>
&gt;you, please say that, I&#39;ll try and minimize those conflicts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Meeting places:<br/>
&gt;    - Greater Faydark stone ring (kelethin newbie zone)<br/>
&gt;    - East Freeport newbie zone<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Meeting times:<br/>
&gt;    - Tuesday August 10th 6pm-8pm PST<br/>
&gt;    - Thursday August 10th 6pm-8pm PST<br/>
&gt;    - Saturday August 14th 10am-12pm PST<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Vote will be closed friday at 6pm PST and I&#39;ll post the results that<br/>
&gt;evening.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d like to use the guild chat feature to make our meeting easier.  Even<br/>
&gt;if you&#39;re not planning on playing on Brell, you can make a newbie and join<br/>
&gt;the guild, to use this feature.  It allows us to send tells to our entire<br/>
&gt;guild, so we can hear conversation even if we&#39;re not exactly in the same<br/>
&gt;physical area.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d also like to suggest an unofficial guild hunt Saturday August 7th at<br/>
&gt;noon PST.  The location will be wherever the official one will be held<br/>
&gt;(results posted Friday evening).  This is for those of us who&#39;d like to<br/>
&gt;get into playing together ASAP.<br/>
