<b>Subject:</b> Re: Petition for less revealing clothing? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240412653">Actually I sent an e-mail to eq (may be in the bit bucket for all I know).<br/>
<br/>
Since I&#39;ve been in FRP a while, and realize the target audience is the<br/>
younger ( &lt; 30) male .. I expected some as I put it: &quot;T&A&quot;.  However I<br/>
would want to have some more choice on being able to present my character<br/>
as &quot;vamp&quot;/&quot;non-vamp professional&quot;.  I pretty much accept the characters<br/>
start in thier &quot;undies&quot;. :)  Its actually the graphics of worn items that<br/>
I&#39;d like to see offer more choices, both in the less revealing and the more<br/>
revealing directions.<br/>
<br/>
However, here are the four main points of my e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
1. I accept skimpy clothing as a market necessity, as well a male playing a<br/>
female character fantasizes looking that way in the role.<br/>
<br/>
2. Depending on how the female playing a female created the character, she<br/>
will want a choice of revealing vs. non revealing, as well as busty vs.<br/>
athletic in look.<br/>
  a) Case in point .. I don&#39;t visualize myself looking like I&#39;m nursing<br/>
twins and wearing something I&#39;d be afraid to turn quickly in (and I do mean<br/>
the armors here) while going toe-to-toe, screaming orcish obscenities at an<br/>
orc in the snow!<br/>
  b) Case in point .. I am an evil female mage and prefer to stay far from<br/>
direct combat and taunt, torment and distract my victims ... of course all<br/>
the clothing available to me makes me look like Nancy Reagan at a formal<br/>
ball!  (Disney does better evil female mage clothes!) <br/>
<br/>
3. The revealing wearable clothing vs. non-revealing clothing is BACKWARDS<br/>
across the classes.<br/>
  a) Case in point .. A female Erudite Paladin upon purchase of her first<br/>
lether tunic, finds herself going from a moderatly Paladinish cloth top to<br/>
... a PINK HALTER TOP?  (from an RP stand point .. yeah right)  Leather<br/>
armor across the board and most banded looks kinky not anything I&#39;d try and<br/>
actually fight in.<br/>
  b) Case in point .. see b above.  Mages aren&#39;t front-line.  I&#39;d love from<br/>
an RP standppoint to imagine the female enchantress flashing a bit of chest<br/>
right as that charm spell goes off ;)  But .. no back to nunnery with mages.<br/>
<br/>
4.  As a long time RPer, I&#39;ve played as many male characters as female.<br/>
Why?  In the wrong crowd .. harassment.  EQ is pretty good IMHO on this<br/>
score.  But if you *know* you&#39;re playing in an area with many immature<br/>
players .. a choice of a &quot;non-vamp&quot; character can make the difference<br/>
between enjoyment and logging early and returning as a male character.<br/>
Also, an option if you fear some regular players whom you play with often<br/>
are getting over &quot;fixated&quot; on your character.  Play long enough on-line ..<br/>
you&#39;ll find that there are times its better to tone it down.  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry, it was long.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, has anyone tested the &quot;Blonde Factor&quot;?  My daughter and I made test<br/>
characters and tried to measure the number of males that started following<br/>
the character about, giving her items .. etc.  A Blonde human and a Blonde<br/>
Wood Elf .. no matter how sternly played ... attract a veritable HOST of<br/>
male groupies :)  Remake the character and replay in the same setting<br/>
(modify name), but as a brunette .. and *poof* .. where&#39;d they all go?   My<br/>
daughter at 10 is flustered by all the male attention and now avoids Blonde<br/>
characters like the plague.<br/>
