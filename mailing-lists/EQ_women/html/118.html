<b>Subject:</b> Re: Women on EQ: Flirting <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-130845858">As a level 9 paladin, I have been flirted with some and responded some. <br/>
Mostly all of us are kind of busy running around killing, buying and <br/>
selling, etc. though. I enjoy the flirting perhaps because until maybe this <br/>
year I had never done so in RL. When I was young (I&#39;m 48 now) I thought I <br/>
was ugly and I was too serious and intelligent to flirt or want to flirt. <br/>
That was in the initial days of feminism when we rejected a lot of our <br/>
feminity in the name of equality. Then for about 15 years I was way over <br/>
weight and no one was interested for a long time. Recently I have lost 50 <br/>
lbs and become physically very attractive because of the weight loss and <br/>
because I&#39;ve learned how to enhance and appreciate my natural and innate <br/>
beauty. Men respond at all levels including opening doors for me as well as <br/>
actually coming on to me.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it&#39;s been fun in EQ getting some attention similar to that I now <br/>
get in RL. On the other hand, I am fairly happily married (17 years now) <br/>
and am not interested in having any affairs. On EQ that could only happen <br/>
if I gave someone my real name and contact information, which I don&#39;t <br/>
intend to do. I have found a steady, however, who is very nice and <br/>
romantic, saying chivalrous things to me, giving me trinkets, and helping <br/>
me find my corpse, fight, etc.. Like most women, my RL husband, is not and <br/>
never has been romantic. Nor have any of the men in my life ever been. The <br/>
rpg environment can lend itself  to that chivalry, romantic thing so many <br/>
of us fantasize about. I very much enjoy hearing his compliments as well as <br/>
complimenting him. We usually do that when one of us needs to leave. It&#39;s a <br/>
great way to end the game evening. I also have genuinely learned a lot from <br/>
watching him play and playing with him. I suspect he&#39;s more experienced at <br/>
EQ or role playing in general than I am and/or that he is a fairly mature <br/>
person in real life. So my compliments are genuine, not just romantic <br/>
frivolities.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s never asked me about my RL except to ask if I was really female. He <br/>
doesn&#39;t know my age or marital status nor do I know anything about him. <br/>
Wonder if it will ever come up or if we will continue to just interact <br/>
within our game roles. Certainly I don&#39;t intend to bring it up.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m throwing out a topic ladies, just want to see what experiences you<br/>
&gt; have had.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Flirting<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My character is the biggest flirt!  I discovered early in the game that<br/>
&gt; most males (no matter what race) liked the look of my character, a<br/>
&gt; half-elf.  Many flirted with her before she even knew she was cute.  It<br/>
&gt; was in-character for Genneth (a bard) to flirt, so she is constantly<br/>
&gt; engaging in flirting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And to add to it, Genn has herself somewhat of a boyfriend in the game,<br/>
&gt; another member of her guild, Teban. (&#39;Course she still flirts with<br/>
&gt; others, but he understands that she is mostly committed to him ;) So,<br/>
&gt; has this phenomenon hit anyone else?  Do you get flirted with?  Have<br/>
&gt; you found yourself a steady??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just curious<br/>
