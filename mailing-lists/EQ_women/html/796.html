<div id="ygrps-yiv-1707049522">Salutations!<br/>
<br/>
Last night I had one of my better gaming experiences<br/>
which included at one point wandering into an Orc<br/>
Village and single handedly wiping it out!<br/>
WOW!<br/>
And all because I just did another little favor for<br/>
someone who cast these &quot;buffs&quot; on me as partial<br/>
payment and made me virtually invincible to these Orcs<br/>
for a while. They couldn&#39;t hurt me, my spells never<br/>
ran low, etc.<br/>
WOW again!<br/>
And I didn&#39;t even ask him for any payment for the<br/>
favor, I never do.<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, a different character told me about my quest<br/>
armor which was fun to start working on that finally,<br/>
and I made a big discorery. There was a lot going on<br/>
like ooc&#39;s and shouts etc. that apparently are turned<br/>
off in the default. It was surprising how much<br/>
conversation was going on when I turned on all those<br/>
options.<br/>
<br/>
After that I joined up with a wizard and helped her<br/>
gather some parts of wasps and spiderling silk that<br/>
she needed for something for a while.<br/>
<br/>
All in all one of my better nights though I did stay<br/>
on way to long and paid the price this morning when I<br/>
woke up early.<br/>
:o/<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, hugs to all,<br/>
:o)<br/>

&gt; ooc=out of character, so pretty much the whole zone<br/>
&gt; sees your message without you having to yell. This<br/>
&gt; is used as an auction for items or a zone warnign<br/>
&gt; when something nasty is running around close to<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
&gt; I use it often, it is a wonderful thing. =)<br/>

&gt; Sometimes you&#39;ll see things like this<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Fno<br/>
&gt; eans Fnord has used the auction command to send a<br/>
&gt; message to the <br/>
&gt; entire zone. The message can be translated as &quot;Want<br/>
&gt; to sell (WTS) banded <br/>
&gt; boots, please send a tell (PST) if you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; interested&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Similarly to auction, people can use shout to shout<br/>
&gt; to the entire zone, or <br/>
&gt; ooc to speak &quot;out of character&quot; to the entire zone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The intention for the use of these channels is:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; shout - your character wants to shout loud enough<br/>
&gt; that people not near <br/>
&gt; them will still be able to hear them, the intention<br/>
&gt; is that you use this <br/>
&gt; &quot;in character&quot; speaking as if you were your<br/>
&gt; character. For example &quot;watch <br/>
&gt; out, there is a sand giant near the beach&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ooc - speaking out of character, this is you<br/>
&gt; speaking as yourself. For <br/>
&gt; example, &quot;Does anyone know what level rangers get<br/>
&gt; double attack at?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; auction - this is reserved for selling items, and<br/>
&gt; inquiring about buying <br/>
&gt; items.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another usefull command is /yell, or /y. This will<br/>
&gt; cause people near you <br/>
&gt; to get a message like &quot;Brangvyne yells for help from<br/>
&gt; your left&quot;. Sometimes <br/>
&gt; it&#39;s hard to find someone, and having them /yell<br/>
&gt; will let you know where <br/>
&gt; they are (if you&#39;re close enough to hear the yell).<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; The accepted way is to ask in a zone using the<br/>
&gt; ooc<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; or auction channels. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also watch for other people auctioning that they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; want to sell jewlery.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Enchanters level 16+ are most commonly jewlers<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; they get spells that <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; allow them to make magic jewlery.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cool, but how do you find such people? is<br/>
&gt; there an<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easier way other than asking everyone you<br/>
