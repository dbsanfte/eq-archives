<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756987471">Just wanted to say hello to everyone, i have a 6th level wizard on<br/>
Errolis Marr.  I currently play with my online friend that i am close to<br/>
and our characters are involved as lovers, we are suppose to be role<br/>
playing a dinner meeting with another couple this weekend ... cant wait<br/>
for that.  Oh My characters name is Elarien, so if You happen to run<br/>
across me please say hello.  I have found it very easy to make friends<br/>
with the men of EQ but i have met few *supose to be ladies* that have<br/>
not only been rude but just plain not nice.   I was very happy when my<br/>
boyfriend found the list and sent me an email bout it.  Look forward to<br/>
meeting some of You.<br/>
<br/>
Take Care,<br/>
