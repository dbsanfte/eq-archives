<div id="ygrps-yiv-924409916">Salutations!<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone give me information about starting a guild, is that <br/>
possible, or do you have to join an existing one?<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone give me some sewing tips? I&#39;ve figured out how to take a <br/>
ruined wolf pelt and certain patterns and put them in the small <br/>
sewing kit to make tunics, boots, etc. but what about other things. I <br/>
have not gotten anything to work in my large sewing kit at all yet, <br/>
keeps saying it&#39;s the wrong stuff. The instructions for sewing large <br/>
items say use a ruined bear pelt and an appropriate pattern which <br/>
patterns would those be?<br/>
<br/>
Finally, for now I was with someone who died the other day and we <br/>
were haveing a lot of trouble finding her body so she could get her <br/>
stuff back. After a while she said that someone else had gotten the <br/>
stuff for her. How does this work? If I die and can&#39;t find my body <br/>
how do I get my stuff back? How can I do this for someone else?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help ya&#39;ll can give,<br/>
<br/>
