<div id="ygrps-yiv-369300452">Greetings, m&#39;ladies.<br/>
<br/>
I recently happened to hear of your gatherings for discussion. I thought <br/>
I might ask if you would welcome a man, such as myself, to participate. <br/>
In my travels of the lands of Norrath, it often seems the women I <br/>
encounter are much more likely to have the wit and intelligence for a <br/>
good conversation. So, ladies, might I participate, or am I invading your <br/>
sanctuary away from us uncouth men? I certainly would not be offended if <br/>
you would prefer that I depart.<br/>
<br/>
I await your decision, ladies.<br/>
