<div id="ygrps-yiv-1748224430">I totally agree.  I had a strange urge when i created my ranger to dump a<br/>
lot of points into AGI instead of stamina thinking &#39;better to not get hit<br/>
than to be able to take hits&#39; and I was right!  Even though I have less HP<br/>
than the true tanks, I end up tanking because I rarely get hit, and if I do,<br/>
my AC minimizes damage.<br/>
<br/>
I have been soloing reds and yellows my whole career. I thought that it<br/>
would all change around level 11 or so, but I just hit 15 and am still<br/>
soloing yellows.<br/>

100 AGI naturally<br/>
135 AGI with rings and Feet of Cat<br/>
320 AC<br/>
400 HP<br/>

&gt; I recently changed from banded shoulders and girdle and gorget to spiked<br/>
shoulders, barbed sleeves, purity belt, and spiked collar.  I went from an<br/>
81 strength to a 91, with a loss of only a couple AC (and after I&#39;m buffed,<br/>
that couple points is really meaningless to me, dunno how it is for others).<br/>
I plan to go with barbed legs (also found in Unrest)(wow, that dungeon<br/>
ROCKS....many, many trains on Povar at least) in the future, which will give<br/>
me a dex bonus (as does the<br/>
&gt; barbed shoulders).  One thing that I found rather nifty is that, with an<br/>
agility of 107, I don&#39;t get hit as often or as hard.  If you find any<br/>
magical items that give decent agility bonuses, you may wish to consider<br/>
this.  I&#39;ve had things that are conning red to me miss three times in a row<br/>
(thank goodness) so I&#39;ve come to appreciate the extra points I threw into it<br/>
at creation.  Just a thought! =)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I wanted to share some armor tips with the list.  My boyfriend and I<br/>
have done some analysis of the weight and AC benefits of various armors.<br/>
The results are somewhat surprising! These should be of particular interest<br/>
to clerics.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My first tip is to choose your belt carefully! For<br/>
wizards/necros/enchanters/magicians you want a bear hide belt.  This has 4AC<br/>
and weighs only 1lb.  For all other classes (except perhaps monks) you want<br/>
a thick leather apron.  These can be found in unrest, and they give 8AC<br/>
(same as plate) but weigh only 1lb.  Both of these items are a great value,<br/>
and can be found fairly cheap.  On Mithanial Marr you can get bear-hide<br/>
belts for 4 plat, and thick leather aprons for 12 plat.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Another tip I have is to be careful about buying bronze armor.  It may<br/>
look very cool, but it is also very very very heavy.  This can be a problem<br/>
for clerics in particular.  Even tanks may find that they are so loaded<br/>
down, that they can&#39;t carry enough loot.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Some bronze items are better values than others.  Good bronze items are<br/>
gauntlets, mask, helm, shoulders, and boots. These items give you a fair bit<br/>
of extra AC, and don&#39;t weigh that much.  If you get just these pieces as<br/>
bronze, and use banded for the rest of your armor, you will only get 9AC<br/>
less than if you had a full suit of bronze, and you will weigh 18.6lb less<br/>
(assuming you&#39;re a small race, you&#39;ll save even more weight if you&#39;re medium<br/>
or large).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Aesthetics play a large part in choosing a character&#39;s equipment, and<br/>
one reason to go for a complete set of bronze is to look cool.  I personally<br/>
think the above mix of banded and bronze looks very cool, and I encourage<br/>
you to try it.  You can always buy a bronze breastplate, and bronze legs, if<br/>
you decide you don&#39;t like how it looks.  You don&#39;t need to buy a bronze<br/>
cloak, neck, wrist, or waist as these don&#39;t really affect appearance.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Another good armor tip to remember, if you&#39;re an elf, is to always buy<br/>
small armor.  Small armor weighs less than medium armor, but fits elves<br/>
fine.  Barbarians should similarly wear medium armor whenever possible (I<br/>
think barbarians can wear any medium armor, I know they can wear medium<br/>
banded).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Another tip I have is to always ask for the weight of an item before you<br/>
purchase it.  Some magic armor can fit any race, and is thus very heavy in<br/>
comparison to small banded or even bronze (even though it has the same AC).<br/>
Some magic armor is also very light, which is a great bonus.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Perhaps some other list member can give some armor tips for large races<br/>
(Ogres, Trolls, Barbarians).  I know you guys end up with very heavy armor.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hopefully this will help some of you the next time it&#39;s time to buy some<br/>
armor.<br/>
