<br/>
I am afraid I do not have any characters on Nameless, only on <br/>
Quellious, but your question might find out how many people still <br/>
read this board. It has lots of really intersting posts, but seems to <br/>
have died just about the time I discovered it, sadly.<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting, <br/>
