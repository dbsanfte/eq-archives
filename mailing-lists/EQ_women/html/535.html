<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I started playing a year ago and today I sat down 
and thought of all the things I could have accomplished with the time I spent in 
Norrath.&nbsp; My house could be finished (we doubled its size in a major 
remodel that will never be done).&nbsp; My novel could be written (halfway 
through).&nbsp; My game design could be complete (think about it more than write 
it up).</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">And then I think about what I have done in 
Norrath.&nbsp; It isn&#39;t about being 52 or having a bunch of alts in their 
20s.&nbsp; It&#39;s really about the people.&nbsp; And here is what I have done in 
Norrath.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">First playing partner was clinically depressed 
after his mother died at 16.&nbsp; He became dysfunctional and dropped out of 
school.&nbsp; At 21 he worked odd jobs as a day laborer and had isolated himself 
from his family and friends.&nbsp; We played every single day together, RPing 
various relationships.&nbsp; He quit in January after getting his GED and 
starting college.&nbsp; On Thanksgiving he said his mother&#39;s family wouldn&#39;t 
want to see him anymore after the things he had done.&nbsp; I held his hand, 
through cyberspace, while he called and reconnected.&nbsp; He got back from 
spending 10 days with them at Christmas and has found his family again.&nbsp; He 
reconnected with his friends.&nbsp; I cried when he left but also smiled 
inside.&nbsp; I was only a shoulder to lean on, but I was there.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">A boy who is facing college applications this year 
talked to me one night about how his parents have basically laid out his life 
for him, giving him a choice of 3 &quot;acceptable&quot; universities and he can do 
pre-med or pre-law.&nbsp; Otherwise, they will not pay for his college.&nbsp; 
This boy is an artist at heart.&nbsp; We talked long into the night about the 
risk of going his own way.&nbsp; What would it mean to earn his parents 
disapproval?&nbsp; Could he earn his own way through the college of his choice 
by working and going to school part time?&nbsp; Is it worth 60 hours a week for 
40 years just to please your parents when it means not pleasing 
yourself?&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Last night another boy, 17, is in the pit of 
depression and self hate.&nbsp; I asked him what standards he was applying to 
himself that made him feel so loathsome.&nbsp; We talked about reasonable 
expectations, learning to shut that parental voice of &quot;you can never be good 
enough&quot; off inside your head, and the joy of doing things not because you excel 
at them but because you just love to do them and to be willing to enjoy doing 
things badly because badly is the best you can do (I took up competitive figure 
skating at age 40!).&nbsp;&nbsp; He cursed me as he logged off because I&#39;d 
ruined his deep depression and he was actually feeling pretty good ;-)&nbsp; (I 
also referred him to Harold and Maude - a must see film for him).</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I play with a partner now who has a girl-friend 
that I remind him a LOT of.&nbsp; We have what he calls &quot;airings&quot; and I call 
&quot;fights&quot;.&nbsp; But it is all about learning to adjust our expectations of each 
other and in some ways his relationship on Norrath mirrors that he has in his 
RL, but it&#39;s a safer place to work through some of the issues that concern 
him.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">So, do I regret the time I have spent in Norrath? 
No!&nbsp; The day in and day out interaction with other people in an environment 
that crosses generations and sexes and all the gaps our society infringes on us, 
has given me the opportunity to build people and not things.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I may die in a messy house that will never be 
finished and my yard may always have weeds.&nbsp; But if I can say that people 
have been better off for having known me, then I have done more good than a 
clean house or a pristine yard would ever accomplish.&nbsp; </font></div>
