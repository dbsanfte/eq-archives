<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-277004687">I also have recently joined SCA. My interest in the Renaissance and the<br/>
Middle Ages is what originally led me to EQ. I am a firm believer in<br/>
actively participating in living history, yet there are times when the<br/>
weather, your health or your time leads you to more passive<br/>
entertainment. The key is to keep a sense of perspective and not become<br/>
too focused on one thing to the exclusion of reality. I have been<br/>
playing EQ from the start, yet I still enjoy it, maybe because my main<br/>
character is still level 20, has never been power leveled and is still<br/>
exploring her environment. I also enjoy reading Pier Anthony&#39;s Zanth<br/>
series, in which characters explore a world of Pun-tastic fantasy.<br/>
	My son is in training to become a SCA fighter. I myself am more<br/>
intrigued with the costuming, arts and foods. We have attended a couple<br/>
of wars already, it is great fun.....but it can also be taken to the<br/>
point where you lose life balance so take caution....then you will enjoy<br/>
it as a lifelong pursuit and not a intense and expensive fling. We began<br/>
this interest by becoming regular attendees of Renaissance Faires (10<br/>
years), then realised that we wanted get more depth to our knowledge<br/>
base.<br/>
	Mayhaps we shall end up having a group of EQ fans in the SCA. My son is<br/>
signed up to also beta test AO, Anarchy Online (Futureworld game). When<br/>
he starts playing I&#39;ll let you know how it looks as a game. Wishing you<br/>
all a &quot;Good Morrow.&quot; :)</div>
