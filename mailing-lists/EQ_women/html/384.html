&lt;&lt; Hi there, and welcome to EQ Women!  This mailing list is for women who <br/>
play the game Everquest to meet eachother and chat.<br/>
 <br/>
 You can post to the list by replying to this message,<br/>

Salutations!<br/>
I am sorry to come on here but I have a question.<br/>
I am about to buy this game and I wanted to get some opinion from some of you <br/>
who are in it about it and how good it is and whether it is worth the cost.<br/>
I was also curious if someone could tell me what the cost is, after the <br/>
initial expense of buying the game. The game at the local Best Buy does not <br/>
give the monthly charge on it at all.<br/>
I have never been in an online game before so this will be a first.<br/>
Please feel free to contact me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Brangvyne@...">Brangvyne@...</a> if you can answer any of <br/>
these questions.<br/>
And don&#39;t worry, I wont clutter your list up with any other posts until I&#39;m <br/>
officially a member of the game.<br/>
