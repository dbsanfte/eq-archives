Ranger Protest?&nbsp; Apparently rangers from all the servers made level

Crushbone.&nbsp; Would have loved to have seen it.</font></font>&nbsp;
<br><i>Nope, I&#39;ve participated in others, though, and was able to see some
of the top rangers who had been playing since Closed Beta (2 as well as
3)... really respected names in the community who&#39;d already made it, and
were no longer active as rangers, but wanted to help others.&nbsp; it was
a great experience to be in on the first one in May, and to be there for
the planning stages and everything. The Ranger&#39;s Glade forum is an excellent
site (part of EQForge) and very active in ranger concerns.&nbsp; I had
to make a clean break, however, because I really did have alot of emotion
tied up in EQ, and when I quit, it was very difficult... I mean, I dragged
my real-life best friend into it so we could &#39;see&#39; each other every day...
my ingame partner has become my out-of-game partner, too... (looooooooong
story, hehe, and I wouldn&#39;t recommend it as a way to pick up guys) so you
can see why I would just want to turn my back on being active in the cause
when that really isn&#39;t typical behavior for me.</i>
<br>&nbsp;<font face="Arial"><font size="-1">But to be honest, I still think
Rangers rock.&nbsp; I could be prejudiced ;-)</font></font>&nbsp;
<br><i>I do, too, honestly, but it&#39;s the rest of the world that needs convincing...
&lt;sigh&gt;&nbsp; I didn&#39;t quit because I wasn&#39;t &#39;winning&#39;; I did it because
Verant told a community of customers to screw off.</i>
<br><i></i>&nbsp;<font face="Arial"><font size="-1">As for my game, I&#39;m now
stuck on how to get away from &quot;killing mobs&quot; as the primary gameplay force.&nbsp;
I want it more adventure based, I think, with characters given &quot;opportunities&quot;
to alter the dynamic of gameplay.&nbsp; And each level grouping having
different quest orientations.&nbsp; And each server being uniquely itself
because of the decisions made by players up to that time.</font></font>&nbsp;<font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Anyway,
the game is now called KARMA and when you die - you REALLY die ;-)&nbsp;
None of this resurrection gorp.&nbsp; You have to be reborn and how you
are reborn is totally dependent on how you played up to that point.&nbsp;
Of course, like anything else, it&#39;s all in the details.&nbsp; But those
are my ideas so far.&nbsp; Opinions?</font></font>&nbsp;<font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Judy</font></font>

<br><i>I recommend you steal a page from the original Ultima series, then,
and have quests and decisions actually count for &#39;Karma&#39; points... in the
Ultima series, if your avatar behaved a certain way, individual NPCs might
or might not choose to adventure with him.&nbsp; Everything was a consequence
of his actions.&nbsp; So, if a KARMA avatar did things according to how
his alignment and class should behave in a given situation, he should get
karma points.&nbsp; Depending on how many Karma points he has, he might
have a higher &#39;fame&#39; rating in how NPCs deal with him (one of the things
I liked about UO; NPC shopkeeps would lower prices for higher famed players),
but it will also determine how he is reborn... just things to consider.
=)</i><i></i>
<p><i>Also, I like the idea of being reborn.&nbsp; I think, at that time,
loot should disappear, maybe restored to the database as &#39;available&#39; for
respawn somewhere... that way, people don&#39;t get too attached to their stuff?&nbsp;
I have to admit, my EQ and UO banks (and heck, my Diablo stash, hehe) had
more sentimental stuff in it than anything else, and it crushed me to have
my UO house looted by people who just destroyed the gifts I&#39;d been given
if they had no value for use or resale... but maybe there&#39;s a lesson in
that? &lt;grin&gt;</i>
