<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852902065">Actually I know of one marriage that ended because of EQ, and one set of<br/>
good friends who decided to meet in real life and ended up falling in love<br/>
in spite of their best efforts not to do so.  They&#39;re engaged to be married<br/>
next May.<br/>
<br/>
But we no longer play EQ. ;-)<br/>

Subject: [EQ_women] Crazy or Not?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; People hooking up through EQ...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I knew one woman that I used to talk to about 2 years ago. I was just<br/>
&gt; happy that there were females that played EQ... ROFL! Anyways she met<br/>
&gt; a guy in another country after her divorce. He came out to visit with<br/>
&gt; her. He was there for about a month. They played EQ, she went to<br/>
&gt; work, and they started a romance. She ended up pregnant. She moved to<br/>
&gt; his country, than back to the USA, had the child. They no longer play<br/>
&gt; EQ but have a family here now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I knew another women who found a husband through EQ. They happen to<br/>
&gt; live close to each other, hooked up, married, and no longer play EQ.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I recently heard from a male friend that came back to EQ after a year<br/>
&gt; off. He was looking for cheap entertainment for him and his wife so<br/>
&gt; they went back to EQ. She&#39;s now divorcing him for another man she met<br/>
&gt; through EQ.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do any of you have any stories? I heard on a message board once from<br/>
&gt; one guy about how his GF left him because he was addicted to EQ.<br/>
&gt; Gross story though.<br/>
