&gt; I thought it was very interesting and decided to check it out. I am <br/>
&gt; very skeptical by nature so the first thing I did was check out the <br/>
&gt; company. I contacted the Better Business Bureau and found that the <br/>
&gt; company has had no complaints lodged against them, I also contacted <br/>
&gt; Paypal who has verified this company. They told me that they verified <br/>
&gt; the company&#39;s licenses, bank accounts and other paperwork indicating <br/>
&gt; to them that the company is legitimate. Then I started asking co-<br/>
&gt; workers and friends about this program and to my surprise 4 out of <br/>
&gt; the 10 people that I spoke with were already using this program. They <br/>
&gt; told me how pleased they were with it and how much money they had <br/>
&gt; saved and are currently saving. So I decided to sign up for this <br/>
&gt; program on 8/6/01. On 8/10/01 I received my complete membership <br/>
&gt; package and the fun began. Using their program and the free lifetime <br/>
&gt; membership that it includes I went to the supermarket ready to make a <br/>
&gt; killing. The cashier rang up my grocery bill and it came out to <br/>
&gt; $239.87 then I presented her with the coupons I received from this <br/>
&gt; program and I saved $193.38 - my final bill was only $46.49! The <br/>
&gt; cashier wasn&#39;t the only one shocked. Thanks Sherri for sharing this <br/>
&gt; information with us!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; PS: The bottom of their webpage also has a link where you can pick up <br/>
&gt; $5.00 for free. It took me about 3 minutes to pick up my $5.00!<br/>
