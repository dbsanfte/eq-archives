<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248144332"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I am about to buy this game and I wanted to get some<br/>
&gt; opinion from some of you <br/>
&gt; who are in it about it and how good it is and<br/>
&gt; whether it is worth the cost.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s worth the cost, but I&#39;m still waiting for<br/>
something better, there isn&#39;t so far...  The best part<br/>
of the game is playing and chatting with the other<br/>
people and learning to be a team. The leveling begins<br/>
to be a bore after getting your 2nd or third character<br/>
to level 20 I think, not that I&#39;ll stop playing<br/>
because of that! :)</div>
