&gt; Is a woman using emotional deceit if she flirts with a 20 year old boy,<br/>
&gt; when she is 50, and doesn&#39;t tell him her age, allowing him to assume she<br/>
&gt; is around his age?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If she&#39;s only flirting, why should she send him a picture?  Now, I think that<br/>
20-year-old boys are a mass of emotion anyway, and I wouldn&#39;t be caught dead<br/>
flirting with one (too much potential to cause lasting damage), but as long as<br/>
she is only flirting, and not letting him get serious... no, she shouldn&#39;t send<br/>
him anything.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; What exactly must we disclose when we flirt with someone online before<br/>
&gt; we&#39;re being emotionally deceitful? Why do people get so worked up over<br/>
&gt; disclosing gender, in comparison with other qualities that define us?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Flirting has always relied on non verbal cues, up to this point in history;<br/>
allowing the physical chemistry or lack thereof to place a natural limitation or<br/>
acceleration on the process.  Those cues are missing, as is the knowledge of<br/>
whether someone is physically attractive when met on the &#39;Net.  What we now have<br/>
is a nation trying to reinvent the rules for romance, and flirting is considered<br/>
the first rule of romance.  No more sidelong glances, no more looking at each<br/>
other admiringly; for the most part, not even phone contact.  When flirting<br/>
crosses the line--and it doesn&#39;t always--it&#39;s now romance.<br/>
<br/>
In romance, the rules are no different on the &#39;Net than in real life (although I,<br/>
frankly, would use extreme caution when getting involved romantically on the<br/>
&#39;Net).  Full disclosure is mandatory before you transition from flirting to<br/>
dating.<br/>
<br/>
We should be able to control that transition on the &#39;Net as well as we do in real<br/>
life (or better, I would hope).  If you are comfortable, as a married black man,<br/>
flirting as a single blonde female wood elf, my only concern would be that you<br/>
maintain the relationships you initiate in exactly the fashion you started them.<br/>
I cannot stress enough that otherwise, by allowing the relationship to<br/>
transition, you are being deceitful.  When you create a character with the intent<br/>
and purpose to &#39;become&#39; that character for others, then you are only deceitful<br/>
when you stop being that character.  If you commit to a certain personality, then<br/>
you are only deceitful when you stop being that personality.<br/>

&gt; finds out.  That&#39;s why I pick on people my own size, hehe, or as my cousin<br/>
&gt; would say, &#39;He&#39;s below the legal limit!  Throw &#39;em back!&#39;  But then, that&#39;s my<br/>
&gt; take as a 30-year-old woman who shares her age with anyone.  I have a few boys<br/>
&gt; related to me that are very wounded now, and I just want to kill the women<br/>
&gt; responsible because they knew full well what they were doing.  Maybe I hold<br/>
&gt; women to a higher standard, and maybe it&#39;s wrong, but I don&#39;t expect men to<br/>
&gt; think of others because they&#39;re well, men, and I expect women to.  &lt;sigh&gt; I<br/>
&gt; apologize if I have offended.<br/>
