<div id="ygrps-yiv-992291571">OK first a list of general points:<br/>
<br/>
Ok, first there is no exp penalty in AO. :) So you just play what you like.<br/>
Second, the IP system.  Very unforgiving!  I&#39;d buy the Sybex Guide (just for<br/>
skill caps and the skill per class clst table).<br/>
Third, a few classes end up running into the the major remaining bugs.<br/>
The most broken features right now are - pets, crowd-control,<br/>
caster-to-melee balance (skewed toward melee now),tradeskills and debuffs<br/>
(very ineffective esp. against mobs).  I&#39;d avoid playing a class heavily<br/>
dependend on most things in that list while you learn the game (until they<br/>
patch a few more times).<br/>
<br/>
Ok, from what you said I think you&#39;d really like an adventurer!  I&#39;d go with<br/>
Solitus (or Atrox if you want to be huge, funny and tank more than heal).<br/>
Adventurers are the second best team healers in the game, they can tank (tho<br/>
only slightly better than a druid), going with melee weapons as main attack<br/>
is very viable and they have the second best speed buffs in the game.  They<br/>
get &quot;morphs&quot; where you can change your self into leets, reets and later huge<br/>
two-headed wolves!  They also have more flexible IP costs so they are more<br/>
beginner &quot;friendly&quot; than a few other classes.  I have played them - they can<br/>
be really fun (and I am an ex-Bard, ex-Main Tank Warrior, ex-Rogue and<br/>
ex-Enchanter).  They solo well and are welcome in groups.<br/>
<br/>
Fixers can be fun, they do have the best speed buffs (and later get<br/>
druid-like evacs) but they are very one dimensional in combat.  They have<br/>
only one good weapon (the Mausser) - it takes SMG and Burst skills (can&#39;t<br/>
use two so don&#39;t train multi).  So you speed buff, then shoot with your SMG<br/>
and heal only if Doc, Adventurer or Martial Artist aren&#39;t covering the job<br/>
(unlikely).  Also solo or group well.<br/>
<br/>
Martial Artist is something you may consider.  They also can travel fast,<br/>
and have very nice healing spells.  They are much more &quot;spell&quot; oriented than<br/>
monks in EQ.  They also move fast, heal and can tank.  Solo or group well<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Docs are fun to level 50 or so, but only the dedicated &quot;must be healer&quot;<br/>
types stick it out past then.  They have little combat effectiveness<br/>
(Martial Arts seems to be the best choice and then only if you aren&#39;t Nano<br/>
breed).  Group well, miserable to solo after 30.  Some groups used to EQ<br/>
Clerics will try to insist you not fight.  Healing also has *insane* aggro<br/>
right now - so expect a doc to die often as they are the weakest at<br/>
defending themselves when aggroed.  And taunting both doesn&#39;t work well and<br/>
many tanks are not from EQ and don&#39;t know how or haven&#39;t trained the skill!<br/>
:(  Group lives, doc dies, group loves doc.<br/>
<br/>
And you&#39;re right the RP potential of a neutral MetaP is huge!  MetaP&#39;s are<br/>
also the class that will run head first into the most bugs.  Neutrals are<br/>
the side that will run head first into the most bugs! Aaaaaaa.  Yes - total<br/>
bitch.  Get the feel of the game on a class they have working first (or<br/>
soundproof the area by your computer, wrap nearby breakables, etc).  MetaP<br/>
and Trader are two classes that have interested me since beta - but I just<br/>
can&#39;t handle either as my main .. yet :(  As well, I expecting Funcom to<br/>
announce moderate changes to the MP class in the next 2-3 weeks.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve moved back to mainly RK2. The Euro release *should* populate that<br/>
server and my guild there has a few Euros that play during my daytime (I<br/>
play when kids in school so that works for me).  Will send you tells today<br/>
on RK2, probably from Dimwit2 (petitioning to get the 2 removed) my Atrox<br/>
Enforcer and Metalrose my Engineer (trying out an odd template with her).<br/>

In reply to:<br/>
<br/>
OOh OOOh... okay, I made a fixer on Rubi-Ka 2 but was surprised there were<br/>
never any other players on.  She&#39;s only 2 and I&#39;m sure I screwed everything<br/>
up<br/>
so I&#39;ll probably restart her.  Clan, name Iceiallana (surprise there :-).  I<br/>
tried a Doctor on Rubi-Ka 1 last night, Omni-Tek Nano-human thingy.  Died in<br/>
my first mission but still figuring it out (think I got the program thingies<br/>
down, but I right clicked something in my inventory by accident and it went<br/>
away so I&#39;ll probably restart her too.  Her name is Caedusia (favorite<br/>
cleric<br/>
name).<br/>
<br/>
So those were my guesses based on EQ.  I played a tanking druid, much to the<br/>
amusement of all my friends :-)  I did love ranger when I started one, but<br/>
hated the exp. penalty.  Enjoy cleric and bard.  I really like the speed and<br/>
healing buffs, but I get bored if I just do the sit/med thing while the<br/>
tanks<br/>
are having all the fun pulling.<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions?  From reading the boards I thought eventually I&#39;d play a<br/>
meta-nanophysicist neutral.  Looks like that will be a total bitch to play,<br/>
though, but what great RP :-)<br/>
