<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-507354648">Funny you should mention our nurturing vs. servile sterotypes. I was quite<br/>
the little healer in a previous game, and yes, I got heartily sick of it.<br/>
So I play a tank.  Granted, this tank has a tiny little healing spell that<br/>
does come in handy, but she is primarily a TANK.  I spend alot of time<br/>
guarding our male clerics and paladins while they&#39;re medding after healing<br/>
my fanny back up to full while I kept them alive long enough to bash the<br/>
mobs on the head a few times and cast Strike or Ward Undead or whichever.  I<br/>
love the role reversal!  And they really do appreciate me taunting critters<br/>
off them and watching them while they meditate.  I have received many<br/>
expressions of gratitude, and I love being the one dishin&#39; out the damage.<br/>
The funniest part is that I play a wood elf, who is tiny, and they play high<br/>
elves and humans, who are much larger.  &lt;chuckles&gt;<br/>
    I even have a special emote set up for them:  &quot;Sara stands guard over<br/>
the tall one, looking quite fierce!&quot;  Got that sucker hotkeyed, and they<br/>
know I&#39;m on duty. =)<br/>
    The cleric I play is a dark elf, so she&#39;s not really the nurturing type<br/>
either.  I chose to play a cleric on that server (Rallos Zek) because some<br/>
of the guys from my guild crossed over, and I thought it&#39;d be neat to have<br/>
some ingame role reversal.  Also, I liked the concept of being able to<br/>
wander around, pondering aloud whether someone would make an appropriate<br/>
sacrifice to my God, the Prince of Hate.  I would like to do that in real<br/>
life some days.<br/>
    By the way, Barbarian Shaman ROCK!!!!  They&#39;re a really cool class, and<br/>
the ones I have met enjoy themselves thoroughly. =)<br/>

Sara, Povar<br/>
Valdaya, Rallos Zek<br/>

&gt; I would just like to tell everyone out there who is a Cleric that they<br/>
&gt; just might like to try out a shaman. I spent 18 levels being a Cleric<br/>
&gt; and 5 being a Shaman so far. I was always frustrated with my<br/>
&gt; limitations as a Cleric and took on way too much responsibility for<br/>
&gt; other people&#39;s lives, which made grouping a very un-fun experience. I<br/>
&gt; love being a Shaman so far. ( I&#39;ve made 2 new characters in Quellios.<br/>
&gt; Bloodless and Blacksatin) Go ahead and laugh at the names, it&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; best I can do on such short notice! I agonized believe me. Someone even<br/>
&gt; called me &quot;campy&quot;!- whatever that means. I&#39;m only 25, that term&#39;s<br/>
&gt; before my time.<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I&#39;ve played on that server for a total of 3 days and have<br/>
&gt; noticed, not just me - also complete strangers, that most people on<br/>
&gt; that server are really helpfull and nice. Or maybe just the people in<br/>
&gt; Halas as that&#39;s the only town I&#39;ve been in. I encourage you guys to try<br/>
&gt; it out as I have been so happy. I don&#39;t die constantly and I don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; to sit out the action all the time. I get to actually participate as a<br/>
&gt; part of the group instead of staring at my spellbook all the time with<br/>
&gt; nothing to do but chat. Not that chatting is at all bad, but I want to<br/>
&gt; have some fun too!<br/>
&gt; I have noticed that a lot of us have said that we play clerics, it<br/>
&gt; seems more than any other class. (Or maybe I only notice the clerics<br/>
&gt; because I play one.)I hope this doesn&#39;t offend you all, but I wonder if<br/>
&gt; we have chosen to play one because we are by nature nurturing and<br/>
&gt; helpfull, or because we have been raised in our society to act servile<br/>
&gt; to men. (I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve raised a few hackles-sorry!) It bothered me that<br/>
&gt; I would be one of the only women in rl playing a female character in<br/>
&gt; any given group and I would be forced to sit and heal all the male<br/>
&gt; warriors. I grew resentfull. I&#39;m wondering if many of you have done the<br/>
&gt; same thing, or if this just says a lot about me.<br/>
&gt; Thanks! :)<br/>
