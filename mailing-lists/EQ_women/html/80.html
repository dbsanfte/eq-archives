<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410862988">I have a neat trick of turning most potential suitors into big brothers. =)  Saves everyone&#39;s feelings, and gets into the roleplay.  The funny thing is, I&#39;m older than<br/>
most of them IRL....heh.  I DID have a very amusing night when I was in Qeynos.  There was a lot of /ooc going on with these two guys getting drunk.  They spent over 50<br/>
plat on booze.  Well, one of them decides he needs to get married.  Apparently he did a /who on the zone, and got me.  So, in /ooc, he starts proposing.  I shoot him<br/>
down.  He offers a ring.  I tell him he&#39;s a filthy human and not for the likes of me.  He offers to stay home with the kids.  I shoot him down again.  By this time, half<br/>
of the zone is in /ooc taking bets and making jokes and cheering him on and egging me on and well.......it was great fun, he sent me a /tell later thanking me for<br/>
playing along, and I have a new friend.  By the way, he DID get married in game later on that month.........lol.<br/>

&gt; When I went on to everquest I was concerned that there<br/>
&gt; might be a lot of flirting, and that it might get out<br/>
&gt; of hand.  I accordingly played my character with a<br/>
&gt; cold exterior (not hard for a dark elf necromancer).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve come to warm up to flirting a bit, though I<br/>
&gt; still don&#39;t do it very much.  I&#39;ve generally found that most guys are fairly polite, or at worst a bit boisterous.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My wood elf druid gets hit on more than my other<br/>
&gt; characters.  My dwarven paladin is hit on very consistently by dwarves (but not other races).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve made lots of friends throughout Mithanial Marr, but I&#39;m hoping as well to join a decent guild at some point, for the increased socialization, and group hunting.<br/>
