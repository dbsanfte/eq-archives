<b>Subject:</b> Re: List meeting / Guild meeting <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-371433642">Actually the 2nd level cleric is the low level char, her name is Ysabel and<br/>
is based in Qeynos.  Since, I&#39;m moving to Brell, all 8 slots will be<br/>
&quot;real&quot;, but I used my last open to make something that shouldn&#39;t have a<br/>
conflict with tagging.  <br/>
<br/>
Though I&#39;d love to attend a get together sometime as one of my<br/>
&quot;bad/neutral&quot; girls, perhaps we could alternate meetings between a good<br/>
area (Faydark) and a neutral one?  Or at least one where I don&#39;t risk<br/>
inappropriate faction hits even if I just stand there.  I just don&#39;t want<br/>
to risk them becoming KOS in thier hometown/best non-good supply town to<br/>
attend a meeting :(  But I&#39;d like to come too :(  Even if my idea for<br/>
Ysabel &quot;works&quot; and I end up with one tagged character who will eventually<br/>
get enough exp to travel to Faydark safely, it would be nice for me to<br/>
share my other RPing side with other females on occasion if the get<br/>
togethers end up being regular.  <br/>
<br/>
I only pointed that out about Deceit since I found the irony amusing.  I do<br/>
not intend on having that char tagged, unless my RP angle changes with her.<br/>
 Deceit noticed you in S Karana, you also asked her for daggers as Luna<br/>
when they were both in S. Ro a few days ago btw.  <br/>

&gt;If you&#39;d like to more easily participate in the chat/social aspect of the<br/>
&gt;meeting, why not make a 1st level character whose only purpose is to<br/>
&gt;participate in the chat?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As far as real characters go, Luna is hunting in South Karana, so I can<br/>
&gt;add you to the guild.  Maybe you&#39;re far from your sisters now, but when<br/>
&gt;you&#39;re higher level you can meet up with us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As far as hunting the Sisters go, this depends on your roleplay<br/>
&gt;inclinations.  You could just write it off as XP farming and forget about<br/>
&gt;it.  You could decide you were an infiltraitor of the sisterhood, and make<br/>
&gt;sure that any (NPC) sister who saw you fighting another died before she<br/>
&gt;could tell the others.  No matter what, it&#39;s a difficult situation to<br/>
&gt;roleplay, but look at it as a challenge 8)<br/>

&gt;&gt; The times are fine.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Kelethin is a bit of a problem since my &quot;goodie&quot; girls are in Qeynos, and <br/>
&gt;&gt; my chars in the Western Antonica area would not want to be within 20 feet<br/>
&gt;&gt; of a dying Crushbone Orc ;).  (without helping the orc of course).  Any<br/>
&gt;&gt; relief for the &quot;evil among you&quot;?<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; I do have a young Cleric I made with my last open slot that I&#39;m toying with<br/>
&gt;&gt; the idea of tagging her with the guild name, as per the suggestion of<br/>
&gt;&gt; communicating via guild chat.  However as I wanted her to worship Rodcet<br/>
&gt;&gt; Nife, she started in Qeynos and at 2 would be unable to traverse Highpass<br/>
&gt;&gt; :(.  Should I contanct Luna IG to get her tagged for chat though?<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; - Lora<br/>
&gt;&gt; (still abhors the name with its NPC connection, but loves the idea)<br/>
&gt;&gt; At least 3 of my &quot;bad&quot; girls intend to hunt the NPC sisters ;?<br/>
&gt;&gt; Though the irony of a female character named Deceit with the &quot;Sisterhood of<br/>
&gt;&gt; Erollisi&quot; guild tag hunting the NPC Sisters of Erollisi would be *very*<br/>
&gt;&gt; amusing.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;I only got three votes! I&#39;m hoping that means everyone else was ok with<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;all the times.  I am nervous setting the time for the meeting based on<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;only three votes.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;I&#39;m going to wait another couple days to let people vote.  If all times<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;are ok with you, please send me an email saying that.  That will let<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;reassure me that people will come 8)<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;I&#39;ll post new times, based on feedback from people who can&#39;t attend,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;and the delay of another vote taking.  I really hope people will come!<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Meeting times: <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;  - Saturday 14th 10am-12pm PST<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;  - Monday 16th 6-8pm PST<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;  - Tuesday 17th 6-8pm PST<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;I hope these times work out for people.  Please send in your vote or<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&#39;all of them are fine&#39; 8) <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;If you would like to join the guild before that, Luna and Briei (Beth&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;character) are both capable of adding people.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;Hi everyone,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;As you may recall Suzanne was organizing an online meeting for mailing<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;list.  We chatted and agreed that Brell Serelis would be a great server to<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;have the meeting on.  This way we can all meet eachother, and also have a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;subsequent guild event.  The subsequent event would be a newbie hunt,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;during which newbies could hunt critters, and higher level guild members<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;could help them out.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;I&#39;d like to hold a brief vote on the time and place of the meeting on<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;brell.  The time matters because we all have different schedules.  The<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;place only matters in terms of where the newbie hunt will take place.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Please respond to this email if you have a preference (if you don&#39;t care,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;you dont need to respond).  If any given meeting time is impossible for<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;you, please say that, I&#39;ll try and minimize those conflicts.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Meeting places:<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;    - Greater Faydark stone ring (kelethin newbie zone)<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;    - East Freeport newbie zone<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Meeting times:<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;    - Tuesday August 10th 6pm-8pm PST<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;    - Thursday August 10th 6pm-8pm PST<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;    - Saturday August 14th 10am-12pm PST<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Vote will be closed friday at 6pm PST and I&#39;ll post the results that<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;evening.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;I&#39;d like to use the guild chat feature to make our meeting easier.  Even<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;if you&#39;re not planning on playing on Brell, you can make a newbie and join<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;the guild, to use this feature.  It allows us to send tells to our entire<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;guild, so we can hear conversation even if we&#39;re not exactly in the same<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;physical area.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;I&#39;d also like to suggest an unofficial guild hunt Saturday August 7th at<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;noon PST.  The location will be wherever the official one will be held<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;(results posted Friday evening).  This is for those of us who&#39;d like to<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;get into playing together ASAP.<br/>
