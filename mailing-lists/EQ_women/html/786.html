<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
No I can&#39;t honestly say I was seriously offended, and<br/>
I don&#39;t really want to get anyone in trouble. I guess<br/>
I was a bit shocked more than anything else by the way<br/>
it all came about. Perhaps, I&#39;m still a little nieve<br/>
in some ways.<br/>
:o)<br/>
After I thought about it I figured it was probably<br/>
just some teenage boy trying to pull a few chains.<br/>
:o)<br/>
Just wondered if there was a good way to handle such<br/>
situations, and your ignore name idea might be a good<br/>
one.<br/>
It&#39;s not like someone could do what he asked in game<br/>
even if they did want to. The whole thing is kind of<br/>
silly when you actually have time to think about it.<br/>
<br/>
:o)<br/>

&gt; These sorts of things happen online. You can try and<br/>
&gt; pursue the matter <br/>
&gt; further to try and get this person in trouble, but<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s rather hard to get <br/>
&gt; a complaint to result in actual punishment. Unless<br/>
&gt; you are seriously <br/>
&gt; offended and upset by comments like this online,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s probably best just <br/>
&gt; to ignore the teenager in question. Remember, you<br/>
&gt; can ignore anyone with <br/>
&gt; the following command:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; /ignore name<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When someone is on ignore, you can&#39;t hear anything<br/>
&gt; they say.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Another question.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I was on last night and ran into this dwarf who<br/>
&gt; keep asking my half <br/>
&gt; &gt; elf ranger to see her Boobies/mellons (his exact<br/>
&gt; terms) for which he <br/>
&gt; &gt; offered to pay me some gold. I said no thanks and<br/>
&gt; ran off and he <br/>
&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t follow me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Has something like this happened to anyone else?<br/>
&gt; &gt; What is the correct response, what should I do, or<br/>
&gt; did I handle it <br/>
&gt; &gt; right?<br/>
&gt; &gt; It bothered me but when I told the person I was<br/>
&gt; grouping with they <br/>
&gt; &gt; just laughed it off, so I said no big deal and<br/>
&gt; went on, but I&#39;m not <br/>
&gt; &gt; sure. Anyway, any advice?<br/>
