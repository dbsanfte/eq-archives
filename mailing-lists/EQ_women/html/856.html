<br/>
&lt;&lt; I am not aware of any ingame chat channle other<br/>
than for guilds, so maybe we should for an all female<br/>
guild. Only problem that I can see is we are all on a<br/>
lot of different servers .. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yep, that was my thought as well. The biggest problem<br/>
is we seem kind of scattered.<br/>
On other hand, I for one would have no major problem<br/>
with creating a toon on a new server to play<br/>
sometimes. Is there any server that already has<br/>
several of us on it? I play primarily Xegony but the<br/>
choice at the time was almost random and while I&#39;m not<br/>
going to get rid of my lvl 33 ranger I&#39;d be fine with<br/>
creating a toon somewhere else as well if anyone else<br/>
is game.<br/>
<br/>
