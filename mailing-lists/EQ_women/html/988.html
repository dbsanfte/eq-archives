<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468724650">I go to all the weddings I can.  (Weddings and babies are my only female<br/>
interests.)  At one, the cleric knew what to say and the couple exchanged<br/>
rings and everything.  (He got a turtlebone ring.  Think she planned to<br/>
throw him in the fountain.)  <br/>
<br/>
The prettiest one was held by the stream in Sanctus Seru.  People brought<br/>
cake, we all drank.  Then they retired to duel!  The only bad spot was<br/>
during the mass buffings frenzy, one person turned into a doggie.  The NPC<br/>
near there didn&#39;t like that.<br/>
