<br/>
We used to talk about adopting a lot but we just kept<br/>
having more kids instead, so we adopted them.<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
I have no time management skills. Nothing ever gets<br/>
done on time or properly. I figure as long as it<br/>
eventually happens it successful.<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations on 62. As someone who recently hit 62<br/>
myself we seem to be taking the same road. Last night<br/>
I took my 21% into 62 and my 65 ranger hubby and went<br/>
to HoH. Why HoH instead of BoT. Well simple. He can<br/>
solo there bow kiting the mobs till they die. It&#39;s a<br/>
bit slow but I keep him healed and toss in a few 1100<br/>
point nukes to speed the process and its not bad at<br/>
all. The two of us were killing mobs with between 30K<br/>
and 75K hp. So my recipie now is BoT if I can get a<br/>
good group, HoH if I&#39;m duoing, and trade skills etc.<br/>
when I&#39;m alone. Working out pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
Finished my fourth coldain shawl yesterday, but I need<br/>
to get my tailoring up some more before I try that 5th<br/>
one. Only 101, and although I know it trivs at 115 I<br/>
think I&#39;m going to triv Wu&#39;s armor at 158 before I<br/>
make the attempt. After all it will need to be higher<br/>
later anyway, so might as well get it on up now.<br/>
<br/>
Do we have any others who like to do that trade stuff<br/>
on the list. I do it a lot when it&#39;s slow. Just work<br/>
on this or that to pass the time. I like the easy<br/>
recipies though even if they cost me more. After all<br/>
it&#39;s not hard to make a few thousand plat if I really<br/>
need to. And along that line, does anyone know a<br/>
simple smithing recipie to use from 88. I just made<br/>
shields till 88. It was easy and all the parts could<br/>
be gotten in one convient spot. Now I&#39;m looking for<br/>
something simple. But baking is the easiest to raise<br/>
if you&#39;re bored and don&#39;t mind sitting around for a<br/>
while. Fish cakes to 135 (a hearty meal), I caught the<br/>
fish and bought the bat wings. Storm salmon to 202<br/>
(stat food) but I&#39;m forgetting what I have to put with<br/>
it. That&#39;s a lot of fish I&#39;ll tell you though. Again<br/>
you just have to have the patience for the fishing in<br/>
PoS. Anyway just my cooking tip of the day.<br/>
:oP<br/>
