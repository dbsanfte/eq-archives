<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Welcome!&nbsp; Started a Barb Shaman on Firiona Vie 
to see how the roleplay was going.&nbsp; Not enough of it, but a few.&nbsp; 
</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Then was lucky and DAoC right off the bat.&nbsp; It 
costs a gold piece to start a guild (and 500 gold to get a guild emblem for 
cloaks -youch) and gold is 100 silver which is 100 copper.&nbsp; The whole guild 
was wearing old tatters found on low level skeletons but we did get 
guilded.&nbsp; So I&#39;m in Blade of Enric on Percival playing Albion.&nbsp; My 
primary is a cleric, but last night I went to Guinevere, also an RP server and 
started a dwarf Viking (will be a Skald aka Bard) and LOVED it.&nbsp; 
</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Back to She-Wolf&#39;s message.&nbsp; It&#39;s the first 
time in my MMORPG experience I&#39;ve ever had hit-points.&nbsp; I could fight and 
fight and fight and the lower my health got it just meant the lower level mobs I 
took so I didn&#39;t take any greif from them (got to use my hard earned copper for 
real armor as no guild there) and let it build back up.&nbsp; They have combat 
styles, too, sort of like EQ Monks, which take extra energy but hit 
harder.&nbsp; I think I may try an Armsman secondary in Albion instead of a 
sorceror (though sorcerors get speed and running around in Camelot is SO 
SLOW!)</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Anyway, I finally understand the appeal of 
warriors.&nbsp; Man can they take a beating!</font></div>
