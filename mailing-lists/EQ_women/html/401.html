<div id="ygrps-yiv-396081839">The wedding was awesome! We had a wonderful ceremony by Imaryn the head<br/>
guide of the server.  After the ceremony we had a celebration with<br/>
friends.  I hired a caterer who served us some exotic treats, and the wine<br/>
flowed freely.<br/>
<br/>
I think the big ingredient in a fun wedding is having the ceremony<br/>
performed by someone who is friendly and can do it well, and a bunch of<br/>
alcohol and food.  Not too deep but that&#39;s it ;) Location is the most<br/>
important thing to think of.  I chose ocean of tears so we wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
spammed by lots of OOC talk (and the sisters isle was just so perfect for<br/>
Luna).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; NOOOOOOO... I missed another wedding! =(  I had company in town all last week and<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t check my eMail once (missed out on alot of other things too).  I&#39;m so<br/>
&gt; sorry.  How was it? Did it go over well? What little details do you wish you&#39;d<br/>
&gt; planned ahead of time? What advice would you give someone planning a wedding in<br/>
&gt; the near future? *clears her throat and grins shyly*<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And how many people would be interested in attending a wedding on Povar? And what<br/>
&gt; are some sites you all would recommend for a wedding for two 20th level<br/>
&gt; characters?  Please, anyone feel free to answer.  I have absolutely no ideas at<br/>
&gt; the present (course I still have a couple levels to go, and we level slowly, so<br/>
&gt; it could be late December before we actually hit 20) and would welcome ANY.<br/>
