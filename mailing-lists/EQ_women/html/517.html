<div id="ygrps-yiv-980107209">Nope Sandy it is not, I got my husband hooked on the game and now our <br/>
14 year old wants to play too :)<br/>
<br/>
About guilds, well it depends on the guild.  I&#39;m on Prexus and in<br/>
Dragonmarked.  Guilds should be about having fun and grouping when folks<br/>
are on and about the same levels.<br/>
<br/>
We are not about Powerleveling ( and saddly I have seen some guilds that<br/>
do that all the time, which makes the higher levels mad after awhile if<br/>
that is all they have to do in the guild ) or going and getting<br/>
something someone wants.  <br/>
<br/>
Now we do go on outtings, like go and raid Runneye or Unrest to help<br/>
someone get what they want.  But mostly it is alot of grouping and<br/>
jokeing around as we running screaming from a Sand Giant in Oasis, or<br/>
just to have someone come and find a person when they are lost.  <br/>
<br/>
*giggles* Heck with me the guild has a Sense Ran skill.  They are always<br/>
comeing to find me.  I hate Halas, can&#39;t find my way out of there at<br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helped.<br/>
<br/>
Well into they find me again, I pull out a deck of cards and start to<br/>
play solitaire.  Knowing someone will find me just to tell me to put the <br/>
red queen on the black king.<br/>

&gt; Hello again,<br/>
&gt; I hope I am not being a pest, but I would like some info on Guilds.<br/>
&gt; What exactly do they do?  How do you find out which one is right for<br/>
&gt; you?  Should a newbie consider joining one, or wait until higher level.<br/>
&gt; BTW, someone said they started playing this game after their boyfriend<br/>
&gt; got them hooked.  Well, My 15 year old son is the one who got me<br/>
&gt; started!  Pretty sad, huh? lol<br/>
&gt; Thanks for your help,<br/>
