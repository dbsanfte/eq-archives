<div id="ygrps-yiv-487567813">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I have a question for You all, i dont know if anyone else has<br/>
experianced this but well here goes.  I wont go in to which server and<br/>
what characters but on the server that i play on a friend of mine was<br/>
accused of stealing from another player, they say they didnt see the<br/>
other person in the room and the other party involved swears on them<br/>
sitting on top of this item for some reason they have dropped in the<br/>
floor.  Now for the reasons this was in the floor i still dont<br/>
understand.  Now this is me but if something is laying there its open<br/>
for the taking people drop unwanted stuff all the time.  I wont go into<br/>
all the deltails but there was a big todo about it and i was trying to<br/>
talk my friend into giving it back and had them talked into it when the<br/>
other party in question and their friends started threating.  Ok now<br/>
this makes me angery be cause they threaten them with having a GM friend<br/>
delete their character.  By this point i am angery one because i do what<br/>
ever i can to help people, so i let them know how stupid i though this<br/>
whole matter was to try to get someone deleted.... this lovely female if<br/>
she was inturn desided she wanted to call me a bitch while all along i<br/>
am trying to get her her things back in which i did.  Now i will take<br/>
alot but that was something that was uncalled for me knowing if all of<br/>
them had just kept their mouths shut i could have gotten the stuff back<br/>
with out any furth happenings other than what had gone on before i<br/>
logged on.  Has this happened to anyone else or is my server just full<br/>
of rude Arse people?<br/>
