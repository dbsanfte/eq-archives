&gt; Currently out of game, but just bumped into an old old friend and it may just<br/>
&gt; be the little &quot;oomph&quot; I need to go get the last two upgrades and explore some<br/>
&gt; new territory.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have an new thread, though, because it is part of why I&#39;m also not playing<br/>
&gt; in DAoC.  I love to roleplay and have gotten my character into an engagement<br/>
&gt; to a Minstrel .  Well, the problem is the Minstrel is always on and as soon as<br/>
&gt; I log in he comes and spend the whole game with me, I never get to solo<br/>
&gt; anymore, I never get to group, and he&#39;s a horrible player so I end up doing<br/>
&gt; more dying than I can stand.  It&#39;s made me kind of not want to play, but I am<br/>
&gt; so bad at hurting people&#39;s feelings I don&#39;t know how to just say &quot;Um, mind if<br/>
&gt; I solo tonight?&quot;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Suggestions?  He started an alt so he wouldn&#39;t level without me and his alt is<br/>
&gt; now level 28.  I&#39;m feeling REALLY guilty.  I also have a lot more pity for<br/>
&gt; poor Sylvanar *giggles and waves to Josh*<br/>
