 </span></blockquote>Ah well for me, I had the tank frist.  She got the nick name the Crying<br/>
Warrior.  Well because I was lost all the time and crying for help.  I<br/>
gave her a few fears - Boats, and Heights; to make things interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Now when the cleric came around, I had her be the Tank&#39;s twin, and she<br/>
hated spiders but was more gental in actions than the tank.  I aways<br/>
healed folks and still could not find my way around. <br/>
<br/>
When I moved to a new server, I made a wood elf ( Man was I sick of<br/>
being Night Blind ) this one is more like a cleric thank a druid. <br/>
Always healing and helping, but she always fell out of the the trees in<br/>
the Wood Elf City.  So she loves to fly and hates spiders.<br/>
