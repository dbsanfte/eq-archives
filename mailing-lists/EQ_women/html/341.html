<div id="ygrps-yiv-447501875">Hi Everyone!<br/>
<br/>
This is a reminder that the list meeting is tonight at 6pm PST on Brell<br/>
Serelis in East Freeport.  To participate, simply create a newbie human<br/>
and choose Freeport as your home town.  Send a tell to Luna when you get<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
If you already have a character on Brell, you can of course use that<br/>
character.  If you have difficulty getting your character to Freeport for<br/>
the event, consider using a newbie to attend the meeting.<br/>
<br/>
There will be a subsequent newbie hunt for those who wish to hunt and get<br/>
some XP.<br/>
<br/>
