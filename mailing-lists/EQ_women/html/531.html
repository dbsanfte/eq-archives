<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1514004273">One good way to group is to try small groups.  Lots of people seem to<br/>
think that you should try and get groups of 5 or 6, but groups of 2 or 3<br/>
can work really well.<br/>
<br/>
As a druid, you are an ideal partner for a tank.  Pure tanks like warriors<br/>
and rogues are usually happy to group with a healer.<br/>
<br/>
I use to dislike twinking, but over time I have come to understand it.  I<br/>
have twinked myself.  For me twinking is simply to avoid aspects of the<br/>
game that I no longer find as entertaining.  Usually with twinks, as with<br/>
any other players, it&#39;s fairly quick to figure out if they&#39;re decent<br/>
people or not.  If someone is nice, whether they are twinked or not,<br/>
they&#39;re nice.<br/>

&gt; I envy you being a 14 lv druid,  when I tell people I am ONLY lv 6,<br/>
&gt; nobody wants to group with me!  :(<br/>
&gt; As far as grouping,  I have only been in 3 different groups for any<br/>
&gt; length of time (1-6 hours)<br/>
&gt; The first group didn&#39;t know what they were doing.  Of course, neither<br/>
&gt; did I but they abandoned me in Lesser Feydark AND didn&#39;t split the loot<br/>
&gt; fairly.<br/>
&gt; The second group I was with was great!  They were mostly lowbies (more<br/>
&gt; experienced players with fairly low level characters).  Lots of fun, and<br/>
&gt; they really helped me out with strategies and not getting lost (dumb<br/>
&gt; blonde syndrome!)  I don&#39;t believe in twinking (sp?) but it is nice to<br/>
&gt; get advice from more experienced folks.<br/>
&gt; The third group didn&#39;t go so well.  Each person had their own agenda,<br/>
&gt; and couldn&#39;t agree on where to go and what to hunt.  I didn&#39;t stay with<br/>
&gt; them long.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My advice for grouping-make sure everyone agrees on plan of action<br/>
&gt; before you start-including where to go, what to hunt, any quests people<br/>
&gt; are on, and order of looting.<br/>
