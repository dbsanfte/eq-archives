<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-591820507">Hullo, there!  I&#39;m the lurker on the site, since I&#39;m no longer actively<br/>
playing EQ, but I couldn&#39;t bear to give up this group. =)  I played a ranger<br/>
<br/>
named Aelwesara on Povar for a year and a half (if you count beta).<br/>
<br/>
I have actually played male characters in MUDS and other online games, and<br/>
it can be very liberating. &lt;grin&gt; That is, if you don&#39;t mind being treated<br/>
like &quot;one of the guys&quot;.  I didn&#39;t tell anyone I was a girl.  I had fun<br/>
although I think I might have come across as very androgynous. &lt;giggle&gt;<br/>
It&#39;s kind of nice not getting hit on or having people assume you got all<br/>
your stuff because you&#39;re a gurrrrrl...<br/>
<br/>
I know many people who have gotten involved in relationships in EQ.  A<br/>
friend of mine moved across the country to be with a woman he met on EQ.<br/>
She took him for alot of money, dumped him, and it turned out she never told<br/>
<br/>
her other boyfriend she was dissolving their relationship (she played on EQ<br/>
with him too) which was probably because she was living with him rent-free<br/>
at the time.  Another one had to quit playing altogether because a woman he<br/>
was roleplaying with went a bit too far and tracked him down... called his<br/>
home and told his girlfriend she was her &quot;competition.&quot; =(  Needless to say,<br/>
<br/>
the girlfriend was a bit... unsettled, and I really don&#39;t blame her.  There<br/>
are women out there who are just as bad as men when it comes to manipulating<br/>
<br/>
a friendship into something else.  I actually know more guys with sad<br/>
stories from online RPGs than I do girls who&#39;ve been hurt.   I don&#39;t know<br/>
why that is.  I think it might be because when guys roleplay, they&#39;re<br/>
departing from traditional norms in alot of ways, and I think some of them<br/>
do end up &quot;feeling&quot; the emotions more deeply than they initially intended.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I know there are women out there who have been used as<br/>
emotional punching bags and sounding boards by their male roleplay partners,<br/>
<br/>
and that can be even harder to break away from because you don&#39;t know when<br/>
the person is roleplaying and when he&#39;s taking advantage of having a<br/>
faceless person he can dump on.  Either way, just remember that if it<br/>
doesn&#39;t feel good, it&#39;s not what you&#39;re paying ten bucks a month for.<br/>
<br/>
On the OTHER other hand, I met my boyfriend a year and a half ago on EQ, and<br/>
<br/>
started dating last October.  So just like any other forum for meeting<br/>
people, you can strike gold... &lt;grin&gt; It&#39;s just a matter of looking for<br/>
friends and getting lucky and finding more... especially when you least<br/>
expect it!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>
