<div id="ygrps-yiv-341921766">Hi,<br/>
Yes, it has been quiet.  I play Addie Healnbear a level 27 cleric (and a few <br/>
other baby characters) on Tunare.  I&#39;m currently in SK hunting outside of <br/>
Paw.  I seem to be forever stuck on 27 right now.  It is just a little bad <br/>
luck.  I get ahead and a cyclops sneaks up, then too many gnolls for my group <br/>
to handle, etc.  Then real life calls and I log behind in skill unstead of <br/>
ahead.  I know she will get over the hump soon.  I really want some of those <br/>
29 spells ).  Also getting to the point where I can go and pay back those <br/>
Sand Gaints that would womp me in Oasis.  <br/>
