<div id="ygrps-yiv-377665641">Hey there.... So, my mother (the one who has all the money in my house) <br/>
finally said I could order kunark the day it came out. I was amazingly <br/>
excited, since on Everlore they said they would be selling it into May.. so <br/>
I load up EQ, and the store button is GONE. Now tell me, is this an <br/>
AMAZINGLY stupid marketing tactic? Give them no way to order something, i.e. <br/>
giving them no way to PAY you?<br/>
    *Shakes head* it just seems incredibly odd to me.. So I went to <br/>
Wal-mart, and they has the new packs there, and I was wondering.. there was <br/>
only one CD inside. Do you call the 1 888 # for the kunark code then? <br/>
because I was going to give the actual EQ part of it (not kunark) to my <br/>
sister. I hope I can do that, or they had better get the store back.. *grr*<br/>
