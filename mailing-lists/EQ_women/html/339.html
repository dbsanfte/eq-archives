<div id="ygrps-yiv-1984680352">The wedding was wonderful, for those who could not attend.  We were a bit delayed in<br/>
starting because one of the guests kept getting attacked by the guards.  After he<br/>
dispatched 6 of them  in haste, they left him alone and the wedding continued.  Logos<br/>
gave a WONDERFUL service (highly recommend him).  And many were there who remembered<br/>
our first meeting and who had stood by me through Corellon&#39;s long illness.<br/>
<br/>
The wedding night was also disturbed, this time by a Dark Elf whom we dispatched with<br/>
extreme prejudice *grin*.  We are now honeymooning in Unrest, and I got to see the<br/>
great Agathorn today, though the circumstances were less than ideal as he was called to<br/>
mediate a dispute, it was truely wonderful as I had never seen him before.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you&#39;re in Unrest on Quellious, say hi.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m a shmoe.  My dad&#39;s birthday is today, and I totally forgot (I swear, I think I<br/>
&gt; got thrown by that whole 7th/8th Saturday/Sunday thing too).  Dnaice, I wanted so<br/>
&gt; badly to be at your festivities, but there isn&#39;t a way possible.  I hope you will<br/>
&gt; forgive me and appreciate the sentiment that I wanted to be there.  I hope your big<br/>
&gt; day is as wondrous as a girl could wish for, and that you are surrounded by your<br/>
&gt; friends and chosen family, and feel truly loved, respected, and cherished.  I wish<br/>
&gt; you the best of adventures and most glorious of hunts, and I hope Corellon<br/>
&gt; appreciates the treasure he is being gifted with--your love and companionship.<br/>
