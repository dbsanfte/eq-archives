<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-700435663">i too experience this bit of parting ways with friends due to playing<br/>
styles. only, it was my bf (who intro&#39;d me to eq) who went the way of the<br/>
buffalo. i&#39;d rather relax, socialize, whatnot, then get mad at things not<br/>
going my way, dying, etc. i had to tell him to stop playing with me as i&#39;d<br/>
rather our rl relationship to work.<br/>
<br/>
i am an avid rp&#39;er, only outside of eq. i am curious as to how some of you<br/>
go about making your characters come to life. *smiles*<br/>
<br/>
as for online rp&#39;ing...<br/>
try monarchy.shareplay.com -&gt; braggarts hall<br/>
it&#39;s a turn based game, and very simple compared to eq. it&#39;s guild based, or<br/>
not. i enjoy it a lot and have been part of that family for over a year -<br/>
though i have set my kingdoms aside. any questions, and i&#39;d gladly answer.<br/>
<br/>
btw - i am very new to this list, and i must say, so far, i&#39;m very impressed.<br/>

&gt;My EQ partner and I discuss these issues alot. We&#39;re both non-competitive,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>have as much fun as you can, love-to-explore-and-do-quests kinda gals. We&#39;ve<br/>
both been playing for well over a year and our primaries are still low<br/>
thirties. <br/>

&gt;The saddest issue I&#39;ve had to come to terms with in EQ is my friends who in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the early days used to love to do all the above mentioned, but have since<br/>
become power levellers and (shudders as she says it) *Kewl Lewt* campers.<br/>
From what used to be a friends list that was always crammed with 20 names,<br/>
its down to low teens now as my friends have slowly turned away from the fun<br/>
playing times we used to have. A couple of &quot;Bless-Yer-Heart&quot; friends have<br/>
played as we always have and I thank the Gods for them, they&#39;ve kept me<br/>
playing EQ. The others I have learned to wish the best and let them go their<br/>
own way without any hurt feelings.<br/>

&gt;You know, the most amazing part to me is when I do group with strangers and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>do my role-playing thing, within the hour, all but the hard-core powergamers<br/>
are rp&#39;ing back with me and having a blast. Go figure.<br/>

&gt;So, would I play a RP-devoted on-line game. Where the heck do I sign up? <br/>
