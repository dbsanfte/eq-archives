<br/>
Pretty much any time is ok with me as i play often, but if i had to miss a<br/>
meeting i could just catch the next one, I think (my opinion only, which i<br/>
love to introduce) that we should have a weekly gathering, like every monday<br/>
or every thursday from 6-8.. then everyone who is on can come and chat or<br/>
whatever.. does this make any sense.. lol<br/>
<br/>
I for one have a very busy schedule and if i knew that every monday nite<br/>
everyone would be online i would try and be there, u know what i mean.. ok,<br/>
what do u think......<br/>

&gt; I only got three votes! I&#39;m hoping that means everyone else was ok with<br/>
&gt; all the times.  I am nervous setting the time for the meeting based on<br/>
&gt; only three votes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m going to wait another couple days to let people vote.  If all times<br/>
&gt; are ok with you, please send me an email saying that.  That will let<br/>
&gt; reassure me that people will come 8)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll post new times, based on feedback from people who can&#39;t attend,<br/>
&gt; and the delay of another vote taking.  I really hope people will come!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Meeting times:<br/>
&gt;   - Saturday 14th 10am-12pm PST<br/>
&gt;   - Monday 16th 6-8pm PST<br/>
&gt;   - Tuesday 17th 6-8pm PST<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope these times work out for people.  Please send in your vote or<br/>
&gt; &#39;all of them are fine&#39; 8)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you would like to join the guild before that, Luna and Briei (Beth&#39;s<br/>

&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As you may recall Suzanne was organizing an online meeting for mailing<br/>
&gt; list.  We chatted and agreed that Brell Serelis would be a great server to<br/>
&gt; have the meeting on.  This way we can all meet eachother, and also have a<br/>
&gt; subsequent guild event.  The subsequent event would be a newbie hunt,<br/>
&gt; during which newbies could hunt critters, and higher level guild members<br/>
&gt; could help them out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d like to hold a brief vote on the time and place of the meeting on<br/>
&gt; brell.  The time matters because we all have different schedules.  The<br/>
&gt; place only matters in terms of where the newbie hunt will take place.<br/>
&gt; Please respond to this email if you have a preference (if you don&#39;t care,<br/>
&gt; you dont need to respond).  If any given meeting time is impossible for<br/>
&gt; you, please say that, I&#39;ll try and minimize those conflicts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Meeting places:<br/>
&gt;     - Greater Faydark stone ring (kelethin newbie zone)<br/>
&gt;     - East Freeport newbie zone<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Meeting times:<br/>
&gt;     - Tuesday August 10th 6pm-8pm PST<br/>
&gt;     - Thursday August 10th 6pm-8pm PST<br/>
&gt;     - Saturday August 14th 10am-12pm PST<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Vote will be closed friday at 6pm PST and I&#39;ll post the results that<br/>
&gt; evening.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d like to use the guild chat feature to make our meeting easier.  Even<br/>
&gt; if you&#39;re not planning on playing on Brell, you can make a newbie and join<br/>
&gt; the guild, to use this feature.  It allows us to send tells to our entire<br/>
&gt; guild, so we can hear conversation even if we&#39;re not exactly in the same<br/>
&gt; physical area.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d also like to suggest an unofficial guild hunt Saturday August 7th at<br/>
&gt; noon PST.  The location will be wherever the official one will be held<br/>
&gt; (results posted Friday evening).  This is for those of us who&#39;d like to<br/>
&gt; get into playing together ASAP.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Online Gaming Gender Rant<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think I could write a whole book ranting about online gender<br/>
&gt; presentation, assumption of heterosexuality, and how queer people basicly<br/>
&gt; get screwed over, but I&#39;ll try and make this brief 8)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First of all, let&#39;s put Everquest in it&#39;s true class: Virtual Reality.  It<br/>
&gt; may be primitive, but it is virtual reality, and to anyone who&#39;s ever had<br/>
&gt; someone tap them on the shoulder because they&#39;ve been talking to you for<br/>
&gt; five minutes and you haven&#39;t heard a damned thing knows, it&#39;s immersive<br/>
&gt; virtual reality.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; People naturally try and relate to their virtual reality experience like<br/>
&gt; they would to their real life experience.  This doesn&#39;t mean they take<br/>
&gt; everything as seriously (otherwise death would reallly suck) but they will<br/>
&gt; naturally impose real life qualities in terms of how them form<br/>
&gt; relationships and socialize online.  These natural social tendancies may<br/>
&gt; be modified by concious choice, but at the root they are all there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; People are used to classifying another person&#39;s gender.  You don&#39;t walk up<br/>
&gt; to someone on the street (usually) and say &quot;you look like a boy, you act<br/>
&gt; like a boy, are you a boy?&quot; We&#39;re expected to recognize these qualities,<br/>
&gt; classify the person as a boy, and then relate to them as a boy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; People do this same thing naturally in EQ, though not to as an extreme.<br/>
&gt; For example:<br/>
&gt;     - You see a male character, you assume this is a male player, you&#39;d<br/>
&gt;       probably need to be told outright by the person they were female<br/>
&gt;       to believe otherwise.<br/>
&gt;     - You see a female character, things are more complicated:<br/>
&gt;         - Most people will not try and classify her gender directly I<br/>
&gt;           think.  They&#39;ll be aware that most female EQ characters are<br/>
&gt;           played by males.  This introduces gender confusion.  They don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;           know how to really deal with a person with a female body but<br/>
&gt;           a male mind so they&#39;ll basicly treat the person like a female<br/>
&gt;           on the surface, but probably not commit to their gender.<br/>
&gt;         - If that female character exhibits behavioral characteristics<br/>
&gt;           that seem female it is very comfortable to allow your gender<br/>
&gt;           &#39;no commitment&#39; stance to slip into &#39;this person is a female<br/>
&gt;           in real life&#39;.<br/>
&gt;         - Likewise if this character exhibits male characteristics,<br/>
&gt;           the person may slip into the assumption the player is male.<br/>
&gt;           All this avoids the need to ask the person what their gender is.<br/>
&gt;         - FLIRTING OF ANY KIND is assumed to indicate gender under the<br/>
&gt;           assumption the player is heterosexual.<br/>
&gt;         - Some people are aware enough of the complexity of online gender,<br/>
&gt;           and care enough about real life gender, to skip all this and ask<br/>
&gt;           (usually to confirm their assumptions)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Queer people get screwed by this in many ways.  Lots of people who<br/>
&gt; probably wouldn&#39;t ID as queer also get screwed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The above rules are arbitrary, and dumb! They are the rules most people go<br/>
&gt; by.  If a person decides on your real life gender by these rules, even<br/>
&gt; worse if a group of people decide on your gender, their is the fundamental<br/>
&gt; assumption that you actively deceived them.  Lets not pull punches,<br/>
&gt; everyone who decides your gender, when you reveal you are of the other<br/>
&gt; gender, will basicly have their entire gender model of you flipped upside<br/>
&gt; down.  This will create confusion, and potentially hostility.  Of course<br/>
&gt; anyone who is not a jerk should realize that their assumptions were wrong,<br/>
&gt; but most people are jerks about gender.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So what can you do to protect yourself in this environment?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You can be up front about your real-life gender.  This will however to<br/>
&gt; some degree prevent you from getting into intense gender interaction with<br/>
&gt; people as a member of your online perceived gender.  Playing a person of<br/>
&gt; the opposite gender in EQ is a great way to explore gender in a fun<br/>
&gt; environment.  Exploring gender is fun and good.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You can be passive about your gender.  This is what our list boys have<br/>
&gt; done.  They let people assume their genders as females, since they didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; actively in this way deceive anyone.  I think this is perfectly 100% ok.<br/>
&gt; Now however they&#39;re getting screwed over by the realization that they can<br/>
&gt; no longer safely come out without alienating some of their friends.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You can lie outright about your gender.  I think this is perfectly ok as<br/>
&gt; well.  Why? Because you&#39;re not hurting anyone.  Really the gender / sexual<br/>
&gt; orientation hangups of other people is not our problem.  Really, our<br/>
&gt; gender in real life is irrelevant to the game of Everquest.  People<br/>
&gt; demand to know real life gender because they have hangups about online /<br/>
&gt; real life gender continuity.  Tough luck! It&#39;s not your responsibility to<br/>
&gt; support their environment where they have this kind of knowledge.  You<br/>
&gt; never aksed to be part of that environment.  You can also say &quot;I won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; answer that question&quot; but people will eventually assume you&#39;re not of your<br/>
&gt; perceived gender, and they&#39;ll mistrust you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; People don&#39;t like to lie.  They like to be honest, especially with people<br/>
&gt; they have good social relationships with.  I think it&#39;s important to<br/>
&gt; realize that an relationship in an online virtual reality is not like a<br/>
&gt; real life social relationship.  Unless you are going to have some kind of<br/>
&gt; real life social relationship with someone online, I think it&#39;s perfectly<br/>
&gt; reasonable to lie about your gender, your sexual orientation, anything if<br/>
&gt; it creates an environment you&#39;re more comfortable with.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We are the queer gender-exploring fringe, moving into an online virtual<br/>
&gt; environment.  The straight heterosexist establishment is imposing on VR<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s own moral code, but I feel no need to participate in it.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; The times are fine.<br/>
&gt; Kelethin is a bit of a problem since my &quot;goodie&quot; girls are in Qeynos, and<br/>
&gt; my chars in the Western Antonica area would not want to be within 20 feet<br/>
&gt; of a dying Crushbone Orc ;).  (without helping the orc of course).  Any<br/>
&gt; relief for the &quot;evil among you&quot;?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do have a young Cleric I made with my last open slot that I&#39;m toying<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; the idea of tagging her with the guild name, as per the suggestion of<br/>
&gt; communicating via guild chat.  However as I wanted her to worship Rodcet<br/>
&gt; Nife, she started in Qeynos and at 2 would be unable to traverse Highpass<br/>
&gt; :(.  Should I contanct Luna IG to get her tagged for chat though?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Lora<br/>
&gt; (still abhors the name with its NPC connection, but loves the idea)<br/>
&gt; At least 3 of my &quot;bad&quot; girls intend to hunt the NPC sisters ;?<br/>
&gt; Though the irony of a female character named Deceit with the &quot;Sisterhood<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; Erollisi&quot; guild tag hunting the NPC Sisters of Erollisi would be *very*<br/>
&gt; amusing.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you&#39;d like to more easily participate in the chat/social aspect of the<br/>
&gt; meeting, why not make a 1st level character whose only purpose is to<br/>
&gt; participate in the chat?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As far as real characters go, Luna is hunting in South Karana, so I can<br/>
&gt; add you to the guild.  Maybe you&#39;re far from your sisters now, but when<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re higher level you can meet up with us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As far as hunting the Sisters go, this depends on your roleplay<br/>
&gt; inclinations.  You could just write it off as XP farming and forget about<br/>
&gt; it.  You could decide you were an infiltraitor of the sisterhood, and make<br/>
&gt; sure that any (NPC) sister who saw you fighting another died before she<br/>
&gt; could tell the others.  No matter what, it&#39;s a difficult situation to<br/>
&gt; roleplay, but look at it as a challenge 8)<br/>

&gt; &gt; communicating via guild chat.  However as I wanted her to worship Rodcet<br/>
&gt; &gt; Nife, she started in Qeynos and at 2 would be unable to traverse<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Hi everyone,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;As you may recall Suzanne was organizing an online meeting for mailing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;list.  We chatted and agreed that Brell Serelis would be a great server<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;have the meeting on.  This way we can all meet eachother, and also have<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;subsequent guild event.  The subsequent event would be a newbie hunt,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;during which newbies could hunt critters, and higher level guild<br/>
members<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;could help them out.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;d like to hold a brief vote on the time and place of the meeting on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;brell.  The time matters because we all have different schedules.  The<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;place only matters in terms of where the newbie hunt will take place.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Please respond to this email if you have a preference (if you don&#39;t<br/>
care,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;you dont need to respond).  If any given meeting time is impossible for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;you, please say that, I&#39;ll try and minimize those conflicts.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Meeting places:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;    - Greater Faydark stone ring (kelethin newbie zone)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;    - East Freeport newbie zone<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Meeting times:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;    - Tuesday August 10th 6pm-8pm PST<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;    - Thursday August 10th 6pm-8pm PST<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;    - Saturday August 14th 10am-12pm PST<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Vote will be closed friday at 6pm PST and I&#39;ll post the results that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;evening.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;d like to use the guild chat feature to make our meeting easier.<br/>
Even<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;if you&#39;re not planning on playing on Brell, you can make a newbie and<br/>
join<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;the guild, to use this feature.  It allows us to send tells to our<br/>
entire<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;guild, so we can hear conversation even if we&#39;re not exactly in the<br/>
same<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;physical area.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;d also like to suggest an unofficial guild hunt Saturday August 7th<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;noon PST.  The location will be wherever the official one will be held<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;(results posted Friday evening).  This is for those of us who&#39;d like to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;get into playing together ASAP.<br/>

&gt; &gt; we&#39;re having a discussion about when online gender<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Actually the 2nd level cleric is the low level char, her name is Ysabel<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; is based in Qeynos.  Since, I&#39;m moving to Brell, all 8 slots will be<br/>
&gt; &quot;real&quot;, but I used my last open to make something that shouldn&#39;t have a<br/>
&gt; conflict with tagging.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Though I&#39;d love to attend a get together sometime as one of my<br/>
&gt; &quot;bad/neutral&quot; girls, perhaps we could alternate meetings between a good<br/>
&gt; area (Faydark) and a neutral one?  Or at least one where I don&#39;t risk<br/>
&gt; inappropriate faction hits even if I just stand there.  I just don&#39;t want<br/>
&gt; to risk them becoming KOS in thier hometown/best non-good supply town to<br/>
&gt; attend a meeting :(  But I&#39;d like to come too :(  Even if my idea for<br/>
&gt; Ysabel &quot;works&quot; and I end up with one tagged character who will eventually<br/>
&gt; get enough exp to travel to Faydark safely, it would be nice for me to<br/>
&gt; share my other RPing side with other females on occasion if the get<br/>
&gt; togethers end up being regular.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I only pointed that out about Deceit since I found the irony amusing.  I<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; not intend on having that char tagged, unless my RP angle changes with<br/>
her.<br/>
&gt;  Deceit noticed you in S Karana, you also asked her for daggers as Luna<br/>
&gt; when they were both in S. Ro a few days ago btw.<br/>

Ogress)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; CONGRATULATIONS!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last night when the East Coast router was down, Corellon could not get on<br/>
so we<br/>
&gt; chatted in Yahoo instead.  The disadvantage was not being able to look<br/>
into his<br/>
&gt; eyes.  The advantage was no interruptive shouts, casting, ooc, auctions<br/>
etc.<br/>
&gt; *grin*  We discussed the honeymoon and both agreed &quot;PG&quot; and he said he is<br/>
not a<br/>
&gt; minor *really, a BIG concern on my part* so we can play it a little more<br/>
adult<br/>
&gt; *grin*.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for the RL thing, we both share the same fear.  We got into it a<br/>
little, out<br/>
&gt; of curiousity, neither of us wanting to lose the fun of the roleplay.  He<br/>
guessed<br/>
&gt; I was 21 *bwahahahahahah*  I don&#39;t think knowing he was off by 25 years<br/>
was the<br/>
&gt; best news he heard all night, but on the other hand the roleplay at the<br/>
time went<br/>
&gt; well.  And we had a good time travelling back to Freeport, but got<br/>
disconnected<br/>
&gt; once there as he smiths and orders started pouring in as soon as he showed<br/>
up on<br/>
&gt; /w and I got about 10 requests for binds and had bows and arrows to sell<br/>
and and<br/>
&gt; and - it was like being in a busy city - I hated it *grin*.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I still don&#39;t know if it has an effect.  This morning started out okay,<br/>
then he<br/>
&gt; announced he thinks our characters are on the wrong servers and we should<br/>
bring<br/>
&gt; the humans to Vallon since he doesn&#39;t want to be a warrior and lose his<br/>
favorite<br/>
&gt; weapon to another player (MEN!).  I was TOTALLY disappointed as I like my<br/>
&gt; Barbarian shaman a lot, even if she is only 4.  And before we had a chance<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; talk, he went afk, then returned with &quot;gotta go&quot; which is more abrupt than<br/>
&gt; normal.  An old friend had just popped in out of nowhere.  So I suddently<br/>
felt<br/>
&gt; like it HAD mattered, and also feel like I&quot;m overly paranoid.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The good news is I switched to Quellious, met up with one of my<br/>
bridesmaids and<br/>
&gt; her ranger friend, we hunted and the more I thought the more I realized it<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; just bad timing.  Well, this couple (though not anything but friends they<br/>
protest<br/>
&gt; overly much all the time *grin*) is also human on Vallon so I think I&#39;ll<br/>
honor<br/>
&gt; Cor&#39;s request and we&#39;ll move our humans there only instead of being a<br/>
cleric to<br/>
&gt; his monk, I&#39;m going to be a Druid and Sibonay&#39;s little sister.  Her<br/>
friend,<br/>
&gt; Tenadar on Quellious is a  monk, Andus, so we&#39;d be matched couples. And<br/>
now it<br/>
&gt; sounds kind of fun.  As all four of us roleplay, we should have a blast.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And if it does affect the roleplay then it is better to find out now,<br/>
right?  The<br/>
&gt; problem is if one partner wants it to evolve into more than it can ever be<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; the other does not.  As it can&#39;t on my part, that was my concern (leading<br/>
him<br/>
&gt; along) and that being settled is probably important.  And if he starts<br/>
sleeping<br/>
&gt; instead of playing with me, it&#39;s probabaly a good thing too.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Greetings everyone!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &lt;ooc&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well it seems I may have spoken just a bit too soon, lol!<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Yesterday I wrote that I expected to have to face the<br/>
&gt; &gt; honeymoon roleplay eventually.  Well, it seems eventually<br/>
&gt; &gt; is coming sooner than I thought! &lt;g&gt;  Ok, ok, I&#39;ll spit<br/>
&gt; &gt; it out. :-)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &lt;ic&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Last night Rezok proposed to me ... and I accepted!! :-)<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Isn&#39;t it thrilling?! &lt;claps her hands in excitement&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We&#39;ve not set a date or ironed out any plans yet.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think I was just too excited being *betrothed* to think<br/>
&gt; &gt; clearly on all the details.  And oh! there&#39;s so many<br/>
&gt; &gt; details. &lt;mind races&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It was sooooo romantic.  He secretly planned to have two<br/>
&gt; &gt; of our closest friends there to witness.  And then he<br/>
&gt; &gt; recited a beautiful poem to me ... the last line of which<br/>
&gt; &gt; was &quot;Will you marry me, we&#39;d make quite a pair&quot;.  I sat<br/>
&gt; &gt; stunned for a moment, then blurted out &quot;Really?&quot; (what a<br/>
&gt; &gt; fool I felt later).  It took me some doing to find my<br/>
&gt; &gt; voice and answer &quot;YES&quot; ... poor fellow had to sit there<br/>
&gt; &gt; and wait while I got my brain to working again. &lt;s&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyways, I could ramble on and on ... so I&#39;ll spare you<br/>
&gt; &gt; all. :-)  Once we have the wedding details ironed out, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; shall let you all know ... for of course, you&#39;re all<br/>
&gt; &gt; invited. &lt;s&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Safe travels,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Wynsong<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; P.S. - Dnaice, I shall try very hard to attend your<br/>
&gt; &gt; wedding. :-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;It is so interesting to read one another&#39;s experiences.  We are<br/>
starting<br/>
&gt; &gt; to talk a bit more<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;about RL, he has a Golden Retriever, lives in VA, etc.  He knows<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am a CS and AI is my hobby<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;(I explained I had learned why he runs around in circles and then<br/>
&gt; &gt; disappers and his brain<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;went into overdrive *smile*).  I suspect he may be a student as he<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t have &quot;regular&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;work hours, but then I&#39;m &quot;on the beach&quot; at work since the recent<br/>
&gt; &gt; take-over obsoleted my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;technology so one never really knows *smile*.   I did make my first<br/>
&gt; &gt; reference to &quot;our&quot; when<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;discussing missing my dog (OES, she died 2 mos. ago) and he didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; cringe outwardly.  Didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;comment either so it could have gone right over his head.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Okay, I&#39;m neurotic.  I&#39;m afraid if he finds out I&#39;m a married mother<br/>
&gt; &gt; of 2 he might lose<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;interest and he is the most fun part of the game.  *sigh*  This is<br/>
&gt; &gt; worse then RL.  Oh, and as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;for the toilets, I noticed their lack when I got drunk and needed<br/>
&gt; &gt; to throw up.  There was no<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;place to puke!  Very embarassing.  And as my aclohol level is 3,<br/>
&gt; &gt; the wedding party itself may<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;be a disaster.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;The honeymoon will definitely be PG.  I sort of view this is my<br/>
equivalent<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the romance<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;novel *grin*.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Troxfo on Vallon Zek<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;P.S.  The wedding is Sunday, Aug. 7 at the Temple of Marr (outside)<br/>
&gt; &gt; in N. Freeport on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Quellious Server.  5 PM Pacific, 6 PM Mountain, 7 PM Central, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; 8 PM Eastern.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;P.P.S.  When we roleplay we do it in talk rather than say - but our<br/>
&gt; &gt; /ems have been known to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;produce a lot of puking and &quot;Get a room&quot; comments from those around<br/>
&gt; &gt; us *smile*<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; You bring up a bridge that I know I will have to cross eventually<br/>
&gt; &gt; as well.  My character,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Wynsong, is very serious about a high elf named Rezok on Fenin<br/>
&gt; &gt; Ro.  OOC, I know very<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; little about the person behind the character save that he&#39;s male,<br/>
&gt; &gt; a few years younger<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; than me, and married (his r/l wife plays a character that is like<br/>
&gt; &gt; a big sister to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Wynsong).  Because I&#39;m very happily married in r/l, very soon into<br/>
&gt; &gt; the rp &quot;relationship&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I set some expectations that the relationship was rp-only ... which<br/>
&gt; &gt; his response was &quot;of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; course&quot;  (what a relief that was).  I felt stupid bringing it up<br/>
&gt; &gt; at all, but after some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; experiences in Realm where ppl wanted the char&#39;s relationship to<br/>
&gt; &gt; spill over to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; players, I learned to speak up front to avoid sticky situations<br/>
&gt; &gt; later.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; As for the honeymoon ... you can rp that any way you wish.  It<br/>
&gt; &gt; depends upon what &quot;rating&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;g&gt; you want that portion of the rp to be.  It can simply be the<br/>
&gt; &gt; two of you &quot;retire&quot; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the honeymoon suite and then chat about the weather while everyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; accepts that it&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; wedding night.  You could decide to go on a trip to a &quot;romantic&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; spot in Norrath and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; hunt, explore, etc.  Or if you wish, you could take the roleplay<br/>
&gt; &gt; further ....   To me,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the roleplaying is about how the character(s) is perceived in<br/>
Norrath.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  So that doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mean I have to roleplay every single detail.  Heck, we don&#39;t roleplay<br/>
&gt; &gt; going to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; bathroom or showering or any of the hundreds of mundane (or not<br/>
&gt; &gt; so mundane) personal<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; things we do irl.  Personally, my honeymoon will probably be rated<br/>
&gt; &gt; pg to pg-13 &lt;g&gt; ...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Disney would prolly be able to put it in one of their movies, lol.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  But the concept of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; honeymoon will be there<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; for everyone (us, friends, &quot;family&quot;) ... and that&#39;s the important<br/>
&gt; &gt; part.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; As a side note ... I did have a marriage on Realm and while the<br/>
&gt; &gt; characters were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; roleplaying their &quot;true love&quot; for the world ... the other player<br/>
&gt; &gt; and I would be /t&#39;ing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; each other chatting about all kinds of &lt;ic&gt; and &lt;ooc&gt; stuff.  When<br/>
&gt; &gt; it came time for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; honeymoon, we retired to the bedroom while our friends partied<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the next room ... and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; just joked around and chatted some more.  For the role play, we<br/>
&gt; &gt; had gone to the marriage<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; bed ... for us, the players, we had not crossed any lines that<br/>
&gt; &gt; would complicate our<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; personal r/l relationships.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Ok, well I&#39;ve rambled enough.  Thanks for putting up with it as<br/>
&gt; &gt; I thought through my own<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; eventual situation.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As my character is marrying on Sunday I must confess to a few<br/>
&gt; &gt; minor qualms.  In<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; particular, er, how does one roleplay a honeymoon *smile*.  Unlike<br/>
&gt; &gt; many who<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; develop relationships in Norrath, my beloved and I are unknown<br/>
&gt; &gt; to one another in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; RL.  For all I know he weighs 300 pounds, guzzles beer, and is<br/>
&gt; &gt; hygenically<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; challenged *smile*<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; There are times if I wonder if this is a positive thing to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; doing.  I mean,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; what if he is some starry eyed adolescent and I ruin him for<br/>
&gt; &gt; life *grin*.  I know<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; MY lines are clearly drawn in fuzz (okay, I think I know the<br/>
&gt; &gt; difference between<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; reality and fantasy though I swear I saw a Pixie Trickster in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the airport the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; other day *grin*).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Anyway, this is all fun and games and I am having fun.  But there<br/>
&gt; &gt; is this part in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the back of my mind that wonders.  Because unlike reading romance<br/>
&gt; &gt; novels (blech -<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; persish the thought) there is another person involved in my little<br/>
&gt; &gt; fantasy and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; must never forget that.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Any other hard core role players out there struggle with these<br/>
&gt; &gt; ridiculous<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; issues?  Any other players over the age of 25, for that matter<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Greetings everyone! =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just wanted to introduce myself. I am Jax Elysium (or Jaxy) who<br/>
&gt; originated from Qeynos in the land of Karana, but recently have had a<br/>
&gt; change of heart and a sort of metamorphisis to an extremely sad and<br/>
&gt; lonely child of Innoruk on Vallon Zek.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t quite understand, but realize that sometimes the Gods dont&#39;<br/>
&gt; explain why or what they do when they play with their mortal children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was hoping to find someone on this list who also serves the will of<br/>
&gt; the Dark Lord who would say Hi or something on Vallon Zek.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ooc:  otherwise I&#39;m a 29 year old newlywed! (got married July 1st) and<br/>
&gt; my husband and I met on meridian59 two years ago and are extremely<br/>
&gt; happy! Only problem is that we only have one computer, so we don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; a chance to explore and play together =((<br/>
&gt; But we still watch each other play and we both love EQ!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; anyways just wanted to introduce myself to y&#39;all!!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Whoops, that last message was actually intended for EQ_rainbow, where<br/>
&gt; &gt; we&#39;re having a discussion about when online gender and real life gender<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t coincide.  That&#39;s what I get for running two mailing lists 8)<br/>
