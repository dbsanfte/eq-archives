<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hiya, Judy. =)&nbsp; Well, it&#39;s hard to kick the 
habit but essentially schoolwork pretty much demanded it.&nbsp; I took two 
accelerated courses this summer and that really kicked my butt, which made it 
aLOT easier to say goodbye.&nbsp; Also, Verant had upset me personally over my 
account (which I&#39;d had since March of &#39;99, without EVER missing a payment, thank 
you very much), and there was the whole fact that Celedhros and I were finding 
that our battle plans were starting to take on the complexity of a good Othello 
match. &lt;grin&gt;&nbsp; Two rangers can be VERY effective, if the rangers in 
question are very, very careful...&nbsp; anyway, it was all getting to be a bit 
much, and school comes first.&nbsp;</font></div>

the fangs for, right?</font></div>

  bizillion alts in my lifetime (sigh).&nbsp; </font></div>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">Anyway, the good news about rangers is how bad 
  the rep is.&nbsp; I play a ranger on TP, the new server.&nbsp; At 12 I got an 
  Ebony Blade because I was the only ranger anyone in the group knew.&nbsp; 
  Another one went up on the boards because no one in that group knew any 
  rangers ;-)&nbsp; </font></div>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">I play, when possible which it hasn&#39;t been in 
  forever, with a now 55 ranger on Brell (sylvanar, I play Iceiallana, a 54 
  druid).&nbsp; He has no trouble getting groups anymore.&nbsp; A lot of the 
  flack is over and it has turned into a huge joke.&nbsp;&nbsp; I get some grief 
  for being a ranger, but there are only 22 of us on the new server (giggles) 
  and since casters outnumber tanks 3:1 now, anyone who can tank is wanted for 
  groups.</font></div>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">As for kicking the habit, congratulatoins.&nbsp; 
  I&#39;ve come close twice but never succeeded.&nbsp; &lt;sigh&gt;</font></div>
