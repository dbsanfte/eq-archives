<br/>
Thanks for the information.<br/>

Wow, five games at once, does that work OK. What are<br/>
you using; DSL . . . cable . . . ?<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m going to end up buying a second copy for a<br/>
second system, but as I&#39;ve been using the cards it&#39;s<br/>
only a little more to run two copies with a long term<br/>
pre pay then to run one with the cards. So, no big<br/>
loss financially anyway. (Just have to buy a second<br/>
computer first.)<br/>

&gt; Since you don&#39;t need the cd to run the game you can<br/>
&gt; use one CD to load the game onto all of your<br/>
&gt; computers, and run EQ on as many computers as you<br/>
&gt; have at once. (Get up to 5 games of eq going at once<br/>
&gt; in my house!) The problem is that you cannot run the<br/>
&gt; same account on more than 1 computer at a time, and<br/>
&gt; you have to reqister a differnet CD for every<br/>
&gt; account. Example: When PoP came out we had to buy 5<br/>
&gt; copies of the game because we have 5 accounts (me<br/>
&gt; plus 4 roomates), but we only used one of the CD&#39;s<br/>
&gt; to install the expansion onto the computers. When it<br/>
&gt; came time to register our expnasions we opened the<br/>
&gt; rest of the boxes and each grabbed a cd so that we<br/>
&gt; would each have our own registration code.<br/>
