<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882505363">I wish my hubbie played.  It would add to our togetherness.  OTOH,<br/>
when he is gone for meetings, he knows where I am and sort of whom<br/>
I am with.  I was actually twinked by an ex-lover.  I got that<br/>
affair stuff out of my system with my current husband, but I AM<br/>
hooking people up with each other, and helping people online.<br/>
That&#39;s just waht I do.<br/>
<br/>
Wish I could find an ambitious, intelligent woman who games to hook<br/>
up to my oldest son, almost 19.  He has NO direction in his life.<br/>
Just thinks about EQ and wargames.<br/>

Our propaganda machine is promising the Iraqi people that, upon<br/>
deposing Sadam, we will provide them with free universal health<br/>
care.   How can I become an Iraqi?<br/>
