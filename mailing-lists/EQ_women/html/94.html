<b>Subject:</b> Re: Twinking?? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-277814100">I don&#39;t have a problem with twinking new characters as a way to more <br/>
quickly get them up to a level where they can interact with other existing <br/>
characters.  I&#39;ve personally just yesterday started one major twink.  We <br/>
always seem to have a shortage of clerics, so I created a dwarven cleric <br/>
and equipped it with my 36th level character&#39;s backup armor.  This means <br/>
several pieces of bronze (including chest and helmet), lizard cloak and <br/>
mantle, bear hide belt, and everything else banded.  And a mucking bit <br/>
2handed blunt weapon called Midnight Mallet that I picked up at an auction <br/>
(11 damage, 44 delay, sometimes squashes 1st level monsters in one hit).<br/>
<br/>
The dwarf&#39;s name is Staar. In the description area of the character I wrote <br/>
&quot;Twinkle twinkle little Staar, what a twinked-up Dwarf you are. Armored up <br/>
in shiny bronze -- that stuff&#39;s not from Orcish pawns!  - Windsong&quot;<br/>
