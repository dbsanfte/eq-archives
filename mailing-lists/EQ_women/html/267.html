<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369580617">Hi Melissa,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not too sure about that one myself, the chaste part, I took it from<br/>
actual conversations with the sisters on the isle.  My best guess is that<br/>
the sisters strive to be chaste because they don&#39;t want their love to be<br/>
bound and focussed on any one person.  I&#39;d like to see the whole chaste<br/>
thing as a role playing element we can use if we want to, and not use if<br/>
we don&#39;t want to.<br/>
<br/>
As for the men-protecting-the-women thing, it can be taken that way, but<br/>
it doesn&#39;t have to.  I was basicly just trying to identify a nice way in<br/>
which men could be incoroporated into the guild.  Your character could<br/>
choose to not have a warder, and that would be a valid choice.  If I were<br/>
to have a warder, I would see him as a default following of Erollisi<br/>
looking to serve his god, and not as someone I needed for protection.<br/>
Others might choose to define their relationship with their Warder in a<br/>
different way (love, protection, siblings, or even the sister protecting<br/>
the Warder?)<br/>
<br/>
All the role playing background can and should be taken on an &quot;if you want<br/>
to use it&quot; basis.<br/>

A couple of comments on the guild ideas as given... first, why would sisters <br/>
dedicated to the Goddess of Love be chaste?  The idea seems wrong to me; the <br/>
opposite seems much more likely.  The other thing that bothers me is the idea of <br/>
<br/>
the Warders - why do a group of warrior women need men to protect them?  Kind of <br/>
<br/>
implies that even tough warrior women need a big strong man to help them, you <br/>
know?  Maybe we could come up with some other way men could belong?  Maybe the <br/>
men could belong to a brother order, The Brothers of Mithaniel, with a close <br/>
association with the Sisters of Erollisi?<br/>
Other than those two quibbles, I think the idea in general is sound and I would <br/>
enjoy belonging to this guild on a new server.<br/>
