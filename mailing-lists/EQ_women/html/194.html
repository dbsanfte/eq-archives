<div id="ygrps-yiv-423522715">I wanted to respond to an e-mail that I just read this morning about rude people who play EQ. I, for one, have experienced a few rude people, however, I think this is to be expected. Out of all the individuals who play EQ, there are bound to be some people who just don&#39;t interact well with others (why they are playing a &quot;role-playing&quot; game is beyond me....but that&#39;s really not my business.)  There are times when I play that I come across people who don&#39;t wish to interact and that&#39;s ok with me. I just avoid them or move on to greener pastures. :-)  By far, I have met more nice people then rude ones. I have a friends list a mile long and I am sure that it will continue to grow!! I have had times when people in the game make me angry (by stealing a kill etc...) but alls fair in love and war..so they say! :-)  So, relax and enjoy the game...don&#39;t worry about people who are rude or don&#39;t respond well to &quot;role-playing.&quot; EQ is far too fun to let a few individuals ruin it for you!!! <br/>
<br/>
One more thing....AND I HOPE SOMEONE CAN HELP ME!!<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know what to do with Rondo Dunfire&#39;s Tongue?????  I have killed Rondo a couple of times and I have two tongues. I have done some light reasearch via the internet etc...but I can&#39;t seem to find a quest having to do with this item. If anyone knows anything about Rondo&#39;s Tongue...please let me know. I would appreciate it (if it&#39;s trash..I will just throw it away!!!). <br/>
<br/>
Thanks....<br/>
