<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943919479">omg i agree.  i joined just a few dayz ago to meet other girls to play eq <br/>
(we all know how much of a lifestyle it is...) and instead it&#39;s the usually <br/>
guy crap!<br/>

okay, i recently quit a guild that had several prepubecent members...  I <br/>
know for sure we had an 8 year old girl (her parents owned a gaming store <br/>
and she had been involved in D&D her entire life) and a 12 year old boy.  <br/>
That in itself was great!  I was really proud of how well the young people <br/>
were doing on raids and such.  Also, that such young people would choose to <br/>
be anti-pk was a testiment to their character!  (RALLOS ZEK GHETTO FAB!!!)  <br/>
However, as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve all noticed, sometimes guild chat can get rather <br/>
.....  18 and over...  On one particular occasion, the 12 year old young man <br/>
mentioned above was trying to relate to the others his own sexual experience <br/>
to seem more a part of the group.  He wasnt impressing anyone apparently, <br/>
and the older guys were making fun of him and calling him a liar.  He <br/>
addmitted to having fabricated most of the story but insisted he had <br/>
&quot;touched a boob&quot;...  Well the guys thought that was hillarious and proceeded <br/>
to lay into the boy verbally.  I couldnt just sit there so I mentioned he <br/>
was only 12 and told them to let the boy have his childhood.  Then I made <br/>
the observation that it was 10pm on a Saturday night, and they were all <br/>
spending it on the computer...  Unbelieveably they started agreeing with me! <br/>
  By the way they responded to that, I&#39;m starting to wonder if ALL of that <br/>
guild isnt under the age of 16......  I quit the guild for other reasons (if <br/>
anyone has a nice guild 55+ on rallos, lemmie know...  i&#39;m guild shopping) <br/>
but that always bugged me.  EQ is not the right place for your sexual <br/>
frustrations!!!<br/>
