be on.<br/>
<br/>
I need to get back to playing that bard a bit, never played one before<br/>
so it&#39;s an experience. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; What home town did you start in?  And what times are you likely to be on?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here are three character that can add<br/>
&gt; Luna (leader - never know where she&#39;ll be)<br/>
&gt; Ysabel (Qeynos area)<br/>
&gt; Taizu (Freeport area)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Luna certainly knows more.  She&#39;s on a lot, and I work from home many days<br/>
&gt; and if I have a time/place to meet in the game prearranged can usually meet<br/>
&gt; at almost anytime.  (Just can&#39;t stay to hunt if its during my working<br/>
&gt; hours). ;)<br/>

&gt; &gt;I made a character on Brell. I was hoping to hook up with the guild, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt;didn&#39;t see anyone on. How do I join up? </span></blockquote></div>
