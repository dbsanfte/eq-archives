<div id="ygrps-yiv-813570098">oh my that is too funny, a friend of mine called me up and said come <br/>
to the arena and help us take down this necro, im like ok. I get <br/>
ther and we finish off a 50 pally and my friend says go take down <br/>
briyn (lol he goes anon so i had no idea what lvl he was) so i walk <br/>
into the arena and attack and 5 seconds later i was dead. He <br/>
snared , rooted dotted whatever. It is funny how small the world is <br/>
that&#39;s for sure. My friend was like oh my god i was joking hes a 65. <br/>
But i learned a few valuable lessons that day. while i would love to <br/>
spy on him i am now fearful of his capabilities lol.<br/>

&gt; Hey a spy!  My two oldest sons play on Karana.  I would like <br/>
reports on<br/>
&gt; them!  Briyn, 65 druid and Dreadtouch 56 necro.<br/>

&gt; If they act like idiot teenage boys, it&#39;s because they are.<br/>
