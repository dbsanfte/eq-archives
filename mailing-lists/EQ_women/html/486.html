<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466252687">Recently I went into Karndor&#39;s Castle and found 43 players and the ooc<br/>
chat was all &quot;don&#39;t kill steal&quot; bitching at each other.  A few minutes<br/>
later I ported to Emerald Jungle and the only people there was my and my<br/>
friend.  The difference between the two zones?  Karndor&#39;s castle has<br/>
unique drops of great equipment and Emerald Jungle has nothing with loot<br/>
(the MoBs give equivalent experience I found).<br/>
<br/>
I had the opportunity to play with a friend I really like grouping with<br/>
but he was busy in another dungeon because &quot;It has thisg great &lt;class<br/>
specific&gt; sword.&quot;  So we didn&#39;t get to spend the day together.  Another<br/>
friend didn&#39;t want to play because &quot;I need to camp this really important<br/>
piece of equipment and I can&#39;t give up the camp or I&#39;ll lose it&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t played EQ all week and it is the second paragraph that really<br/>
sums up why.  I feel like EQ used to be about friends, RP, and hunting<br/>
together in groups and learning to take new areas and defeat dungeons<br/>
you&#39;d never tried before.  Then it turned into camping and lists.  And<br/>
now it has deteriorated to &quot;things&quot; being more important than &quot;people&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else feel this?  Is it just the people I&#39;ve been hanging out<br/>
with lately being more &quot;thing&quot; than &quot;people&quot; oriented and I should go<br/>
find some new friends?  Or is it that not being the target market of the<br/>
game I just don&#39;t get it and getting the coolest things is really what<br/>
the game is about?<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, my disatisfaction toward EQ of late has been profound.<br/>
Profound enough that I can&#39;t bring myself to log back in.  And I really<br/>
think it is that they tweaked the game for the worse, starting with the<br/>
addition of class specific armor and weaponry.  Suddenly it&#39;s all about<br/>
&quot;stuff&quot;.  Or was it always and I just missed the point?<br/>
<br/>
More importantly, if there were an RP style game tweaked more toward<br/>
people than things, would you play it?  If the game gave points for<br/>
storyline and sometimes favored the underdog (letting the least equipped<br/>
defeat the most equipped like a David and Goliath kind of story) and<br/>
promoted group dynamics with more &quot;realistic&quot; story effects - would that<br/>
be of any interest?<br/>
<br/>
Just doing a bit of &quot;market research&quot; here.  And, yes, I do have an idea<br/>
up my sleeve &lt;grins&gt;.<br/>
