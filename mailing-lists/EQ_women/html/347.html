<div id="ygrps-yiv-1089134227">I have to agree.  Also, you&#39;re much more effective in a group than by<br/>
yourself.  I used to stand at the orc lift and /ooc for fellow adventurers.<br/>
That brought me some companions that I count amongst my closest friends to<br/>
this day.  We would use one person to lure a centurion away from the<br/>
spawning area and bring it back closer to the woods line (and incidentally,<br/>
the path BACK to Kelethin) and then the rest of us would join in and bash<br/>
the snot out of it.  Good, clean fun. &lt;grins&gt;<br/>

&gt;I&#39;d try hunting on Orc Hill.  Orc Hill is near the orc lift, which is the<br/>
&gt;lift in Kelethin that is on an incline.  If you follow the path from<br/>
&gt;there, continuing on after it ends, you should see a hill surrounded by<br/>
&gt;orc tents.  This is a great place to hunt up to level 9.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are lots of orcs on orc hill.  The most important thing to know is<br/>
&gt;how to run to the guards, if you have orcs on you.  That will save your<br/>
&gt;life.  With your speed song, you should be able to outrun the orcs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When you get an orc, try and run on top of the hill, so other orcs won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;wander by and join in on the fight.  They all spawn at the bottom of the<br/>
&gt;hill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Level five is a hard level in greater faydark, but once you get to level 6<br/>
&gt;you&#39;ll find things a lot easier, that&#39;s when you get your healing song.<br/>
