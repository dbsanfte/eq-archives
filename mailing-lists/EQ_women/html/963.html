<div id="ygrps-yiv-579736806">Hi!<br/>
Well, I&#39;m back again although I&#39;m not sure if anyone will even <br/>
remember me. At least this time I have EQ up and running and have <br/>
managed to figure out a few little things.<br/>
<br/>
All of my toons are currently on the Xegony server where my mains are <br/>
all currently enrolled in the guild Hand of Judgement . . .<br/>
Baroness Melwen Shadowbow a High Elf Cleric of Tunare of 61 Seasons &<br/>
Brangvyne Nimloth a Wood Elf Ranger of Tunare of 52 Seasons live.<br/>
My other toons include . . .<br/>
Xenawyr - 55 Druidess<br/>
Moriel - 35 Shadow Knight<br/>
Linnathon - 33 Enchantress<br/>
<br/>
Thought I would pop in and see how everyone was doing or if anyone <br/>
even remembered me etc.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone plays on Xegony I would love to meet you and say hi, or if <br/>
you fall in groupable range of any of those toons to adventure a bit <br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
/Hugs to All<br/>
Bran</div>
