Now what we need is a sruvey on whether ther are ANY women out ther who
play men.&nbsp; I have not yet met a single one, though I did meet a man
playing a woman who said his wife plays a male warrior.&nbsp; I have contemplated
giving it a try, but to be perfectly honest, I&#39;m not sure I want to explore
trying to RPG a male.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s a good thing.&nbsp; I think
it may represent a very real limitation on my take of the world.&nbsp;
Hmmm....
<p>Anyone out there try?
