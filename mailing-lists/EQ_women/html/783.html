&lt;&lt; hey there, Ha, yes that happens to me quite often,<br/>
i am a wood elf ranger so feel for you hon about the<br/>
whole thing, it happened to me again yesterday to be<br/>
exact. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, actually part of what I wanted to know was how<br/>
widespread that kind of thing was. In some ways I<br/>
guess maybe it&#39;s not that big of a deal but I had<br/>
never come across that on EQ before and I must admit<br/>
that it kind of threw me for a bit. I really didn&#39;t<br/>
know how to respond so I just kind of ran off . . .<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; What i do when that happens is just usually duel<br/>
them and win. LOL It tends to knock them down a notch<br/>
or two, or three....hahahhahah &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
:o)<br/>
Yeah, I guess I could have looked at them and saw if I<br/>
might have done that although I&#39;m not that strong<br/>
right now, so I&#39;m not sure I could have beaten them<br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; But if it really bothers you tell them that and<br/>
then promptly leave, orrrr you can do what i did once<br/>
and it kinda freaked them out, tell them that you are<br/>
actaully a guy playing a girl, freaks them out really<br/>
good. LOL  Be creative!!!!!!!!!!!!! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This apparently was a guy playing a girl . . .<br/>
The character was female and when they started some<br/>
else made a comment about them being a girl and they<br/>
said they were really a guy in real life.<br/>
Unfortunately you can&#39;t tell in the game who is who or<br/>
what is what.<br/>
:o/<br/>
<br/>
Anyway thanks for listening, I guess it&#39;s just<br/>
something that happens and I should just make the best<br/>
of it so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
:o)<br/>

<br/>
PS - Do you think I could have gotten him to pay the<br/>
offered gold and then told him I was a guy . . . Maybe<br/>
he would learn a bit of a lesson that way . . .<br/>
:o)<br/>
