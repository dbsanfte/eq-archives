<br/>
Oh man *shivers at the thought* at level 9.  Man they must be hounding<br/>
you day and night.  And Sow Whore works *big smile* I like the name and<br/>
it fits :)  <br/>
<br/>
I feel bad about asking for cash for Sow.  Get a sob story on how they<br/>
lost there bodies or I just Sow them to shut them up :)  Now higher<br/>
levels<br/>
or folks that have been playing a while will ask nicely and give me cash<br/>
for<br/>
it.  While the beggers just will shout and don&#39;t even say thanks.  Some <br/>
do but most run off.  And then they wonder why I will not heal/buff/Sow<br/>
them another time.<br/>
<br/>
And what they do to you sounds about normal.  When I played a cleric it<br/>
seemed that they wanted me to heal them in a battle but would not take<br/>
the<br/>
time to help me or wait.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like the Higher levels are the best to give Sow too.  And like<br/>
you<br/>
I always like them :)  <br/>
<br/>
Ah an Enchanter, great class to play, but man I can just see how much he <br/>
gets bugged.  I alway give SOW and the buffs I have if I get breezed.<br/>
<br/>
Cool, my husband ( got him hooked on EQ ) want to get married in the<br/>
game too.<br/>
Anyone know how to do it?<br/>
<br/>
Your guild sounds great :)  <br/>
<br/>
Never got into the skills like baking, always was too broke after buy<br/>
spells :)<br/>
I&#39;m going to have to try baking it sounds like fun and easy.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; One good way to group is to try small groups.  Lots of people seem to<br/>
&gt; think that you should try and get groups of 5 or 6, but groups of 2 or 3<br/>
&gt; can work really well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As a druid, you are an ideal partner for a tank.  Pure tanks like warriors<br/>
&gt; and rogues are usually happy to group with a healer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I use to dislike twinking, but over time I have come to understand it.  I<br/>
&gt; have twinked myself.  For me twinking is simply to avoid aspects of the<br/>
&gt; game that I no longer find as entertaining.  Usually with twinks, as with<br/>
&gt; any other players, it&#39;s fairly quick to figure out if they&#39;re decent<br/>
&gt; people or not.  If someone is nice, whether they are twinked or not,<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re nice.<br/>

<br/>
I like small groups too. Now in Highpass with the Orcs a big group is<br/>
needed, but <br/>
that is the only time I have seen that you need to be in a big group. <br/>
Now I have<br/>
not been to Kurank yet so I&#39;m not sure about there.<br/>
<br/>
And yep I must say I&#39;m Twinked, but I got the stuff from my old cleric<br/>
and tank.<br/>
When out and got the stuff myself or on a guild raid.  So I don&#39;t feel<br/>
bad about<br/>
it.  <br/>
<br/>
When someone asks where I got something ( twinked with armor Lockjaw<br/>
vest - I was lucky to get<br/>
out of that fight alive :) , shield from named gnoll in highpass, and<br/>
screaming mace )<br/>
I tell them they are gifts.  If they get mad and want to know more they<br/>
get mad but most<br/>
folks just smile and seem to understand.  Think they are twinks too :)<br/>
