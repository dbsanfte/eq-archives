<br/>
A new server (not the race wars server) will be going up in the next two<br/>
weeks.  That would seem to be the sensible server on which to try this, so<br/>
no one is directly advantaged from previous connections on an old server.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of a city, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary to have an official guild<br/>
city.  It may be useful however to have an unofficial city, so that those<br/>
of us who wish to group while newbies can choose to group in that city.<br/>
I&#39;d personally recommend Kelethin/Felwithe.  My experience has been this<br/>
is one of the best newbie zones, and one of the best social zones.<br/>
Butcherblock, Lesser Faydark, Unrest, and Crushbone also offer a great<br/>
range of close by zones to adventure in.  Really I think almost any newbie<br/>
zone would suffice, there are great places to adventure everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
I personally plan on playing either a High Elf or Human Cleric or<br/>
Enchanter (can&#39;t quite choose!)  I also plan on being either a blacksmith<br/>
or a jeweler, and will do my best to provide either armor or jewlery at a<br/>
low cost to my guildmates.<br/>

&gt; Me too. But that is the question, we need to decide server and city.<br/>
&gt; Perhaps the server with the highest levels could watch out over the<br/>
&gt; people joining that server? Help them build up quicker for better<br/>
&gt; partying? </span></blockquote></div>
