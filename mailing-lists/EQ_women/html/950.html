<div id="ygrps-yiv-1102738119">your thoughts seem very well organized and you&#39;re very well spoken.  the <br/>
conning issue they spoke about in a patch...  it&#39;s to increase the number of <br/>
mobs you can get experience from.  as for medding taking a long time, well <br/>
it&#39;s always been that way.  when i first started playing it wasnt enough to <br/>
just sit to regen mana...  you had to med with your spellbook open or you <br/>
were only regening hp..  now THAT sucked.  oh those changes...  i agree with <br/>
ophi about the high vs. low end game play...  as a necro i am insanely <br/>
jealous of my druid friend who can solo in the plane of nightmare (while i <br/>
seem to be made obsolite(i spell like a man too) since i neither slow, heal, <br/>
tank, or do much dps and have been rendered unable to solo)  until you come <br/>
to the level when you&#39;re quading with your c34or5 (oh youre gonna love it) i <br/>
suggest trying clarity out... it&#39;s not regen for a lvl 60 manapool but it <br/>
should be an improvement on your current mana regen rate.  it also helps to <br/>
know which mobs are best suited for your personal style of soloing (or you <br/>
could just group anywhere but that&#39;s kinda crazy cause i&#39;m from rallos and <br/>
groups = ganked before lvl 50)  in the 40&#39;s and upper 30&#39;s i spent alot of <br/>
time in bbm fear kiting dwarves in various locations around the zone.  3 of <br/>
them can be single pulled but they hit HARD so try not to get hit.  by the <br/>
way, my dots at 56 arent as good as a druid&#39;s dots doing maybe 1k of damage <br/>
in 6 seconds all together, and since the intro of the graveyards, mobs that <br/>
quad for 400 with 5k hp and resists out the yin yang, and everything NOT <br/>
from PoP being green or so deep in a dungeon it&#39;s unbelievable, i&#39;m feeling <br/>
pretty crappy about new stuff too...  i felt badly for wizzies and druids <br/>
with the intro of PoP because of the loss of port money and again for the <br/>
wizzies with the nerfing of MB.  i felt badly for all low end casters with <br/>
the intro of soulbinders (cause that was the way to make plat at lvl 12)  <br/>
but there is an up side to it... no more newbs or guildies trying to bum a <br/>
ride (well some guildies do for certain zones but...) or bugging you for a <br/>
bind...  no more pk wizzards killing people then insta-gating to nexus <br/>
having just ganked all their plat and some precious piece of gear your best <br/>
friend gave you for your birthday so you had to wear it even though it wasnt <br/>
no drop and you felt like an idiot when the pkwizzy sent you vile tells <br/>
mocking you...  i digress of course...  changes arent all bad.  the guys <br/>
upstairs just want it to be a more social experience...  they want us to <br/>
group for our exp and questing.  that was the idea all along but they didnt <br/>
know how the public would react to certain elements of the game, so they <br/>
made some mistakes....  they&#39;re not changing things, they&#39;re fixing it.  it <br/>
was never supposed to be that easy in the first place.  oh i wish you <br/>
could&#39;ve seen it before =)  back when everything was hard (before they tried <br/>
to make too much money and appeal to larger audiences)...  i used to run <br/>
from Qeynos to Freeport and back and the boats were a social event where <br/>
everyone complained (and when they were broken and you had to petition from <br/>
a dock standing with all the other people for an hour hehehe) and people <br/>
could pk at lvl one and there was none of this soulbound till lvl 10 crap, <br/>
you had to cr from the beginning and people gave you gear for being a girl <br/>
and everyone was nice and happy and the game was hard but that was okay <br/>
cause it made you feel like a real adventurer who was really traveling and i <br/>
used to sit on the beach in oasis of mar and listen to the waves.....  eq <br/>
has changed, but it&#39;s starting to get back to the way it used to be and i <br/>
cant wait.  but i hope sony gives you your money back or something.  i wish <br/>
you had been there.  it was nice.<br/>

&gt;Dear Friends.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My station name is (Edited).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am writing because Everquest has changed too much from the game<br/>
&gt;that I originally purchased to play. I have also purchased several<br/>
&gt;expansion packs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Firstly, there seems to be this occurrence called &quot;nerfing&quot; where Sony<br/>
&gt;limits a game feature by either discontinuing or severely limiting it,<br/>
&gt;when in the past it was widely available.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Specifically, I play a druid character that has been rendered<br/>
&gt;essentially<br/>
&gt;useless because of changes in the way the game is applied to the<br/>
&gt;character and its level (spells, etc). I only play that character<br/>
&gt;and am not interested in starting another from scratch just because<br/>
&gt;someone reprogrammed the game. I&#39;d rather quit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Second, I have heard that Sony is trying to &quot;level out the playing<br/>
&gt;field&quot; with respect to these changes. What you have done is leveled<br/>
&gt;my character o the point that I cannot play without finding a large<br/>
&gt;group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I did not intend to play with large groups, now or ever. And even<br/>
&gt;when I do find a large group, my character&#39;s group value is useless<br/>
&gt;to them. I can offer them nothing of value because my character now<br/>
&gt;cannot contribute<br/>
&gt;anymore either by direct attack or by &quot;buffing&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For example, the general feature called &quot;mana&quot; is severely defective<br/>
&gt;in that it takes eons to regenrate. To counter this defect, I relied<br/>
&gt;on a spell that helped &quot;mana&quot; regenerate faster, named Kodiaks<br/>
&gt;Endless Intellect. This spell has recently been &quot;nerfed&quot; to work<br/>
&gt;only on high level characters. Now, I sit and stare at a computer<br/>
&gt;screen, bored out of my mind. Where&#39;s the pleasure in playing your<br/>
&gt;game when all I do is sit. Its a waste of my time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Third, the issue of &quot;mana&quot;, and the amount of &quot;mana&quot; that spells<br/>
&gt;require should be reassessed. The game is for fun. I am not having<br/>
&gt;fun. I can only cast 3 or 4 spells before the &quot;mana&quot; runs out. Then,<br/>
&gt;it takes a lifetime to regenerate &quot;mana&quot;. I could go fry up a pound<br/>
&gt;of bacon before my &quot;mana&quot; regenerates (I did that last night).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Either make &quot;mana&quot; regenerate faster, make spells use less &quot;mana&quot;, or<br/>
&gt;let us &quot;pay&quot; for Kodiaks Endless Intellect. Whatever you do, you&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;got to do something, I am reluctant to play anymore.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Fourth, it appears that many NPC&#39;s have been enhanced in some way.<br/>
&gt;Many things that used to &quot;con&quot; light blue or green now &quot;con&quot; dark<br/>
&gt;blue. And in the past, I used to be able to kill these NPC&#39;s by<br/>
&gt;myself, even without Kodiaks Endless Intellect. Now, I die every<br/>
&gt;time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Finally, overall, I believe that the game&#39;s features should remain<br/>
&gt;static. One plans and strategizes based on the parameters of the<br/>
&gt;game. When the parameters continually change, as they have been, one<br/>
&gt;cannot strategize and the game becomes a waste of time and money.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The way I look at it, I am a customer that is now not getting what I<br/>
&gt;originally paid for. Please correct these problems. If you would<br/>
&gt;like a comprehensive list of other problems, I can compile it for<br/>
&gt;you. The ones that Im complaining about are the worst offenders.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;_______________________<br/>
&gt;sorry about the spelling in the previous post, not a good day for me<br/>
&gt;^_^  hopefully this one is better, and yes i do spell like a man my<br/>
&gt;mother tells me that too LOL<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; OK, but you spell like an man, so let me proofread it first.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Frankly, I don&#39;t WANT realism in my games.  I LIKE being able to go<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the bank and have the same things everywhere. I LIKE teleporting<br/>
&gt; &gt; and jumping off of high places and gliding in over KC for a<br/>
&gt; &gt; landing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have a RL if I want realism.<br/>
