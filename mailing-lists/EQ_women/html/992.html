<div id="ygrps-yiv-904651302">lol omg that is just cruel. I have a friend like that though too. <br/>
yes necros who have duelling xp...eeks i run from and now druids as <br/>
well...that snare just kills me. I also have a policy of not moving <br/>
non pet casters when oom...while my friend never left me i learned <br/>
albeit very slowly that oom means HELPLESS. I havent had the <br/>
opportunity to meet dreadtouch however i may seek him out and <br/>
inconspicuously place myself in his way. AS for the arena there is <br/>
no point however I have found that it is a great way to try out new <br/>
spells without the risk of losing xp, also u get the unredictability <br/>
of human playing strategies. I ahve learned alot through duels <br/>
(though i only duel those that respect boundaries) and have changed <br/>
certain strategies. For example i fought a 53 warrior... thinking to <br/>
myself a peice of cake (i can heal, stun, root and dd from a <br/>
distance)..well i lost although i didnt use lh (i rarely do i save <br/>
that for when i actually need it) he still had 60% hp when i got <br/>
down to 3%. The reason is he had 160??? magic resistance..not one <br/>
spell i casted stuck and the end result was he just hit harder and <br/>
had way more hp then me. It was fun but now if my first spell doesnt <br/>
land i rely only on healing myself when fighting warriors and i have <br/>
taken that lesson to the Planes fighting higher lvl mobs...if my <br/>
spells r resisted i dont bother and resort to healing while i fight. <br/>
And maybe too i have just hung out with too many testerone driven <br/>
males who feel the need to constantly prove themselves lol. anyways <br/>
off to housework and errands and then to NORRATH<br/>

&gt; Yeah, he is a great one for tricks.  He had lev on a friend, and <br/>
bound him<br/>
&gt; in the air over PoK.  Then he told him to click off the lev.  The <br/>
guy fell<br/>
&gt; to the ground, died, came back IN MID AIR, died again and again <br/>
and again.<br/>
&gt; I am not sure how they got out of it.  I think they had to <br/>
petition to<br/>
&gt; change his bind spot!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have never gone to the arena in Quellious.  I do know a couple <br/>
of women<br/>
&gt; on my server who are most crazy than I am.  I figured it was a guy <br/>
thing.<br/>
&gt; I mean, no exp?  What&#39;s the point?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Beware of dueling druids and necros.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I played my nephew&#39;s wiz once with Bryn.  He was supposed to be <br/>
PLing me.<br/>
&gt; I have a policy against moving wizards when they are OOM.  He ran <br/>
off and<br/>
&gt; left an orc get me.  Never going to play with him again.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Aubrey, Dreadtouch is a nice boy.  I recommend him.<br/>

said<br/>
&gt; ____&gt;come <br/>
&gt; ____&gt;to the arena and help us take down this necro, im like ok. I <br/>
get <br/>
&gt; ____&gt;ther and we finish off a 50 pally and my friend says go take <br/>
down <br/>
&gt; ____&gt;briyn (lol he goes anon so i had no idea what lvl he was) so <br/>
i walk <br/>
&gt; ____&gt;into the arena and attack and 5 seconds later i was dead. He <br/>
&gt; ____&gt;snared , rooted dotted whatever. It is funny how small the <br/>
world is <br/>
&gt; ____&gt;that&#39;s for sure. My friend was like oh my god i was joking <br/>
hes a 65. <br/>
&gt; ____&gt;But i learned a few valuable lessons that day. while i would <br/>
love to <br/>
&gt; ____&gt;spy on him i am now fearful of his capabilities lol.<br/>
