<br/>
Paladins actually have exciting weapons of almost every type.  Off hand I<br/>
can think of excellent 1h blunt, 2h blunt, 1h slashing, and 2h slashing<br/>
weapons.  Accordingly, I&#39;d suggest trying to train them all to some<br/>
extent.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to train them all, I think one handed slashing is<br/>
probably your most defining weapon type.  Paladins are skilled shield<br/>
bashers.  Ghoulbane, a relatively easy to obtain Paladin weapon is one<br/>
handed slashing.<br/>
<br/>
However without an exceptional one handed slashing weapon like Ghoulbane,<br/>
most of the time you will benefit from using a two handed slashing<br/>
weapons.  They are more commonly available, and generally do far more<br/>
damage, then normal one handed slashing weapons.  Exceptional one handed<br/>
slashing weapons are usually paladin only.<br/>
<br/>
A good lower-priced two handed slashing weapon is an axe of the iron<br/>
black.  They are easily found Kunark weapons.  BBCs are common Antonica<br/>
2-handed slashing weapons as are shiny brass halberds, and should be<br/>
cheaper than an axe.  GZs are also good.<br/>
<br/>
For one handed slashing, until you obtain ghoulbane, there really aren&#39;t a<br/>
lot of great one handed slashers.  I&#39;d suggest keep your bash and slash<br/>
maxed with a fine steel longsword and a shield, then switch back to your<br/>
two-hander once both skills are maxed.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps =)<br/>

&gt; You know, I&#39;m one of the few women too in groups.  Was looking at my <br/>
&gt; guild roster (I&#39;m still a dedicated, not full member yet) and there <br/>
&gt; are only three listed.  All of us are wives or girlfriends of the men <br/>
&gt; in the guild.  Hmmm... but it is fun though. Any Paladins on this <br/>
&gt; list?  I&#39;m always looking for Paladin advice.  What sort of weapons <br/>
&gt; are best... and should I practice 2H blunt?  My Cleric bf says no... <br/>
&gt; but he also admits he&#39;s a cleric and never played a fighter class.<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
