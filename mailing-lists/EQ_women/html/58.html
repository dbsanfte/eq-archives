<div id="ygrps-yiv-1214395858">Grrrrrrrrr.  I&#39;ve been playing since Day one, and have noticed that most of the<br/>
guys I work with have switched to female characters, supposedly because they get<br/>
free stuff.  I wasn&#39;t ever given (nor did I solicit any) stuff until I joined a<br/>
guild.  Now, my brothers take care of me, but since I reciprocate, I feel it&#39;s<br/>
fair.  Every time I see a &quot;female&quot; character (especially wood elves since I play<br/>
one) twinking, I /tell them....hehehe.......might not make me very popular but I<br/>
feel better at night. =)<br/>

&gt; I was intrigued to see RPG weddings... I have a boyfriend in RL who plays a<br/>
&gt; Barbarian Shaman at a higher level than myself, on the same server.  So, I<br/>
&gt; get some perks from that :)  He normally plays from work with other friends<br/>
&gt; and his brother, so it&#39;s like a close knit family. They just play the game,<br/>
&gt; and that&#39;s what they are there for...hunting and quests, no on line<br/>
&gt; relationships.   I group with all males, which proves to be interesting.<br/>
&gt; Flirting does take place and all members have significant others that do not<br/>
&gt; play EQ... soon to be single with the way the are on all the time!  I have<br/>
&gt; been told most males will play female characters since they get more things<br/>
&gt; and favors... I suppose I have noticed that.  I love the game and find I<br/>
&gt; look forward to going home from work to play... it&#39;s a whole other world!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope to hear from y&#39;all.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Hello All,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  I have lot of different characters, but my two main ones are Dyrlia<br/>
&gt; &gt;RaverSong, a level 24 bearded Dwarven Cleric on Innoruuk server, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;Dandara, a level 13 Human ShadowKnight on Cazic-Thule server.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  I have never been asked if I am a woman in real life, which I find rather<br/>
&gt; &gt;odd, but count my blessings for. I&#39;m sure it will happen someday, but it<br/>
&gt; &gt;hasn&#39;t so far. (Crosses fingers).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  As far as flirting goes, I am a notorious flirt and I&#39;ll flirt with<br/>
&gt; &gt;anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt;at any time. That&#39;s the way I am in real life, so I guess I can&#39;t help it<br/>
&gt; &gt;in<br/>
&gt; &gt;EQ. I think human interaction is one of the best parts of the game, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;flirtation is one of the oldest of human interactions &lt;grin&gt;. If you and<br/>
&gt; &gt;those you do it with enjoy it, by all means have fun with it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  The thing that irks me to no end (and I&#39;ll be honest here and admit that<br/>
&gt; &gt;I<br/>
&gt; &gt;believe most of these &quot;women&quot; to be played by men)is the female characters<br/>
&gt; &gt;that you see once in awhile that shout something to the effect of &quot;I&#39;m a<br/>
&gt; &gt;cute, helpless, sexy, level four wood elf and I want someone to give me,<br/>
&gt; &gt;for<br/>
&gt; &gt;free, an item or ten obtainable only by a full-group of level 40+ people.<br/>
&gt; &gt;*bats eyelashes*.&quot; I&#39;m not saying its wrong or that they should be shunned<br/>
&gt; &gt;on site. I&#39;m not even sure exactly why it bothers me, but its incredibly<br/>
&gt; &gt;annoying. Maybe it&#39;s because I feel like they are taking advantage of male<br/>
&gt; &gt;hormones, and I don&#39;t feel right doing that so I&#39;m jealous &lt;G&gt;. Dandara did<br/>
&gt; &gt;ask someone of higher level once to bring her back an ice goblin from<br/>
&gt; &gt;Permafrost, but I don&#39;t exactly see that as being the same thing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Cheers,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Danette<br/>
