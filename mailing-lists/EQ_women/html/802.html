<br/>
OK, thanks Christina.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been noticing a couple of things of late which<br/>
are probably not great mysteries to anyone here, but .<br/>
. .<br/>
One is that a lot of the females on EQ are male in rl.<br/>
Another is that once people start finding out your<br/>
female in rl the males start hanging around a lot<br/>
more.<br/>
:o)<br/>
It&#39;s kind of laughable sitting here thinking that it&#39;s<br/>
all a computer game, but I had two guys both wanting<br/>
to group with me last night but each didn&#39;t want the<br/>
other one around. The one I didn&#39;t group with kept<br/>
contacting me with messages trying to find out if I<br/>
was through with the other guy yet, and telling me how<br/>
he knew better places to go. I want go into all the<br/>
details, but I couldn&#39;t help but laugh.<br/>
:o)<br/>
OK, and the questions:<br/>
Is it normal for guys to start calling you &quot;babe&quot;<br/>
after you have grouped for a couple hours, and start<br/>
trying to use the /hug and /kiss command, or do I just<br/>
find all the &quot;good&quot; :o) ones? Is there a slap command,<br/>
I didn&#39;t think of that last night but I guess I&#39;ll<br/>
have to check that one out.<br/>
:o)<br/>
If there is someone you have grouped with a couple<br/>
times and, well, they are kind of a looser, is there a<br/>
nice way to avoid them, not let them know if you are<br/>
online etc. without just telling them flat out? (By<br/>
looser I&#39;m saying this particular character is non<br/>
comunicative, a problem I don&#39;t have, and never seems<br/>
to understand me when they do communicate. They group<br/>
and then run off by themselves and die instead of<br/>
letting me come along and help, they are very quick<br/>
and whenever we, usually I, kill something they always<br/>
grab whatever it is carrying faster than I can. I<br/>
don&#39;t want to be rude, and I don&#39;t want to hurt<br/>
anyones feelings but I don&#39;t really want to group with<br/>
them either, because it&#39;s not fun.<br/>
The bad part is that they badgered me into agreeing to<br/>
meet them Sat to group. Yes, I&#39;m a wimp. Should I try<br/>
to sit down and have a heart to heart talk with them<br/>
about what they are doing wrong?<br/>
Suggestions please!<br/>
Not sure how to handle it and thought maybe someone<br/>
here might have been there and done that and could<br/>
pass on a bit of advice.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening anyway,<br/>
Hugs,<br/>
:o)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Say is it possible to get unmarried in EQ?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I mean suppose your &quot;spouse&quot; quits playing and you<br/>
&gt; &gt; find interest elsewhere or somehting.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Just curious.<br/>
