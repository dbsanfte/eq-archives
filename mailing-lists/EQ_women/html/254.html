<div id="ygrps-yiv-634619481">In all honesty, I would just like more choice in clothing in general.  Not just <br/>
getting to choose whether our clothing is revealing or not, but what we wear <br/>
just in general.  I would enjoy being able to buy skirts for feminine characters <br/>
<br/>
and pants for more athletic ones.  Why must clothes be limited to starting <br/>
garments and armor?  Being able to choose clothing in general would also help <br/>
more characters look distinctive, rather than all the same.  With such a limited <br/>
<br/>
choice of faces, anything that can help differentiate one character from another <br/>
<br/>
is a Good Thing, imho.<br/>
