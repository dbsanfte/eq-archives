A good thing to do is before you hand in any quest items talk to the NPC <br/>
again and listen very carefully to the exact instructions. I am ultra <br/>
paranoid about this stuff, but I have never lost a quest item. The <br/>
instructions are usually very precise.<br/>

&gt; You don&#39;t even want to know what I did last night with<br/>
&gt; that quest.<br/>
&gt; :o)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But maybe someone will get a laugh out of my<br/>
&gt; stupidity.<br/>
&gt; :o)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I finally got together all the things I needed for the<br/>
&gt; tunic. I never did find the forest drakling scale but<br/>
&gt; I found someone who had one and offered to sell it to<br/>
&gt; me and asked what I would give them. I told them that<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t have any idea what anything cost but would<br/>
&gt; pay them whatever the fair price was. They told me<br/>
&gt; that they used to get 50pp but that they would sell it<br/>
&gt; to me for 20pp and that to be nice they would let me<br/>
&gt; have it for 10pp if that was all I could afford. Well<br/>
&gt; I had the 20pp and I didn&#39;t want to take advantage of<br/>
&gt; anyone so I gave it to them. (Yes, I&#39;m a sucker)<br/>
&gt; :o)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then I took all my stuff back to the Ranger guild<br/>
&gt; house and gave it to the Ranger who gave me the quest,<br/>
&gt; I forget the name. He took all the stuff, told me<br/>
&gt; thank you, and that was it. I didn&#39;t get anything, no<br/>
&gt; tunic, no exp., no nothing. I was so upset I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know whether to laugh or cry . . .<br/>
&gt; :o)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, after standing there for a long time kicking<br/>
&gt; myself I asked them for the quest all over again.<br/>
&gt; Oddly, this time they gave me the box to put<br/>
&gt; everything in and they also gave me a pattern for an<br/>
&gt; &quot;enchanted tunic&quot;? Not sure what that is all about as<br/>
&gt; there are not enough slots in the box to fit the stuff<br/>
&gt; and the tunic.<br/>
&gt; :o)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, I went back out and started gathering stuff<br/>
&gt; again. Still need to regain a couple items, including<br/>
&gt; that silly Forest Drakling Scale, but now I&#39;m paranoid<br/>
&gt; about the exact approach to take to not lose<br/>
&gt; everything again. Apparently, I did or said something<br/>
&gt; wrong last time.<br/>
&gt; :o)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh well, live and learn I guess, but it certainly<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t make me feel any better when I was telling<br/>
&gt; someone about the whole thing later and they told me I<br/>
&gt; had been ripped off on the price of the Forest<br/>
&gt; Drakling Scale . . . ouch!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, just thought I&#39;d throw that out in case anyone<br/>
&gt; was interested at all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; PS - I came across a master key in CB last night and I<br/>
&gt; have the two Orc eyes for the sword. For any more<br/>
&gt; experienced rangers out there, is there anything<br/>
&gt; special I need to do to give this to the Ranger in the<br/>
&gt; guild and actually get the sword instead of losing<br/>
&gt; that too.<br/>

&gt; &gt; LOL ... someone in guild was just complaining about<br/>
&gt; &gt; that earlier today :) ... they&#39;re a pain but, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; newbie armor quests are worth it in the long run :)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Have fun, and hunt safe ~<br/>

&gt; &gt; I never would have thought how much trouble it<br/>
&gt; &gt; can be to find a pristine forest drakling scale.<br/>
