<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468787190"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; I have a question! Why does my level 5 bard keep<br/>
&gt; dying? I just can&#39;t keep<br/>
&gt; &gt; her alive enough to get any experience to level.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I ran into the same problem with my bard, I just had to get patchwork<br/>
and from then on it was no problem. I was hunting in Misty Thicket<br/>
also, which is easier I think at that level. I could just run to the<br/>
wall gate and have the guards take care of the monster if I got into<br/>
trouble. I&#39;ve leveled a few characters there, I think it&#39;s a great<br/>
place up until level 12 or so.</div>
