<div id="ygrps-yiv-280431081">This is a mini Diablo II review.<br/>
<br/>
I have been quite burned out by EQ lately, so I picked up Diablo 2.  I wasn&#39;t<br/>
particularly interested in it (though I loved Diablo) but some friends had<br/>
it and I wanted to play multiplayer with them.<br/>
<br/>
It took me about half an hour to figure out the interface, and &quot;remember&quot;<br/>
how to play.  I wasn&#39;t too impressed at the start everything seemed overly<br/>
complicated.<br/>
<br/>
I started with a barbarian (I wanted a simple character).  I started hacking<br/>
away.  My immediate shock was that things just died so easily and so quickly.<br/>
I&#39;m used to EQ where killing one mob can be a monumental effort, but my<br/>
little barbarian dude was cleaving things left right and center.  One<br/>
thing I like about Diablo II is that all characters have mana and cast<br/>
spells.  My barbarian has this satisfying &#39;bash&#39; spell that smacks things<br/>
a little extra hard.<br/>
<br/>
By level 4 I was a bit bored and decided to try a Necromancer.  This totally<br/>
hooked me! When I read the class over it sounded a little bizarre to me.<br/>
I summoned my little skeleton pet and he started running around fighting<br/>
everything.  Pets in diablo are a little psychotic, there is no &quot;pet back off&quot;<br/>
command, and they just try and kill everything they see.<br/>
<br/>
Once I got level 2 I was able to upgrade my pet spell, and now I had two<br/>
pets! That was fun, never got to do that in EQ.<br/>
<br/>
As I continued to level I got more spells, and I found I liked them all,<br/>
even though originally they didn&#39;t seem too exciting.  One line of necro spells <br/>
I wasn&#39;t excited about was debuffs.  They have a debuff that causes mobs<br/>
to take twice as much damage, and another that causes mobs to do 1/3 less<br/>
damage.  As you level up a bit, these spells become invaluable ways to<br/>
make your pets more effective.  Indeed, by level 9, all I&#39;m doing is <br/>
summoning pets and debuffing mobs.  I have a bolt spell but I never use it.<br/>
At level 9 I also have a golem pet, bringing my pet total to 3.  Using<br/>
pets is a bit hard because they are psychotic, but it&#39;s fun too.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Diablo 2 is an exciting video game with RPG elements.  I enjoy the<br/>
&#39;leveling up&#39; aspect of it, and the opportunity to choose skills that customize<br/>
my character.  Diablo 2 isn&#39;t a true RPG but it has a lot of great RPG <br/>
elements.<br/>
<br/>
The quests so far are great as well, and the cinematics are stunning.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I give this game a solid 4 out of 5 stars.  I see Diablo 2 as an<br/>
excellent way to spend a lot of hours playing an entertaining game.<br/>
<br/>
As a last note, I&#39;m not all that interested in the multiplayer capabilities.<br/>
My interest is purely in the single player version.  If you enjoy multiplayer<br/>
Diablo the game will have even more to offer you.<br/>
