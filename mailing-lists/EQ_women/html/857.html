<div id="ygrps-yiv-780910862">You can create serverwide channels I believe.<br/>
<br/>
To do it you do something like:<br/>
<br/>
    /join serverwide.women<br/>
<br/>
So everyone could in theory join that channel and chat, even being on <br/>
different servers.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; I am not aware of any ingame chat channle other<br/>
&gt; than for guilds, so maybe we should for an all female<br/>
&gt; guild. Only problem that I can see is we are all on a<br/>
&gt; lot of different servers .. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yep, that was my thought as well. The biggest problem<br/>
&gt; is we seem kind of scattered.<br/>
&gt; On other hand, I for one would have no major problem<br/>
&gt; with creating a toon on a new server to play<br/>
&gt; sometimes. Is there any server that already has<br/>
&gt; several of us on it? I play primarily Xegony but the<br/>
&gt; choice at the time was almost random and while I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; going to get rid of my lvl 33 ranger I&#39;d be fine with<br/>
&gt; creating a toon somewhere else as well if anyone else<br/>
&gt; is game.<br/>
