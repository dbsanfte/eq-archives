<br/>
Yes, Surefall Glade might be nice. We have been<br/>
invited to another wedding that is going to take place<br/>
there so we are planning to come and see how<br/>
everything works out.<br/>
Right now I think everyone on my friend list is up to<br/>
lvl 13 or higher so I think most of the guests should<br/>
not have a major problem getting there if they want to<br/>
come. We can offer transportation from the druids (I<br/>
seem to have a fairly high number of druid friends for<br/>
some reason, well 3 or 4 anyway including my<br/>
intended).<br/>
<br/>
I know what you mean about being the ranger that was<br/>
lost, I generally have no idea where I am, but I guess<br/>
I must be a bit more timid in my exploring then you<br/>
were. In fact, it&#39;s kind of a running joke with us<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
A tell between us might go something like this: Me,<br/>
&quot;Dear heart, how do I get to &quot;place x&quot;?&quot;<br/>
Him, &quot;Where are you now hun?&quot;<br/>
Me &quot;I don&#39;t really know, but I think I&#39;m in the &quot;so<br/>
and so&quot; zone.&quot;<br/>
Him, &quot;Ok dear no problem, just go east.&quot;<br/>
Me, &quot;Which way is east?&quot;<br/>
Him, (after delivering some kind of arcane analysis of<br/>
the weather and cloud patterns or Norrath) &quot;and that<br/>
should take you right there.&quot;<br/>
Me, &quot;???&quot;<br/>
Him, &quot;Or, you could just try sense heading.&quot;<br/>
Me, &quot;You know my sense heading is broken.&quot;<br/>
Him, &quot;No, it&#39;s not broken dear, just keep trying it.&quot;<br/>
Me, &quot;I&#39;m telling you this thing is broken, even when<br/>
it gives me a direction I&#39;m not sure if I can trust<br/>
it.&quot;<br/>
Him, (seeming more frustrated now for some reason)<br/>
&quot;Just keep trying, it&#39;s not broken.&quot;<br/>
Me, (with an appropriate silance and a sigh) &quot;OK.&quot;<br/>
Him, &quot;Do you want me to come help you?&quot;<br/>
Me, &quot;No, I&#39;m fine, just lost that&#39;s all, you know I&#39;m<br/>
always lost, kind of funny really, I&#39;m the ranger who<br/>
has no sense of direction.&quot;<br/>
Him, &quot;Yes, funny, ha ha, Now, just keep pushing sense<br/>
heading.&quot;<br/>
Me, &quot;OK, but I&#39;m telling you it&#39;s broken.&quot;<br/>
Him, &quot;It&#39;s not broken!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And so on it goes . . .<br/>
<br/>
I have now explored most of Feydwar, and I&#39;m working<br/>
on Antonica (sp) now, but it&#39;s a very slow process<br/>
with me. Got killed twice in North Karana last night<br/>
by Griffons . . . ack, that was frustrating and not<br/>
good for the exp lvl but did manage to make lvl 21<br/>
never the less.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it&#39;s fun and I&#39;m learning.<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
Best Regards till next time,<br/>
Hugs,<br/>

&gt; I was the ranger that was lost, so I ended up<br/>
&gt; aaaaaaaaaaaall over the place.  I died a lot between<br/>
&gt; first and fifth. ;-)  We used to love just roaming<br/>
&gt; around and never had a teleport until we&#39;d<br/>
&gt; thoroughly explored two of the continents (the main<br/>
&gt; human one and Feydwer).  But really, the people we<br/>
&gt; ran into that way were some of our favorites for<br/>
&gt; years... and some of our guildmates!<br/>

&gt;   Thanks for the note. Do you mean Surefall Glade?<br/>
&gt; If so<br/>
&gt;   that&#39;s where I&#39;m at right now in the game more or<br/>
&gt;   less. I&#39;m soulbound there anyway.<br/>
&gt;   :o)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   That could be an idea though, it is kind of a neat<br/>
&gt;   place. I&#39;m not sure how many people will even come<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt;   something like this. I expect it to be small. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;   fairly new to the game and don&#39;t know lots of<br/>
&gt; people<br/>
&gt;   yet. He has played for much longer but tends to be<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt;   loner and solo a lot, at least before he ran into<br/>
&gt; me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   It might be an idea though. Funny I was right<br/>
&gt; there<br/>
&gt;   and didn&#39;t even think of it. Of course, there are<br/>
&gt; so<br/>
&gt;   many places I haven&#39;t been yet.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   As for guilds I sort of have this feeling that its<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt;   bit tacky to go around asking. On the other hand I<br/>
&gt;   really want to try that part of the game out.<br/>
&gt;   Maybe I don&#39;t have enough escapades.<br/>

&gt;   &gt; There&#39;s a ranger haven on the mainland outside<br/>

&gt;   &gt; Qeynos, IIRC.  That&#39;s where I got married.  The<br/>
&gt; name<br/>
&gt;   &gt; escapes me (haven&#39;t played in a long while) but<br/>
&gt;   &gt; someone on the list should know of which I<br/>

&gt;   &gt; It&#39;s very nice.  If you have any concerns about<br/>
&gt;   &gt; guests&#39; safety, ask some of your &#39;wedding party&#39;<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt;   &gt; be &#39;ushers&#39;, ie., escort your guests from<br/>
&gt; Qeynos. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Or have a wizard &#39;port &#39;em in.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; My fiance and I were both rangers.  We were very<br/>
&gt;   &gt; effective at taunting; once one&#39;d take too much<br/>
&gt;   &gt; damage, the other would start taunting madly. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &#39;Course, the roles may have changed in the past<br/>
&gt;   &gt; year...<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Guilds, eh... they&#39;re nice if you&#39;ve joined one<br/>
&gt;   &gt; because you regularly adventure with many of its<br/>
&gt;   &gt; members, but I never personally advertised for a<br/>
&gt;   &gt; guild.  I tended to let my escapades take me<br/>
&gt; where<br/>
&gt;   &gt; they would (as an elven ranger when Povar was<br/>
&gt; first<br/>
&gt;   &gt; new, there was A LOT of escapade) and ran into<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt;   &gt; guild brethren when hunting.  When I began<br/>
&gt; looking<br/>
&gt;   &gt; for them when I signed on, I knew I was finding<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &quot;home&quot;.  Just my two coppers&#39;.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>

&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   Salutations All!<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   I have not posted for a while, and I know<br/>
&gt; everyone<br/>
&gt;   &gt; was probably <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   relaxing a little and here I am again.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   :o)<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   EQ has been progressing prettry good for me I<br/>
&gt;   &gt; think. I&#39;ve made a <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   couple of good friends who are more<br/>
&gt; experienced<br/>
&gt;   &gt; then me and don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   seem to mind giving advice or helping out so<br/>
&gt;   &gt; that&#39;s very nice.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   I&#39;ve also been trying to learn more about my<br/>
&gt; role<br/>
&gt;   &gt; as a Ranger in <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   Norrath. I just found out last week what a<br/>
&gt; handy<br/>
&gt;   &gt; thing taunt can be <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   when trying to keep a mob off your healer? OK,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;   &gt; slow but I&#39;m <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   getting there I think. And I&#39;ve gotten duel<br/>
&gt; wield<br/>
&gt;   &gt; and double attack <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   now so that&#39;s interesting to play with.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   Last night a Druid friend and I went to Paudal<br/>
&gt;   &gt; Cavern for my first <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   trip there. I would have died twice during the<br/>
&gt;   &gt; first fight we had I <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   think if they had not been there to keep me<br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt;   &gt; deaths door. That <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   was a tough mob and red all the way for me at<br/>
&gt; lvl<br/>
&gt;   &gt; 19 (20 now).<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   Anyway, enough ramblin, so it&#39;s question time:<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   1.) I have been asked to get married and have<br/>
&gt; said<br/>
&gt;   &gt; yes. :o) Any good <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   suggestions on locations that would be nice<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt;   &gt; not to hard for <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   guests to get to? He has a place in mind, I<br/>
&gt; forget<br/>
&gt;   &gt; the name, but it <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   sounds like it might be hard for lower level<br/>
&gt;   &gt; characters to even <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   reach. I have not traveled over much of<br/>
&gt; Norrath<br/>
&gt;   &gt; still so I&#39;m not <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   sure. Anyway, if anyone has ideas I&#39;d love to<br/>
&gt; hear<br/>
&gt;   &gt; them.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   Also, when things are set, which may be a<br/>
&gt; while<br/>
&gt;   &gt; I&#39;ll post a note here <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   letting everyone know. You are all invited, of<br/>
&gt;   &gt; course, feel free to <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   come if you have a character on the Xegony<br/>
&gt; server,<br/>
&gt;   &gt; of if you want <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   just create a quick one at the proper time and<br/>
&gt;   &gt; come anyway. I&#39;d love <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   to meet anyone who might do me the honor of<br/>
&gt;   &gt; coming.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   2.) Can anyone give me advice on how to find a<br/>
&gt;   &gt; guild that might be <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   interested in letting a Ranger in the low 20&#39;s<br/>
&gt;   &gt; join? Would it be ok <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   to just kind of start asking around? Is there<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt;   &gt; way to tell a better <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   guild from one not as good?<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   Anyway, I hope everyone had a nice<br/>
&gt; Thanksgiving.<br/>
