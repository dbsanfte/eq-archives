<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-405216807">I will tell you what, the only guilds I will join are ones where I already <br/>
know a member of the guild.  One of them that I am a member of, required me <br/>
to group with two of the officers before they would even consider my <br/>
application.<br/>
<br/>
The quality of the guilds that I have come across on Tunare, has <br/>
deteriorated SEVERELY.  You get people who zone in and ooc that they&#39;re <br/>
looking for a guild.  Why don&#39;t you take the time to get to know someone?<br/>
<br/>
I used to be a leader of a guild on Tunare, and we were quite stringent <br/>
about who could and could not be in our guild.<br/>
<br/>
It was relatively nice.  I quit because I was sick of the crap but that was <br/>
just personal issues.<br/>
<br/>
I just rejoined a new guild that is like family.  They are very small,  but <br/>
they are SO close to one another.  Which is what&#39;s important.  It&#39;s not <br/>
important to have 300 people logged on at a time.  It&#39;s important to be able <br/>
to talk to one another and work together.<br/>
