<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308132018">This is my understanding of how it works:<br/>
<br/>
The online store was shut down because basicly the company Verant<br/>
contracted out their shipping to has performed badly and they don&#39;t feel<br/>
confident they can ship orders quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Whether you purchase RoK through the online store, or from a store, you<br/>
get the same CD and the same kind of account key.  The only difference is<br/>
that the retail version has a box and a manual, while the upgrade version<br/>
has just the CD (and maybe the cloth map?).<br/>
<br/>
A RoK CD contains the full Everquest and ROK installation files.  The CD<br/>
Key can be used to either start a brand new Everquest account that can<br/>
access RoK (with a free month of gameplay) or it can be used to upgrade an<br/>
existing account to RoK (no free month of gameplay).  You can&#39;t however<br/>
both upgrade an existing account, and start a new one.  This paragraph is<br/>
somewhat speculative.  I personally used a store-bought RoK to upgrade my<br/>
EQ account to be able to access RoK.<br/>

&gt;     *Shakes head* it just seems incredibly odd to me.. So I went to <br/>
&gt; Wal-mart, and they has the new packs there, and I was wondering.. there was <br/>
&gt; only one CD inside. Do you call the 1 888 # for the kunark code then? <br/>
&gt; because I was going to give the actual EQ part of it (not kunark) to my <br/>
&gt; sister. I hope I can do that, or they had better get the store back.. *grr*<br/>
