This is the way I look at the situation...  <br/>
<br/>
-Your wife played 18 hours a day, neglecting life in<br/>
general, not sleeping or communicating with her<br/>
husband or family, or pretty much avoiding them.  Did<br/>
it occur to you that there was likely a problem before<br/>
she started playing EQ?  As with any sort of game,<br/>
book, or even television, it can be a wonderful tool<br/>
to relax and get away from the trials of life.  Some<br/>
people get carried away with it and you must look at<br/>
it from an outside view.  What made her feel like life<br/>
was so much more bearable in the EQ world?  Have you<br/>
considered that there may have been a communication<br/>
problem before she started playing?  That maybe<br/>
something was bothering her?  Did you even ask?  Or<br/>
perhaps you did...<br/>
<br/>
As for snooping through her files...  This tells me<br/>
that you had lost trust for her and beyond that,<br/>
communication.  As far as I am concerned, this problem<br/>
really had nothing to do with EQ other than it being<br/>
the medium she used to escape whatever the problem<br/>
was.  It could have been anything, really.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of hopping on an EQ forum tossing out advice<br/>
or warning, consider what it is that you really are<br/>
telling us.  Buecause I am not so sure that it occures<br/>
to you that 9 chances out of 10 the problem was hidden<br/>
there far before she started playing EQ and it just<br/>
then became noticable.<br/>
<br/>
I have been happily married for 7 years and during<br/>
that time, I have found myself getting deep into<br/>
something (Artwork, reading, webpages... never EQ)<br/>
when I was experiencing trials in my marriage.  After<br/>
we would work things out and get our communication<br/>
back, I found that those things were not nearly as<br/>
intriguing to me and I would much rather spend time<br/>
with my Husband.<br/>
<br/>
So tossing the medium (EQ in this case) aside, a far<br/>
better warning would be &quot;Be careful not to let<br/>
communication and happiness with your family slip<br/>
through the cracks for so long that you get wrapped up<br/>
in another world&quot;.  Instead of saying, &quot;She turned<br/>
away from her family because of EQ!&quot;  Say &quot;We stopped<br/>
communicating and grew unhappy so she turned to EQ&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is not putting the blame on you, for<br/>
communication takes 2 or more people.  It is just as<br/>
much her fault as your own.<br/>

&gt; I guess...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Never found any evidence of any online or RL affairs<br/>

&gt; insipid dribble about ports, spells, gear, etc,<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, and as for the Lexus...sorry, can&#39;t help you<br/>
&gt; there.  In fact, <br/>
&gt; when ours is done, we&#39;ll likely have to replace it<br/>
&gt; with a Toyota or <br/>
&gt; Nissan; since she quit her $30K job back in 2000 to<br/>
&gt; play UO (then EQ) <br/>
&gt; fulltime, some cutbacks have become necessary.<br/>
