<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452615250">Laura Chris Green, Ph.D.&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:cgreen@...">cgreen@...</a>&gt; your computer is infected. If<br/>
you need help inoculating your computer, email me privately.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone else. Delete the attachment called Happy99.exe that showed up on<br/>
this list. It is a virus. Laura did not know her computer was infected, so<br/>
do not blame her for this. The only thing that can be done is to not open<br/>
the file yourself and become infected.<br/>
<br/>
Mailing lists really should be set up to not allow attachments to be sent<br/>
out so this type of virus would not be spread.<br/>
