<div id="ygrps-yiv-285893477">Hey there!<br/>
<br/>
The scariest thing about being in North Queynos is getting out of North <br/>
Queynos, hopefully you can find a nice druid or wizard who will give you a <br/>
lift.<br/>
<br/>
Over in Erudin you can fight in the Warrens which should be just about <br/>
right for your level. I haven&#39;t fought there myself however.<br/>
<br/>
One tried and true place to hunt is Oasis in antonica. The crocodiles <br/>
there are non aggressive until you whack them. Start off with Caimen (the <br/>
weakest crocs) and work your way up from there. You can also group and <br/>
fight orcs. North Ro is also good xp at your level, Dervish Cutthroats are <br/>
good xp.<br/>
<br/>
When you get a little higher perhaps journey to Luclin. Pauldal caverns is <br/>
great xp to level 23 or so, and you get to fight cool fungus beasts.<br/>
<br/>
For a better weapon, I suggest you save your money carefully, and then <br/>
travel to the Bazaar in Luclin. There you will find players selling all <br/>
kinds of amazing stuff, and you can usually find incredible deals. These <br/>
days, it&#39;s generally much more effective to buy a weapon than it is to <br/>
kill a monster for it. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck and have fun :)<br/>

&gt; Also weapons are key! Do you know of any quests that i might do to get a new improved weapon? Oh yes, and if you are ever wandering around NQ tell me, i am Melefante, if you pick up any rusty weapons i can sharpen them for you, i bought a few too many sharp stones, hahahhahaha.  I am trying to get rid of them wisely!<br/>
