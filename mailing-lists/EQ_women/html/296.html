<div id="ygrps-yiv-1299684670">I can tell you that I met my RL husband some years ago on something called<br/>
Sierra On Line.  Our characters roleplayed together and we were married<br/>
on-line, at the time I was married in real life (but not happily).  After<br/>
time, we became RL friends (though we never met) and then I got a divorce<br/>
and we met in real life. He moved to where i live and we have been together<br/>
for 5 years and got married just last year.<br/>
<br/>
I have known people that have gotten really involved in their characters and<br/>
it has spilled into real life and has caused divorces, great marriages,<br/>
great friendships etc. I think if you and the person you are roleplaying<br/>
with have a clear understanding that this is JUST a roleplay thing<br/>
(especially if you are married or in another serious relationship in real<br/>
life) then you will be fine.  Your partner in real life may not understand<br/>
this roleplaying relationship either and it can cause a great deal of<br/>
jealousy.  Roleplaying the honeymoon can enter dangerous territory. I<br/>
probably dont need to say much more on that subject, unless you both<br/>
understand what you are doing.  Roleplaying (no matter what people say) can<br/>
create alot of emotions for you in real life that you may not want.  For me<br/>
it was a very positive experience that lead to me meeting my best friend, my<br/>
husband.  It was not what I was looking for, but I am sure my husband at the<br/>
time thought it was the worst thing I ever got involved in.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to ramble on, and some may not agree.. but in the end if you both have<br/>
an understanding I think you will be okay.  It is alright in my mind to say<br/>
ooc that you are married, engaged, single etc. so that if someone has the<br/>
idea that since you are roleplaying a romantic relationship it can become<br/>
something more, they will know what to expect.  And yes, you never know who<br/>
is behind the character!  Hope this helps some!<br/>

&gt; As my character is marrying on Sunday I must confess to a few minor<br/>
qualms.  In<br/>
&gt; particular, er, how does one roleplay a honeymoon *smile*.  Unlike many<br/>
who<br/>
&gt; develop relationships in Norrath, my beloved and I are unknown to one<br/>
another in<br/>
&gt; RL.  For all I know he weighs 300 pounds, guzzles beer, and is hygenically<br/>
&gt; challenged *smile*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are times if I wonder if this is a positive thing to be doing.  I<br/>
mean,<br/>
&gt; what if he is some starry eyed adolescent and I ruin him for life *grin*.<br/>
I know<br/>
&gt; MY lines are clearly drawn in fuzz (okay, I think I know the difference<br/>
between<br/>
&gt; reality and fantasy though I swear I saw a Pixie Trickster in the airport<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; other day *grin*).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, this is all fun and games and I am having fun.  But there is this<br/>
part in<br/>
&gt; the back of my mind that wonders.  Because unlike reading romance novels<br/>
(blech -<br/>
&gt; persish the thought) there is another person involved in my little fantasy<br/>
and I<br/>
&gt; must never forget that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any other hard core role players out there struggle with these ridiculous<br/>
&gt; issues?  Any other players over the age of 25, for that matter *smile*<br/>
