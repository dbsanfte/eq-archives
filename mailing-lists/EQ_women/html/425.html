<div id="ygrps-yiv-1772453024">Welcome to the addiction...<br/>
<br/>
The first thing you want to decide is what type of player you think you<br/>
will want to be.  There are three basic kinds of players:<br/>
<br/>
TANKS - these characters do a lot of &quot;mellee&quot; - actually hitting and<br/>
smashing on things, they require a LOT of equipment which means money<br/>
and lots of time searching for armor, the best weapons, etc.  They get<br/>
to kick, bash, dual weild, dodge, taunt etc.  The tank is expected to go<br/>
down to protect caster and healers.  They usually do the pulling of the<br/>
MoBs, take the most damage, and often die the most frequently, though<br/>
that depends in good part on the skill of the group.<br/>
    advantages:  they are the most active of the group<br/>
    disadvantages: they can only be bound in major cities so have lots<br/>
of travel when they day; they have long downtime for healing if not<br/>
paired with a healer<br/>
<br/>
CASTERS - these are the characters that use magic to damage the MoBs.<br/>
They can either do direct damage, damage over time, or area damage.<br/>
They don&#39;t get or need nearly as much in the way of equipment, however<br/>
the spells cost money and at higher levels must be researched which<br/>
means collecting and sorting through tons of runes and words.  Your bank<br/>
will look more like a library than a safety deposit box.   Casters don&#39;t<br/>
really mellee anymore at the higher levels and battle is a matter of<br/>
judicious use of manna.<br/>
    advantages:  they do best in kill stealing areas, its just fun to<br/>
nuke the hell out of a MoB, they can bind themselves wherever they are<br/>
fighting<br/>
    disadvantages:  no strength, very low hit points, LOTS of time spent<br/>
staring at the spell book meditating<br/>
<br/>
HEALERS:  These people spend their time buffing and healing the group.<br/>
They have a few direct damage spells, weaker than pure casters, and they<br/>
do some mellee which means they can wear armor and have the same<br/>
equipment hunting fun as the tanks.  But mostly they heal.  The healer<br/>
is the most beloved and most protected member of any group.  A wise<br/>
group does NOT let the healer die.  And when fighting groups with<br/>
healers, always kill the healer first.<br/>
    advantages:  well loved and can always find a group, only has<br/>
downtime for manna, can bind anywhere like casters.<br/>
    disadvantages:  always getting requests.  &quot;buff me, heal me, feed<br/>
me&quot;  is pretty much all you hear.   And prone to attack since healing<br/>
aggravates MoBs.  Spends as much time meditating as casters, but has<br/>
more strength<br/>
<br/>
So, once you decide the basic TYPE of play you want, then you can look<br/>
at the classes.  I advise you pick the class first and the race second<br/>
even though the &quot;Character Select&quot; screen is geared the other way.  Some<br/>
classes are limited, such as Shamans.   Only Barbarians, Trolls, and<br/>
Ogres can be Shamans.<br/>
<br/>
Among the different basic categories is some crossover.  The basic TANK<br/>
is the warrior.  However, Paladins, Shadow Knights, and Rangers are also<br/>
considred tanks.  All of these are 3/4 warrior.  The Paladin is 1/4<br/>
cleric.  The SK 1/4 necormancer.  The Ranger 1/4 Druid.   This means<br/>
they get the skills of the other class, only their spells will be<br/>
significantly weaker.  They also take experience penalties because they<br/>
are hybrids.<br/>
<br/>
The basic CASTER is the wizard.  The wizard does the most DD of all the<br/>
casting classes, but has no pet and is toast soloing if root doesn&#39;t<br/>
work (my experience at least).  The Magician is second most powerful,<br/>
with lesser spells but with a pet to tank for him.  Enchanters are also<br/>
pure casters and very well loved at the high levels once they can<br/>
mesmerize and cast clarity.   Necromancers are pure casters as well, and<br/>
probably one of, if not THE, most powerful classes with the strongest<br/>
pets in the game and the ability to heal off the prey plus use health<br/>
for manna.<br/>
<br/>
The basic HEALER is the cleric.  They have the most powerful of all<br/>
healing spells and the best buffs in the game.  They are also very<br/>
powerful casters against the undead.  I would list Shamans, Druids, and<br/>
Bards as healers as well, since they get good healing and buffing<br/>
skills.  However, they also get excellent Damage over Time spells and<br/>
some decent DD.<br/>
<br/>
Once you figure out which class, then you might want to decide whether<br/>
you want to play good guy or bad guy.  Bad guy is harder because there<br/>
are so many places you are killed on sight and a lot of time needs to be<br/>
spent fixing factions for easier travel.<br/>
<br/>
When it comes to pumping up your stats, if you are a caster or healer,<br/>
put everything you can into int (caster) or wisdom (healer).  If you are<br/>
a tank, strength and dexterity are important.  The green characteristics<br/>
on the screen are the ones you want to pump up.  But your manna will be<br/>
determined by int and wisdom and I find being encumbered because I can&#39;t<br/>
carry anything pretty tolerable as a caster since I don&#39;t move much<br/>
during battle anyway.  Pretty pathetic trying to travel with 3,000 loose<br/>
coins though *smiles*.<br/>
<br/>
Then go out and start killing snakes and rats and bats.  Ask questions<br/>
in /ooc and you&#39;ll get tons of help.  It&#39;s a mostly friendly game,<br/>
really.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Salutations All!<br/>
&gt; It has been a bit since I have posted asking for some input on getting the game Ever Quest. I do appreciate the input I got and I did end up buying the game a few weeks ago. However, with one thing and another I did not get it installed onto my computer until today and as of right now I still have not signed on. That will probably be tomorrow sometime.<br/>
&gt; Anyway, now that I am actually on the verge of getting started I had a couple of questions I was hoping some of you might help answer.<br/>
&gt; 1.) The tutorial that is included on the CD keeps locking up. Did anyone else have this problem? It has me a bit worried in that I am afraid that the game might do the same thing. It always happens shortly after leaving the guildmaster to go get some food. Any input, or suggestions?<br/>
&gt; I will be contacting the website to see if they might know why but was wondering if any of you had the same problem.<br/>
&gt; 2.) Can anyone give me some suggestion on where to start or what to do first? Some suggestions from those who have been there and done that might be helpful/useful?<br/>
&gt; 3.) Anyone looking for a trainee or companion to go adventuring with. I plan on trying to start with a half-elf bard, and am looking forward to doing some adventuring with someone or several someones if anyone is interested in taking on a beginner.<br/>
&gt; Well, I hope everyone had a good Christmas and look foward to chating a bit and seeing some of you in the world of EQ.<br/>
&gt; Happy Adventuring,<br/>
