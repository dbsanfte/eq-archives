<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;m not too sure about that one myself, the chaste part, I took it from<br/>
&gt;actual conversations with the sisters on the isle.  My best guess is that<br/>
&gt;the sisters strive to be chaste because they don&#39;t want their love to be<br/>
&gt;bound and focussed on any one person.  I&#39;d like to see the whole chaste<br/>
&gt;thing as a role playing element we can use if we want to, and not use if<br/>
&gt;we don&#39;t want to.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But do we have to be like the NPC Sisters?  Seems to me the player guild can<br/>
be<br/>
different (like allowing men in, for one thing).  Honestly, the ancient<br/>
custom<br/>
of sacred prostitution (hence sharing the love of the Goddess with Her<br/>
worshippers) seems more likely to me, but not something we would necessarily<br/>
want to implement!  But I am not too big on the chastity idea either - who<br/>
says<br/>
Sisters are monogamous in their love?<br/>
If nothing else, my character is unlikely to be chaste, but I would hate to<br/>
have<br/>
<br/>
to view this choice as violating her vows to the Goddess, if you see what I<br/>
mean.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;As for the men-protecting-the-women thing, it can be taken that way, but<br/>
&gt;it doesn&#39;t have to.  I was basicly just trying to identify a nice way in<br/>
&gt;which men could be incoroporated into the guild.  Your character could<br/>
&gt;choose to not have a warder, and that would be a valid choice.  If I were<br/>
&gt;to have a warder, I would see him as a default following of Erollisi<br/>
&gt;looking to serve his god, and not as someone I needed for protection.<br/>
&gt;Others might choose to define their relationship with their Warder in a<br/>
&gt;different way (love, protection, siblings, or even the sister protecting<br/>
&gt;the Warder?)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would seriously have to ponder the issue for my own character.  Guess we<br/>
will<br/>
see how it goes.<br/>
Anyway, good luck!<br/>
