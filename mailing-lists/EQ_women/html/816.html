&lt;&lt; when you go to make your clothes you place all of<br/>
the ingredients in the box (minus the pattern) and hit<br/>
combine. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t get the pattern the first time for some<br/>
reason, but I did combine and get the cloth. I thought<br/>
I was supposed to give it back to him. &quot;Sigh&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; This should result in some specially named piece of<br/>
cloth you place the fabric and the pattern inside a<br/>
loom/sewing kit and combine to get the armor. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Does this mean I can&#39;t make the armor until I get high<br/>
enough in my tailoring skill? How high should I be to<br/>
do that. I think my current level is about 17?<br/>
I have the same problem with my bow quest. I have<br/>
everything I need, but someone told me I needed to be<br/>
about 150 in fletching before I can be pretty sure of<br/>
making a bow. So, I just put everything in the bank to<br/>
await that day, if or when it arrives.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; The only ingredients that you hand back to the guy<br/>
giving out the quests are the ones for the weapon<br/>
which is normally given after you ask for the<br/>
tunic/breastplate. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I got the weapon quest (sword), or at least was told<br/>
what I needed. Two Orc eyes and a Master Key. I&#39;ve got<br/>
all this. Do I need to put in a special bag or just<br/>
hand them all to the guy and then get my sword?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; As for getting ripped off on the Forest Drakling<br/>
Scale, I know how that goes. Those silly things out<br/>
not to be selling for more than 2-3pp, however, the<br/>
pristine are so rare and in such demand still that<br/>
people are selling them for as high as 50pp. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
To be honest after several hours of game time and lots<br/>
of dead FD&#39;s I would not have minded that much if I<br/>
had at least managed not to turn around and throw it<br/>
all away.<br/>
:o/<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Personally I wouldn&#39;t pay more than 5pp for a<br/>
regular or ruined FDS, or over 10pp for the Pristine<br/>
FDS. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Live and learn, and they did offer to trade, but I<br/>
didn&#39;t have what they wanted.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Scales in Misty Thicket are a different story.....<br/>
