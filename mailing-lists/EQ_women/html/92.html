<b>Subject:</b> Re: Real females on Rallos Zek? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1494226631">I play a dark elf female cleric on Rallos Zek, and I haven&#39;t actually run into<br/>
those problems there as much as I have on Povar.  Maybe it&#39;s the whole cleric<br/>
thing, I dunno.  On the other hand, I DID meet one of the best roleplayers I&#39;ve<br/>
ever seen on that server, and after he rescued me from a pretty hairy<br/>
situation, he gave me patchwork leggings....unsolicited! He had just upgraded<br/>
and appreciated my roleplaying and effusive gratitude and thought I was worthy.<br/>
&lt;shrugs&gt;  Nothing like that had ever happened to me on Povar.  The PvP server<br/>
wasn&#39;t what I expected, I must say, and neither was playing a Dark elf<br/>
character.  It&#39;s actually been a good experience!<br/>

&gt; My RL friend plays on Rallos Zek. He doesn&#39;t SAY he wants me to play there,<br/>
&gt; but he keeps asking about the character I made on that server.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway Saturday I spent level 2 being chased by a &quot;female&quot; character named<br/>
&gt; Typehere in the newbie area outside Kelethin. It was annoying, though<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s no reason to whine and complain if you are playing on Rallos Zek.<br/>
&gt; But I just no for certain that Typehere was NOT a real female.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So I&#39;m asking if there ARE any real females on Rallos Zek. I told my friend<br/>
&gt; no, he said he thought there were.<br/>
&gt; Anyone here play there? How do you put up with the annoyances? I&#39;m as tough<br/>
&gt; as anyone, but the game is challenging enough as it is, without worrying<br/>
&gt; about &quot;Typeheres.&quot;<br/>
