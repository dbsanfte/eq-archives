<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045565742">I have a topic for discussion, actually.  Since this is a women&#39;s list what<br/>
better place to talk about the number of men that play women characters on<br/>
EQ?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care what gender that people play in the game, but what I&#39;m finding<br/>
particularly disturbing is the amount of men that pretend they are women<br/>
characters then start the typical &quot;romancing&quot; song and dance (be it fantasy<br/>
or with the intention of bringing it to reality) of the male characters (or<br/>
in some cases, other female characters).  For example, I know of a man who<br/>
plays a female wizard on my server who started telling me how &quot;bonded&quot; they<br/>
felt to me...how well we connect. All the while, my male friends on EQ are<br/>
starting to wonder about the odd friendliness that the char exhibited toward<br/>
me...but the guy didn&#39;t want our other EQ friends to know it was a guy<br/>
playing a girl. I&#39;ve extracted myself from that situation but know of other<br/>
male characters that he/she has started to be extra friendly with. When I<br/>
let those male char&#39;s know of the deception they are typically appalled, not<br/>
so much from a homophobic standpoint, but from the idea that they were<br/>
deceived.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard that from other guys too...they start hanging out with a female<br/>
character and weeks after flirting online they discover that it is a guy<br/>
that they are with.<br/>
<br/>
Again, the idea of flipping genders isn&#39;t too disturbing to me..it&#39;s how far<br/>
they carry the deception that gets me a bit riled up. And...I find that a<br/>
lot of the male characters are really hesitant to believe that I am a woman.<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering if any of you have had good, bad experiences or just general<br/>
comments?<br/>

&gt; This list has grown pretty quiet, and that&#39;s ok.  I thought I&#39;d send an<br/>
&gt; innocent &#39;hi&#39; to the list though and see what everyone has been up to in<br/>
&gt; EQ lately?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I recently became an apprentice guide and I&#39;ve been having a lot of fun<br/>
&gt; with that.  We&#39;re not supposed to tell people what server we&#39;re on<br/>
&gt; unfortunately, so I can&#39;t tell you that =/<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My Ranger on Brell made 50 recently (I also have a 50 enchanter there).<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been spending a lot of time killing dragons, and romping though the<br/>
&gt; planes.  In a way I miss the simpler dungeons, since plane and dragon<br/>
&gt; raids are usually always lengthy undertakings, and 90% of the time you<br/>
&gt; just sit around waiting for the next fight to happen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I started a baby magician on Luclin mostly to visit a close friend who has<br/>
&gt; moved there.  It&#39;s nice to have a pet =) They&#39;re fun.<br/>
