<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443875062">LOL!  My oldest son has been playing a female since EQ started!  He<br/>
says he never got anything from anyone.  Nobody was high enough<br/>
back then.  He says a SoW was uber then!  I didn&#39;t mind until once<br/>
I caught him sending a picture of a female classmate, claiming it<br/>
was him.  I grounded him and threatened to tell his guildmates.<br/>
