bizillion alts in my lifetime (sigh).&nbsp; </font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Anyway, the good news about rangers is how bad the 
rep is.&nbsp; I play a ranger on TP, the new server.&nbsp; At 12 I got an Ebony 
Blade because I was the only ranger anyone in the group knew.&nbsp; Another one 
went up on the boards because no one in that group knew any rangers ;-)&nbsp;

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I play, when possible which it hasn&#39;t been in 
forever, with a now 55 ranger on Brell (sylvanar, I play Iceiallana, a 54 
druid).&nbsp; He has no trouble getting groups anymore.&nbsp; A lot of the flack 
is over and it has turned into a huge joke.&nbsp;&nbsp; I get some grief for 
being a ranger, but there are only 22 of us on the new server (giggles) and 
since casters outnumber tanks 3:1 now, anyone who can tank is wanted for 
groups.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">As for kicking the habit, congratulatoins.&nbsp; 
I&#39;ve come close twice but never succeeded.&nbsp; &lt;sigh&gt;</font></div>
