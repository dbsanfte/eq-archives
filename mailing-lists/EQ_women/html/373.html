<b>Subject:</b> Got 50, met Nagafen, lost 50... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-859270833">Hey everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I got level 50 with my enchanter on Brell Serelist yesterday.  Then I<br/>
joined a expedition to take on Nagafen (first try on the server).  We got<br/>
through the first fire giants ok.  Then we got through King Tranix the<br/>
fire giant SK ok.  Next we got to Nagafen herself.  She had a unique fire<br/>
giant wizard guarding her.  In the first attack, we took down the wizard,<br/>
but Nagafen killed everyone.  We then sent several more waves attacking<br/>
Nagafen.  We unfortunately never got her below 60% health.  I lost about 5<br/>
bars of xp dying about 10 times.  Some people lost up to twice that much.<br/>
It was a really exciting fun experience though.  The scariest thing about<br/>
the whole thing was that many big players had their corpses sitting right<br/>
under Nagafen and it was possible we&#39;d never get their corpses back (mine<br/>
was there too).  But, brave warriors through themselves at Nagafen while<br/>
we dragged our corpses away so they could be looted.<br/>
