<div id="ygrps-yiv-1403657709">This list has grown pretty quiet, and that&#39;s ok.  I thought I&#39;d send an<br/>
innocent &#39;hi&#39; to the list though and see what everyone has been up to in<br/>
EQ lately?<br/>
<br/>
I recently became an apprentice guide and I&#39;ve been having a lot of fun<br/>
with that.  We&#39;re not supposed to tell people what server we&#39;re on<br/>
unfortunately, so I can&#39;t tell you that =/<br/>
<br/>
My Ranger on Brell made 50 recently (I also have a 50 enchanter there).<br/>
I&#39;ve been spending a lot of time killing dragons, and romping though the<br/>
planes.  In a way I miss the simpler dungeons, since plane and dragon<br/>
raids are usually always lengthy undertakings, and 90% of the time you<br/>
just sit around waiting for the next fight to happen.<br/>
<br/>
I started a baby magician on Luclin mostly to visit a close friend who has<br/>
moved there.  It&#39;s nice to have a pet =) They&#39;re fun.<br/>
