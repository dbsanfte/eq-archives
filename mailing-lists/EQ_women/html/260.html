&gt;Hail all!<br/>
&gt;Well, I had a good chuckle reading the post about blondes and brunettes in<br/>
&gt;EQ. Guys are just too silly aren&#39;t they? They see a blonde graphic and <br/>
&gt;start<br/>
&gt;to follow it around, but won&#39;t do the same for a brunette graphic? No <br/>
&gt;wonder<br/>
&gt;they fall for silicone breasts and bleach blondes in real life! :)<br/>
&gt;As I play a dwarf I have a less &quot;seductive&quot; look in-game, something I share<br/>
&gt;with other short people like gnomes and halflings (and of course ogres and<br/>
&gt;trolls :) I guess the programmers like the long legged half nudes, but kept<br/>
&gt;us short and stumpy folk in more sensible knee socks and heftier underwear.<br/>
&gt;I personally think a lot of the female clothing looks beautiful (wood elf<br/>
&gt;banded is one of my favourites), but I do understand the comments about it<br/>
&gt;looking rather trampy and downright hard to wear in battle. It would be <br/>
&gt;nice<br/>
&gt;if there was an option to have your outfit either revealing or not so<br/>
&gt;revealing. Like a roleplay switch sort of :) Then the female casters could<br/>
&gt;choose a bustier look, and the warriors could (if they so wished) choose to<br/>
&gt;cover themselves a bit more.<br/>
&gt;Anyway, I hope this clothing issue doesn&#39;t discourage too many players. <br/>
