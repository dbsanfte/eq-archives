<div id="ygrps-yiv-757891065">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I am Dornita and Dornar, two characters on the Fennin Ro server.<br/>
<br/>
Dornita is a 19th level High Elf Paladin who comes from a very rich <br/>
Felwithe family that is in the shipping business.  She is a clothes horse <br/>
and only wears the finest armor and accouterments.  She has a personal Chef <br/>
named Pierre who packs her picnic baskets with the finest wines and <br/>
eatables.  She is very snooty and does not deign to talk to the plebeians <br/>
that<br/>
wander around Faydwer whining about their lost corpses and hawking their <br/>
trashy loot.  She has a crush on Lord Jyleel, but he only tells her that he <br/>
is sorry she is not a defender. She has taken vows of purity, duty and <br/>
honor to shape her behavior, and often lays down her life for her group. <br/>
 She is patient and not greedy.  She solos very well, but is an extremely <br/>
slow leveler.  As a paladin she is a mini-tank, mini-cleric and <br/>
very-mini-caster (undead only), but she has maximum skills in swimming, <br/>
fishing and sense heading, as well as the 5 ranks of magic use.<br/>
<br/>
Dornar is Dornita&#39;s wood elf cousin.  She is a 14th level Druid and a <br/>
pretty good tailor.  She is a member of a hunting club, so she only gets to <br/>
come out on Monday nights and Thursdays when she groups with her hunting <br/>
club.  She sometimes sneaks out when she falls behind the levels of the <br/>
other members of the hunting club, so she can catch up, since she is a very <br/>
slow leveler.  She would be on all the time, but SHE PROMISED TO BE GOOD. <br/>
 (But she is such a good solo character, it is very hard).  She binds, <br/>
levitates, swims underwater, befriends animals, runs like a wolf, and hides <br/>
like a tree.  She likes to explore and is very good at one handed slashing <br/>
and offensive magic use.<br/>
<br/>
We look forward to meeting the other women of Everquest.<br/>
<br/>
D and D  (pun intended, hehe)<br/>
<br/>
Ps.  Yes, I am a women in real life, too.  Probably one of the oldest <br/>
players of EQ.<br/>
