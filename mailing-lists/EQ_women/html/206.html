<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-103721893">Hey folks -- trim your quotes!!!  Suzanne and Dawn have been posting <br/>
two-line messages followed by the entire contents of a digest.  This makes <br/>
it almost impossible to read any messages following them in the digest, <br/>
since they are lost in the spam.  It also makes the download time <br/>
excessive.  This is at the least an inconvenience, and some people pay for <br/>
their download time, so it&#39;s an extra expense.  Try to follow basic <br/>
netiquette and don&#39;t quote anything that you aren&#39;t specifically intending <br/>
to have people re-read.<br/>
