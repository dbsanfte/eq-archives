  <div>&quot;My son&quot; was 9lbs 9oz... my niece is the first girl out of us siblings 
  that have had munchkins. I really really really hope I am blessed in the 
  future with a little girl to have hold and love. I am happy for my sister but 
  jealous at the same time!!! Thankfully she said I could &quot;kidnap&quot; her little 
  one but I&#39;m waiting until she&#39;s bigger since 3lbs is too small for me and I&#39;d 
  be afraid of hurting her... my son was huge so he was easy to me.</div>
