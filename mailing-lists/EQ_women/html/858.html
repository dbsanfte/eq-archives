&lt;&lt; You can create serverwide channels I believe. To do<br/>
it you do something like:<br/>
/join serverwide.women<br/>
So everyone could in theory join that channel and<br/>
chat, even being on different servers. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Cool. Do you know how you would then talk on that<br/>
channel vs. others or distinguish from ingame play.<br/>
<br/>
for example I can type /g to talk to my guild. Would<br/>
you have to type the above every time you wanted to<br/>
may any statement? Would there be a check to see who<br/>
was on the serverwide.women? Just curious. If there is<br/>
I could open this up when I got on, check for anyone<br/>
else who had done the same than say hi . . .<br/>
