these are some of my fav sites. It has been very important to me to learn<br/>
how to use my sense heading and LOC buttons. I get lost easily, in reallife<br/>
and these keep me from being so lost in EQ. I am new to EQ also but am<br/>
addicted!!!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Salutations All!<br/>
&gt;It has been a bit since I have posted asking for some input on getting the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>game Ever Quest. I do appreciate the input I got and I did end up buying the<br/>
game a few weeks ago. However, with one thing and another I did not get it<br/>
installed onto my computer until today and as of right now I still have not<br/>
signed on. That will probably be tomorrow sometime.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Anyway, now that I am actually on the verge of getting started I had a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>couple of questions I was hoping some of you might help answer.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;1.) The tutorial that is included on the CD keeps locking up. Did anyone<br/>
 </span></blockquote>else have this problem? It has me a bit worried in that I am afraid that the<br/>
game might do the same thing. It always happens shortly after leaving the<br/>
guildmaster to go get some food. Any input, or suggestions?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I will be contacting the website to see if they might know why but was<br/>
 </span></blockquote>wondering if any of you had the same problem.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2.) Can anyone give me some suggestion on where to start or what to do<br/>
 </span></blockquote>first? Some suggestions from those who have been there and done that might<br/>
be helpful/useful?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;3.) Anyone looking for a trainee or companion to go adventuring with. I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>plan on trying to start with a half-elf bard, and am looking forward to<br/>
doing some adventuring with someone or several someones if anyone is<br/>
interested in taking on a beginner.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Well, I hope everyone had a good Christmas and look foward to chating a bit<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and seeing some of you in the world of EQ.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Happy Adventuring,<br/>
