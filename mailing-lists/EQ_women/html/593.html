<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The &quot;rangers suck&quot; issue started at 50 when rangers 
could deal out proportionately more damange than any other tank, but could take 
less damage and therefore they were constantly draining all the mana of the 
clerics and dying a LOT.&nbsp; Verant recently raised the caps on their ability 
to avoid getting hit (which rangers should excel at over other tanks) and there 
is hope that this will balance the play.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">BUT, rangers are not really &quot;tanks&quot; in that they 
cannot take damage.&nbsp; They are mellee class because they dish out INCREDIBLE 
amounts of damage, esp. at 50+ (I watched Sylvanar solo a mob in Fear and KS 
from the casters everytime).&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to learn when to backout of 
fights to lower ourselves from the top of the aggro list.&nbsp; We need to 
always pull from a distance (that&#39;s why we have such good archery skills).&nbsp; 
I&#39;d like to see us get even better archery weapons so we could stand back away 
from the tanks and just play archers, but the damage done now doesn&#39;t compare 
with duel weilding 2 fast weapons with a haste belt and haste buff.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Yeah, it&#39;s a great class.&nbsp; You just have to 
max out your AC (hard withough plate) and play smart.&nbsp; That, and have a 
good attitude about dying and getting teased ;-)</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>Now that I know I can post to the board, I&#39;d like to 
  introduce <br>myself. I&#39;m Liz, and I started playing EQ just over a month ago, 
  with <br>a ranger (no, they do not suck; perfect newbie class) on 
  <br>Quellious.She is called Gyngermynx (it sounded like a clever at the 
  <br>time, but how will I ever think of a surname to go with it?)<br><br>I live 
  in the UK, so I lose a lot of sleep trying to group with my <br>new friends 
  from the US and my guildmates, the Fremen, a new and <br>friendly little 
  guild; what about Frewomen, though ;).<br><br>If you see me, do please say 
  hello :)<br><br>Liz<br><br></tt><br></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
