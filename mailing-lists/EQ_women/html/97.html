<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866379683">In case anyone is wondering why I have a man&#39;s name before my e-mail<br/>
address I&#39;ll tell ya. If you take a look at the agreement when you sign<br/>
up for yahoo mail it says you absolutely have to provide correct<br/>
information that they can give to certain people for demographic<br/>
information or some such silly stuff, so I of course couldn&#39;t put real<br/>
stuff down. The best way to get me to not do something is to tell me I<br/>
absolutely have to do it! hehe<br/>
 Anyways, I don&#39;t have a problem with this so called twinking. The only<br/>
way I figure I could begrudge someone of their good fortune is if I<br/>
were jealous. I&#39;m not real fond of sitting and whacking on monsters<br/>
just to build levels anyway. I figure the only reason we do this anyway<br/>
is to learn to work together to achieve a goal. That&#39;s what I think is<br/>
the fun part. When I really think about it, or when I allow myself to,<br/>
I find something really disturbing in several people crowding around<br/>
and beating up on another creature. I make myself feel better by<br/>
telling myself that it is in fact a monster and that this has nothing<br/>
to do with real life. (I went through a couple of days thinking about<br/>
what it says about my character that I participate in such an activity<br/>
and have decided that no, this does not mean I&#39;m conditioning myself to<br/>
getting together with a gang and beating up on another human being. It<br/>
really made me sick when I first saw what was going on.) But I digress.<br/>
If someone else has the good fortune or friends or whatever to give<br/>
them neat stuff so what? I mean, rl isn&#39;t fair either is it? I wasn&#39;t<br/>
born rich and I don&#39;t have a problem with someone who is. Big deal.<br/>
It&#39;s not like they&#39;re gonna suddenly shoot up to 50th level because<br/>
they got a neato mace or some moderate armor. I personally WILL NOT eek<br/>
through the first several levels ever again because I&#39;ve already done<br/>
it once and I appreciate what it took to get there. Enough already. I&#39;m<br/>
not sure why someone else has to suffer to make me feel better about my<br/>
situation. Someone else&#39;s twinking hasn&#39;t made a bit of difference in<br/>
my online life other than listening to other people bitch about it.<br/>
That&#39;s what I found the most annoying.<br/>
