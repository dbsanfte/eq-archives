<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899563177">You need a GM if you need to change your surname to match his. The only <br/>
real service GMs provide is changing your surname when you are married. <br/>
They also sometimes help make weddings more fun by performing the marriage <br/>
ceremony.<br/>
<br/>
As for gifts, well that&#39;s up to you. A great place to look for wedding <br/>
gifts might be the Bazaar, you can buy almost anything there and usually <br/>
at a great value.<br/>
<br/>
Any ring can be a wedding ring but PC jewlers can make rings that are <br/>
actually called &#39;wedding rings&#39;. The cheapest wedding ring is an electrum <br/>
carnelian wedding ring, you could probably get one made for about 5pp but <br/>
it would be a special order. You can also get Diamond and Fire Opal <br/>
wedding rings that will be more expensive (then can be as expensive as <br/>
1000pp). Like real life, with wedding rings you need to figure out how <br/>
much you want to spend, then talk to a jewler, and they&#39;ll be happy to <br/>
take all your money.<br/>
