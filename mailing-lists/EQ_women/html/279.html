<div id="ygrps-yiv-1553500801">Okay, I am on the East Coast, and all set up again! Wow, what a move....&lt;groans&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As far as our meeting goes, here is a rough update.  So far, Friday and<br/>
Wednesdays are bad days for us, and it&#39;s going to be the first week of August.<br/>
How about that first Thursday? Any one have a conflict with that?<br/>
<br/>
I have made a character named Ishtarre, who will act as hostess only to the<br/>
point of getting everyone together.  She will probably be 3rd or 4th at the<br/>
most.  I will be getting her to Freeport, where she will start making bat<br/>
crunchies like there is no tomorrow. =)  Make a new character, bring one if you<br/>
have one already so we can see who you like to be, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really excited about this.  I don&#39;t know anyone here yet except my family<br/>
and I won&#39;t be starting college until the fall, so......I&#39;m lonely! hehe<br/>

&gt; are we all making newbie level 1s then or should we have a character up some<br/>
&gt; in levels?  Where can we all meet at?  Almost any day is good for me except<br/>
&gt; wednesdays<br/>
