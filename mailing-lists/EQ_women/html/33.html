<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146278943">Hello Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
It has been a long night of fighting orcs and watching the beautiful unicorn<br/>
in Lesser so I will keep this short.<br/>
<br/>
My girls all live on Bristlebane and they are:<br/>
<br/>
Bitty lvl 3 halfling Druid  -- However, Bitty has had a head injury and does<br/>
not acknowledge she is a Druid, she believes she is a pirate and that<br/>
someone has stolen her ship, The Miss Lady Red Toes. Please be kind to her,<br/>
she is quite insane.<br/>
<br/>
Garnet lvl 7 human Ranger -- A bit tough but has a good heart but, shhhh,<br/>
don&#39;t tell that to anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Honi lvl 6 human Bard --  Honi was named for her sweet voice and<br/>
disposition.<br/>
<br/>
Ivory lvl 6 high elf Cleric -- Ivory is a tailor as well as a healer.  Quiet<br/>
but good at her job.<br/>
<br/>
Kachine lvl 12 human Monk -- Very shy, Kachine is to be married to Mondre, a<br/>
15th level Cleric.<br/>
<br/>
Zuzu lvl 9 troll Warrior -- Zuzu also has some mental problems but we don&#39;t<br/>
mention them to her because we don&#39;t want to get &quot;barshed on de hed&quot;.   She<br/>
is convinced she is beautiful and boasts about it on a regular basis.  She<br/>
thinks she has won some sort of beauty contest to prove it but, when<br/>
questioned about it, she changes the subject with song or threats of<br/>
barshing.  She also thinks she is always right.<br/>
<br/>
So, there you have it, my girls.  If you are ever on Bristlebane, take a<br/>
moment and say hello.  Another female and I were discussing how difficult it<br/>
is to make female friends on our server.  We have both encountered many rude<br/>
female chars. and it was beyond role-play.   I told her I felt most were 13<br/>
year old males, lol.  Seriously though, she and I have talked about this and<br/>
would like some input regarding the subject. Do you find this on the other<br/>
servers?  I love my male friends dearly but, come on, we all need a little<br/>
girl-talk now and then, don&#39;t we?  I am looking forward to some feedback on<br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
Well, so much for short.  Glad to be here on the list with all of you.<br/>
<br/>
