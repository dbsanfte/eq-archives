<div id="ygrps-yiv-1946859049">I&#39;m a shmoe.  My dad&#39;s birthday is today, and I totally forgot (I swear, I think I<br/>
got thrown by that whole 7th/8th Saturday/Sunday thing too).  Dnaice, I wanted so<br/>
badly to be at your festivities, but there isn&#39;t a way possible.  I hope you will<br/>
forgive me and appreciate the sentiment that I wanted to be there.  I hope your big<br/>
day is as wondrous as a girl could wish for, and that you are surrounded by your<br/>
friends and chosen family, and feel truly loved, respected, and cherished.  I wish<br/>
you the best of adventures and most glorious of hunts, and I hope Corellon<br/>
appreciates the treasure he is being gifted with--your love and companionship.<br/>
