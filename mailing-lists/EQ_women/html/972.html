<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631810365">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Mary Beth and I play a 65 Dark Elf Cleric (Brinni) and a 65 <br/>
Human Monk (Naiya) on the Ayonae Ro server.  I belong to the guild <br/>
Legend of the Jokers www.lotj.net and I have just ran across this <br/>
mailing list.  I would love to be a part of it and meet some new <br/>
everquest players; female ones at that! <br/>
<br/>
I should also mention that I am doing a University paper on the <br/>
women of everquest.  The other reason I decided to join this mail <br/>
list is to get some opinions from other women who play everquest and <br/>
what it means to them to be involved in this type of mporpg.  If <br/>
anyone is interested in finding more information out about my <br/>
research paper and wouldn&#39;t mind answering a few questions, feel <br/>
free to contact me either through here or privately. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks and I look forward to meeting all of you!<br/>
~Mary Beth</div>
