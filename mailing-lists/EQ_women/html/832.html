<div><font face="Arial" size="2">There&#39;s a ranger haven on the mainland outside of 
Qeynos, IIRC.&nbsp; That&#39;s where I got married.&nbsp; The name escapes me 
(haven&#39;t played in a long while) but someone on the list should know of which I 
speak.&nbsp; It&#39;s very nice.&nbsp; If you have any concerns about guests&#39; 
safety, ask some of your &#39;wedding party&#39; to be &#39;ushers&#39;, ie., escort your guests 
from Qeynos.&nbsp; Or have a wizard &#39;port &#39;em in.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">My fiance and I were both rangers.&nbsp; We were 
very effective at taunting; once one&#39;d take too much damage, the other would 
start taunting madly.&nbsp; &#39;Course, the roles may have changed in the past 
year...</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Guilds, eh... they&#39;re nice if you&#39;ve joined one 
because you regularly adventure with many of its members, but I never personally 
advertised for a guild.&nbsp; I tended to let my escapades take me where they 
would (as an elven ranger when Povar was first new, there was A LOT of escapade) 
and ran into my guild brethren when hunting.&nbsp; When I began looking for them 
when I signed on, I knew I was finding a &quot;home&quot;.&nbsp; Just my two 
coppers&#39;.</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>Salutations All!<br><br>I have not posted for a while, and 
  I know everyone was probably <br>relaxing a little and here I am 
  again.<br>:o)<br><br>EQ has been progressing prettry good for me I think. I&#39;ve 
  made a <br>couple of good friends who are more experienced then me and don&#39;t 
  <br>seem to mind giving advice or helping out so that&#39;s very nice.<br><br>I&#39;ve 
  also been trying to learn more about my role as a Ranger in <br>Norrath. I 
  just found out last week what a handy thing taunt can be <br>when trying to 
  keep a mob off your healer? OK, I&#39;m slow but I&#39;m <br>getting there I think. 
  And I&#39;ve gotten duel wield and double attack <br>now so that&#39;s interesting to 
  play with.<br><br>Last night a Druid friend and I went to Paudal Cavern for my 
  first <br>trip there. I would have died twice during the first fight we had I 
  <br>think if they had not been there to keep me from deaths door. That <br>was 
  a tough mob and red all the way for me at lvl 19 (20 now).<br><br>Anyway, 
  enough ramblin, so it&#39;s question time:<br><br>1.) I have been asked to get 
  married and have said yes. :o) Any good <br>suggestions on locations that 
  would be nice but not to hard for <br>guests to get to? He has a place in 
  mind, I forget the name, but it <br>sounds like it might be hard for lower 
  level characters to even <br>reach. I have not traveled over much of Norrath 
  still so I&#39;m not <br>sure. Anyway, if anyone has ideas I&#39;d love to hear 
  them.<br>Also, when things are set, which may be a while I&#39;ll post a note here 
  <br>letting everyone know. You are all invited, of course, feel free to 
  <br>come if you have a character on the Xegony server, of if you want <br>just 
  create a quick one at the proper time and come anyway. I&#39;d love <br>to meet 
  anyone who might do me the honor of coming.<br><br>2.) Can anyone give me 
  advice on how to find a guild that might be <br>interested in letting a Ranger 
  in the low 20&#39;s join? Would it be ok <br>to just kind of start asking around? 
  Is there a way to tell a better <br>guild from one not as good?<br><br>Anyway, 
  I hope everyone had a nice Thanksgiving.<br><br>Hugs<br>:o)<br>Bran<br>lvl 20
