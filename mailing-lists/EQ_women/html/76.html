<div id="ygrps-yiv-638771449">I tend to heal anyone who is in danger of dying in <br/>
combat, but if a person is not in danger I generally <br/>
don&#39;t.  I haven&#39;t had a lot of people ask me for heals <br/>
though.  If I am asked for heals, I&#39;ll usually say I&#39;m <br/>
low on mana (if I am) or throw a single heal on them if <br/>
I&#39;m full.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if I am full of mana and I&#39;m in the <br/>
mood, I sometimes heal or buff people randomly for no <br/>
reason at all.  It&#39;s an easy way to be nice to someone, <br/>
and make new friends.  People seem in particular to <br/>
appreciate getting Spirit of the Wolf.<br/>
<br/>
I spent three hours last night in Kelethin disguised as <br/>
a tree.  I went about bolting orcs, healing, and buffing <br/>
newbies as they valiantly tried to face off orcs.  That <br/>
was a lot of fun.  I didn&#39;t get any XP, or any treasure,<br/>
but I had set asside the time to do it and it was fun.<br/>
A few newbies were freaked out by this moving tree.  Others speculated as to whether I was an enchanter or a druid.  I saved several people&#39;s lives, and they were very greatful.  A few newbies role played with me, as I presented myself as &#39;The Great Tree&#39;, a protective Kelethin forest spirit.  All in all, it was fun.  I recommend you healers and buffers give a shot at some community service some time, it can be rewarding 8)<br/>

Every person I heal means I have to sit staring at that damn spellbook waiting for my mana to regen. I don&#39;t mind doing that for my partymembers because that&#39;s my job, but not if it&#39;s going to take out of my playing time and I get nothing out of it. <br/>
