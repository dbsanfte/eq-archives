 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll tell you one thing I&#39;d like EQ to do--more consistent reward questing with decent loot items. Not that, mind you, there aren&#39;t any quests (few and far between) that reward with decent items for long and arduous work, but the majority of them seem to me to be unbalanced. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the long and arduous work I mind, that&#39;s the fun and the adventure part of it. It&#39;s the dinky little item you get for completing a storyline quest. And, it seems to me, as I get older in levels, the good quests get fewer and fewer.<br/>

Decent Questing=Decent Rewarding<br/>
