<div id="ygrps-yiv-972543854"><div>&quot;My son&quot; was 9lbs 9oz... my niece is the first girl out of us siblings that have had munchkins. I really really really hope I am blessed in the future with a little girl to have hold and love. I am happy for my sister but jealous at the same time!!! Thankfully she said I could &quot;kidnap&quot; her little one but I&#39;m waiting until she&#39;s bigger since 3lbs is too small for me and I&#39;d be afraid of hurting her... my son was huge so he was easy to me.</div>
