<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi sister!&nbsp; Boy does that sound 
familiar.&nbsp; Which guild?&nbsp; I played my ranger on Tholuxe a long time and 
I think she&#39;s still in Legends.&nbsp; There were a LOT of teenagers in the guild 
as it was growing.&nbsp; Just wondering if it&#39;s the same group.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">My new char will be a Barb Shaman on Tunare.&nbsp; 
I&#39;ll be playing with a 40 wiz and 16 necro.&nbsp;&nbsp; I love flexible 
characters and was always laughed at for being a tanking druid.&nbsp; I remember 
my Shaman friends being able to do crowd control when there was no 
enchanter.&nbsp; Tanking all the time.&nbsp; Apparently the only time Shaman 
really is boring and kinda sucks is when you&#39;re doing buffing circles and they 
have to spend hours and hours buffing people.&nbsp; Plus, they get alchemy which 
sounds REALLy fun!</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Welcome back!&nbsp; And I know just how you feel 
about Brell.&nbsp; Some great friends, but some very awful server 
politics.&nbsp; </font></div>

  again</div>
  <div><br></div><tt><br>After a long absence from the game I&#39;m playing again, 
  kind of.<br><br>As some of you may or may not remember I quit EQ about 5 or 6 
  months ago<br>after breaking up with my boyfriend who I played with constantly 
  before<br>that point. That plust a general disgust with server politics and 
  a<br>new job caused me to quit cold turky.<br><br>I have a close friend who 
  switched to one of the new servers Tholue Paelis<br>(probably mispelled). I 
  decided I would go play a newbie druid on there,<br>and I hunted up to level 
  16 or so. My friend is actually in an uber-guild<br>of sorts on the server, 
  which of course conjures up all sorts of negative<br>imagery. He put me in the 
  guild just so I could listen to guildsay and<br>it&#39;s been an interesting 
  listen to say the least, very teen boy.<br><br>After playing a druid for a 
  little while I started to realllllly miss my<br>enchanter from Brell (54th 
  level). My friend offered to lend me a level 52<br>druid to power level 
  myself. Despite warning bells going off in my head, I<br>figured, what the 
  heck!<br><br>So I started power leveling my brand new first level enchanter, 
  which is<br>an interesting experience to say the least. For those of you who 
  aren&#39;t<br>familiar, high level druid power level characters by buffing them, 
  putting<br>a damage shield on them, and chloroplast. With this a 1st level 
  character<br>can kill a 12th level mob. It took me about 3 hours to get to 
  16th level<br>this way. I continued to tank up to about 30th level at which 
  point it<br>stopped being effective. From that point on I&#39;ve done kiting using 
  memory<br>blur to allow the druid to do all the damage, but allowing my 
  enchanter to<br>then take the kill. I&#39;m 39th level now.<br><br>Now, all of 
  this is not really playing EQ in the sense I normally have.<br>It&#39;s been kind 
  of fun though simply because I haven&#39;t done anything like<br>this before. My 
  goal now is to get 46th level so I can hunt with my<br>friend&#39;s guild, as they 
  go about killing dragons, and Venril Sathir, and<br>other such &quot;uber 
  mobs&quot;.<br><br>But, it all feels very cold in a way, I don&#39;t really know anyone 
  on the<br>server, and the people in the guild don&#39;t seem like people I&#39;ll 
  really<br>like (except for my friend). I wonder sometimes if after I 
  officially join<br>the guild, if I will end up quitting the server a couple 
  days later =) It<br>could happen.<br><br>I&#39;ve gone back to my old server to 
  visit and that&#39;s nice, I always run<br>into some old friends who say hi and 
  chat with me. There are people I<br>still care about on that old server. But, 
  it seems like I have a barrier<br>that prevents me from playing there. I just 
  know if I play there that<br>server politics will rear its ugly head 
  again.<br><br>So for now I will power level my little enchanter on Tholuxe, 
  and see what<br>it&#39;s like playing there. <br><br>Christina<br><br></tt><br></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
