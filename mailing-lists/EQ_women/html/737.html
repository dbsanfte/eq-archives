<div id="ygrps-yiv-472296019">Greetings. My colleague and I are making a documentary about the <br/>
phenomenon of Everquest. We have have become fascinated with all<br/>
aspects of the game. The role-playing, the building up of characters, <br/>
the economy of the game, the way people interact online, etc... We <br/>
hope to explore all these areas of the game by interviewing players, <br/>
spouses, children, parents and even the EQ developers.<br/>
<br/>
We plan on shooting over the next couple of months. We live in Los <br/>
Angeles and are prepared to travel around the country to conduct our <br/>
interviews. <br/>
<br/>
If interested, pease reply to our email eqdocfilm&lt;at&gt;yahoo&lt;dot&gt;com <br/>
and provide us with your age and location (city/state), level and <br/>
guild affiliation, and how long you&#39;ve been playing the game.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Nina and Andy</div>
