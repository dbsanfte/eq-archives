<div id="ygrps-yiv-11330275"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Hi Brent,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The EQ_women list is only for women to join and participate in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I will not enforce this rule in any way, because there is no point in<br/>
&gt;trying to enforce it--anyone can get around it.  I don&#39;t want to pretend<br/>
&gt;that this can be enforced, so I won&#39;t remove you from the list, or even<br/>
&gt;ask you to leave, I&#39;ll just say that that&#39;s the rule.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Digests from the list are publicly readable from www.onelist.com.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- Christina<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok, consider me off the list. If anyone would like to, feel free to drop <br/>
me a line, either in email or on Tarrew Marr.<br/>
