<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578914546">Personally the cloths don&#39;t bother me all that much, i have to set someone<br/>
straight from time to time when they make wise cracks bout my banded armor but it<br/>
doesnt really bother me all that greatly.  For the most part I get very little in<br/>
the way of rude gestures.<br/>

Happy gaming<br/>

&gt; As most of you know an Everquets expansion is going to come out around<br/>
&gt; Christmas.  One of the things I&#39;d like to set up is a petition to get<br/>
&gt; less revealing clothing options for everquest characters.  In particular,<br/>
&gt; I think you should be able to set your newbie (naked) clothing to be something<br/>
&gt; better than, for example, a dark elf bikini.  It would also be nice if you<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t have to wear plate mail before you could get armor that didn&#39;t look<br/>
&gt; like fine mesh with an exposed neckline.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d want this to be an online petition, maybe associated with one of the<br/>
&gt; Everquest websites.  Does anyone know if any of those sites have those<br/>
&gt; sorts of things? I&#39;ve seen lots of &#39;polls&#39; (but really I don&#39;t want to do<br/>
&gt; this as a poll, otherwise all the 16 year old boys will vote no).  I want<br/>
&gt; something where you can submit a form I guess.<br/>
