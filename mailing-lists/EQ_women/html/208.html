<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800133208">I had this problem and what I did to maybe solve it was to open a web page<br/>
underneath before launching EQ and it seems to have helped.  Maybe your ISP<br/>
thinks you went offline?  Not really sure, but the disconnects are rarer<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
A tip I learned from some computer wizards was to also hit control alt<br/>
delete and close everything except for Explorer and Systray after I reboot<br/>
my system.  This has really helped speed up the game and helped a little<br/>
with zoning speed.<br/>

Anyone else have trouble staying in the game? Rather anyone else solve the<br/>
problem of being dropped from the game? I am often dropped from the game to<br/>
my desktop, still connected to the internet. Sometimes it&#39;s easier to play<br/>
early in the morning, but anything after 10 am has gotten impossible. I<br/>
really want to play too. :-(  I&#39;ve been through all the customer service<br/>
folks and their last suggestion is maybe a new modem.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else solved this problem? I have been playing on the pvp server<br/>
and now that I have a few things, this problem makes it too dangerous to<br/>
play. I hope someone can help.<br/>
