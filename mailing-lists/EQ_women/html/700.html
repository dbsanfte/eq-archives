<div id="ygrps-yiv-342753826">Thats a thought, my daughter wants to go back to EQ but just to fool around<br/>
low level when we feel like it.<br/>
<br/>
I have quit AO too now.  Had promise, assuming they made some of thier<br/>
better ideas actually work.  Instead, it seem like they broke more each<br/>
patch than they fixed with the exception of major crashed (they have fixed<br/>
most, but not all).  Half my AO guild is going to try DAoC, and a few EQ<br/>
people I know.<br/>
<br/>
However, recent Sony/Verant comments to a British gaming mag have me very<br/>
hesitant about reopening an EQ account at all. :(<br/>

Subject: [EQ_women] RP Server in Test<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For the RP lovers out there that have quit playing EQ, the new RP server,<br/>
Firiona Vie, is up and running in test (i.e., you have to use eqtst.exe to<br/>
play).  They have new rules: trivial loot, race/class/deity alignments that<br/>
prohibit grouping and guilding with non aligned players, language barriers<br/>
(no<br/>
common tongue at all), everyone is ROLEPLAY ON, and only one character is<br/>
allowed.<br/>
<br/>
I played it the last two nights and had a BLAST!  Everyone in Everfrost<br/>
(never<br/>
did play Shaman past 9 before) was roleplaying.  I hear that wasn&#39;t the case<br/>
in GFay and Qeynos but that the RP&#39;ers were pretty strong and insistent and<br/>
the spam quieted down.  The chars will be wiped out once the server goes<br/>
live,<br/>
but I kind of like Katrice and will probably keep her.  I love the Shaman<br/>
potions they can make now :-)<br/>
<br/>
A few powergamers have decided to come to FV to see how the new rules affect<br/>
people, and as long as they don&#39;t uber guild the server and camp the dragons<br/>
and make the high end game SUCK I don&#39;t mind.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the rumor is the server goes live the day DAoC is released.  I&#39;m<br/>
planning on getting DAoC, but I may just not cancel my EQ account quite yet.<br/>
AO, on the other hand, BIG YAWN!  Made it to 10 and quitting.  Good try, but<br/>
the game is just too buggy *sigh*.<br/>
