<br/>
Thanks for the web site. I sent over there and took a<br/>
look around. There is a lot of good information there,<br/>
about different professions. I&#39;m actually tailoring<br/>
now more than fletching but it appears that lots and<br/>
lots of time could be spent on these activities if you<br/>
really wanted to get good at it.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently there is a market for this kind of stuff<br/>
though. I carry around sewing kits, patterns etc. with<br/>
me pretty much wherever I go lately and in the last<br/>
couple days I&#39;ve had three people ask me about if I<br/>
was a tailor and could I do something for them.<br/>
At this point me skills are so poor that I decline<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
The fletching question came about more from getting<br/>
the treant bow staff and wanting to turn it into a<br/>
bow. Well it&#39;s clear from the little I read on<br/>
fletching last night that even if I go get the rest of<br/>
the materials I need my chances of actually making a<br/>
bow are slim untill I had a lot more practive, so any<br/>
suggestions on how I would be able to find someone<br/>
with enough skill in bowmaking that if I gave them the<br/>
material and offered to pay them some platinum they<br/>
might make the bow for me?<br/>
<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s generally cheaper to buy bows and arrows from<br/>
&gt; merchants than fletch <br/>
&gt; them. The best bows and arrows are fletched, but<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re expensive to <br/>
&gt; make.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Salutations All!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; After wandering all over Nerrath and collecting up<br/>
&gt; &gt; various things and returning them to the head<br/>
&gt; ranger I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was given 15 gold and a treant bow staff thingy.<br/>
&gt; OK,<br/>
&gt; &gt; what do I do with this, or rather since I&#39;m pretty<br/>
&gt; &gt; sure I can make a bow with it how would I go about<br/>
&gt; &gt; doing that? Can anyone help or give suggestions on<br/>
&gt; &gt; this?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt; &gt; :o)<br/>
