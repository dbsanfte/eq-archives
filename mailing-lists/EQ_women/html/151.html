<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1584124348">I recently changed from banded shoulders and girdle and gorget to spiked shoulders, barbed sleeves, purity belt, and spiked collar.  I went from an 81 strength to a 91, with a loss of only a couple AC (and after I&#39;m buffed, that couple points is really meaningless to me, dunno how it is for others).  I plan to go with barbed legs (also found in Unrest)(wow, that dungeon ROCKS....many, many trains on Povar at least) in the future, which will give me a dex bonus (as does the<br/>
barbed shoulders).  One thing that I found rather nifty is that, with an agility of 107, I don&#39;t get hit as often or as hard.  If you find any magical items that give decent agility bonuses, you may wish to consider this.  I&#39;ve had things that are conning red to me miss three times in a row (thank goodness) so I&#39;ve come to appreciate the extra points I threw into it at creation.  Just a thought! =)<br/>

&gt; I wanted to share some armor tips with the list.  My boyfriend and I have done some analysis of the weight and AC benefits of various armors.  The results are somewhat surprising! These should be of particular interest to clerics.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My first tip is to choose your belt carefully! For wizards/necros/enchanters/magicians you want a bear hide belt.  This has 4AC and weighs only 1lb.  For all other classes (except perhaps monks) you want a thick leather apron.  These can be found in unrest, and they give 8AC (same as plate) but weigh only 1lb.  Both of these items are a great value, and can be found fairly cheap.  On Mithanial Marr you can get bear-hide belts for 4 plat, and thick leather aprons for 12 plat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another tip I have is to be careful about buying bronze armor.  It may look very cool, but it is also very very very heavy.  This can be a problem for clerics in particular.  Even tanks may find that they are so loaded down, that they can&#39;t carry enough loot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some bronze items are better values than others.  Good bronze items are gauntlets, mask, helm, shoulders, and boots. These items give you a fair bit of extra AC, and don&#39;t weigh that much.  If you get just these pieces as bronze, and use banded for the rest of your armor, you will only get 9AC less than if you had a full suit of bronze, and you will weigh 18.6lb less (assuming you&#39;re a small race, you&#39;ll save even more weight if you&#39;re medium or large).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Aesthetics play a large part in choosing a character&#39;s equipment, and one reason to go for a complete set of bronze is to look cool.  I personally think the above mix of banded and bronze looks very cool, and I encourage you to try it.  You can always buy a bronze breastplate, and bronze legs, if you decide you don&#39;t like how it looks.  You don&#39;t need to buy a bronze cloak, neck, wrist, or waist as these don&#39;t really affect appearance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another good armor tip to remember, if you&#39;re an elf, is to always buy small armor.  Small armor weighs less than medium armor, but fits elves fine.  Barbarians should similarly wear medium armor whenever possible (I think barbarians can wear any medium armor, I know they can wear medium banded).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another tip I have is to always ask for the weight of an item before you purchase it.  Some magic armor can fit any race, and is thus very heavy in comparison to small banded or even bronze (even though it has the same AC). Some magic armor is also very light, which is a great bonus.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Perhaps some other list member can give some armor tips for large races (Ogres, Trolls, Barbarians).  I know you guys end up with very heavy armor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hopefully this will help some of you the next time it&#39;s time to buy some armor.<br/>
