<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693194872">Hi there, and welcome to the group. I only joined myself recently, <br/>
and I discovered there is a huge list of topics previously covered. I <br/>
spent a whole (slow) afternoon at work reading my way through them.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t see much happening sometimes, but-oh,my-post a question, <br/>
and there&#39;ll be plenty of advice for you, so a lot of women read it.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you have your new spells now, and good luck with your chanter. <br/>
You&#39;ll never be short of a group with her, and grouping is where the <br/>
most fun is to be had, imho.<br/>
<br/>
Love, Liz <br/>
