<div id="ygrps-yiv-203663355">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
It seems there is a lot of interest in having the guild be on Brell<br/>
Serilis.  Not everyone agrees, but the majority is in favor, so lets go<br/>
ahead with it.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who wish an official city, I&#39;d like to suggest<br/>
Kelethin/Felwithe.<br/>
<br/>
In order to create the guild, I need at least nine people to join me in<br/>
the EQ chat tonight to go through the automated guild creation process.<br/>
I&#39;ll arbitrarily ask that people show up at 10:30 EST in the Brell<br/>
Serilis chat room.  I&#39;ll then create a &quot;Sisters of Erollisi&quot; chat room<br/>
which we will move to, and the automated guild creation process will<br/>
begin.  I will then add players within the game as you send me tells.<br/>
<br/>
I have a 6th level high-elf enchanter on Brell named Luna.<br/>
<br/>
