<b>Subject:</b> Re: balancing EQ with real life :) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-136700462">I understand where you are coming from. My fiance and I both play EQ. It&#39;s a <br/>
lot of fun to be together but there are times when I wish we would go out <br/>
instead of playing. We are both avid game players and play other MUD/ <br/>
Strategy games as well as EQ.<br/>
I have noticed that EQ becomes VERY involved. And at times we have both <br/>
become obsessed with the game. That&#39;s just when the servers go down on the <br/>
weekend for emergncy matience or my cable modem goes down. hehe it makes us <br/>
realize that the world is still out there and we go do something else. Just <br/>
be patient. He&#39;ll get bored of it soon.<br/>
