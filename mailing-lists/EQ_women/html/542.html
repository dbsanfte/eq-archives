<div id="ygrps-yiv-95215265">I was a master smith and a grandmaster jewler, here is some of the stuff<br/>
I&#39;ve learned.<br/>
<br/>
Tailoring is a great starter skill, it requires little investment to make<br/>
patchwork armor.  However, if you want to continue on to high end stuff<br/>
(reinforced leather, 10-slot bags) it requires considerable time and money<br/>
investment.  You can make good newbie-level money doing tailoring in<br/>
greater faydark.<br/>
<br/>
Smithing requires about a 200pp investment to master (less if you are<br/>
optimal).  Smithing I found to be very rewarding early on in my server&#39;s<br/>
life, there were lots of tanks who wanted armor.  For various reasons<br/>
though, it can get boring.  To make small or large armor you have to<br/>
travel a lot to get your molds and metals and such.  To make medium armor,<br/>
you can do it in freeport, where all the materials are fairly available.<br/>
Smithing is quite enjoyable I found though eventually it becomes tedious.<br/>
You can make good low level money smithing in freeport or greater fay.<br/>
This will probably work best if you are level 20 or under as you will be<br/>
able to hunt in the near vicinity to freeport where people who will want<br/>
your wares will hang out.<br/>
<br/>
Oh I almost forgot, smiths can make weapons now.  They couldn&#39;t when I<br/>
smithed.  I don&#39;t get the impression that forged weapons are a<br/>
very competitive business though.<br/>
<br/>
Baking and brewing are both more &#39;fun&#39; trades.  All the skilled bakers and<br/>
brewers I know are druids, which makes sense because getting your goods<br/>
requires a lot of travel.  These two skills require little investment to<br/>
start, but a lot of work and travel to master.  These are nice because you<br/>
can give people alcohol or food, I still remember with joy the day my<br/>
druid friend gave me chocolate! You won&#39;t make money doing this.<br/>
<br/>
Jewlery is one of the few trades you can make serious money in but it is<br/>
also fairly competitive.  In order to make money in jewelcraft you usually<br/>
need a sizible investment.  Maxing your jewelcraft to 200 will cost<br/>
several thousand plat.  On the other hand, 50pp will get you able to make<br/>
some jewelry.  If you are not an enchanter you will have to pay to get<br/>
your metal bars enchanted which is a pain.  If you have a close enchanter<br/>
friend you could do ok though =)<br/>
<br/>
Alchemy is shaman only and you have to be fairly high level to do it.<br/>
Shrink and SOW potions are pretty cool though, but they require a sizible<br/>
investment (thus the high level).<br/>
