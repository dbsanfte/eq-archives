<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880944805">Welcome to the list and there are some of us here that don&#39;t play much anymore<br/>
but can answer all your questions.  My characters were:<br/>
<br/>
Druid - 54<br/>
Bard - 36<br/>
Necromancer - 29<br/>
Cleric - 22<br/>
Wizard - 22<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m playing Dark Ages of Camelot now for a change of pace and FINALLY picked<br/>
my primary character - an Armswoman.  She&#39;s my first tank and it&#39;s really fun<br/>
to have hit points and actually care about armor and weapons.  I am one last<br/>
step away from my crossbow quest but still need 3 levels to acquire the skill.<br/>
 I play in Albion on Percival.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and Christina, I did get my Warden to 4 on Morgan Le Fay, but after my<br/>
frist RvR experience, gonna try to settle on one character until I can do some<br/>
damage.  Hibernia took two of our keeps and made an assault on Snowdonia<br/>
Station so there was a massive call to arms.  At 11 all I could do was<br/>
interrupt their lowest caster and I didn&#39;t succeed in doing that more than<br/>
once *sigh*  Our RvR leadership is PATHETIC!  But it was a lot of fun<br/>
nonetheless.<br/>
