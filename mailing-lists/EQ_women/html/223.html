<b>Subject:</b> Re: Race Wars Server <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-167787497">There is absolutely no way I will ever be playing on the race wars<br/>
server. If I wanted to play a game where people ran around killing each<br/>
other I would go back to Ultima Online. Which I wouldn&#39;t because I left<br/>
that damn game just for the pvp reason. (I&#39;m very upset with the whole<br/>
pvp thing as you may have noticed.) My sweetie says he and his friends<br/>
are going to go play on it and would I like to join. Isn&#39;t it funny<br/>
that all the people I&#39;ve heard of that want to go kill each other are<br/>
guys!? hmmm? If I wanted to play with a bunch of asinine 13 yr old boys<br/>
I would go back to UO. Ok, I&#39;m a little bitter. *laughs* Btw, have you<br/>
guys been to that page where EQ players can have their pics put up? I<br/>
went and had a look around and to my suprise half of the pics up there<br/>
were women! I&#39;m thinking maybe we aren&#39;t as rare as I had thought! :) I<br/>
just sent mine in today so maybe he will have it up in a couple days.<br/>
You guys have to go look at it, they&#39;re funny I promise. Ok, two of<br/>
them should make you laugh. One definitely will. *snickers* <br/>
I have a char already on Quellious and would be thrilled to get<br/>
together with ya&#39;ll. I hope the time is ok, I have a volunteer project<br/>
going on from July 26th to the 6th of August and won&#39;t be home until<br/>
after 6 those nights. If I can&#39;t make it, maybe we can plan for another<br/>
time again later? *Smiles* Happy Hunting!</div>
