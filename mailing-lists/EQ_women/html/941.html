<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234802100">UO is ultima online which i&#39;ve never played...  i do know for sure though <br/>
that it&#39;s not the same as everquest...  now on to business...  i didnt find <br/>
&quot;snooping&quot; disturbing...  I assumed you had found something durring your <br/>
search..  i have an eq friend...  his wife played as well...  she ended up <br/>
meeting men on the game and it led to affairs irl and eventually a <br/>
divorce...  he got the best revenge of course...  guessed her password and <br/>
stole her beloved main character lol...  i think she deserved it.  if you <br/>
find your &quot;snooping&quot; to be disturbing i&#39;m not going to argue with you.  <br/>
certainly after the revalation that she had done nothing wrong.  now about <br/>
game talk being &quot;insipid dribble&quot;...  what would you prefer people to talk <br/>
about while playing the game?  sex???  you didnt seem happy when she was <br/>
showing concern for your happiness to her &quot;guildies&quot;.  OH by the way, those <br/>
blips and flickering lights on the screen represent real living people.  we <br/>
are the people they represent...  WE are everquest.  dont expect a <br/>
sympathetic ear from me when you complain to me about the effect people like <br/>
me have had on your life.  if i feel badly about anything, i feel for your <br/>
financial situation, although it&#39;s not my fault (and dont blame everquest... <br/>
  your WIFE made the decision to quit her job (and a poor decision it was) <br/>
guns dont kill people, criminals with guns kill people)  i really pity you.  <br/>
you say she&#39;s getting better?  GOOD!!!!  Quit making your daughter cry by <br/>
obsessing over &quot;mommy&#39;s eq&quot;.  Go on with your life and try as hard as she <br/>
is!!!  If i were your wife i would have left you for a sane man a long time <br/>
ago...  of course if i were your wife i would probably be just as insane and <br/>
do things like quitting jobs to play video games and sleeping on the couch <br/>
until noon...  there&#39;s plenty more opinions where this came from if you care <br/>
to take offense instead of advice from what i&#39;ve said.  just dont expect to <br/>
change my mind by repeating yourself.  i&#39;ve heard how bad your life was.  <br/>
life tends to suck from time to time.  that&#39;s what makes these happy times <br/>
so darn good.  you say life is good now.  GO LIVE IT!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I pour out my life story of my marriage to an EQ fiend, who stopped<br/>
&gt;everything else in her life for a game...and you find my snooping to<br/>
&gt;be disturbing??  All depends on your point of view, I guess...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Never found any evidence of any online or RL affairs (as many EQ<br/>
&gt;widows and widowers have experienced); just line after line of<br/>
&gt;insipid dribble about ports, spells, gear, etc, occassionally<br/>
&gt;puncuated by a nasty reference to me (&quot;Hubby getting upset again<br/>
&gt;better log soon :( &quot;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Oh, and as for the Lexus...sorry, can&#39;t help you there.  In fact,<br/>
&gt;when ours is done, we&#39;ll likely have to replace it with a Toyota or<br/>
&gt;Nissan; since she quit her $30K job back in 2000 to play UO (then EQ)<br/>
&gt;fulltime, some cutbacks have become necessary.<br/>
