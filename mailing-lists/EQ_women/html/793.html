&lt;&lt; You are always bound somewhere, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
OK, thanks for the information, that clears that up<br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I know that there have been talks about bind<br/>
poitions or items with bind charges for melee<br/>
classes(similar to gate potions), but I&#39;m not sure if<br/>
Verrant has gone live with those or not. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That would be cool although probably beyond what I<br/>
could get right now anyway.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Remember most of us clerics are always willing to<br/>
help rez you if your bound far away from your corpse.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks. Is there a penalty for this of some kind,<br/>
losing items, exp. or something?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Check the /who for the zone to get the names of the<br/>
clerics in the zone before you start fighting if the<br/>
nearest city is rather far away that way you can send<br/>
them a tell when you die, most of the time they are<br/>
quiet willing to help you out. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, the example of what happened late last night<br/>
might be a good one. I had last bound in Kaladim (sp)<br/>
and needed to go to Steamfont in search of a Micro<br/>
Servo. I was wondering around doing OK but not finding<br/>
what I needed. There were a few fights but nothing I<br/>
couldn&#39;t handle when I came across some Minatour<br/>
Slavers. They were dark blue and there were a couple<br/>
of them so I didn&#39;t want to chance it alone. I started<br/>
back toward town to see if I could enlist someone to<br/>
come back with me and help free the Gnome slaves. On<br/>
the way I stopped and fought something and got about<br/>
half way wounded. I was standing there tossing a<br/>
couple minor heals on myself just in case I ran into<br/>
somehting else when I was attacked from behind by a<br/>
skeleton. I turned to fight but it was a white threat<br/>
and being half wounded already it finished me off.<br/>
I reappeared in Kelethin and started back to get my<br/>
body, but in the dark I think I missed my turn in<br/>
Lesser Feydark and I was ambushed by a Brownie and<br/>
killed again, so back to Kelethin.<br/>
Fortunately, a found a very kind lvl 54 Shadow night<br/>
that I knew who was online and met me and helped me<br/>
retrieve my bodies.<br/>
:o)<br/>
This isn&#39;t even the first time I&#39;ve died once or twice<br/>
simply trying to retrieve the body from when I died<br/>
the first time.<br/>
Just gets kind of frustrating at times.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one game feature I would happily have done<br/>
without.<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
After helping me get my body she literally sat me down<br/>
in the game and had a long time with me about EQ and<br/>
pointed out a few facts of life on Narreth etc. :o) It<br/>
was very sweet of her, and I picked up a few pointers<br/>
as well.<br/>
<br/>
