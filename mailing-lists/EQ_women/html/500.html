<div id="ygrps-yiv-1973876037">wow. <br/>
*is in thorough awe*<br/>
i feel like such a newbie. <br/>
i gather that a lot of you have been playing for quite a while. i only<br/>
started at new years. <br/>
<br/>
i guess essentially, what you do is the same as what i do for ark - a young,<br/>
hottempered, compassionate half elf sorcerous that is too powerful for her<br/>
own good. i use her for multiple online role plays and i eventually made a<br/>
bio for her. i just find it harder to role play &quot;standing up&quot;. as in - at<br/>
the moment, right there.<br/>
<br/>
kudos to all, i must say. *smiles* <br/>
