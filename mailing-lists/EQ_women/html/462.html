       I have been lurking on the list for a few months now, mainly<br/>
because of real life battles. I am 45 yo, an unemployed teacher, single<br/>
mother of two older kids, cohabiting with elderly parents, helping<br/>
operate a family business. One of my battles has been to find a new<br/>
teaching job, in a field where I am overqualified (i.e.: too much<br/>
education).<br/>
<br/>
      I still have not found a position but the current questions under<br/>
discussion were ones that I felt the need of reply.<br/>
<br/>
1. How does a person balance &quot;Real Life&quot; with &quot;EQ&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
    I started playing EQ in order to keep in communication with my post<br/>
teen & teen-age children. If I as a parent wanted to understand their<br/>
world focus, I needed to understand their interests.  My kids have been<br/>
playing RPG&#39;s for years, even to running a guild on Realm. This is the<br/>
first one that I have attempted to play. My highest character is a level<br/>
16 Enchanter and I have played since last spring....but I do not play<br/>
every day, nor do I always play the same character.<br/>
    The world is filled with as many dragons to conquer  .....we play<br/>
when it is down time from our world. My kids and I attend Ren Faires,<br/>
take college classes, and my son will be a Jr. Councilor of the local<br/>
Demolay chapter next month. I am active as a mother advisor to a slew of<br/>
my son&#39;s friends, whose parents work, are too busy to listen, are<br/>
shutting out the cries for advise, etc. I help them, put their<br/>
priorities in perspective, guage what they want from their future and<br/>
listen to their trials at becoming young men.... (dating, college plans,<br/>
relationships with parents).<br/>
    My playing the game has the effect of moderating the amount that my<br/>
kids play... since my characters though not daring are steady in their<br/>
gaining. This has encouraged my son to look toward the next level in<br/>
game playing.....progamming. A maxim I was told by an person in the<br/>
industry...When you stop playing the games and start developing them, is<br/>
a measure of technology maturity. While I and my kids continue to<br/>
play......for fun, we also realize that there is a lot more excitement<br/>
in the real world.<br/>
<br/>
2. Why do boys play girls.....?<br/>
<br/>
    Many of my son&#39;s friends have played girls on EQ, I asked them<br/>
why.... girls are given stuff, while no one cares to help guys. Many<br/>
times the ability to advance can depend on how well a character is<br/>
prepared in armor. I myself have had gifting toward female characters<br/>
that I have, though I try to repay when I can by defending allies.<br/>
<br/>
3. Flirting.?<br/>
Absolutely none of my characters flirt. Gaming online is like dating<br/>
online......you really cannot move beyond friendship. You cannot love<br/>
online, nor even know the reality of a person within a fantasy<br/>
environment. As far as lying on line, why?  I have made many<br/>
acquaintances with young men, my son&#39;s age. They do not mind playing the<br/>
game with me. They realize that I am a thoughtful player, trust worthy<br/>
ally and benefit to their experience in the game.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    I enjoy playing my EQ characters, but I strive not to lose myself<br/>
within the online medium. It is in reality &quot;Just a game,&quot; while there is<br/>
a reality that has just as many evils to fight. Poverty, injustice,<br/>
prejudice, enviromental decay, ignorance, abuse of others are &quot;real&quot;<br/>
monsters which must be addressed, we cannot live in a virtual world<br/>
forever.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    If you play on E&#39;ci look for Yadienu the High Elf  Enchanter (16) or<br/>
Duenya the Cleric Gnome (12).  I may not ever achieve a level 50<br/>
character on EQ, but my real goal is to achieve a high standing in real<br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
    Just something that you might think about.....Ladies of EQ.....</div>
