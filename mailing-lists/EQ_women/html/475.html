<br/>
Personally I think they should of pushed it back a month so they <br/>
can get everything ready. I could of lived with that.  But<br/>

&gt; LOL, Rose.  I even went to Comp USA today, since it was to hit retail<br/>
&gt; shelves.  HAHAHAHA!!!  Nope, they haven&#39;t gotten THEIR order in either<br/>
&gt; ;-(.  The good news is I FINALLY got all the way through to getting to<br/>
&gt; hold at the 800 number.  This after 3 days of calling, once getting<br/>
&gt; through to be told &quot;everyone will get their order&quot; and then hung up<br/>
&gt; on.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, and just called.  They have no record of my order.  However, I<br/>
&gt; cannot order again because I&#39;ve already ordered and no, the shipping<br/>
&gt; company people can&#39;t do anything, I have to call Sony.  But, of<br/>
&gt; course, Sony can&#39;t do anything I have to call the shipping company.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry, this IS a rant.  I have had a lot of respect for Verant in the<br/>
&gt; past, but the way they have handled Kunark is totally and completely<br/>
&gt; unacceptable.  A valuable lesson in how NOT to handle customer<br/>
&gt; support.<br/>
