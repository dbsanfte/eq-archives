<div id="ygrps-yiv-2119669967">Oh, thank goodness your holiday won&#39;t be ruined by the presence of <br/>
your family.  God forbid you&#39;d have to be sucked away from Evercrack <br/>
to attend a parade, cookout, or firework display.<br/>
<br/>
As a guild leader, my stay-at-home wife played EQ 80+ hours/week <br/>
until I couldn&#39;t take it anymore; I&#39;d come home from working 12-14 <br/>
hours and had to do all the damn housework because she was &#39;busy&#39; on <br/>
some raid or porting a guildee, or some such crap.  Our 6-yr old girl <br/>
still cries when we talk about mommy&#39;s EQ.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to vent, and I realize this isn&#39;t the place for it, but pls <br/>
heed my advise and keep an eye on your &#39;past time&#39;; when you start to <br/>
feel happier because your family&#39;s not around.....?<br/>
