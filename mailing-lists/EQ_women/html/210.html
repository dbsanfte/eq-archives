<div id="ygrps-yiv-116953611">I sorry.  I was doing it so people knew what I was referring to without having<br/>
to go back and re-read an old letter (if they hadn&#39;t deleted it).  I learned<br/>
that on a previous digest and will throw the philosophy away for this one.<br/>
Quote left in on purpose this time.<br/>

&gt; Hey folks -- trim your quotes!!!  Suzanne and Dawn have been posting<br/>
&gt; two-line messages followed by the entire contents of a digest.  This makes<br/>
&gt; it almost impossible to read any messages following them in the digest,<br/>
&gt; since they are lost in the spam.  It also makes the download time<br/>
&gt; excessive.  This is at the least an inconvenience, and some people pay for<br/>
&gt; their download time, so it&#39;s an extra expense.  Try to follow basic<br/>
&gt; netiquette and don&#39;t quote anything that you aren&#39;t specifically intending<br/>
&gt; to have people re-read.<br/>
