<b>Subject:</b> Hi! I would like to introduce myself <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-850636085">Hi! I just wanted to introduce myself.<br/>
<br/>
I play Tikha D&#39;Ombrenoire on Mithaniel Marr.  She is a 21st level Erudite <br/>
Cleric.  I also have a secondary character called Gabriella on the same <br/>
server.  She is a level 3 wood elf bard.  I just started her recently, but <br/>
spend most of my time playing my main char Tikha.<br/>
<br/>
In RL I am 30 years old and married. I have a 4 year old daughter.  My <br/>
husband and I both play EQ and love it! We both have a computer and we have <br/>
two ASDN connections to the internet in our home, so most of the time we <br/>
play together.  We have made many friends in EQ and are still making new <br/>
ones everyday.  It is funny cause lots of guys like flirting with Tikha, but <br/>
if/when they find out that Imaaj (my husband&#39;s character) is being played by <br/>
my RL husband they don&#39;t seem to always know how to react.  Tikha has a love <br/>
in EQ though.  His name is Oadn.  Whenever Imaaj seems to show any signs of <br/>
jealousy, Oadn just tells Imaaj that they will have to duel it out.  They <br/>
get lots of kicks and laughs out of the situation.  My husband is ok with <br/>
the whole idea of my roleplaying a relationship on EQ.  He is not the type <br/>
to be lovey with his character and knows that I enjoy the companionship in <br/>
game that Oadn brings.  Imaaj thinks of Oadn as one of his best hunting <br/>
partners.  Oadn and Imaaj often hunt together even when Tikha isn&#39;t online.  <br/>
Besides, it seems that Imaaj is waiting for Gabriella to grow up a bit so <br/>
that he can start courting her ;-) He really loves female wood elves!!!<br/>
<br/>
I am looking forward to creating a char on Brell and meeting with the rest <br/>
of you.  Is there a meeting time each week, or is there another planned <br/>
meeting soon?  How do I go about joining the guild once I have created a <br/>
character on Brell?</div>
