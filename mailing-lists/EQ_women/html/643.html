<div><br>p.s.&nbsp; At what point do your non-eq women friends start rebelling 
now that conversations invariably turn to the interesting and new way you found 
to die last night?<br><br></div>
<div>---I tried to explain EverQuest to my non-EQ women friends.&nbsp; 
Once.&nbsp; The glazing of the eyes wasn&#39;t pretty.&nbsp; On the other hand, the 
guys and I eagerly checked our mail every day for our beta discs and hoped and 
prayed we&#39;d pick a good server (there weren&#39;t very many during test).&nbsp; 
*grin*&nbsp; I discovered that my whole &quot;gaming thing&quot; was indulged by my women 
friends.&nbsp; It was kinda funny actually.&nbsp; Of course, I have one good 
friend who is also a gamer, but while I&#39;m an explorer, she&#39;s a hard core kill 
&#39;em all type, so sometimes our gaming styles clash and the things we found to 
discuss the next day were sometimes alien to each other =P.&nbsp; I miss playing 
with her though (now that I&#39;ve moved out of computer games and back into D&amp;D 
with the new 3rd Edition rules). =(&nbsp; </div>

<div>The beginning of EQ&nbsp;was so great... lots of humor, lots of orc trains 
to Kelethin&nbsp;ramps... *sighs reminiscently*&nbsp; I met my partner (in game 
and now out of game) when he auctioned to sell patchwork boots and I just HAD to 
have a pair... I had been saving my coppers for them and now voila!&nbsp; There 
he was! *chuckle*&nbsp; I had to send him a tell saying I got lost on my way 
back from Crushbone because I strayed off the path to avoid a centurion. 
=P&nbsp; Well, he rescued me and the rest is history.&nbsp; Does anyone even buy 
patchwork anymore? =(&nbsp; Shortly before we left, I had newbies wanting to buy 
my equipment (and I was a double digit lastnamed midget&nbsp;at the 
time!!)--like my watchman boots... c&#39;mon!</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now we have brought our rangers to the world of pen and paper games, and 
life is good.&nbsp; We play once a week and I can still keep up with my studies 
(college at my age is NOT easy) and work half-time too.&nbsp; I miss EQ some 
days, but I have to admit I don&#39;t miss having my life and leisure time 
back.</div>
