<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-864458816">This is an excellent topic for discussion and I think the line needs to<br/>
be drawn between flirting, which is usually done &quot;across a distant<br/>
room&quot;  so to speak, and building in-game relationships which is a more<br/>
serious form of roleplay.<br/>
<br/>
If I am in a group and flirting with a Bard (my favorite) by saying how<br/>
romantic his voice is, then I see no reason to say &quot;and, by they way I<br/>
am  married with 2 children &quot;.  However, should we continue to group and<br/>
perhaps it becomes clear that our in-game roleplay is taking a decidedly<br/>
romantic turn, then I abosultely believe that without question it is my<br/>
responsibility to tell him at least that I am married with 2 children<br/>
and there is no chance that any in-game relationship will transfer into<br/>
real life.<br/>
<br/>
And I think there is an even stronger moral issue when it comes to any<br/>
kind of sexual innuendo in the roleplay and that is that the players be<br/>
&quot;of an age&quot;.  If two 16 YOs want to go at it who am I to object.  But if<br/>
a 25 YO wants to do that kind of roleplay with a 16 YO I will object and<br/>
object STRONGLY!  That sort of thing is bordering on pederasty and is<br/>
intolerable.  Esp. since there are children as young as 10 playing this<br/>
game unsupervised.  [resists the temptation to pull out her parents<br/>
should know what their children are doing on-line soapbox].<br/>
<br/>
So, I think the same goes for men.  Men (and women, though fewer women<br/>
choose to play men) have a rare opportunity to see how the world treats<br/>
the opposite sex by taking on a female character.  I know some men who<br/>
do it because women get lots of free buffs and twinks.  But they begin<br/>
to understand the price the women are paying through expectations etc.<br/>
pretty quickly.  There is no such thing as a free buff (grins).<br/>
<br/>
When to disclose is a question for each individual.  But we each have<br/>
responsibility for our own emotional attachment and if one goes off<br/>
attaching to someone without knowing anything about the player behind<br/>
the character, that is also that person&#39;s responsibility.  Should a man<br/>
lie and say &quot;oh, no I really AM a woman&quot; that is reprehensible.  But if<br/>
you don&#39;t ask then you can&#39;t be pissed off when you find out later.<br/>

&gt; Is a woman using emotional deceit if she flirts with a 20 year old<br/>
&gt; boy,<br/>
&gt; when she is 50, and doesn&#39;t tell him her age, allowing him to assume<br/>
&gt; she<br/>
&gt; is around his age?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; What exactly must we disclose when we flirt with someone online before<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; we&#39;re being emotionally deceitful? Why do people get so worked up over<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; disclosing gender, in comparison with other qualities that define us?<br/>

&gt; &gt; rather when those phony women begin using emotional deceit with the<br/>

&gt; &gt; that they are with, building emotional friendships and relationships<br/>
&gt; (or<br/>
&gt; &gt; sexually suggestive relationships) without the honesty of who they<br/>

&gt; &gt; Great site btw...refreshing to find. Thanks!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I found this article pretty neat.  It was based on a comprehensive<br/>
&gt; survey<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of men who play female characters, to see why they do it.<br/>
