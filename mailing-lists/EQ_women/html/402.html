<div id="ygrps-yiv-87914521">I have been playing from the date of release last year, I have 5 chars that<br/>
I like to play; but in the beginning I could not decide on a race/class - so<br/>
I started and deleted about 6 chars (geeze what a waste of time!)  Anyway I<br/>
have two main chars one is a lvl 35 DE Necro named Karrma Sutra and one is a<br/>
DE Cleric named Kilanna.  My question is how in the heck to you guys get to<br/>
lvl 50 so fast?  I don&#39;t see 50 in my future for months and months!  But of<br/>
course I play an average of 2 hours a day, except on weekends - that may<br/>
have something to do with it!  Any suggestions?  Also I have a ranger that<br/>
was recently started - I totally love playing her! But she is still a baby.</div>
