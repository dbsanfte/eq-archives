<br/>
i feel for you - i&#39;m like that - get attached and such. <br/>
<br/>
heck, i didn&#39;t even rp with a guy, we just fought together, he helped me<br/>
out, i helped his friends out, and we chatted, when his rl gf found out and<br/>
*kaboom!* he disappeard long enough for me to wonder if she a) destroyed his<br/>
copy of eq, or b) killed him. hehe.<br/>
<br/>
anyways - don&#39;t give up eq. you obviously are one of those people who make<br/>
the game worth it for people like me. i hate the powergaming, the camping,<br/>
etc. you have a network of friends and &quot;family.&quot; like irl, mourn your loss,<br/>
but continue on. you have people for support. *smiles*<br/>
<br/>
here - i bestow on you the highest honour i can give (you have to see my<br/>
char&#39;s sig to fully understand but...)<br/>
<br/>
*SMOOGLES*<br/>

&gt;Subject: If it&#39;s just a game, why does it hurt so much?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;First of all I&#39;m irate at Verant.  Apparently they not only keep text logs<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of all text in the game, they allow these logs outside the company (or, at<br/>
least ONE employee has distributed them).  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;I have been playing an in-game love story for about the last 4-5 months.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m married and he has a serious, though out of town, girlfriend.  It is<br/>
purely fantasy RP.  But it&#39;s fun.  Well, apparently his RL GF has a friend<br/>
at Verant who gave her access to all the text files that he has generated  -<br/>
i.e., she has read large quantities of his private conversations.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Bottom line is that she sees me as a threat and so the in-game<br/>
 </span></blockquote>romance/relationship is off.  I can&#39;t fault him for caring more for his real<br/>
life girlfriend.  But it leaves me with this huge empty hole inside.  It is<br/>
the RP aspect of EQ that I enjoy the most.  Cute little wood elf druid in<br/>
love with adorable half elf ranger.  We ran our guild together.  We had a<br/>
full blown fantasy and it&#39;s gone and I don&#39;t want it to be.  I have no<br/>
choice.   But Norrath is filled with memories that now feel sort of sour.<br/>
After all, we were planning our in-game wedding!  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;This is not the first RP relationship I&#39;ve had.  It&#39;s the third with the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>first ending on a good, though sad, note when he left because he had pulled<br/>
his life together.  The second one I ended  because I didn&#39;t like the way I<br/>
was treated - my player feelings being subjugated to the RP for the sake of<br/>
the RP.  And now this.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;What&#39;s sad is that if anything I help her since I know this man&#39;s<br/>
 </span></blockquote>idiosyncracies and come down on him for some of them.  In fact, I had told<br/>
him something in our relationship which he took into theirs and it made him<br/>
more attentive to her needs and less self-absorbed in his own thoughts.  He<br/>
told me about it.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, I&#39;m not going to change the current situation.  He has to do what<br/>
 </span></blockquote>he feels necessary and right, wrong, or indifferent she feels threatened by<br/>
his having a relationship in-game.  I&#39;ll still be his friend, but playing<br/>
together isn&#39;t going to work out the same.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;My husband had the best response.  &quot;You need a new game.  Too bad there<br/>
 </span></blockquote>aren&#39;t any out there&quot;.  I tried Diablo 2 and blech.  To me EQ is all about<br/>
the people and it is the people that I enjoy.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;So I am sitting here wondering if I have what it takes to try again.  I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>know at least four players who were more than thrilled to lend me a shoulder<br/>
to cry on.  I am well loved in the game and that&#39;s nice.  I&#39;m sure I could<br/>
build a new romance.  I&#39;m just wondering if it&#39;s worth it emotionally.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;I get attached to my characters (when I played with my first partner I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>would cry when he decided he didn&#39;t want to play a character anymore and<br/>
even though it was the same partner, the loss of that character hurt ).  I<br/>
cry at sad movies.  I cry at the end of good books.  That kind of attachment<br/>
to characters is part of who I am and I wouldn&#39;t want to change it.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;But my heart has gone out of the game with this.  I&#39;m scheduled for a raid<br/>
 </span></blockquote>tonight and they are voting on my membership in a new guild this week and I<br/>
don&#39;t want to shoot myself in the foot by just stopping right now.  He&#39;s<br/>
sorting out where he feels the boundaries are since he wants our friendship<br/>
(we both do) but isn&#39;t sure what violates his promise to his GF and what<br/>
doesn&#39;t.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, I&#39;m just trying to sort through what is healthy and not healthy for<br/>
 </span></blockquote>me wrt to EQ now.  I&#39;m happily married for 15 years and have 2 kids and<br/>
that&#39;s what MATTERS.  But I&#39;ve always had an active fantasy life and having<br/>
people to populate it with thier own independent input has just been a<br/>
delight.  But Norrath is transient and people come and people go.  And each<br/>
loss hurts.  Some more than others.  Each is the loss of a friend (Brell<br/>
isn&#39;t the same without Luna, for example).<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, insights and perspective are welcome.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
