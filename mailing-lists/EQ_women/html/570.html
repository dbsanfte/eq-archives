<div id="ygrps-yiv-1162680098">Hiya fellow eq girlies :) I do hope I haven&#39;t posted this twice, but <br/>
my internet connection appears to be playing up..<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Viv, and play various chars on Tunare and Morell-Thule.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a coupla things I&#39;ve always thought of asking other eq <br/>
girls.. firstly, I know a lot of guys play female chars, and I&#39;ve <br/>
tried a few times making male chars but just felt silly playing them <br/>
and ended up deleting them within the first level or so. Is it just <br/>
me? Have I got too much wussiness factor in me? Or am I just a <br/>
mediocre role-player? Or both?!?! ;)<br/>
<br/>
Also.. has anyone else had their heart broken in eq? Silly question I <br/>
know, but i guess I just want reassurance that I&#39;m not alone here ;P <br/>
In fact, I met a guy the other day whose heart was broken by a girl <br/>
in eq, so it&#39;s not just a girlie thing i guess..<br/>
<br/>
Btw, i&#39;m in Australia in rl, and my Tunare chars are Athens, Rynni <br/>
and Lrynn (tho Lrynn may be taking a break..) and on Morell-Thule are <br/>
Jhasper, Leilanni and Volare.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers :)</div>
