<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-545634444">Well I gave up playing PC EQ along time ago. I miss somethings about <br/>
that version, but have also fallen in love with some of the features <br/>
that the PS2 version offers. Slight differences, and some major ones, <br/>
but oh well. :)<br/>
<br/>
I am actually just waiting for the new game by Varient, Star Wars <br/>
Galaxies. Supposedly it will fix everything crappy about EQ, and be <br/>
one of the best gam,es for online. I cant wait to bash heads with my <br/>
female wookie. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Maybe when i get my new PC I will come back and play the PC version <br/>
of EQ again. I loved my necromancer, and my druid there. I was <br/>
untouchable! HEHE</div>
