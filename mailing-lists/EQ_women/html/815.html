<div id="ygrps-yiv-525785645"><p>when you go to make your clothes you place all of the ingredients in the box (minus the pattern) and hit combine. This should result in some specially named piece of cloth you place&nbsp;the fabric&nbsp;and the pattern inside a loom/sewing kit and combine to get the armor. The only ingredients that you hand back to the guy giving out the quests are the ones for the weapon which is normally given after you ask for the tunic/breastplate. </p>
<p>As for getting ripped off on the Forest Drakling Scale, I know how that goes. Those silly things out not to be selling for more than 2-3pp, however, the pristine are so rare and in such demand still that people are selling them for as high as 50pp. Personally I wouldn&#39;t pay more than 5pp for a regular or ruined FDS, or over 10pp for the Pristine FDS. </p>
