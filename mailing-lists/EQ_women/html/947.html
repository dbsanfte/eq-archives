<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646820065">I, personally, have enjoyed the revamping of the<br/>
zones.  Once you reach the higher end of the game, you<br/>
find it sort of loses it&#39;s challenge.  For those that<br/>
feel this way, it has been a blessing and has<br/>
heightened their game play.  <br/>
<br/>
Though some of the zones are harder and require a<br/>
larger force, or a higher level to enter, there are<br/>
many higher level folks that will be greatful for<br/>
that.  There are many lower level zones, but once you<br/>
near the top, you found yourself stuck in the planes<br/>
or having to have a raid force for about everything. <br/>
I never ran into a lack of places to go when lower<br/>
level.<br/>

&gt; into this game <br/>
&gt; such as revamping some perfectly fine zones and make<br/>
&gt; them harder than <br/>
&gt; orginaly, and swiping c3 and even c2 from our<br/>
&gt; collective grasp, my <br/>
&gt; famley members who play this game will be writing<br/>
&gt; sony and they will <br/>
&gt; shortly and most likely <br/>
&gt; be quiting this game, which in effect may lead to my<br/>
&gt; defection as <br/>
&gt; well due to the incressing dificulty of this so call<br/>
&gt; &quot;class balancing&quot;<br/>
&gt; now mind you this is total horse shit on sonys part,<br/>
&gt; and they are <br/>
&gt; taking all the fun and adventur out of this game by<br/>
&gt; making every <br/>
&gt; thing totaly impossible and un reachable, now i know<br/>
&gt; not every one <br/>
&gt; feels like this but not every one is a druid who<br/>
&gt; with out c3 can <br/>
&gt; cast no more that 3 spells with out haveing to sit<br/>
&gt; for 20 minets and <br/>
&gt; meddititing for example<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What im asking my fellow everquest players and there<br/>
&gt; friends is for <br/>
&gt; there suport in the effort we are trying to get sony<br/>
&gt; to see, that <br/>
&gt; they are systematicly desimating a game that once<br/>
&gt; was fun and <br/>
&gt; enjoyable. Once this letter is writin i will have it<br/>
&gt; in <br/>
&gt; the forums were i can with sonys email which we have<br/>
&gt; directed these <br/>
&gt; coments.We would appriciate the suport of our fellow<br/>
&gt; gamers and <br/>
&gt; friends if they too would also after that time email<br/>
&gt; sony and the <br/>
&gt; like with their concers and grips- please once this<br/>
&gt; is posted <br/>
&gt; consider our request as some one has to fight back<br/>
&gt; again the few who <br/>
&gt; decide they need to nerf our spells, our strengh and<br/>
&gt; our fun in this <br/>
&gt; game <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am asking for the suport of fellow games in<br/>
&gt; showing there <br/>
&gt; displesure for the changes that are taking place<br/>
&gt; with this game and <br/>
&gt; im hoping to fight back against the evil that is the<br/>
&gt; everquest <br/>
&gt; managemnt. <br/>
&gt; thank you for taking your time to read this<br/>
