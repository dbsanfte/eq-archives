<div id="ygrps-yiv-878381587">I used to love doing traeskills til i reached about 190 lol.. I have <br/>
191 in baking, 135 in tailoring, 100 in smithing, 80 in brewing and <br/>
62 in jewellery. I have found now though with wu&#39;s needing so many <br/>
ingrediesnt for a single combine that it has turned me off of <br/>
tailoring, same with smithing. Baking is still fun but when u have <br/>
to make 35 patty melts to lvl up it becomes kind of annoying. And my <br/>
bank *faints* there was never any room in it..lol filled with eggs <br/>
and misty picnic ingredients, vials of viscous mana..nope i need a <br/>
break but for all those out there..i say try and have fun with it. <br/>
my friends enjoy my skills =). ps i have 110 AA&#39;s in parenting <br/>

&gt; I enjoy doing trade skills very rarely.  I will however get in <br/>
these moods where I will want to do them.  I&#39;ve been working on my <br/>
cleric&#39;s faction to start her shawls.  She was ally with giants for <br/>
a long time while my guild was hunting in Ntov (kael armor).  Two <br/>
ring wars later and a bunch of dead giants I think I am ready to <br/>
begin serious trade skilling for that shawl.  :)   <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Baking has always been my favourite of all the trades.  Its fairly <br/>
easy, a lot of the components for the great stat food come from some <br/>
wonderful exp spots, and the food you can make is very beneficial!  <br/>
I haven&#39;t tried smithing but www.eqtraders.com may be a spot to look <br/>
if you haven&#39;t heard of that website!<br/>

&gt; Salutations!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We used to talk about adopting a lot but we just kept<br/>
&gt; having more kids instead, so we adopted them.<br/>
&gt; :o)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have no time management skills. Nothing ever gets<br/>
&gt; done on time or properly. I figure as long as it<br/>
&gt; eventually happens it successful.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Congratulations on 62. As someone who recently hit 62<br/>
&gt; myself we seem to be taking the same road. Last night<br/>
&gt; I took my 21% into 62 and my 65 ranger hubby and went<br/>
&gt; to HoH. Why HoH instead of BoT. Well simple. He can<br/>
&gt; solo there bow kiting the mobs till they die. It&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; bit slow but I keep him healed and toss in a few 1100<br/>
&gt; point nukes to speed the process and its not bad at<br/>
&gt; all. The two of us were killing mobs with between 30K<br/>
&gt; and 75K hp. So my recipie now is BoT if I can get a<br/>
&gt; good group, HoH if I&#39;m duoing, and trade skills etc.<br/>
&gt; when I&#39;m alone. Working out pretty good.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Finished my fourth coldain shawl yesterday, but I need<br/>
&gt; to get my tailoring up some more before I try that 5th<br/>
&gt; one. Only 101, and although I know it trivs at 115 I<br/>
&gt; think I&#39;m going to triv Wu&#39;s armor at 158 before I<br/>
&gt; make the attempt. After all it will need to be higher<br/>
&gt; later anyway, so might as well get it on up now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do we have any others who like to do that trade stuff<br/>
&gt; on the list. I do it a lot when it&#39;s slow. Just work<br/>
&gt; on this or that to pass the time. I like the easy<br/>
&gt; recipies though even if they cost me more. After all<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s not hard to make a few thousand plat if I really<br/>
&gt; need to. And along that line, does anyone know a<br/>
&gt; simple smithing recipie to use from 88. I just made<br/>
&gt; shields till 88. It was easy and all the parts could<br/>
&gt; be gotten in one convient spot. Now I&#39;m looking for<br/>
&gt; something simple. But baking is the easiest to raise<br/>
&gt; if you&#39;re bored and don&#39;t mind sitting around for a<br/>
&gt; while. Fish cakes to 135 (a hearty meal), I caught the<br/>
&gt; fish and bought the bat wings. Storm salmon to 202<br/>
&gt; (stat food) but I&#39;m forgetting what I have to put with<br/>
&gt; it. That&#39;s a lot of fish I&#39;ll tell you though. Again<br/>
&gt; you just have to have the patience for the fishing in<br/>
&gt; PoS. Anyway just my cooking tip of the day.<br/>
