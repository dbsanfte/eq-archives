<div id="ygrps-yiv-1190104136">Maria, I love it.  Zuzu, my troll warrior, is the only one of all my girls<br/>
who flirts.  She gets tons of attention from it and if it gets out of line<br/>
she just tells them: &quot;Use leve Zuzu lone or she barsh use on de hed und use<br/>
no like dat fur sure.  Har de har. &quot;    They even get a kick out of that.<br/>
hehe   I find it much easier to flirt with Zuzu because she has a built in<br/>
ability to fuss at males with her role and personality.  It makes it easier<br/>
to stop it before it gets too intense.  She once had a troll male say: &quot;Zuzu<br/>
cute, we go make baby now.&quot;   Zuzu just smiled, drooled and told him in her<br/>
worst troll accent: &quot; Zuzu too purdy ta be makin babies wif ugly troll lak<br/>
use be.  Zuzu waits fer purdy bard mans. &quot;  He laughed and gave her a<br/>
shield. hehe.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your troll.  We need more female trolls. &lt;smiles&gt;<br/>

&gt; Hello all sisters...<br/>
&gt; Well, after playing a goodie-two-shoes cleric since I first got into the<br/>
&gt; game, I decided recently to check out how the other side lives and started<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; female troll shadow knight. The swamp was a new experience alright, and so<br/>
&gt; was the famed troll regeneration (watch those HPs zoooom up!). But the<br/>
&gt; funniest thing was when I flirted with an ogre warrior in Grobb (some big<br/>
&gt; bad &#39;un with a last name). After all the recent discussion here on<br/>
flirting<br/>
&gt; and females getting items, I decided to try out my trollie charms on this<br/>
&gt; ogre. All I did was to comment (in my well spoken troll dialect) on what a<br/>
&gt; fine basher he seemed to be and emote &quot;:bats her eyelashes at [player]&quot;<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; all of a sudden I received 1 platinum! For a lvl 2 trollie SK, this was<br/>
&gt; indeed a fine gift... I guess trollie women have something to teach my<br/>
&gt; dwarven cleric when it comes to turning mens heads because my cleric never<br/>
&gt; received such a fine gift... :)<br/>
&gt; After this encounter, my trollie character is convinced she is indeed<br/>
&gt; attractive, but I doubt she will carry her flirting further than the<br/>
&gt; eyelashes at the moment. Still it&#39;s proof that it&#39;s not just the wood<br/>
elves<br/>
&gt; that can make a killing by flirting... :) /em smiles fiercely<br/>
