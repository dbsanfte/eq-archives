<div id="ygrps-yiv-44449413">I admit, I&#39;ve had a great time with Valdaya.  Her description has two words in<br/>
it:  &quot;I bite.&quot; hehe<br/>
She&#39;s quite a change in RP for me from my wood elf ranger on Povar, and I admit<br/>
I enjoy letting my &quot;darker&quot; side out once in a while......=)<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m glad to hear from a real female on Rallos Zek! I&#39;m glad you haven&#39;t had<br/>
&gt; too many problems. My  friend has dabbled with a dark elf necromancer, and<br/>
&gt; he says the dark elves are zealous about not pvping their own kind.<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, the Wood elves do not have that sort of pack.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t been annoyed enough to quit yet. But I was wondering. Thanks for<br/>
&gt; the information.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I play a dark elf female cleric on Rallos Zek, and I haven&#39;t actually run<br/>
&gt; into<br/>
&gt; &gt;those problems there as much as I have on Povar.  Maybe it&#39;s the whole<br/>
&gt; cleric<br/>
&gt; &gt;thing, I dunno.  On the other hand, I DID meet one of the best roleplayers<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt;ever seen on that server, and after he rescued me from a pretty hairy<br/>
&gt; &gt;situation, he gave me patchwork leggings....unsolicited! He had just<br/>
&gt; upgraded<br/>
&gt; &gt;and appreciated my roleplaying and effusive gratitude and thought I was<br/>
&gt; worthy.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&lt;shrugs&gt;  Nothing like that had ever happened to me on Povar.  The PvP<br/>
&gt; server<br/>
&gt; &gt;wasn&#39;t what I expected, I must say, and neither was playing a Dark elf<br/>
&gt; &gt;character.  It&#39;s actually been a good experience!<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; My RL friend plays on Rallos Zek. He doesn&#39;t SAY he wants me to play<br/>
&gt; there,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; but he keeps asking about the character I made on that server.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyway Saturday I spent level 2 being chased by a &quot;female&quot; character<br/>
&gt; named<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Typehere in the newbie area outside Kelethin. It was annoying, though<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; there&#39;s no reason to whine and complain if you are playing on Rallos Zek.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; But I just no for certain that Typehere was NOT a real female.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; So I&#39;m asking if there ARE any real females on Rallos Zek. I told my<br/>
&gt; friend<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; no, he said he thought there were.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyone here play there? How do you put up with the annoyances? I&#39;m as<br/>
&gt; tough<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; as anyone, but the game is challenging enough as it is, without worrying<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; about &quot;Typeheres.&quot;<br/>
