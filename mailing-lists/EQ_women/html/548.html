&gt;decide which.  I am leaning toward tailoring or baking.  If anyone has<br/>
&gt;any tips or advice, please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i personally do baking and tailoring. though i find tailoring now set aside<br/>
due to the priceiness (sp?) of the other components.<br/>
<br/>
if you can forage - i highly suggest brewing and baking. two totally fun<br/>
skills. i mean - the responses of your group members when you start chowing<br/>
down on smoked wood elf, or crunchy troll toes...mmmmmm-hmmmmmmmm. hehe. as<br/>
for brewing - swamp water at it&#39;s finest ;)<br/>
<br/>
have fun with it - role play, etc. *G* if money is a problem, definitely<br/>
stick to the stuff where you can easily find/hunt the components and only<br/>
have to buy occasional other ones. *smiles* though with smithing you can<br/>
make some money. hehe.</div>
