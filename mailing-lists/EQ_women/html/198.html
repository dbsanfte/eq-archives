<div id="ygrps-yiv-122891006">Hi there!  Allow me to introduce myself, i am Jen.  I have a couple EQ characters, but I primarily play Aquaria, a Wood Elf Warrior, Level 8 on the Tunare Server.  I have only been playing EQ for almost 3 months now.  It is the first role playing game I have played and I am totally hooked!  I can&#39;t wait to hear other women&#39;s tales and experiences of the game!</div>
