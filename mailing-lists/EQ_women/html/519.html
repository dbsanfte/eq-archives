<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836113821">Guilds are pretty cool.  The main advantage they offer is a chat interface<br/>
where you can talk to everyone in your guild.  Using this interface you<br/>
can then find people to hunt with.  Hopefully, you come to hunt with these<br/>
people semi regularly, which helps create a more enjoyable play<br/>
experience.  Looking for people to hunt with all the time can be<br/>
difficult.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good to join a guild where the people in the guild are around your<br/>
level.  It&#39;s good to join a guild where the people in the guild play about<br/>
the same frequency as you (so you don&#39;t pull too far ahead, or get left<br/>
too far behind).<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s ok to leave your guild or change guilds.  Over time you may<br/>
find your guild doesn&#39;t serve your needs any more, and at that point it&#39;s<br/>
a good time to consider another guild.<br/>
<br/>
Guild politics can be a pain.  Guilds often have rules or regulations, and<br/>
if they don&#39;t sit well with you, the guild won&#39;t work for you.<br/>
<br/>
Small guilds can be annoying because, unless they are close personal<br/>
friends, you&#39;ll probably get frustrated that usually no one from your<br/>
guild is on.  Larger more established guilds tend to provide a more stable<br/>
constant environment, but can be more difficult to get into.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

&gt; Hello again,<br/>
&gt; I hope I am not being a pest, but I would like some info on Guilds.<br/>
&gt; What exactly do they do?  How do you find out which one is right for<br/>
&gt; you?  Should a newbie consider joining one, or wait until higher level.<br/>
&gt; BTW, someone said they started playing this game after their boyfriend<br/>
&gt; got them hooked.  Well, My 15 year old son is the one who got me<br/>
&gt; started!  Pretty sad, huh? lol<br/>
&gt; Thanks for your help,<br/>
