The game is totally addictive and will take over your life!  Other than<br/>
that, it&#39;s great.  The monthly cost is $10 unless you decide to sign up<br/>
for 6 mos. at a time in which case it is $9.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; Hi there, and welcome to EQ Women!  This mailing list is for women<br/>
&gt; who<br/>
&gt; play the game Everquest to meet eachother and chat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  You can post to the list by replying to this message,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Salutations!<br/>
&gt; I am sorry to come on here but I have a question.<br/>
&gt; I am about to buy this game and I wanted to get some opinion from some<br/>
&gt; of you<br/>
&gt; who are in it about it and how good it is and whether it is worth the<br/>
&gt; cost.<br/>
&gt; I was also curious if someone could tell me what the cost is, after<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; initial expense of buying the game. The game at the local Best Buy<br/>
&gt; does not<br/>
&gt; give the monthly charge on it at all.<br/>
&gt; I have never been in an online game before so this will be a first.<br/>
&gt; Please feel free to contact me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Brangvyne@...">Brangvyne@...</a> if you can answer<br/>
&gt; any of<br/>
&gt; these questions.<br/>
&gt; And don&#39;t worry, I wont clutter your list up with any other posts<br/>
&gt; until I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; officially a member of the game.<br/>
