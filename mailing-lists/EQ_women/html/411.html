<div id="ygrps-yiv-2038185880">Well, that&#39;s kinda tough. =(  When I started playing on Povar, my<br/>
friends from another game decided to play on Tunare.  Well, I&#39;d already<br/>
committed to my RL friends from work to play on Povar, and I decided to<br/>
stick with it.  Hence I lost contact with almost everyone I had enjoyed<br/>
a previous &#39;fantasy world&#39; with, and they were some wonderful, loving<br/>
people (at least IC, hehe).<br/>
<br/>
This may not seem to have any bearing, at first, but it gets deeper.<br/>
That&#39;s the very first level we can find ourselves caught in, social<br/>
creatures that we (you and I, Judy, *grin*) are.<br/>
<br/>
I also have had a partner who crossed over from a previous game to play<br/>
with me.  Well, he had sworn up and down that he wasn&#39;t going to do<br/>
that, so I started making friends on my server and having a good time.<br/>
Practically from release, my current partner and I met each other and<br/>
just, I dunno, clicked (we&#39;re best friends in real life, now... met each<br/>
other in October. =)  ).  So my former partner shows up, says, &#39;Here I<br/>
am! Let&#39;s play!&#39; and I... well, I already had someone who fit my<br/>
character in this game oh, so very well.  and my former partner doesn&#39;t.<br/>
=(<br/>
<br/>
Last scenario, then I&#39;ll shut up...hehe... so, I met this guy a while<br/>
back, after I met my partner but before my partner and I had anything<br/>
formal going (hadn&#39;t even discussed getting married or anything like<br/>
that).  He and I had a good time, and while my partner was attending to<br/>
RL stuff on weekends and evenings and what not, he and I would play.<br/>
Had a WONDERFUL time.  Then I tell him my partner and I decided to get<br/>
betrothed.  He was not happy.  He decided that he should have had a<br/>
shot, at least, because he was the reason I joined my guild and went to<br/>
Antonica the first time and yada yada.  Well, he was right in some ways,<br/>
but wrong in others.  It ended up with stuff carrying over into real<br/>
life.  So for a while, EQ stopped being my haven and started being my<br/>
hell.  He doesn&#39;t even play anymore. =(<br/>
<br/>
Moral of the story?  Men IC are just like men IRL.  They just have a<br/>
venue in EQ to show that romantic, daring knightly side that we women<br/>
all adore.  But they don&#39;t check their personalities at the door when<br/>
they log on.  Some men share well, some don&#39;t.  The thing is this:  did<br/>
you enjoy the game before him, and if so, why? Answer that question and<br/>
you may find your mood changing for the better.  If you say, &#39;Yes, but<br/>
he added sooo much to my enjoyment of the game,&#39; I understand, sister,<br/>
believe me.  And trust me on one last thing before you hit that delete<br/>
button to flush this windy and egotistical reply, hehe:  your enjoyment<br/>
will get back to what it was, one way or another.  (1) You will be very<br/>
happy you chose your server and stuck with it, or (2) you will find a<br/>
partner who better suits you, or (3) you and your current partner will<br/>
resolve the conflicts you have.  Any which way you choose, it will come<br/>
back once you get the chance to remember why you bought the game.<br/>
