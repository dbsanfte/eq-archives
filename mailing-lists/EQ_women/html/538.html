<div><font face="Arial" size="2">ROFLMAO - just wait til you get group 
teleport.&nbsp; The druid&#39;s life is &quot;TAXI&quot;!&nbsp; And if you&#39;re a cleric and get 
res?&nbsp; People ask my cleric friend to travel 8 zones away to rez them.&nbsp; 
</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I have rules now that really help.&nbsp; I usually 
start the game with about 20-30 minutes of teleporting.&nbsp;&nbsp; If on a 
raid, it&#39;s my job to pick people up before and drop them off after.&nbsp; Once 
I&#39;m grouped, my group gets my time and my mana.&nbsp; It is not fair to leave a 
group to teleport someone and then come back.&nbsp; Not to mention it is 
impossible if deep in a dungeon.&nbsp; I&#39;ll SOW anyone if I have SOW up (which 
is almost never as I usually keep SLN in my buffing slot and I only have one 
except on a raid then I drop my &quot;save my ass&quot; slot and put group chloro 
there).&nbsp;&nbsp; However, usually the rangers always have SOW up (fewer 
spells to fill their slots) so I almost never get asked anymore.&nbsp; (My bard, 
in full lambent, however gets asked all the time which completely cracks me 
up).</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">So my advice is to remember you can always say 
&quot;no&quot;.&nbsp; When younger and soloing, I would only SOW if I had meditated to 
full.&nbsp; If someone was willing to wait, I&#39;d SOW them.&nbsp; If not, forget 
it.&nbsp; I also will not do it for someone who is not polite.&nbsp; I had one 
paladin ask me to group with him and when I suggested that at 25 he&#39;s get little 
experience with a 52 he said &quot;oh, I know.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just SOW and invis 
me.&quot;&nbsp; I refused.&nbsp; I told him he needed to learn manners and consider 
this refusal a lesson. It takes so little to say &quot;Could you please help 
me.&nbsp; I need SOW and invis to join my group</font>.&quot;</div>

  <div><br></div><tt>Hey...Ranalla, you mentioned that everyone was shouting for 
  SoWs when you<br>were in fp when you got to 14. My Barb Shaman (Kalara on the 
  Veeshan server)<br>got her SoW spell at lvl 9 and ever since then I&#39;ve 
  essentially been a SoW<br>whore (lol might be a bit crude, but apt). The big 
  difference now that i&#39;m<br>lvl 21 is that no one pays me for the SoW. They 
  just come up to me (and<br>pretty soon you&#39;ll know what I mean...they&#39;ll come 
  up, sort of stand there<br>and before they can ask for the SoW I am already 
  mid-spell to just get them<br>to go away). They literally assume that it is 
  for free, say thanks and walk<br>away. Drives me nuts when they do it right 
  after I&#39;ve just fought a mob, am<br>at half-life, oom and my party is the same 
  or worse. That&#39;s usually the only<br>time that I&#39;ll turn them 
  down.<br><br>Most people just say thanks (but often not even that) and leave. 
  Others,<br>usually the higher levels, will&nbsp; give me buffs and that I can 
  always<br>appreciate.<br><br>My in-game fiance (hey...THAT is a great topic, 
  in-game marriages...anyone<br>know of a good place in Norrath to tie the 
  knot?) is an enchanter and he<br>gets asked for breezes far more than I do and 
  they pay him...and often pay<br>him well. Hey, I have often paid several plat 
  to get a good breeze or<br>clarity. Can&#39;t live without my new addiction!&nbsp; 
  And seriously, I can&#39;t tell<br>you how great it is to have a perpetual sow and 
  breeze when you are in a<br>group.<br><br>My guild is a pretty big one but 
  there is a big disparity between high level<br>characters and lower ones. You 
  can really tell the difference between the<br>ones that came into the guild at 
  a later time and the ones that have been<br>there for awhile. Most of them are 
  lvl 30+ and then the next group is pretty<br>much right around 20, then it 
  drops to a few new secondary char of people in<br>the guild who are really low 
  levels. It sort of sucks because the guild<br>raids are mostly planned by the 
  higher levels and excludes a lot of people.<br>But it&#39;s growing and new people 
  are coming on board all the time. I&#39;m<br>finding that I hang out mostly with 
  people in my guild and it is a lot of<br>comradarie. It also doesn&#39;t hurt that 
  70% of the guild are druids (weird,<br>huh?) and so getting a port is never a 
  problem.<br><br>I play for the social aspects, but I love the questing and 
  learning skills.<br>I have half my totemic armor already and the getting it 
  has been most of the<br>fun...travelling all over, getting help from people. 
  I&#39;m a lvl 68 in baking<br>(funny because I&#39;m not a domestic sort in real 
  life...I can cook well but<br>don&#39;t like to so much). Baking is an awesome 
  skill to have because once you<br>buy a spit, you can bake while you meditate! 
  And fresh meat there is<br>aplenty. I find it funny though that there aren&#39;t 
  many bakers around. My<br>friends always laugh when I present them with beer 
  braised lion or pickled<br>gator. The food is also lighter than regular food 
  (monks love that) at .01<br>and it lasts a lot longer.<br><br>Okay, I&#39;m 
  rambling...brought up lots of things we can use for topics later<br>(guilds, 
  skills, weddings, social stuff). :-)<br><br>Crystal<br>Kalara, 21st Barbie
