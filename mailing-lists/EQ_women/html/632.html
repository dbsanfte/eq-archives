<div id="ygrps-yiv-865127379">A newbie question re server politics; what are they?  Are there different &#39;cultures&#39; on different servers?  Is this a guild thing?  Is there something I should look out for?  &lt;gulp&gt;<br/>

I&#39;ve gone back to my old server to visit and that&#39;s nice, I always run<br/>
into some old friends who say hi and chat with me. There are people I<br/>
still care about on that old server. But, it seems like I have a barrier<br/>
that prevents me from playing there. I just know if I play there that<br/>
server politics will rear its ugly head again.<br/>
<br/>
So for now I will power level my little enchanter on Tholuxe, and see what<br/>
it&#39;s like playing there. <br/>
