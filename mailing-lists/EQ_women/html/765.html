were very good friends for a while and he helped me get through some real

the end of that year, and became engaged with our families&#39; blessings in May 
this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></div>

  have a story about marrage and eq, My cleric<br>&gt; met an enchanter at 
  lvl&nbsp; 17 while grouping in oasis,<br>&gt; we got talking and after a few 
  nights realized we<br>&gt; had alot in common as real life ppl. We were 
  married<br>&gt; in game&nbsp; at the little dock in nro at sunset that<br>&gt; 
  takes you to IC when we&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&gt; made lvl 20&nbsp; and that was 
  about a 1 1/2 ago. We<br>&gt; spent almost every night eather grped or we 
  would<br>&gt; talk in game, after about a month we started talking<br>&gt; 
  over the phone, slowly our friendship grew in the<br>&gt; real world. <br>&gt; 
  The only problem was he was on the other side of the<br>&gt; US from me so it 
  was limited to just talking on the<br>&gt; phone, the feelings for each other 
  grew and we found<br>&gt; we had we had fell in love for real. we wanted 
  to<br>&gt; meet&nbsp; but at that time it wasnt a thing we could do.<br>&gt; 
  we continued to talk daily on eq and on the phone<br>&gt; for about a year. We 
  then started to talk using<br>&gt; netmeeting and did that for a few months. 
  We started<br>&gt; both feeling<br>&gt; of wanting to be togeather very 
  strongly. we then<br>&gt; started making plans for him to come down so 
  we<br>&gt; could meet for real. This last July he spent 3 weeks<br>&gt; here 
  wiht me. we had so much fun and both of us<br>&gt; realized how much we&nbsp; 
  loved being with each other.<br>&gt; We both realized how hard it was going to 
  be for him<br>&gt; to go back home. We talked about him moving here.<br>&gt; 
  At the end of aug he moved him self down here to<br>&gt; move in with 
  me.<br>&gt; We are very happy togeather and cant imagine what it<br>&gt; would 
  be to be wiht one an other now. He is a very<br>&gt; loving person and im very 
  happy and feel very luck<br>&gt; to have found him. The odds of us meeting in 
  game<br>&gt; are huge and the odds of us grping in the same grp<br>&gt; that 
  night are even bigger. So we&nbsp; feel it was<br>&gt; totally ment to be. 
  <br>&gt; So see wonderful things can happen from playing a<br>&gt; game and 
  ingame marrage.<br>&gt; so i guess that is my answer about getting 
  married<br>&gt; in the game.<br>&gt; Tyhana Storm<br>&gt; 55 cleric<br>&gt; 
  Bertoxx <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Ps my cleric as preformed a few marrages now 
  also<br>&gt; and those ppl are still very happy with there<br>&gt; partner in 
  the game.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br>&gt; From:

  :o)&lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; Hi!&lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; 
  &lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; I sent a long post the other day and hoped on the<br>&gt; 
  list today only to &lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; realize that it had not made it to this 
  list at all.<br>&gt; In fact, &lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; apparently my last couple of 
  posts didn&#39;t make it to<br>&gt; the list.&lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; 
  Sometimes I can be so dumb . . . but I can&#39;t help<br>&gt; but wonder where I 
  &lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; sent the crazy things.&lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; 
  :o)&lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; Anyway, a little question for anyone 
  who might think<br>&gt; about &lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; answering . . 
  .&lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; Is there a level limit you need to be 
  to get married<br>&gt; in EQ? What are &lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; the advantages and 
  or disadvantages of tying the EQ<br>&gt; knot?&lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt;
