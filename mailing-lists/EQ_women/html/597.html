<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609188404">The Ebony Blade is found in lower guk live side.  It&#39;s a pretty cool<br/>
ranger only sword, that procs a root that does some damage.  It&#39;s<br/>
considered a good low level ranger weapon.<br/>
<br/>
Around 30-40 level many prefer switching to an Electrum Bladed Wakizatci<br/>
(or two).  This sword has a better damage ratio, and is very light and<br/>
fast.  This is the one you need the fangs for.<br/>
<br/>
Around level 40-50 most rangers try and pick up Yakeshas and a flowing<br/>
black silk sash.  Yakesha is a very popular weapon, with the same ratio as<br/>
the EBW and a nice 75 point damage proc.  EBWs are IMHO almost as good<br/>
however, and you&#39;re fine with a pair of those at 50.<br/>
<br/>
A good two handed sword will have better damage output than dual wielding<br/>
up to around level 35 or so.  It depends on your weapons though.  Some<br/>
good two handed ranger weapons are:<br/>
   - Axe of the iron black (Found commonly in Kunark, sold for a couple<br/>
hundred plat I believe.  This puppy really owns, it is good to 40th level<br/>
for sure. Pick one up.)<br/>
   - Shiny Brass Halberds (SBH) and Blackened Iron Bastard Swords (BIBS)<br/>
are good up to level 30 or so.<br/>
   - I&#39;m not really up to date on all the crazy Kunark weapons, I know<br/>
there are a lot of powerful ones around now<br/>

&gt; Hiya, Judy. =)  Well, it&#39;s hard to kick the habit but essentially schoolwork pretty much demanded it.  I took two accelerated courses this summer and that really kicked my butt, which made it aLOT easier to say goodbye.  Also, Verant had upset me personally over my account (which I&#39;d had since March of &#39;99, without EVER missing a payment, thank you very much), and there was the whole fact that Celedhros and I were finding that our battle plans were starting to take on the complexity of a good Othello match. &lt;grin&gt;  Two rangers can be VERY effective, if the rangers in question are very, very careful...  anyway, it was all getting to be a bit much, and school comes first. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ebony blade... wow... that&#39;s the one we collected the fangs for, right?<br/>

&gt;   I remember you!  I have played through a bizillion alts in my lifetime (sigh).  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Anyway, the good news about rangers is how bad the rep is.  I play a ranger on TP, the new server.  At 12 I got an Ebony Blade because I was the only ranger anyone in the group knew.  Another one went up on the boards because no one in that group knew any rangers ;-)  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I play, when possible which it hasn&#39;t been in forever, with a now 55 ranger on Brell (sylvanar, I play Iceiallana, a 54 druid).  He has no trouble getting groups anymore.  A lot of the flack is over and it has turned into a huge joke.   I get some grief for being a ranger, but there are only 22 of us on the new server (giggles) and since casters outnumber tanks 3:1 now, anyone who can tank is wanted for groups.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   As for kicking the habit, congratulatoins.  I&#39;ve come close twice but never succeeded.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
