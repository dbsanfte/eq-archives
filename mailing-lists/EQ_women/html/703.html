But they are in the full print version and were posted to Lums (before it<br/>
closed) and another mailing list and verified by some other folks.  If you<br/>
know any Brits get them to scan the article and fax it. ;)<br/>

Here is another report based on that<br/>

As an Aussie friend would say about it &quot;Oi! Oi!&quot; ;)<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm .. may want to contact you Ice on the server that guild is on after<br/>
release.  That is the team my daughter and I want to try.  I want to be a<br/>
Saracen - as my husband has historical ties to Moorish culture in Spain and<br/>
that got me going on background ideas.  That and they have NO elves! ;)<br/>

&gt; I have quit AO too now.  Had promise, assuming they made some of thier<br/>

&gt; most, but not all).  Half my AO guild is going to try DAoC, and a few EQ<br/>
&gt; people I know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However, recent Sony/Verant comments to a British gaming mag have me very<br/>
&gt; hesitant about reopening an EQ account at all. :(<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For the RP lovers out there that have quit playing EQ, the new RP server,<br/>
&gt; Firiona Vie, is up and running in test (i.e., you have to use eqtst.exe to<br/>
&gt; play).  They have new rules: trivial loot, race/class/deity alignments<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; prohibit grouping and guilding with non aligned players, language barriers<br/>
&gt; (no<br/>
&gt; common tongue at all), everyone is ROLEPLAY ON, and only one character is<br/>
&gt; allowed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I played it the last two nights and had a BLAST!  Everyone in Everfrost<br/>
&gt; (never<br/>
&gt; did play Shaman past 9 before) was roleplaying.  I hear that wasn&#39;t the<br/>
case<br/>
&gt; in GFay and Qeynos but that the RP&#39;ers were pretty strong and insistent<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; the spam quieted down.  The chars will be wiped out once the server goes<br/>
&gt; live,<br/>
&gt; but I kind of like Katrice and will probably keep her.  I love the Shaman<br/>
&gt; potions they can make now :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A few powergamers have decided to come to FV to see how the new rules<br/>
affect<br/>
&gt; people, and as long as they don&#39;t uber guild the server and camp the<br/>
dragons<br/>
&gt; and make the high end game SUCK I don&#39;t mind.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, the rumor is the server goes live the day DAoC is released.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; planning on getting DAoC, but I may just not cancel my EQ account quite<br/>
yet.<br/>
&gt; AO, on the other hand, BIG YAWN!  Made it to 10 and quitting.  Good try,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; the game is just too buggy *sigh*.<br/>
