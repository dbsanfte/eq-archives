<br/>
I have a level 52 Ranger (Pixy) as you know Icey, and I can say without a<br/>
doubt that rangers rock really hard...up to about level 40.  From level<br/>
40-50 they are good.  After 50 they start to become weak in comparision<br/>
with other hybrids/tanks.<br/>
<br/>
Rangers are in particular rocking for small groups.  I hunted from level<br/>
20 to 50 with my RL boyfriend (now ex sigh).  It was really quite easy for<br/>
us to get to 50 together.  We grouped sometimes in larger groups but the<br/>
majority of the time we just hunted together.<br/>
<br/>
We got most of our xp hunting outdoors.  Harmony is great for single<br/>
pulling, then we just did tank/heal.  Like all tanks rangers depend on<br/>
equipment, but if you have decent equipment, rangers tank great up to<br/>
level 50.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I&#39;ve always loved the elegance of Rangers.  My first high level<br/>
character was a druid, and I recognized that snare and harmony were<br/>
awesome, so playing a ranger was the obvious next step.<br/>
<br/>
Post 50 I find that paladins and shadowknights are both very interesting,<br/>
but not quite interesting enough for me to level one =) I have a baby<br/>
Paladin who is level 15 who I enjoy playing though.<br/>

&gt; Yes, one of my pet peeves with the game is how drastically each class changes from the early levels to the higher levels.  As my betrothed (if he ever returns /em pouts) is a ranger I am all too familiar with the difficulties of that class.  (Oh, and Druids do wear green armor once they get their vermiculite - we look like rangers in green mail and rangers are in green plate).  Did you participate in last weekends Ranger Protest?  Apparently rangers from all the servers made level 1 wood-elves, formed a guild called &quot;Wrath of Rangers&quot;, and descended on Crushbone.  Would have loved to have seen it.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But to be honest, I still think Rangers rock.  I could be prejudiced ;-) </span></blockquote></div>
