<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hiya!&nbsp; I&#39;m a lurker, don&#39;t mind me. =)&nbsp; I 
used to play, and you probably saw one of my rants about the problems with the 
ranger class and didn&#39;t understand my vehement defense of and support for the 
ranger community back before Verant changed the rules.&nbsp; I played a ranger 
from release date on, and while rangers are one of the easiest classes to get up 
to the 30s, at that point the lack of defensive capabilities begins to really 
show (or at least it used to).&nbsp; Frankly, the ranger was not the light, 
nimble, agile fighter we had been told during beta it would be.&nbsp; I put mega 
points into agility with my first ranger and it ended up being an &quot;in&quot; joke in 
the community to have done so. &lt;grin&gt;&nbsp; Also, my ingame and real life 
partner was a ranger, and at the heyday of ranger bashing, it was virtually 
impossible for the two of us to get a pickup group.&nbsp; So finally it got to 
be more frustrating for us to play than not.&nbsp; We attended the sit-ins, said 
good bye to too many fellow rangers who had been in beta with us and created 
their rangers on release date too, and just got heartsick, really.&nbsp; It 
happens, you know? Now that my university schedule has heated up a bit I&#39;m glad 
we&#39;re not playing online games right now.&nbsp; We&#39;ve gone back to D&amp;D now 
that they have the new rules.&nbsp; We play one night a week with one group and 
two Saturdays a month with another.&nbsp; I find I have alot more free time now 
that we&#39;ve kicked our&nbsp;four-hour-a-night Evercrack habit. &lt;blush&gt;

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Anyway, I wanted to ask if your guild was based on 
the Dune books... the Fremen were a nomadic tribe of desert dwellers (male and 
female both! =P).&nbsp; Excellent series if I do say so.&nbsp; I hope you find 
many hours of enjoyment with your ranger.&nbsp; Tunare bless!</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>Now that I know I can post to the board, I&#39;d like to 
  introduce <br>myself. I&#39;m Liz, and I started playing EQ just over a month ago, 
  with <br>a ranger (no, they do not suck; perfect newbie class) on 
  <br>Quellious.She is called Gyngermynx (it sounded like a clever at the 
  <br>time, but how will I ever think of a surname to go with it?)<br><br>I live 
  in the UK, so I lose a lot of sleep trying to group with my <br>new friends 
  from the US and my guildmates, the Fremen, a new and <br>friendly little 
  guild; what about Frewomen, though ;).<br><br>If you see me, do please say 
  hello :)<br><br>Liz<br><br></tt><br></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
