<div id="ygrps-yiv-884764458"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello everyone, Nice to see lots of email from this list. I,M 
<br>a youngish, LOL, gramma and I,M addicted to EQ. I play a level 12 High Elf 
<br>Magician on Morell Thule. It,s taken me 3 months to get that far alone as I 
<br>tend to ignore all the screaming little boys and explore and hunt alone. I 
<br>have been wondering about guilds also, and going of to new areas to explore.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I,M not ready to start looking for a guild yet, but from 
<br>listening to conversations and reading lots of forums, I see that you have to 
<br>join to get to places you can,t fight alone.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morell Thule is a fairly new server, so there are lots of lower 
<br>level characters and there is a fair amount of roleplaying on it. If you 
<br>ignore or avoid all the little screamers it,s fun. I,m running out of things 
<br>to hunt in my area so will have to leave soon.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for female friends that don,t play , wow , they are not too 
<br>understanding, they think I have gone off the deep end. So I just don,t tell 
<br>them how much I play any more. I did get my daughter addicted too, so now I 
<br>have someone to talk to about the game..............Roseann in Minnesota</font></font></html></div>
