&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just wondered how long the shelf life of EQ is? I have played since <br/>
&gt; 24 August 2000, and I tend to feel that I could carry on playing for <br/>
&gt; around a year, so long as I could get groups. EQ does not strike me <br/>
&gt; as a game I could easily play casually though, so I probably wouldn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; play fewer hours per week over a longer period.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think the decisive factor would be in-game; it&#39;s a miserable <br/>
&gt; occupation if you can&#39;t play as part of a group, so if it comes to <br/>
&gt; the point where my ranger cannot get into groups, it will probably be <br/>
&gt; time to move on. I suppose I might try another class, but I am not <br/>
&gt; that interested in doing so.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Many of you have played far longer than me, and some have retired. I <br/>
&gt; should be very interested to know how this worked for you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One further point; are any of you intending to play any of the new <br/>
&gt; games slated to open up in 2001? eg Shadowbane, Dark Age of Camelot<br/>
&gt; <br/>
