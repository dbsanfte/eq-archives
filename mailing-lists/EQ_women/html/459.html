<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777536208">He has been raiding Fear a lot lately.  He is trying to get all of his<br/>
ranger armour right now.<br/>
<br/>
I have beent thinking of getting an account lately, but wouldn&#39;t it be hard<br/>
for me to play with me since I would be a newbie character and he would be<br/>
level 50?  I could see if he would create a second character to just play<br/>
with me maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Also his 50 level ranger is a female.  It would be hard for us to be able to<br/>
flirt unless it was a different character.  I think I&#39;ll need to talk to him<br/>
about this more.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Okay, to be honest, I don&#39;t balance well at all.  It&#39;s a chronic<br/>
&gt;  struggle and I consider EQ an addiction with a WHOLE LOT of<br/>
&gt;  rationalization why I can play it.   If he is playing the raids on Fear<br/>
&gt;  and Hate and the dragon raids then he really is committing himself for<br/>
&gt;  the duration of the raid.  At the earlier levels one can log on and log<br/>
&gt;  off pretty freely as there is less coordination with other people.  But<br/>
&gt;  the raids require commitment.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  If he IS level 50, he doesn&#39;t really have to play every night.  He is at<br/>
&gt;  the maximum level.  One suggestion would be to set aside one night a<br/>
&gt;  week as &quot;date night&quot; where the two of you spend time together.  And,<br/>
&gt;  yes, you might look into getting your own EQ account.  It really doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;  cost that much.  Not so you can spend more time playing with him as much<br/>
&gt;  as so you can learn a bit more about the environment and community.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Or just hang out with him.  There is enough downtime in the game that I<br/>
&gt;  often read a book while other watch TV while playing.  It is interrupted<br/>
&gt;  conversation, but it is possible to have.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  At any rate, good luck.  I don&#39;t know that there is a solution,<br/>
&gt;  honestly.  If I had a real life group like SCA I might enjoy that more.<br/>
&gt;  I suspect it is a LOT healthier.  &lt;sigh&gt;  Oh well, good luck.<br/>
