<b>Subject:</b> Shamans and Clerics <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2090096023">I would just like to tell everyone out there who is a Cleric that they<br/>
just might like to try out a shaman. I spent 18 levels being a Cleric<br/>
and 5 being a Shaman so far. I was always frustrated with my<br/>
limitations as a Cleric and took on way too much responsibility for<br/>
other people&#39;s lives, which made grouping a very un-fun experience. I<br/>
love being a Shaman so far. ( I&#39;ve made 2 new characters in Quellios.<br/>
Bloodless and Blacksatin) Go ahead and laugh at the names, it&#39;s the<br/>
best I can do on such short notice! I agonized believe me. Someone even<br/>
called me &quot;campy&quot;!- whatever that means. I&#39;m only 25, that term&#39;s<br/>
before my time. <br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ve played on that server for a total of 3 days and have<br/>
noticed, not just me - also complete strangers, that most people on<br/>
that server are really helpfull and nice. Or maybe just the people in<br/>
Halas as that&#39;s the only town I&#39;ve been in. I encourage you guys to try<br/>
it out as I have been so happy. I don&#39;t die constantly and I don&#39;t have<br/>
to sit out the action all the time. I get to actually participate as a<br/>
part of the group instead of staring at my spellbook all the time with<br/>
nothing to do but chat. Not that chatting is at all bad, but I want to<br/>
have some fun too!<br/>
I have noticed that a lot of us have said that we play clerics, it<br/>
seems more than any other class. (Or maybe I only notice the clerics<br/>
because I play one.)I hope this doesn&#39;t offend you all, but I wonder if<br/>
we have chosen to play one because we are by nature nurturing and<br/>
helpfull, or because we have been raised in our society to act servile<br/>
to men. (I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve raised a few hackles-sorry!) It bothered me that<br/>
I would be one of the only women in rl playing a female character in<br/>
any given group and I would be forced to sit and heal all the male<br/>
warriors. I grew resentfull. I&#39;m wondering if many of you have done the<br/>
same thing, or if this just says a lot about me. <br/>
Thanks! :)<br/>
