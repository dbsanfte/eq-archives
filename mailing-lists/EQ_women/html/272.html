<div id="ygrps-yiv-163277807"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;But I do wonder how we will manage a bunch of &quot;Sisters of Love&quot; ;P  I<br/>
&gt;also have disagreement with how EQ set up the current Sisters from an RP<br/>
&gt;angle (well said already), but I don&#39;t want to inherit that confusion.<br/>
&gt;While I like the structure of the guild proposed ... would it be possible<br/>
&gt;to be Sisters of {Something Else}?  Then we could set up our own RP angle<br/>
&gt;without confusion with an existing NPC order?   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree that this would probably be better.  That way we can make our own rules, <br/>
<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;As well, the NPC sisters are wood elf warriors who follow<br/>
&gt;Erollisi, interestingly not a PC option.  And another RP oddity I noticed<br/>
&gt;... the Marr twins created Barbarians, and planted &quot;the seed&quot; from which<br/>
&gt;humans evolved from Barbarians, however Barbarians cannot worship the<br/>
&gt;Marr&#39;s, though most humans can.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow, that is interesting.  I hadn&#39;t noticed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Tunare is the only other female godess ...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The picture of Quellious looks like a little girl.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;or what do we stand for?  Love?  Goodness?  Comraderie?  Valor?  &gt;Triumph?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Independence?  Strength?  Vengeance?  Justice?  Fate?  Creavtivity?  (Thinking <br/>
of Greek mythology, where the Furies were female and stood for justice and <br/>
retribution, the Fates also female, and the Muses female as well.  Or we could <br/>
be Maenads and represent untamed wildness.  Just some ideas of concepts we could <br/>
<br/>
represent.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;BTW, the chastity thing comes from Roman warrior&#39;s beliefs.  And it only<br/>
&gt;applied to MALES.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>On a vaguely related note, I did ponder that perhaps males could serve as <br/>
sisters if they underwent castration (also a historical occurence).  &lt;evil grin&gt;<br/>
What does the race/class mixture look like at this point, anyway?<br/>
