<div id="ygrps-yiv-932448841">Hello!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
this email group is alive after all. :-)<br/>
<br/>
my fiance and I both play on Veeshan. <br/>
I started out playing a druid on the Rathe, in July got her to about <br/>
level 11, and then decided that wasn&#39;t the profession for me.  We had <br/>
heard some good things about Veeshan, so we made the switch!<br/>
Having a wonderful time. Have met some very wonderful people, and had <br/>
the good fortune to join a guild, the Honorable Knights.<br/>
<br/>
He has a level 6 Barbarian Shaman called Tavvish, and my character is <br/>
a Level 7 (so close to 8 it is painful) High Elf Enchantress named <br/>
Nyndari.<br/>
<br/>
Send a tell and say hi if you are on!  *smile*<br/>
<br/>
We are currently in misty thicket, doing some adventuring.  I managed <br/>
to save a young halfling druid&#39;s life, and it turned out that it was <br/>
his alt, and he had a high level enchanter on hold, so I received a <br/>
rod of insidious glamour as a reward, I nearly died!<br/>
<br/>
p.s Enchanters Rock!!<br/>
p.p.s I am not addicted, I can stop playing anytime I want to,.... <br/>
um.. I just don&#39;t want to! *LOL*<br/>
Someone mentioned they didn&#39;t know how to get to the website? this is <br/>
the address:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EQ_women/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EQ_women/</a><br/>
Cheers<br/>

have been <br/>
&gt; playing about a year and a half. I also have 2 warriors levels 30 <br/>
and 40. My <br/>
&gt; husband is a MAJOR addict! I love it, but not nearly as addicted as <br/>
he is! <br/>
&gt; You know.. women just cant stop everything to play  : )<br/>
