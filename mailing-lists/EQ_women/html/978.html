<br/>
I know whereof you speak.<br/>
<br/>
The last time I went to child birth classes the<br/>
instructor told me I should be teaching the class. (No<br/>
I&#39;m not kidding.) I was like the example for every<br/>
situation. I think I&#39;m level 65 with a couple hundred<br/>
AA&#39;s now in motherhood.<br/>
:oP<br/>
<br/>
And the other night we we&#39;re discussing the<br/>
possibility of a number 8.<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
You forgot to even mention the post docorate work in<br/>
time management and fiscal responsibility.<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
As for work outside the home I own a fitness center<br/>
and try to keep that running somewhat right. Not a lot<br/>
of money but I enjoy it.<br/>

&gt; ____&gt;OK are you a doctor like an MD or a PhD.<br/>
&gt; College was<br/>
&gt; ____&gt;something I had trouble with as well. OK, I did<br/>
&gt; get a<br/>
&gt; ____&gt;bachlors but I changed majors four or five<br/>
&gt; times and<br/>
&gt; ____&gt;it took forever. Then I worked on my masters<br/>
&gt; but I<br/>
&gt; ____&gt;kind of bounced back and fourth on that and<br/>
&gt; never<br/>
&gt; ____&gt;finished it. I did end up with enough credit<br/>
&gt; for a PhD<br/>
&gt; ____&gt;though plus some if I had ever stayed on one<br/>
&gt; thing<br/>
&gt; ____&gt;long enough.<br/>
