<div id="ygrps-yiv-1164055930">Hi Liz,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to the EQ_women group but have been using<br/>
eGroups for a while. Did you perhaps send your<br/>
original post from the eGroups EQ_women home page and<br/>
subsequent posts from your email account? This could<br/>
cause what you are describing. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious to hear if if your husband has a separate<br/>
account as well Sanna. I have had numerous friends on<br/>
EQ where husband and wife played and when they used<br/>
the same account it hasn&#39;t been a pretty sight. I&#39;ve<br/>
also seen it create problems when a married couple<br/>
play on the same server and they find love interests<br/>
in the game. My husband doesn&#39;t play EQ and I prefer<br/>
it that way. I don&#39;t mean to appear pessimistic about<br/>
your playing together. I&#39;m sure that if you have a<br/>
great relationship in RL that everything will be all<br/>
good. The best advice I could give you, take it or<br/>
leave it, is for both of you to become a team that<br/>
strive to reach common goals. If you begin to outlevel<br/>
each other I believe you might run into problems<br/>
because you&#39;ll find yourselves less able to hunt<br/>
together. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck and above all else...HAVE FUN!!<br/>

&gt; I assume your husband has a separate account and PC,<br/>
&gt; or there could <br/>
&gt; be some ugly scenes in store as the addiction<br/>
&gt; grips....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How does playing with your RL partner work? My<br/>
&gt; boyfriend thinks I am <br/>
&gt; a half-crazed addict, and plans to stick to the odd<br/>
&gt; blast of Quake <br/>
&gt; and Unreal, but I rather imagine it to be nice to<br/>
&gt; hunt together. That <br/>
&gt; said, there are earlier threads on the board saying<br/>
&gt; the opposite, as <br/>
&gt; well as supporting the idea.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW, can anyone tell me why my very first post<br/>
&gt; appeared under my <br/>
&gt; name, while subsequent ones appear under my e-mail<br/>
&gt; address?<br/>
