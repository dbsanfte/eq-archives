<br/>
Thanks for the note. Do you mean Surefall Glade? If so<br/>
that&#39;s where I&#39;m at right now in the game more or<br/>
less. I&#39;m soulbound there anyway.<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
That could be an idea though, it is kind of a neat<br/>
place. I&#39;m not sure how many people will even come to<br/>
something like this. I expect it to be small. I&#39;m<br/>
fairly new to the game and don&#39;t know lots of people<br/>
yet. He has played for much longer but tends to be a<br/>
loner and solo a lot, at least before he ran into me.<br/>
<br/>
It might be an idea though. Funny I was right there<br/>
and didn&#39;t even think of it. Of course, there are so<br/>
many places I haven&#39;t been yet.<br/>
<br/>
As for guilds I sort of have this feeling that its a<br/>
bit tacky to go around asking. On the other hand I<br/>
really want to try that part of the game out.<br/>
Maybe I don&#39;t have enough escapades.<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s very nice.  If you have any concerns about<br/>
&gt; guests&#39; safety, ask some of your &#39;wedding party&#39; to<br/>
&gt; be &#39;ushers&#39;, ie., escort your guests from Qeynos. <br/>
&gt; Or have a wizard &#39;port &#39;em in.<br/>

&gt; My fiance and I were both rangers.  We were very<br/>
&gt; effective at taunting; once one&#39;d take too much<br/>
&gt; damage, the other would start taunting madly. <br/>
&gt; &#39;Course, the roles may have changed in the past<br/>
&gt; year...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Guilds, eh... they&#39;re nice if you&#39;ve joined one<br/>
&gt; because you regularly adventure with many of its<br/>
&gt; members, but I never personally advertised for a<br/>
&gt; guild.  I tended to let my escapades take me where<br/>
&gt; they would (as an elven ranger when Povar was first<br/>
&gt; new, there was A LOT of escapade) and ran into my<br/>
&gt; guild brethren when hunting.  When I began looking<br/>
&gt; for them when I signed on, I knew I was finding a<br/>
&gt; &quot;home&quot;.  Just my two coppers&#39;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Salutations All!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I have not posted for a while, and I know everyone<br/>
&gt; was probably <br/>
&gt;   relaxing a little and here I am again.<br/>
&gt;   :o)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   EQ has been progressing prettry good for me I<br/>
&gt; think. I&#39;ve made a <br/>
&gt;   couple of good friends who are more experienced<br/>
&gt; then me and don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;   seem to mind giving advice or helping out so<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s very nice.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I&#39;ve also been trying to learn more about my role<br/>
&gt; as a Ranger in <br/>
&gt;   Norrath. I just found out last week what a handy<br/>
&gt; thing taunt can be <br/>
&gt;   when trying to keep a mob off your healer? OK, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; slow but I&#39;m <br/>
&gt;   getting there I think. And I&#39;ve gotten duel wield<br/>
&gt; and double attack <br/>
&gt;   now so that&#39;s interesting to play with.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Last night a Druid friend and I went to Paudal<br/>
&gt; Cavern for my first <br/>
&gt;   trip there. I would have died twice during the<br/>
&gt; first fight we had I <br/>
&gt;   think if they had not been there to keep me from<br/>
&gt; deaths door. That <br/>
&gt;   was a tough mob and red all the way for me at lvl<br/>
&gt; 19 (20 now).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Anyway, enough ramblin, so it&#39;s question time:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   1.) I have been asked to get married and have said<br/>
&gt; yes. :o) Any good <br/>
&gt;   suggestions on locations that would be nice but<br/>
&gt; not to hard for <br/>
&gt;   guests to get to? He has a place in mind, I forget<br/>
&gt; the name, but it <br/>
&gt;   sounds like it might be hard for lower level<br/>
&gt; characters to even <br/>
&gt;   reach. I have not traveled over much of Norrath<br/>
&gt; still so I&#39;m not <br/>
&gt;   sure. Anyway, if anyone has ideas I&#39;d love to hear<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
&gt;   Also, when things are set, which may be a while<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll post a note here <br/>
&gt;   letting everyone know. You are all invited, of<br/>
&gt; course, feel free to <br/>
&gt;   come if you have a character on the Xegony server,<br/>
&gt; of if you want <br/>
&gt;   just create a quick one at the proper time and<br/>
&gt; come anyway. I&#39;d love <br/>
&gt;   to meet anyone who might do me the honor of<br/>
&gt; coming.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   2.) Can anyone give me advice on how to find a<br/>
&gt; guild that might be <br/>
&gt;   interested in letting a Ranger in the low 20&#39;s<br/>
&gt; join? Would it be ok <br/>
&gt;   to just kind of start asking around? Is there a<br/>
&gt; way to tell a better <br/>
&gt;   guild from one not as good?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Anyway, I hope everyone had a nice Thanksgiving.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Hugs<br/>
