<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733799566">When I intruduced myself earlier I just told you about my character, but now<br/>
about myself. I am a 31 year old married mother of 3 all under the age of 5.<br/>
My husband is one of my group mates and plays a female. He gets more<br/>
flirting and stuff than I do, which rather makes me jealous I think. (Of<br/>
course when his character runs around half nekkid when he dies he can&#39;t help<br/>
but get flirted with ya know?) When asked about my age I am honest and tell<br/>
them how old I am. And I have openly made a point of telling those that ask<br/>
that I am married because my husband is the jealous type. About the only<br/>
comments I have gotten so far are about the new banded mail I am wearing, it<br/>
is rather um...form fitting on the top. My husband does not tell others his<br/>
age, marital status nor his gender. Oh well that is his business and this<br/>
list is not about him right? :) Sorry to ramble on.<br/>
