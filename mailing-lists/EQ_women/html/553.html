<div><font face="Arial" size="2">THANK YOU!</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Yes, one of my pet peeves with the game is how 
drastically each class changes from the early levels to the higher levels.&nbsp; 
As my betrothed (if he ever returns /em pouts) is a ranger I am all too familiar 
with the difficulties of that class.&nbsp; (Oh, and Druids do wear green armor 
once they get their vermiculite - we look like rangers in green mail and rangers 
are in green plate).&nbsp; Did you participate in last weekends Ranger 
Protest?&nbsp; Apparently rangers from all the servers made level 1 wood-elves, 
formed a guild called &quot;Wrath of Rangers&quot;, and descended on Crushbone.&nbsp; 
Would have loved to have seen it.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">But to be honest, I still think Rangers rock.&nbsp; 
I could be prejudiced ;-)</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The gameplay needs to be more consistent.&nbsp; I 
think the reason I love playing newbies is that they can all be played up until 
20, then the world changes.&nbsp; Then it changes again at 40 and again at 
50.&nbsp; And frankly, the time it takes to get experience at 50 is 
obscene.&nbsp; Why not add more levels but let people have the satisfaction of 
watching their experience bar go up.&nbsp; My group killed 64 mobs in Chardok 
and I gained less than 1/4 bubble experience.&nbsp; That&#39;s 
RIDICULOUS!</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">As for my game, I&#39;m now stuck on how to get away 
from &quot;killing mobs&quot; as the primary gameplay force.&nbsp; I want it more 
adventure based, I think, with characters given &quot;opportunities&quot; to alter the 
dynamic of gameplay.&nbsp; And each level grouping having different quest 
orientations.&nbsp; And each server being uniquely itself because of the 
decisions made by players up to that time.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Anyway, the game is now called KARMA and when you 
die - you REALLY die ;-)&nbsp; None of this resurrection gorp.&nbsp; You have to 
be reborn and how you are reborn is totally dependent on how you played up to 
that point.&nbsp; Of course, like anything else, it&#39;s all in the details.&nbsp; 
But those are my ideas so far.&nbsp; Opinions?</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>Hello, everyone... I stole Gwyk&#39;s subject line because I 
  thought it was<br>appropriate to me, hehe...<br><br>Well, it&#39;s been a month 
  now since I&#39;ve stopped playing EQ, and really the only<br>thing I miss is the 
  people.&nbsp; I started playing in Beta 4, so that was over a<br>year ago, so 
  maybe I just got burned out?&nbsp; This is primarily information for<br>Judy, 
  but might have a new perspective to offer my other fellow women 
  gamers...<br><br>I was a ranger the entire time, although I did try rolling up 
  a couple of other<br>classes.&nbsp; My heart just has always been with the 
  AD&amp;D ranger, and that&#39;s what I<br>wanted to play.&nbsp; Well, I don&#39;t know 
  how many others here play rangers, but there<br>gets to be a point where it 
  just doesn&#39;t work well unless you have the right<br>combination party.&nbsp; I 
  won&#39;t go into the details, but suffice to say, if you&#39;re<br>curious, go to any 
  of the ranger boards and you&#39;ll get an &#39;earful&#39; =P.<br><br>I even re-rolled my 
  ranger and started over, which (for someone who doesn&#39;t play<br>more than ten 
  or fifteen hours a week) represented a huge investment of time.<br>Why?&nbsp; 
  Two reasons, one of which was I thought Aelwesara went better with my 
  soon<br>to be last name than Sara. =P&nbsp; And also, I had bought the 
  &#39;agility&#39; lie, and<br>pumped all my stat points into agility for my first 
  ranger... finding out later<br>that agility is no where NEAR the important 
  stat Verant originally told us it<br>was.&nbsp; But, you see, this was my 
  primary, my only.&nbsp; I know people advise not to<br>have just one 
  character, but even with pencil-and-paper games, I liked to have<br>one 
  character for a series of campaigns, build her a history, imbue her with 
  a<br>strong personality, yada yada... so for me, I typically only have one 
  high level<br>character at a time, and I become attached to her. 
  &lt;blush&gt;&nbsp; So I want her to<br>have all the advantages I can give 
  her, and proper statistics distribution<br>seemed to be one.&nbsp; As it turns 
  out later, I was still wrong...<br><br>But I could have kept playing my 
  ranger, since I was fortunate to have a great<br>many friends, and I probably 
  could have succeeded, although it would have been<br>largely due to their 
  largesse and that of senior rangers who passed everything<br>they could down 
  to me and Celedhros.&nbsp; My partner (also a ranger) and I were 
  very<br>knowledgeable players, really because we did a lot of research and 
  reading and<br>listening and exploring and experimenting.&nbsp; But I think my 
  big problem was not<br>with the fact that my class changes drastically in its 
  abilities at level 45,<br>causing such a change in paradigm that it was 
  shocking; I think my problem was<br>with Verant&#39;s response to the player base 
  concern over these changes.&nbsp; Odd that<br>customer service played such a 
  big decision in my desire to leave, but there it<br>is. &lt;snort&gt;&nbsp; I 
  mention this only because I know Judy was thinking of putting<br>something 
  together, and I thought you might like that info... over thirty 
  people<br>I&nbsp; know of have quit over this issue.&nbsp; That might not be a 
  large number to<br>Verant yet, but those are the people I know of... what 
  about the others?&nbsp; And<br>more have stopped playing high-level rangers 
  than any other class.&nbsp; When a<br>strong percentage of clients say, &#39;Hey, 
  that&#39;s not right&#39;, it might be better to<br>do more than give a token answer 
  and let them struggle...<br><br>I, too, suffered watching my server Povar turn 
  into a miniDiablo server.&nbsp; I&#39;ve<br>politely told people, &quot;Nay, I do not 
  have the Spirit of the Wolf yet&quot; (rangers<br>don&#39;t get it til level 39) and 
  had them cuss me out and call me a liar and<br>announce to the zone that I 
  wouldn&#39;t give sow (I hate that word now, by the way<br>=) )... impugning the 
  honor of someone they&#39;ve never met because it&#39;s their<br>God-given right to 
  have whomever they demand cast that spell on them.&nbsp; My<br>favorite 
  response to those zone-wide shouts was, &#39;Have you ever met a druid IN<br>GREEN 
  ARMOR???&#39;&nbsp; But I shouldn&#39;t have had to resort to defending myself, 
  should<br>I? I mean... anyone could have done a /who all Aelwesara and found 
  out for<br>himself... but no, here I am with my name plastered across the 
  darned zone...<br>&lt;sigh&gt;<br><br>I have responded to people, &#39;I cannot 
  leave my party to track a monster for you,<br>and even if we find it, you are 
  too low level to fight it...&#39; only to discern<br>that they wanted me to find 
  it, fight it, and let them loot it, usually for<br>about 10 plat.&nbsp; At 
  that point, I have to deal with, &#39;Oh, come on, if you don&#39;t<br>suck it won&#39;t 
  take very long, why don&#39;t you want to help me I lost everything I<br>had...&#39; 
  and most of the time, it&#39;s not even an item for one of their 
  classes&#39;<br>quests (for example, the fire heart in Solusek A, being requested 
  by... a<br>magician?? C&#39;mon...).&nbsp; I remember not being able to muster the 
  desire to go<br>hunt, because everything that we knew of that was 
  level-appropriate had a<br>waiting list, mostly filled by higher levels 
  wanting to kill a mob for a rare<br>drop in order to sell it so they could 
  amass more money...&nbsp; of course, Ruins of<br>Kunark made that a lot 
  better, and it was the only thing that kept my interest<br>for a while, but my 
  poor PII 233 has such a problem handling the graphics (it<br>can&#39;t be my card, 
  can it? I mean, I have a Voodoo 3 2000, which works fine for<br>Diablo and 
  Starcraft and Tribes...) that at times the lag was lethal... my<br>problem, 
  not Verant&#39;s, but I&#39;m a starving student and my next upgrade has to<br>wait 
  for my loan refund. &lt;grin&gt;<br><br>I decided I wanted to leave before I 
  had a cleric call me a mana-sink for the<br>first time, which has happened to 
  several of my senior brethren.&nbsp; I decided I<br>wanted to leave before I 
  got frustrated with competing with other classes for my<br>quest items (also 
  has happened).&nbsp; I wanted to keep Aelwesara fresh and strong<br>and 
  powerful, as in over twenty years of role-playing she has been my 
  favorite<br>avatar.<br><br>Point is, I can&#39;t tell if my decision was swayed by 
  overall burnout from having<br>played a game for almost 16 months, or if it 
  really is primarily a question of<br>game mechanics and customer 
  service.&nbsp; I&#39;m giving you this information, Judy,<br>because I know you&#39;ve 
  expressed a desire to have it, and if you can solve some<br>of these problems, 
  it might help your project.&nbsp; I mean, I played AD&amp;D steadily<br>for 
  what... almost fifteen years, not counting the breaks? Granted, there 
  were<br>things there that I didn&#39;t agree with, but most DMs were amenable to 
  editing the<br>rules to suit their individual campaigns (and as long as you 
  didn&#39;t take a<br>character out of their &#39;world&#39; it worked just fine), and they 
  had the physical<br>ability to do so... not all of those changes favored me, 
  so I don&#39;t think my<br>dissatisfaction here is founded in mere pique... and 
  I&#39;m not the kind of person<br>who is usually very demanding of my play 
  environment...<br><br>I try to make the best of wherever I find myself, and 
  did so in spite of rampant<br>pkilling in Ultima Online for over a year (the 
  old, pre-expansion days there),<br>and even though I didn&#39;t like alot of the 
  game mechanics (tank mages? C&#39;mon...)<br>because they weren&#39;t traditional, I 
  made the most of it and honestly put up with<br>quite a bit to prove that I 
  could stick to it.&nbsp; And really--if we want to talk<br>about player 
  rudeness and vileness and general ickyness, UO and Diablo have been<br>where 
  I&#39;ve met the absolute worst... so it&#39;s not the people in EQ, is it?&nbsp; 
  Not<br>the majority, anyway?<br><br>So, Judy, here&#39;s the data... don&#39;t know 
  what you want to do with it... &lt;grin&gt;<br>I&#39;m just providing it.&nbsp; My 
  apologies, Christina, if this sounds like a rant and<br>is inappropriate to 
  the forum.&nbsp; I do have alot of positive experiences (I can<br>tell ya how 
  to have a great wedding, what to look for in a guild, yada yada)<br>that I 
  would still love to share but haven&#39;t recently because I didn&#39;t know if 
  I<br>should since I wasn&#39;t playing.&nbsp; I think Everquest has the best 
  platform for the<br>most classes/races that is currently on the market, and I 
  would strongly urge<br>other players to take my experiences with a grain of 
  salt.&nbsp; I was not a power<br>leveler, I was a roleplayer.&nbsp; I did 
  manage to get a decent number of levels on<br>me, but that was never the 
  goal.&nbsp; Some of my senior rangers say it&#39;s possible to<br>power level a 
  ranger to 45 within a matter of less than a month, because the<br>class really 
  rocks for most of those levels if you play it well.&nbsp; It all depends<br>on 
  what you&#39;re looking for.&nbsp; If I may be allowed to &#39;lurk&#39; here and comment 
  from<br>time to time, I would love to do so.&nbsp; I&#39;ve enjoyed this list for 
  what...? Since<br>before I moved to Maryland, I know that, and that was last 
  July... I&#39;m thinking<br>May, Christina?&nbsp; Anyway, I&#39;ve loved being part of 
  it, and would love to continue<br>to do so.&nbsp; Regardless, I wish you all 
  the best experiences you could have,<br>wherever you are (and I LOVE the idea 
  of a female halfing warrior--more power to<br>ya!).&nbsp; Tunare 
  bless.<br><br>Aelwesara C├╗thalion, also known as &#39;sara C├╗thalion<br>Champion 
  of the Feydark<br>Povar<br><br><br></tt></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
