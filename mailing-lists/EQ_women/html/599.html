<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-689518556">Thanks for your replies and advice. My ranger is now level 16, <br/>
hunting crocs at oasis mainly, and soooo looking forward to dual <br/>
wield. I have a silvery war axe, and a gnoll hide lariat for use in <br/>
offhand (I hope the low delay will mean fast skill increases). I am <br/>
currently building my 2HS skill to max (nearly there now) with an axe <br/>
of the iron back, which I love.<br/>
<br/>
My guild is presumably called the Fremen because its founder was a <br/>
Frank Herbert fan. Anyway, the desert of Oasis seems eminently suited <br/>
to the guild, but they are all in the US, and grouping with them <br/>
means sleepless nights. For your information, the guild is very new, <br/>
mainly lower level players and very friendly and helpful where <br/>
possible. Of course, it lacks the resources of an old, high-level <br/>
guild, but I didn&#39;t join to get twinked or power-levelled anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and best wishes,<br/>
<br/>
Liz</div>
