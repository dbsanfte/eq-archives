<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi there--</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">My partner and I plan to play Horizons and 
Neverwinter Nights.&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2">UO2 looks like it will be 
a huge improvement on UO, and I am hoping that I can at least try it out.&nbsp; 
</font>Other than that, we just got involved in the Role Playing Games 
Association (RPGA) and are heavily (well, not compared to EQ =P) into Dungeons 
and Dragons (3rd edition)&nbsp;and soon Star Wars (more his thing than 
mine).&nbsp; I told him that LiveAction RolePlaying (LARP) games looked like fun 
and I might follow a group around next time we meet at the college--they meet on 
the same night as one of our campaigns and they wear black and lots of makeup 
and jewelry and stuff--pretty cool! ;)&nbsp; The nice thing about what we&#39;re 
doing right now is that we only do it once a week and about every other 
weekend--leaves plenty of time for the family, my schoolwork, and our 
careers.&nbsp; Things to consider if you are a roleplayer trying to balance your 
worlds.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">However, I have officially given up beta testing. 
Sigh.&nbsp; I just don&#39;t have time any more if I want to keep my grades up and 
continue to &quot;ramp up&quot; at work.&nbsp; I have four games under my belt that gave 
me wonderful insight into the world of debugging and what customers look for in 
a product, and it will help me in all aspects of life--I heartily recommend 
making the attempt!&nbsp; I got my start by signing up at gamespot and 
Sierra.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp; </font><font face="Arial" size="2"></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">If you DO decide to give beta testing a shot and 
are accepted, I recommend that you devote a serious amount of time to trying out 
_all_ the different aspects of the game, not just the race/clan/whatever 
combination that interests you most.&nbsp; You gain respect in the beta world by 
finding bugs and recording them and reporting them back to the developers in a 
professional and courteous manner.&nbsp; Once you establish your credibility as 
a tester with a company, they often create a pool to which you will be added for 
future games--and you will most likely have a good chance at being selected for 
first wave/alpha if it&#39;s not to be done inhouse!&nbsp; That is very 
exciting.&nbsp; Also, you can use games that you&#39;ve beta tested as &quot;references&quot; 
for other games that you are signing up to beta test.&nbsp; I will tell you that 
women do seem to have a slight edge in that we have a smaller demographic group 
and are perceived as having a different perspective.&nbsp; If you are willing to 
give FPS or RTS games a try you may find you are getting accepted more and more 
often since women are perceived as being huge RPGers and not necessarily 
combatants.&nbsp; One of my favorite games to test was a magic-duelling 
one-on-one genre... great stuff but it never really got off the ground. =(&nbsp; 
Occasionally that will happen, but don&#39;t consider it to be time wasted.&nbsp; 
You will have gained experience in many areas, including bugspotting and 
maneuvering and battle tactics.&nbsp; Anyway, there&#39;s some free advice on the 
world of beta testing so take what you want from it. =)</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>In the previous thread, noone addressed the question of 
  whether they <br>planned to play any of the upcoming online games. I don&#39;t 
  know too <br>much about them, but there seem to be some interesting ones, like 
  <br>Neverwinter Nights, which will not be massively multiplayer, but <br>allow 
  you to adventure with a few friends like AD&amp;D, or&nbsp; Shadowbane 
  <br>(sounds to PK-friendly to me) and Dark Age of Camelot. I know there 
  <br>are others, including futuristic ones. And then, of course, there is 
  <br>EQ2.<br><br>Does anyone know anything about them? Anyone in the 
  betas?<br><br>Love, Liz<br><br>aka Gyngermynx, Ranger of Tunare, 37 seasons
