&gt; My husband and I get along rather well around this game. As a matter of fact<br/>
&gt; just last night we created 2 new characters, Erudite Wizard and Enchanter,<br/>
&gt; just so we could group together more. His other character has gotten way<br/>
&gt; past me in levels to the point that I can&#39;t really group with him any<br/>
&gt; longer. He is the one that got me hooked on this game to be honest. He<br/>
&gt; bought it and I was jealous of the time he spent playing it so I bought it<br/>
&gt; and even moved my computer downstairs so we could play side by side without<br/>
&gt; having to yell up and down stiars at each other.<br/>

&gt; &gt;    Actually yes, it IS about how you deal with your other half in a gaming<br/>
&gt; &gt;situation, too, I would think. Alot of us are married to or live with someone,<br/>
&gt; &gt;and they have a significant effect on how we play.  Right now, I&#39;m in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;process of moving to the East Coast, without said SO, and the sad part is, the<br/>
&gt; &gt;fact that I&#39;m a gamer and roleplayer and he isn&#39;t has something to do with it. I<br/>
&gt; &gt;was content to try to be the perfect &quot;fit&quot; until he started standing over my<br/>
&gt; &gt;shoulder every time I got on the computer.  That was when I first realized we<br/>
&gt; &gt;had some serious problems.  I noticed that I had no RL friends anymore because I<br/>
&gt; &gt;was strongly discouraged from seeing them.  I work, and I buy groceries, and I<br/>
&gt; &gt;go home.  I didn&#39;t even realize I was being controlled until he started telling<br/>
&gt; &gt;me who I could and could not hunt with.  And this from a supposedly enlightened,<br/>
&gt; &gt;intelligent, strong-minded woman.  Sheesh. &lt;grins&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;    I don&#39;t know if anyone else has had my sort of experience or not, and I hope<br/>
&gt; &gt;you haven&#39;t.  But it IS a valid argument for discussing how we deal with our<br/>
&gt; &gt;domestic relationships.  If one woman here reads and relates to anything any of<br/>
&gt; &gt;us write, then it&#39;s all worthwhile.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; When I intruduced myself earlier I just told you about my character, but now<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; about myself. I am a 31 year old married mother of 3 all under the age of 5.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; My husband is one of my group mates and plays a female. He gets more<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; flirting and stuff than I do, which rather makes me jealous I think. (Of<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; course when his character runs around half nekkid when he dies he can&#39;t help<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; but get flirted with ya know?) When asked about my age I am honest and tell<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; them how old I am. And I have openly made a point of telling those that ask<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; that I am married because my husband is the jealous type. About the only<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; comments I have gotten so far are about the new banded mail I am wearing, it<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; is rather um...form fitting on the top. My husband does not tell others his<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; age, marital status nor his gender. Oh well that is his business and this<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; list is not about him right? :) Sorry to ramble on.<br/>
