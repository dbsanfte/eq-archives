<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475394708">I am 47, but pass for 35 easily.  I am a mother, spec. ed.<br/>
compliance monitor, computer builder/fixer/networker, substitute<br/>
teacher, nutritional consultant, editor, graphic artist and<br/>
webmistress.  (I think I forgot something!)<br/>

Don&#39;t major in computers, per se.  That&#39;s like majoring in<br/>
screwdrivers.  Pick an application for your tool.  I had<br/>
programming back in 1977 and HATED it.  Then in &#39;93, I discovered<br/>
the Internet and fell instantly in love.  A library in your house!<br/>
I started building and upgrading then.  People say that when I am<br/>
the room, computers behave.  They can sense fear and they know I<br/>
will rip their guts out!<br/>

Our propaganda machine is promising the Iraqi people that, upon<br/>
deposing Sadam, we will provide them with free universal health<br/>
care.   How can I become an Iraqi?<br/>
