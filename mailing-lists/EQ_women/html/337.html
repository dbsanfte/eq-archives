&gt;The time for the meeting has been set for Monday August 16th at 6pm PST in<br/>
&gt;East Freeport on Brell Serelis.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The meeting is an opportunity for us all to meet eachother and chat.<br/>
&gt;You can either make a newbie character just to attend the meeting, or you<br/>
&gt;can use your existing Brell Serelis character.  While Evil races are not<br/>
&gt;allowed inside East Freeport, the newbie zone is not patrolled.<br/>

to be careful who they talk to.  <br/>
