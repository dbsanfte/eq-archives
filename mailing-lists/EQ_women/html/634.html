<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, I went so far as to uninstall and cancel my 
account.&nbsp; Of course then I went and met someone who plays and wants me to 
start a character just to play and so I think I&#39;m coming back only on a VERY 
limited basis.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Face it, the game itself is boring as hell.&nbsp; 
Especially the solo game.&nbsp; Even with groups if you don&#39;t make up totally 
unbalanced groups or try mobs that are way too high for you or pull in Fear 
(that&#39;s my fave) there&#39;s no challenge.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The fun part is the people.&nbsp; And the social 
interaction.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Anyway, I probably am going to start playing again 
and when I do it will be on Tunare so I wanted to say hi.&nbsp; Because I had 
such an addiction my hours of play will be limited.&nbsp; I&#39;m really only doing 
it for a friend, not because I want to play, really.&nbsp; But I got presented 
with an RP story line I couldn&#39;t turn down *giggles*.</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>In March, I&#39;ll be playing for 2 full years.<br><br>Since 
  you&#39;ve asked, here&#39;s been my change in perspective on EQ, the good and the 
  bad:<br><br>(Disclaimer: All below is only MHO, no one has to agree with me, 
  just how I see it)<br><br>Good:<br><br>1. Lots of new, challenging zones 
  released often enough to keep me playing.<br><br>2. Grouping with friends I&#39;ve 
  known a long, long time and love hanging around with.<br><br>3. Matured 
  &quot;rules&quot; of the game. Such as random loot, &quot;play nice&quot; rules, easing up of 
  KS&#39;ing. In the early days, I never did get a BS tunic with a name like &quot;Zuki&quot; 
  and alpha loot order.<br><br>4. Less populated servers because of all the new 
  one added and splitting.<br><br>Bad:<br><br>1. The general &quot;socialness&quot; of the 
  game has taken a deep dive down. In the early days, it was fun and exciting 
  for everyone. Everyone learned stuff the hard way together. Now, it constant 
  shouts for exp. res&#39;s and sow and clarity. Very little fun chit 
  chat.<br><br>2. Greediness has risen sharply. Farming. Begging. Camping items 
  to twink a lower level character. All rampant.<br><br>3. General &quot;safety&quot; of 
  the game. Everyone knows what level creatures are in every zone. If you die, 
  get an exp. res. Maps, locs, everything&#39;s available to you. There&#39;s no more 
  exploring or serendipity to the game.<br><br>4. &quot;Lather, Rinse, Repeat&quot; aspect 
  of fighting and hunting. *Yawns*<br><br>I&#39;ve cut back sharply on how much I 
  play in the last 6 months. I cut back because the game isn&#39;t as challenging 
  anymore. There is no &quot;end&quot;. You can&#39;t win it. There&#39;s no storyline to make you 
  think and ponder and get stuck. It isn&#39;t a very mentally challenging game 
  (IMHO), so after the &quot;physical&quot; thrill has worn off, it doesn&#39;t have much to 
  offer me.<br><br>I still enjoy playing and exploring with my friends, but now 
  I&#39;m on for their company, not for the game.<br><br>Zuks<br>Cleric of 
  Tunare<br><br>---<br>Cleric OOM. <br>Please refer all healing requests to
