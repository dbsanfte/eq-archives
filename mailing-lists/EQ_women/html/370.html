The barbarian warrior/shaman combo or the Human monk/cleric sounds like two <br/>
best combos. You always want to have a healer around...you never know what <br/>
you can get yourself into when you go hunting =)<br/>
<br/>
I leveled my dark elf magician to level 22 or so with my dark elf <br/>
necromancer friend. The combo worked out well too....but having a healer and <br/>
buffs are always better =)<br/>

My partner and in game husband in four out of five of our character<br/>
pairs and boyfriend in one (the only chance I get to flirt with other<br/>
men *grin*) gets restless easily, as you can tell by the number of<br/>
character pairs we have.  We have decided five is definitely enough and<br/>
want to choose which ones to take to the next level (10 to 20).  It<br/>
takes little time to bring them up to 9 and longer through the teens.<br/>
But what we have noticed in the 20s is that it is a week or two per<br/>
level and with the amount of time invested we want to pick the<br/>
characters we like most to put that kind of time in.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we may take all of them to 20 and then decide, but right now we<br/>
need to decide for the next level, 10ish to 20ish.  We roleplay and the<br/>
stories are important, but we can always change them, we can&#39;t change<br/>
character and class.  We prefer to play together, we group when we meet<br/>
good people to group with, but there are times when we want to solo if<br/>
the other is not available.  That is the major drawback to High Elf<br/>
wizard as if root fails I&#39;m toast against even low blues.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here are our couples:<br/>
<br/>
High Elves:<br/>
     Paladin     24<br/>
     Wizard     22<br/>
<br/>
Wood Elves:<br/>
     Ranger    9<br/>
     Druid      9<br/>
<br/>
Humans:<br/>
     Monk    10<br/>
     Cleric      9<br/>
<br/>
Dark Elves:<br/>
     Necro    14<br/>
     Mage     11<br/>
<br/>
Barbarians:<br/>
     Warrior    9<br/>
     Shaman    9<br/>
<br/>
We also roleplay and the Dark Elf story is the strangest and the human<br/>
the most boring.  So, if people have their own favorites or see certain<br/>
advantages or disadvantages to the pairing, I&#39;d love to hear opinions.<br/>
Who likes to play what and why is always a subject of great interest.<br/>
And as Wizard is the only role I have experience in past the newbie<br/>
stages, I&#39;d love some advice on what makes good higher level play and<br/>
why.<br/>
