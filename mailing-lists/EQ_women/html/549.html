<div id="ygrps-yiv-824749948">Hey there... I havne&#39;t checked my em-ail in like a week and a hlf, so I had <br/>
a 134 message backlog. =( Anyhow... Some info on me. *drumroll*<br/>
<br/>
I play Gikkwiny Triseyed on the Quellious Server. I am level 23 and a <br/>
bubble, and I am a warrior. I&#39;m also one of the rarest sex/race/classes, <br/>
being a female Halfling warrior. You don&#39;t know how often I get clarity <br/>
since I&#39;m a halfling.. you would think they would notice the CRAFTED (anyone <br/>
high enough to cast clarity HSOULD know what crafted looks like.. ) and even <br/>
after inspecting me, they still cast it.. LOL...<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I am in one of the best guilds (in my opinon) in EQ... I&#39;m in Far <br/>
Dareis Mai. Everyone in our guild is female (yes, I know there are probably <br/>
guys playing girl chars, but a high majority are female). We have no real <br/>
squabbling, and we all have fun, which is the most important thing. It&#39;s <br/>
great to go into a zone and you see a guildmate, and you can always be <br/>
assured a friendly hello, or if you need help, the high levels in the guild <br/>
will do what they can.. (not to mention if they just HAPPEN to have a <br/>
crafted bracer or silvery axe around and you need them, they&#39;ll giveit to <br/>
you )=P But they are all really sweet... If you have a char on Qull and wish <br/>
to join, let me know.<br/>
<br/>
I am a master fletcher, and I would say it&#39;s worth it... IF you are a class <br/>
that can use arrows. to about a 90 skill level, it&#39;s pretty much break <br/>
even.. I think it MIGHT take 20 plat. You just keep combining the cheapest <br/>
components.. (don&#39;t worry about combinations, as long as you have an arrow <br/>
tip, fletches, a nock, and a shaft, it&#39;ll combine) but after you hit about <br/>
90, come of the components start costing 8 or 9 gold. Now, the reason why <br/>
fletching is worth being such a money sink is that with a &quot;bad&quot; skill in <br/>
archery, a longbow, and the regualr arrows you buy form mechants, I was <br/>
doing 2-5 damage with a bow, unless I critical hit. Now, with a carved <br/>
ashwood bow and Class 3 bone point arrows, I do 20 damage... so (even though <br/>
it&#39;s difficult) I can actually kite with arrows... (btw, making magical <br/>
arrows costs about 10 pp or more for just 5 arrows, so that&#39;s not goint to <br/>
happen for a LONG time. ))<br/>
<br/>
the worst thing about being a warrior is the horendous downtime, and that <br/>
you can&#39;t really solo over 20... You are conastantly dependant on others. <br/>
One of the perks, though, is watching the casters run around in cirlces with <br/>
a mob behind them going &quot;Help me! Help me!&quot; when two seconds ago they were <br/>
telling you how they could servive on their own.. =P Also, a lot of the <br/>
other classes think that melee classes should be rolling in cash since they <br/>
don&#39;t have to buy spells... well, just an FYI, but I have only had over 200 <br/>
plat ONCE. what happens is, I finally build up a moderate stash, then comes <br/>
the time to buy armor components, or jewels, or work on a trade skill, then <br/>
I&#39;m back to having only 10 p in the bank. =(<br/>
<br/>
The other thing I don&#39;t get is lately, mor and more newbies are ansking me <br/>
to twink/powerlevel them. As in regards to the twink issue, I&#39;m level 22, <br/>
and i&#39;m wearing bronze boots. I won&#39;t twink you, unless your level 10 and <br/>
still wearing cloth. There is nothing sillerier then a halfling with orange <br/>
feet. (they do not change the foot graphic for halflings when they put on <br/>
boots, they just tint the feet. That means I have bright orange feet and <br/>
dark orange nail polish).<br/>
<br/>
As for Powerleveling, I have no clue HOW a warrior is supposed to PL <br/>
someone.. I can&#39;t heal, I can&#39;t buff, all I could possibly do is make sure <br/>
you won&#39;t die, but that&#39;s a guard service, not PLing... *sighs* Ah, well... <br/>
I&#39;m done ranting now... Talk to you all later!<br/>
