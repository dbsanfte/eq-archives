<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285960999">Greetings and Salutations ladies,<br/>
<br/>
I am Rosepetal a lvl 17 elven druid who plays on the Castle Lightwolf <br/>
server in the new PS2 Evercrack Online Adventures. Does anyone here <br/>
play this version, and is on the same server as me? I think its great <br/>
that we women have a forum for our EQ addiction. I used to play PC <br/>
version, but got bored, and pissed off when all my friends had no <br/>
life and would level way above me, always causing me to find new <br/>
people to group with. I am curretly an Elder of the Arcane Blades <br/>
guild. Should anyone here play this game, I would love to meet up <br/>
with you in game. I am 27/f(of course)/Canada,BC. So hopefully I am <br/>
not alone in this. :)<br/>
God bless and God speed,<br/>
Rose</div>
