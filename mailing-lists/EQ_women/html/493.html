 </span></blockquote>I like my characters to have 1 or 2 faults or traits that are specific to them. It makes them individuals to me, and after awhile, people start to *know* that character. For example, my bard absolutely adores barbarians and is easily distracted by the mention of alcohol in any form. Anyone that&#39;s hung out with her for a few nights groans aloud when any of these two things are nearby.<br/>

My cleric, OTOH, could not care less about any male, but is more the mothering, nurturing type--unless you threaten or mock dwarves (her race), then she&#39;d as soon cut yer knees out then toss a bandage yer way (her words exactly)<br/>
