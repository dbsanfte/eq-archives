<div id="ygrps-yiv-718067126">Hi everyone, I&#39;m the list moderator, and I thought it was only appropriate that I introduce myself and my characters as well.<br/>
<br/>
My first character is Inora a dark elf necromancer.  She had a lot of problems making cash, and found it difficult to solo past 18th.  I eventually put her asside temporarily, so a magician friend could level to adventure with her.  They will start adventuring again very soon.  I found Necromancers to be a very fun class to play, and they are very good at soloing.  It is difficult being a dark elf necromancer though, because so many NPCs want to kill you! <br/>
<br/>
My second character is Iuna, a wood elf druid.  I&#39;ve found druids to be really fun--they have an interesting mix of magic.  My druid is currently 20th level.  I think she will be my favorite character for some time.<br/>
<br/>
My third character is Svarta. a dwarven paladin.  She groups with a couple of my friends.  I find taking a little dull sometimes though.  She&#39;s very much a group oriented character.  The rest of the group consists of a bard and a wizard.<br/>
<br/>
In real life I&#39;m a 26 year old Canadian who works as a software programmer.  I&#39;ve been playing role playing games, and computer games, since I was twelve or so.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m happy that so many people have joined this list, and that so much great chatting has been going on.<br/>
