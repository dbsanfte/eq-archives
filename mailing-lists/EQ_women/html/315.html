<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004440500">It is so interesting to read one another&#39;s experiences.  We are starting to talk a bit more<br/>
about RL, he has a Golden Retriever, lives in VA, etc.  He knows I am a CS and AI is my hobby<br/>
(I explained I had learned why he runs around in circles and then disappers and his brain<br/>
went into overdrive *smile*).  I suspect he may be a student as he doesn&#39;t have &quot;regular&quot;<br/>
work hours, but then I&#39;m &quot;on the beach&quot; at work since the recent take-over obsoleted my<br/>
technology so one never really knows *smile*.   I did make my first reference to &quot;our&quot; when<br/>
discussing missing my dog (OES, she died 2 mos. ago) and he didn&#39;t cringe outwardly.  Didn&#39;t<br/>
comment either so it could have gone right over his head.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I&#39;m neurotic.  I&#39;m afraid if he finds out I&#39;m a married mother of 2 he might lose<br/>
interest and he is the most fun part of the game.  *sigh*  This is worse then RL.  Oh, and as<br/>
for the toilets, I noticed their lack when I got drunk and needed to throw up.  There was no<br/>
place to puke!  Very embarassing.  And as my aclohol level is 3, the wedding party itself may<br/>
be a disaster.<br/>
<br/>
The honeymoon will definitely be PG.  I sort of view this is my equivalent to the romance<br/>
novel *grin*.<br/>

P.S.  The wedding is Sunday, Aug. 7 at the Temple of Marr (outside) in N. Freeport on the<br/>
Quellious Server.  5 PM Pacific, 6 PM Mountain, 7 PM Central, and 8 PM Eastern.<br/>
<br/>
P.P.S.  When we roleplay we do it in talk rather than say - but our /ems have been known to<br/>
produce a lot of puking and &quot;Get a room&quot; comments from those around us *smile*<br/>

&gt; You bring up a bridge that I know I will have to cross eventually as well.  My character,<br/>
&gt; Wynsong, is very serious about a high elf named Rezok on Fenin Ro.  OOC, I know very<br/>
&gt; little about the person behind the character save that he&#39;s male, a few years younger<br/>
&gt; than me, and married (his r/l wife plays a character that is like a big sister to<br/>
&gt; Wynsong).  Because I&#39;m very happily married in r/l, very soon into the rp &quot;relationship&quot;<br/>
&gt; I set some expectations that the relationship was rp-only ... which his response was &quot;of<br/>
&gt; course&quot;  (what a relief that was).  I felt stupid bringing it up at all, but after some<br/>
&gt; experiences in Realm where ppl wanted the char&#39;s relationship to spill over to the<br/>
&gt; players, I learned to speak up front to avoid sticky situations later.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for the honeymoon ... you can rp that any way you wish.  It depends upon what &quot;rating&quot;<br/>
&gt; &lt;g&gt; you want that portion of the rp to be.  It can simply be the two of you &quot;retire&quot; to<br/>
&gt; the honeymoon suite and then chat about the weather while everyone accepts that it&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; wedding night.  You could decide to go on a trip to a &quot;romantic&quot; spot in Norrath and<br/>
&gt; hunt, explore, etc.  Or if you wish, you could take the roleplay further ....   To me,<br/>
&gt; the roleplaying is about how the character(s) is perceived in Norrath.  So that doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; mean I have to roleplay every single detail.  Heck, we don&#39;t roleplay going to the<br/>
&gt; bathroom or showering or any of the hundreds of mundane (or not so mundane) personal<br/>
&gt; things we do irl.  Personally, my honeymoon will probably be rated pg to pg-13 &lt;g&gt; ...<br/>
&gt; Disney would prolly be able to put it in one of their movies, lol.  But the concept of<br/>
&gt; honeymoon will be there<br/>
&gt; for everyone (us, friends, &quot;family&quot;) ... and that&#39;s the important part.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As a side note ... I did have a marriage on Realm and while the characters were<br/>
&gt; roleplaying their &quot;true love&quot; for the world ... the other player and I would be /t&#39;ing<br/>
&gt; each other chatting about all kinds of &lt;ic&gt; and &lt;ooc&gt; stuff.  When it came time for the<br/>
&gt; honeymoon, we retired to the bedroom while our friends partied in the next room ... and<br/>
&gt; just joked around and chatted some more.  For the role play, we had gone to the marriage<br/>
&gt; bed ... for us, the players, we had not crossed any lines that would complicate our<br/>
&gt; personal r/l relationships.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok, well I&#39;ve rambled enough.  Thanks for putting up with it as I thought through my own<br/>
&gt; eventual situation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hey, btw ... I lost the date, time and place (and server) for your wedding. :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; As my character is marrying on Sunday I must confess to a few minor qualms.  In<br/>
&gt; &gt; particular, er, how does one roleplay a honeymoon *smile*.  Unlike many who<br/>
&gt; &gt; develop relationships in Norrath, my beloved and I are unknown to one another in<br/>
&gt; &gt; RL.  For all I know he weighs 300 pounds, guzzles beer, and is hygenically<br/>
&gt; &gt; challenged *smile*<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There are times if I wonder if this is a positive thing to be doing.  I mean,<br/>
&gt; &gt; what if he is some starry eyed adolescent and I ruin him for life *grin*.  I know<br/>
&gt; &gt; MY lines are clearly drawn in fuzz (okay, I think I know the difference between<br/>
&gt; &gt; reality and fantasy though I swear I saw a Pixie Trickster in the airport the<br/>
&gt; &gt; other day *grin*).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, this is all fun and games and I am having fun.  But there is this part in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the back of my mind that wonders.  Because unlike reading romance novels (blech -<br/>
&gt; &gt; persish the thought) there is another person involved in my little fantasy and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; must never forget that.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Any other hard core role players out there struggle with these ridiculous<br/>
&gt; &gt; issues?  Any other players over the age of 25, for that matter *smile*<br/>
