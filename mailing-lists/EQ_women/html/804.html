&lt;&lt; Basicly it&#39;s up to you to decide what is and is not<br/>
acceptable in how you interact with people in the<br/>
game. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, of course.<br/>
:o)<br/>
As my subject said I was only rambling a bit though.<br/>
I&#39;m afraid I tend to do that a lot.<br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; You can create your own emotes in the following<br/>
way: /me slaps Joewoodelf That will make the game say<br/>
Brangvyne slaps Joewoodelf &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ah, cool, I knew you could create your own emotes, but<br/>
didn&#39;t know how to set that up exactly.<br/>
:o)<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt; There are no easy answers to personal interactions,<br/>
you need to figure that stuff out yourself. My advice<br/>
is have fun and try to not unnecessarily hurt people&#39;s<br/>
feelings, while at the same time ensuring people<br/>
respect your boundaries. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, your right of course. As I said just chatting<br/>
more than anything. I am having fun, otherwise I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be playing the game or here talking about it,<br/>
but I am aware that I tend to run on sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
:o)<br/>

PS - If I&#39;m &quot;chatting&quot; to much, or anything I say<br/>
bothers anyone, or is just out of line or topic or<br/>
whatever for the list someone is welcome to just tell<br/>
me to shut up. I sometimes get carried away but I&#39;m<br/>
not offended if someone says enough already.<br/>
