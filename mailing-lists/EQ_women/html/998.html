<br/>
I&#39;m like that in some ways. I&#39;ll get spells where I do<br/>
a lot of trade skill stuff and spells where I don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Not long ago I made a Vah Shir bard and I&#39;ve been<br/>
having fun playing her now too. Not so much spells but<br/>
been doing quests with her. Something I never did much<br/>
with my other toons except for the shawl quest for my<br/>
cleric which I am still working on by the way.<br/>

&gt; start her shawls.  She was ally with giants for a<br/>
&gt; long time while my guild was hunting in Ntov (kael<br/>
&gt; armor).  Two ring wars later and a bunch of dead<br/>
&gt; giants I think I am ready to begin serious trade<br/>
&gt; skilling for that shawl.  :)   <br/>

&gt; Baking has always been my favourite of all the<br/>
&gt; trades.  Its fairly easy, a lot of the components<br/>
&gt; for the great stat food come from some wonderful exp<br/>
&gt; spots, and the food you can make is very beneficial!<br/>
&gt;  I haven&#39;t tried smithing but www.eqtraders.com may<br/>
&gt; be a spot to look if you haven&#39;t heard of that<br/>
&gt; website!<br/>

&gt; Salutations!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We used to talk about adopting a lot but we just<br/>
&gt; kept<br/>
&gt; having more kids instead, so we adopted them.<br/>
&gt; :o)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have no time management skills. Nothing ever gets<br/>
&gt; done on time or properly. I figure as long as it<br/>
&gt; eventually happens it successful.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Congratulations on 62. As someone who recently hit<br/>
&gt; 62<br/>
&gt; myself we seem to be taking the same road. Last<br/>
&gt; night<br/>
&gt; I took my 21% into 62 and my 65 ranger hubby and<br/>
&gt; went<br/>
&gt; to HoH. Why HoH instead of BoT. Well simple. He can<br/>
&gt; solo there bow kiting the mobs till they die. It&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; bit slow but I keep him healed and toss in a few<br/>
&gt; 1100<br/>
&gt; point nukes to speed the process and its not bad at<br/>
&gt; all. The two of us were killing mobs with between<br/>
&gt; 30K<br/>
&gt; and 75K hp. So my recipie now is BoT if I can get a<br/>
&gt; good group, HoH if I&#39;m duoing, and trade skills etc.<br/>
&gt; when I&#39;m alone. Working out pretty good.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Finished my fourth coldain shawl yesterday, but I<br/>
&gt; need<br/>
&gt; to get my tailoring up some more before I try that<br/>
&gt; 5th<br/>
&gt; one. Only 101, and although I know it trivs at 115 I<br/>
&gt; think I&#39;m going to triv Wu&#39;s armor at 158 before I<br/>
&gt; make the attempt. After all it will need to be<br/>
&gt; higher<br/>
&gt; later anyway, so might as well get it on up now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do we have any others who like to do that trade<br/>
&gt; stuff<br/>
&gt; on the list. I do it a lot when it&#39;s slow. Just work<br/>
&gt; on this or that to pass the time. I like the easy<br/>
&gt; recipies though even if they cost me more. After all<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s not hard to make a few thousand plat if I<br/>
&gt; really<br/>
&gt; need to. And along that line, does anyone know a<br/>
&gt; simple smithing recipie to use from 88. I just made<br/>
&gt; shields till 88. It was easy and all the parts could<br/>
&gt; be gotten in one convient spot. Now I&#39;m looking for<br/>
&gt; something simple. But baking is the easiest to raise<br/>
&gt; if you&#39;re bored and don&#39;t mind sitting around for a<br/>
&gt; while. Fish cakes to 135 (a hearty meal), I caught<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; fish and bought the bat wings. Storm salmon to 202<br/>
&gt; (stat food) but I&#39;m forgetting what I have to put<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; it. That&#39;s a lot of fish I&#39;ll tell you though. Again<br/>
&gt; you just have to have the patience for the fishing<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; PoS. Anyway just my cooking tip of the day.<br/>
&gt; :oP<br/>
