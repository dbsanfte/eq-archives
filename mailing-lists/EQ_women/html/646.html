<div id="ygrps-yiv-687336077">I really don&#39;t know very much except what 2 of my friends have told me after joining and leaving The Sisterhood.<br/>
<br/>
One left because of political strife within the guild. I think this happens to every guild at one point, though, so it isn&#39;t a negative thing necessarily. My own guild went through some major political strife over the summer, but it came out much the better for it in the long run.<br/>
<br/>
The other left because she felt the guild got very big and she didn&#39;t know most of the people in it anymore. Again, a personal issue, I think. Some like big guilds, some small. <br/>
<br/>
As far as my personal experience with The Sisterhood goes, I found them to be polite, helpful, kind, brave, exemplary players. <br/>
