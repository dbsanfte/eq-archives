<div id="ygrps-yiv-1829492408">People hooking up through EQ...<br/>
<br/>
I knew one woman that I used to talk to about 2 years ago. I was just <br/>
happy that there were females that played EQ... ROFL! Anyways she met <br/>
a guy in another country after her divorce. He came out to visit with <br/>
her. He was there for about a month. They played EQ, she went to <br/>
work, and they started a romance. She ended up pregnant. She moved to <br/>
his country, than back to the USA, had the child. They no longer play <br/>
EQ but have a family here now.<br/>
<br/>
I knew another women who found a husband through EQ. They happen to <br/>
live close to each other, hooked up, married, and no longer play EQ.<br/>
<br/>
I recently heard from a male friend that came back to EQ after a year <br/>
off. He was looking for cheap entertainment for him and his wife so <br/>
they went back to EQ. She&#39;s now divorcing him for another man she met <br/>
through EQ. <br/>
<br/>
Do any of you have any stories? I heard on a message board once from <br/>
one guy about how his GF left him because he was addicted to EQ. <br/>
Gross story though.<br/>
