<b>Subject:</b> Race Wars Server <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-967963185">They&#39;re testing the code for the race wars server now on the test server.  I&#39;m wondering how people think it will be?  I was kind of interested in race wars, since is was an unusual form of PvP.  I&#39;ve never really been interested in killing other players, but having the possibility available changes the dynamic of the game, and that is interesting.  <br/>
<br/>
However, I&#39;m worried based on what I&#39;ve heard on the test server that race wars is just going to be a bloodbath.  The fact that you can&#39;t kill your own team is perhaps giving people the extra motivation to kill people on other teams for no reason other than the fact that they can.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have any thoughts on this one?<br/>
