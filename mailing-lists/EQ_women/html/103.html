<div id="ygrps-yiv-687534872">This is a very good point.. I have done that much.. I hunt with someone so<br/>
when we start new characters together then we have the other one pass along<br/>
some coins to at least get starting spells.. I didn&#39;t even realize GM&#39;s<br/>
would give you a &quot;leg up&quot; kit, it&#39;s shocking actually.  We do good to get<br/>
GM&#39;s to answer us.. I did get to talk to a programmer once though.. he&#39;s in<br/>
charge of the design of the spells..  He showed up on Erud&#39;s Crossing when I<br/>
was there alone.. I thought I saw someone then did a /who and I was the only<br/>
one there so I went to investigate of course, after asking him he told me he<br/>
was testing out new spells..I didn&#39;t actually get to see those or anything..<br/>
we did talk about several things though. I was surprised he did stay to talk<br/>
to me for a several minutes.. among other things was how you have to med<br/>
with that dratted book open.. I did get my 2 copper worth in about that.. he<br/>
said at least it was better than beta where you couldn&#39;t even chat when<br/>
medding.. that it stayed that way until a few other programmers decided to<br/>
play spell casters and they didn&#39;t like it.. he did say the meditate button<br/>
would be obsolete at some point and would just auto kick on when you open<br/>
the book, which is good for blondes like me who sometimes sit to med and<br/>
then run off to do something in the house real quick (gotta get that stuff<br/>
done at some point ladies.. hehe) and come back to find I forgot to push<br/>
that darn button.. hehe..<br/>
<br/>
Another thing we did talk about was the friend list, I commented that I&#39;ve<br/>
made many friends in test that I hunt with at certain areas and like to keep<br/>
in touch and find out where they are to see if I can find a group if my<br/>
partner isn&#39;t with me.  I have to sometimes remove someone to put a new<br/>
friend on cause of the 20 limit.. he said yes it was something he wanted<br/>
changed.. and even asked how many I thought would be enough for me.. I said<br/>
at LEAST 2x as big if not more and he agreed.. hopefully that&#39;ll change at<br/>
some point.  This guy had a some great stuff on.. when I asked about where<br/>
to get that sorta thing he said I couldn&#39;t.. that it was things he&#39;d made<br/>
himself to test out.. must be nice to be able to do that.. All in all it was<br/>
a good chat and I was grateful he took the time to explain some things to me<br/>
about why things do what they do in the game.<br/>
<br/>
This list is GREAT by the way.. so good to talk to fellow lady EQ&#39;ers!<br/>

P.S.  What someone said (either this list or the other..) about it being<br/>
hard to role play on test is quite true because of there being fewer players<br/>
there.  I don&#39;t mind one bit though, I just enjoy meeting other people,<br/>
learning how their characters do what they do (never know when I&#39;ll wanna<br/>
try one of them) and just have fun in the game =)<br/>
