<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364515847">The accepted way is to ask in a zone using the ooc or auction channels. <br/>
Also watch for other people auctioning that they want to sell jewlery.  <br/>
Enchanters level 16+ are most commonly jewlers as they get spells that <br/>
allow them to make magic jewlery.<br/>
