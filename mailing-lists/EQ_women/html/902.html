<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-710682505">Thank you!  I made 45 and 3/5ths last night.  Was hoping the family<br/>
would be more cooperative in my playing today, but no.  And the<br/>
thunderstorms keep disconnecting our server&#39;s modem.  I get new<br/>
spells at 46.  You should come by Burning Woods and PL me sometime!<br/>
 :-)<br/>
<br/>
Got irritated today.  A groupie complained about me talking too<br/>
much.  I was not talking a lot.<br/>
