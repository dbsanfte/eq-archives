However, I&#39;m in a<br/>\ngreat guild because we are not just a guild, we are a<br/>\nfamily. We are small, about 30 members with about 45<br/>\ncharacters. In order to get in our family the entire<br/>\nfamily votes and then the new person is adopted in<br/>\nduring a ceremony. It really is wonderful. We all have<br/>\nthe same last name as well and are recognized server<br/>\nwide. Our charter is dedication to family, love,<br/>\nhonor, and loyalty and we go out of our way to help<br/>\nothers in need. I have many wonderful brothers and<br/>\nsisters and have an adopted daughter as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nLilyana Stormseeker<br/>\nLevel 45 Paladin<br/>\nKarana Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Zuki Vekk &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zuki@...\">zuki@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve been playing EQ for a year and a half now, and<br/>\n&gt; one thing that I&#39;ve come to believe is that the<br/>\n&gt; quality of guilds has definitely gone down hill.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve always thought of a guild as a group of<br/>\n&gt; friends, people that want to play together, or chat<br/>\n&gt; or hang out. Just recently, I was on as a newbie<br/>\n&gt; character I have and someone I didn&#39;t know just<br/>\n&gt; walked up to her and invited her into a guild. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d love to join a small guild that everyone is<br/>\n&gt; friendly, that people get together for fun once in a<br/>\n&gt; while, no matter what their levels. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So what do you all think, have guilds changed from<br/>\n&gt; what they once were?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Zuki<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 29 cleric of Tunare and one damn proud dwarf!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Angelfire for your free web-based e-mail.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.angelfire.com\">http://www.angelfire.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet Yahoo!
