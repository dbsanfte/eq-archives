I was also looking at Beurocrat,<br/>\nbut it would HAVE to be OT I think.  Still, looked like some interesting<br/>\nplaying possibilities.  I think right now I just need to level up enough to<br/>\nget out of the backyard.<br/>\n<br/>\nI rebuilt my Fixer last night and put her on RK1 and saved my IP points having<br/>\nread more of the guides.  She kicks some serious ass at level 2 *giggles*.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen I switched to EQ because I wanted to do &quot;just one thing&quot; with my<br/>\nEnchanter and ended up levelling to 5 and wandering over to &quot;just start&quot; my<br/>\ncleric (since my enchanter will rapidly outlevel my son&#39;s warrior, I figured<br/>\nI&#39;d have a cleric for him to group with - help him out).  And OF COURSE a<br/>\nlovely Druid wandered by and gave me SOW and SLS and a damage buff so I just<br/>\nHAD to go into the Commons and play.  She&#39;s 3 now :-)  ANd I haven&#39;t bought a<br/>\nsingle spell yet (LOL).  GOing to bed at 2 AM just isn&#39;t as much fun at my age<br/>\nwhen I know I&#39;ll be dead by 2 PM today :-(  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut what was interesting to me was as I had to mem and run more than once with<br/>\nmy chanter, I suddenly thought &quot;Yeah, I could live without CR&quot; though I do<br/>\nhave some awfully fond memories of having to put together CR teams for<br/>\nguildmates.  OR the one night I was camping Cindreela and inadvertently backed<br/>\ninto Fear - boy was THAT ever an adrenaline rush; the zone was EMPTY and I had<br/>\ngroup teleport up and it took forever to cast and I was petrified.  By the<br/>\ntime I gated out SR was already putting together a rescue team :-)  They liked<br/>\nme back then and, yes, Loonah, less baggage on a new server.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I do wonder if the lack of loss on death doesn&#39;t take away some of the<br/>\nmore interesting aspects of the game while, at the same time, also releiving<br/>\nsome nasty drudgery.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm.... adrenaline rush followed by 2 hours in Chat while the monks and<br/>\nclerics do CR vs. no adrenaline rush, wait at a terminal and pick up my stuff.<br/>\n Difficult choices *giggles*<br/>\n<br/>\nIce<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Lora Roa&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:loraroa@...\">loraroa@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; --------------------------------------------- <br/>\n&gt;\tAttachment:´┐¢ <br/>\n&gt;\tMIME Type:´┐¢multipart/alternative <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------- <br/>\n </span></blockquote>OK first a list of general points:<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, first there is no exp penalty in AO. :) So you just play what you like.<br/>\nSecond, the IP system.  Very unforgiving!  I&#39;d buy the Sybex Guide (just for<br/>\nskill caps and the skill per class clst table).<br/>\nThird, a few classes end up running into the the major remaining bugs.<br/>\nThe most broken features right now are - pets, crowd-control,<br/>\ncaster-to-melee balance (skewed toward melee now),tradeskills and debuffs<br/>\n(very ineffective esp. against mobs).  I&#39;d avoid playing a class heavily<br/>\ndependend on most things in that list while you learn the game (until they<br/>\npatch a few more times).<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, from what you said I think you&#39;d really like an adventurer!  I&#39;d go with<br/>\nSolitus (or Atrox if you want to be huge, funny and tank more than heal).<br/>\nAdventurers are the second best team healers in the game, they can tank (tho<br/>\nonly slightly better than a druid), going with melee weapons as main attack<br/>\nis very viable and they have the second best speed buffs in the game.  They<br/>\nget &quot;morphs&quot; where you can change your self into leets, reets and later huge<br/>\ntwo-headed wolves!  They also have more flexible IP costs so they are more<br/>\nbeginner &quot;friendly&quot; than a few other classes.  I have played them - they can<br/>\nbe really fun (and I am an ex-Bard, ex-Main Tank Warrior, ex-Rogue and<br/>\nex-Enchanter).  They solo well and are welcome in groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nFixers can be fun, they do have the best speed buffs (and later get<br/>\ndruid-like evacs) but they are very one dimensional in combat.  They have<br/>\nonly one good weapon (the Mausser) - it takes SMG and Burst skills (can&#39;t<br/>\nuse two so don&#39;t train multi).  So you speed buff, then shoot with your SMG<br/>\nand heal only if Doc, Adventurer or Martial Artist aren&#39;t covering the job<br/>\n(unlikely).  Also solo or group well.<br/>\n<br/>\nMartial Artist is something you may consider.  They also can travel fast,<br/>\nand have very nice healing spells.  They are much more &quot;spell&quot; oriented than<br/>\nmonks in EQ.  They also move fast, heal and can tank.  Solo or group well<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nDocs are fun to level 50 or so, but only the dedicated &quot;must be healer&quot;<br/>\ntypes stick it out past then.  They have little combat effectiveness<br/>\n(Martial Arts seems to be the best choice and then only if you aren&#39;t Nano<br/>\nbreed).  Group well, miserable to solo after 30.  Some groups used to EQ<br/>\nClerics will try to insist you not fight.  Healing also has *insane* aggro<br/>\nright now - so expect a doc to die often as they are the weakest at<br/>\ndefending themselves when aggroed.  And taunting both doesn&#39;t work well and<br/>\nmany tanks are not from EQ and don&#39;t know how or haven&#39;t trained the skill!<br/>\n:(  Group lives, doc dies, group loves doc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you&#39;re right the RP potential of a neutral MetaP is huge!  MetaP&#39;s are<br/>\nalso the class that will run head first into the most bugs.  Neutrals are<br/>\nthe side that will run head first into the most bugs! Aaaaaaa.  Yes - total<br/>\nbitch.  Get the feel of the game on a class they have working first (or<br/>\nsoundproof the area by your computer, wrap nearby breakables, etc).  MetaP<br/>\nand Trader are two classes that have interested me since beta - but I just<br/>\ncan&#39;t handle either as my main .. yet :(  As well, I expecting Funcom to<br/>\nannounce moderate changes to the MP class in the next 2-3 weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve moved back to mainly RK2. The Euro release *should* populate that<br/>\nserver and my guild there has a few Euros that play during my daytime (I<br/>\nplay when kids in school so that works for me).  Will send you tells today<br/>\non RK2, probably from Dimwit2 (petitioning to get the 2 removed) my Atrox<br/>\nEnforcer and Metalrose my Engineer (trying out an odd template with her).<br/>\n<br/>\n- Lora / Hechicera on boards<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn reply to:<br/>\n<br/>\nOOh OOOh... okay, I made a fixer on Rubi-Ka 2 but was surprised there were<br/>\nnever any other players on.  She&#39;s only 2 and I&#39;m sure I screwed everything<br/>\nup<br/>\nso I&#39;ll probably restart her.  Clan, name Iceiallana (surprise there :-).  I<br/>\ntried a Doctor on Rubi-Ka 1 last night, Omni-Tek Nano-human thingy.  Died in<br/>\nmy first mission but still figuring it out (think I got the program thingies<br/>\ndown, but I right clicked something in my inventory by accident and it went<br/>\naway so I&#39;ll probably restart her too.  Her name is Caedusia (favorite<br/>\ncleric<br/>\nname).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo those were my guesses based on EQ.  I played a tanking druid, much to the<br/>\namusement of all my friends :-)  I did love ranger when I started one, but<br/>\nhated the exp. penalty.  Enjoy cleric and bard.  I really like the speed and<br/>\nhealing buffs, but I get bored if I just do the sit/med thing while the<br/>\ntanks<br/>\nare having all the fun pulling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuggestions?  From reading the boards I thought eventually I&#39;d play a<br/>\nmeta-nanophysicist neutral.  Looks like that will be a total bitch to play,<br/>\nthough, but what great RP :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet free email and a permanent address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amexmail.com/?A=1\">http://www.amexmail.com/?A=1</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
