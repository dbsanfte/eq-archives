The funny thing is, I&#39;m older than<br/>\nmost of them IRL....heh.  I DID have a very amusing night when I was in Qeynos.  There was a lot of /ooc going on with these two guys getting drunk.  They spent over 50<br/>\nplat on booze.  Well, one of them decides he needs to get married.  Apparently he did a /who on the zone, and got me.  So, in /ooc, he starts proposing.  I shoot him<br/>\ndown.  He offers a ring.  I tell him he&#39;s a filthy human and not for the likes of me.  He offers to stay home with the kids.  I shoot him down again.  By this time, half<br/>\nof the zone is in /ooc taking bets and making jokes and cheering him on and egging me on and well.......it was great fun, he sent me a /tell later thanking me for<br/>\nplaying along, and I have a new friend.  By the way, he DID get married in game later on that month.........lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nSara, Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:truffle@...\">truffle@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:truffle@...\">truffle@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When I went on to everquest I was concerned that there<br/>\n&gt; might be a lot of flirting, and that it might get out<br/>\n&gt; of hand.  I accordingly played my character with a<br/>\n&gt; cold exterior (not hard for a dark elf necromancer).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve come to warm up to flirting a bit, though I<br/>\n&gt; still don&#39;t do it very much.  I&#39;ve generally found that most guys are fairly polite, or at worst a bit boisterous.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My wood elf druid gets hit on more than my other<br/>\n&gt; characters.  My dwarven paladin is hit on very consistently by dwarves (but not other races).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve made lots of friends throughout Mithanial Marr, but I&#39;m hoping as well to join a decent guild at some point, for the increased socialization, and group hunting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Christina<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Get free personalized email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.iname.com\">http://www.iname.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
