It&#39;s a pretty cool<br/>\nranger only sword, that procs a root that does some damage.  It&#39;s<br/>\nconsidered a good low level ranger weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nAround 30-40 level many prefer switching to an Electrum Bladed Wakizatci<br/>\n(or two).  This sword has a better damage ratio, and is very light and<br/>\nfast.  This is the one you need the fangs for.<br/>\n<br/>\nAround level 40-50 most rangers try and pick up Yakeshas and a flowing<br/>\nblack silk sash.  Yakesha is a very popular weapon, with the same ratio as<br/>\nthe EBW and a nice 75 point damage proc.  EBWs are IMHO almost as good<br/>\nhowever, and you&#39;re fine with a pair of those at 50.<br/>\n<br/>\nA good two handed sword will have better damage output than dual wielding<br/>\nup to around level 35 or so.  It depends on your weapons though.  Some<br/>\ngood two handed ranger weapons are:<br/>\n   - Axe of the iron black (Found commonly in Kunark, sold for a couple<br/>\nhundred plat I believe.  This puppy really owns, it is good to 40th level<br/>\nfor sure. Pick one up.)<br/>\n   - Shiny Brass Halberds (SBH) and Blackened Iron Bastard Swords (BIBS)<br/>\nare good up to level 30 or so.<br/>\n   - I&#39;m not really up to date on all the crazy Kunark weapons, I know<br/>\nthere are a lot of powerful ones around now<br/>\n<br/>\nPixy, level 52 Ranger (Retired), Brell Serilis<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, 19 Oct 2000, Suzanne J.

I took two accelerated courses this summer and that really kicked my butt, which made it aLOT easier to say goodbye.  Also, Verant had upset me personally over my account (which I&#39;d had since March of &#39;99, without EVER missing a payment, thank you very much), and there was the whole fact that Celedhros and I were finding that our battle plans were starting to take on the complexity of a good Othello match. &lt;grin&gt;  Two rangers can be VERY effective, if the rangers in question are very, very careful...  anyway, it was all getting to be a bit much, and school comes first. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ebony blade... wow... that&#39;s the one we collected the fangs for, right?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Aelwesara C´┐¢thalion, formerly of Povar<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;   From: Judy Tyrer <br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@egroups.com\">EQ_women@egroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Thursday, October 19, 2000 4:06 PM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [EQ_women] Hello everyone<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I remember you!  I have played through a bizillion alts in my lifetime (sigh).  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Anyway, the good news about rangers is how bad the rep is.  I play a ranger on TP, the new server.  At 12 I got an Ebony Blade because I was the only ranger anyone in the group knew.  Another one went up on the boards because no one in that group knew any rangers ;-)  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I play, when possible which it hasn&#39;t been in forever, with a now 55 ranger on Brell (sylvanar, I play Iceiallana, a 54 druid).  He has no trouble getting groups anymore.  A lot of the flack is over and it has turned into a huge joke.   I get some grief for being a ranger, but there are only 22 of us on the new server (giggles) and since casters outnumber tanks 3:1 now, anyone who can tank is wanted for groups.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   As for kicking the habit, congratulatoins.
