;)&nbsp; The nice \n  thing about what we&#39;re doing right now is that we only do it once a week and \n  about every other weekend--leaves plenty of time for the family, my \n  schoolwork, and our careers.&nbsp; Things to consider if you are a roleplayer \n  trying to balance your worlds.</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">However, I have officially given up beta testing. \n  Sigh.&nbsp; I just don&#39;t have time any more if I want to keep my grades up and \n  continue to &quot;ramp up&quot; at work.&nbsp; I have four games under my belt that gave \n  me wonderful insight into the world of debugging and what customers look for \n  in a product, and it will help me in all aspects of life--I heartily recommend \n  making the attempt!&nbsp; I got my start by signing up at gamespot and \n  Sierra.</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">&nbsp; </font><font face=\"Arial\"\n size=\"2\"></font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">If you DO decide to give beta testing a shot and \n  are accepted, I recommend that you devote a serious amount of time to trying \n  out _all_ the different aspects of the game, not just the race/clan/whatever \n  combination that interests you most.&nbsp; You gain respect in the beta world \n  by finding bugs and recording them and reporting them back to the developers \n  in a professional and courteous manner.&nbsp; Once you establish your \n  credibility as a tester with a company, they often create a pool to which you \n  will be added for future games--and you will most likely have a good chance at \n  being selected for first wave/alpha if it&#39;s not to be done inhouse!&nbsp; That \n  is very exciting.&nbsp; Also, you can use games that you&#39;ve beta tested as \n  &quot;references&quot; for other games that you are signing up to beta test.&nbsp; I \n  will tell you that women do seem to have a slight edge in that we have a \n  smaller demographic group and are perceived as having a different \n  perspective.&nbsp; If you are willing to give FPS or RTS games a try you may \n  find you are getting accepted more and more often since women are perceived as \n  being huge RPGers and not necessarily combatants.&nbsp; One of my favorite \n  games to test was a magic-duelling one-on-one genre... great stuff but it \n  never really got off the ground. =(&nbsp; Occasionally that will happen, but \n  don&#39;t consider it to be time wasted.&nbsp; You will have gained experience in \n  many areas, including bugspotting and maneuvering and battle tactics.&nbsp; \n  Anyway, there&#39;s some free advice on the world of beta testing so take what you \n  want from it. =)</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Hope everyone is enjoying good health and \n  fulfilling guildship,</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Aelwesara C├╗thalion</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Ranger of UO and EQ</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">and bard and druid of D&amp;D</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n  <blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\">\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@yahoogroups.com\"\n title=\"EQ_women@yahoogroups.com\">EQ_women@yahoogroups.com</a> ; <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@yahoogroups.com\"\n title=\"EQ_women@yahoogroups.com\">EQ_women@yahoogroups.com</a> </div>\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Friday, February 09, 2001 6:19 \n    AM</div>\n    <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> [EQ_women] EQ2, or perhaps \n    not....</div>\n    <div><br></div><tt>In the previous thread, noone addressed the question of \n    whether they <br>planned to play any of the upcoming online games.
