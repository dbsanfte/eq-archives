I<br/>\ncreated it because I noticed that Everquest was a boy-dominated game and I<br/>\nthought it would be cool to create a list for women who play Everquest to<br/>\nchat with eachother.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, this list is pretty quiet, though we do have 75 members.  So, my<br/>\nquestion is, how can this list better serve the needs of its members?<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to hear everyone&#39;s ideas.  What would you like to see on this<br/>\nlist? How can this list better serve your needs?<br/>\n<br/>\nTina (Brell Serilis)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
