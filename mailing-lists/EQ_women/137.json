As he progressed in levels<br/>\nhe started to experience exactly what you described.   By level 16 he was<br/>\nburnt out.  Now we are on the Test Server and he plays a monk, I am a druid.<br/>\nWe love this combination.  I discussed your letter with him and he wants me<br/>\nto tell you it is not a female thing, he is very, very male ( jock even) and<br/>\nhe experienced the same thing.  Personally, I think the partner/group makes<br/>\nall the difference in the world.  I also believe that if you cease to have<br/>\nfun then change what you are doing or with whom you are doing it.  I cannot<br/>\nstress enough how much difference the right partner/group can make for ANY<br/>\nclass.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust MHO,<br/>\n<br/>\nJanice<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: terrence wallingford &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:greenloafers@...\">greenloafers@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@onelist.com\">EQ_women@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, June 26, 1999 9:40 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_women] Shamans and Clerics<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: terrence wallingford &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:greenloafers@...\">greenloafers@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would just like to tell everyone out there who is a Cleric that they<br/>\n&gt; just might like to try out a shaman. I spent 18 levels being a Cleric<br/>\n&gt; and 5 being a Shaman so far. I was always frustrated with my<br/>\n&gt; limitations as a Cleric and took on way too much responsibility for<br/>\n&gt; other people&#39;s lives, which made grouping a very un-fun experience. I<br/>\n&gt; love being a Shaman so far. ( I&#39;ve made 2 new characters in Quellios.<br/>\n&gt; Bloodless and Blacksatin) Go ahead and laugh at the names, it&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt; best I can do on such short notice! I agonized believe me. Someone even<br/>\n&gt; called me &quot;campy&quot;!- whatever that means. I&#39;m only 25, that term&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; before my time.<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I&#39;ve played on that server for a total of 3 days and have<br/>\n&gt; noticed, not just me - also complete strangers, that most people on<br/>\n&gt; that server are really helpfull and nice. Or maybe just the people in<br/>\n&gt; Halas as that&#39;s the only town I&#39;ve been in. I encourage you guys to try<br/>\n&gt; it out as I have been so happy. I don&#39;t die constantly and I don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; to sit out the action all the time. I get to actually participate as a<br/>\n&gt; part of the group instead of staring at my spellbook all the time with<br/>\n&gt; nothing to do but chat. Not that chatting is at all bad, but I want to<br/>\n&gt; have some fun too!<br/>\n&gt; I have noticed that a lot of us have said that we play clerics, it<br/>\n&gt; seems more than any other class. (Or maybe I only notice the clerics<br/>\n&gt; because I play one.)I hope this doesn&#39;t offend you all, but I wonder if<br/>\n&gt; we have chosen to play one because we are by nature nurturing and<br/>\n&gt; helpfull, or because we have been raised in our society to act servile<br/>\n&gt; to men. (I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve raised a few hackles-sorry!) It bothered me that<br/>\n&gt; I would be one of the only women in rl playing a female character in<br/>\n&gt; any given group and I would be forced to sit and heal all the male<br/>\n&gt; warriors. I grew resentfull. I&#39;m wondering if many of you have done the<br/>\n&gt; same thing, or if this just says a lot about me.<br/>\n&gt; Thanks! :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Looking to expand your world?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ONElist has 175,000 e-mail communities from which to choose!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
