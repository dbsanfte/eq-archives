Best class and race depends a lot on your playing<br/>\nstyle, they are all fun in different ways =)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m in a guild called Rain which my ex-boyfriend runs (ack, we just broke<br/>\nup last week, I&#39;m still not used to calling him my ex =( We are still<br/>\nfriends but I don&#39;t know how things will work out for us and the guild in<br/>\nthe long run.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a level 54 enchanter.  I love enchanters because they tend to act<br/>\nto alter combat more than to actually kill mobs.  They mesmerise things,<br/>\nthey speed things up, they slow things down, I guess I&#39;m a bit of a<br/>\ncontrol freak =) My enchanter is a female high elf named Luna.  Enchanters<br/>\nare not much fun at low levels though.  Most of their spells become more<br/>\nuseful at high levels, at low levels they are mostly a waste of mana.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have a level 52 wood elf rangers.  Rangers are I think one of the<br/>\nmost fun tank classes. They are very versatile.  I&#39;m finding at level 52<br/>\nthat being a ranger isn&#39;t as fun as it used to be though, rangers seem to<br/>\npeak at around 40 I&#39;d say. <br/>\n<br/>\nTina<br/>\n<br/>\nOther fun classes:<br/>\n  Bards, at low levels they are basicly tanks with neat abilities.<br/>\nThey get healing song and speed song fairly early<br/>\n  Druids, they get lots of fun spells fairly early, and are good for both<br/>\ngrouping and soloing pretty much forever<br/>\n  Necromancers, very powerful, and have lots of neat tricks.  Pets are<br/>\nfun.<br/>\n  Monks, don&#39;t need a lot of equipment, and very effective in battle.<br/>\nFairly simple to play as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 30 Jun 2000, Sandy Wright wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Tina,<br/>\n&gt; I can only speak for myself, but as a newbie, there are lots of things I would<br/>\n&gt; like to see on this list.<br/>\n&gt; First of all, what server everyone plays on and why?<br/>\n&gt; What is the best class and race everyone has ever played?<br/>\n&gt; Are you in a guild, which one, and any other guild info?<br/>\n&gt; Stories about great RP adventures and worst mistakes.<br/>\n&gt; General chatting and fun.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I guess I will start with my basic info.<br/>\n&gt; I play on the Torvonnilous server, mostly because it has the fewest players<br/>\n&gt; usually.<br/>\n&gt; My current fav character is a lvl 5 Druid Woodelf named Linenu.<br/>\n&gt; I usually play the &#39;good&#39; characters vs. the &#39;evil&#39; but i can see where they<br/>\n&gt; would be fun.<br/>\n&gt; I have never tried the PvP servers, and probably won&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; I am not in a guild but would like to be someday.<br/>\n&gt; Latest fun-last night I played for over 6 hours on and around Orc hill with 3<br/>\n&gt; other char.  Kicked some major Orc booty!  and had fun talking and flirting<br/>\n&gt; with the guys in my group. (I was the only woman!)<br/>\n&gt; Biggest mistake (so far!)-not putting all my ability points into Wisdom for my<br/>\n&gt; Druid when I started this character.<br/>\n&gt; In Real Life, I am a Kindergarten teacher in her late 30&#39;s.  My 15 year old<br/>\n&gt; son is the one who started this game and then got me hooked.  Since I am out<br/>\n&gt; of school for the summer, I have lots of time to play.  I don&#39;t know what I<br/>\n&gt; will do in August when I go back to work!!  I wonder if I can play EQ during<br/>\n&gt; recess and lunch???!!!  lol<br/>\n&gt; I hope to hear from others on this list.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Sandy-<br/>\n&gt; ICQ- #9462081<br/>\n&gt; AIM- SandyW62<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Let Internet Call Manager notify you of phone calls while you&#39;re surf!<br/>\n&gt; Never feel rushed to get off-line again.
