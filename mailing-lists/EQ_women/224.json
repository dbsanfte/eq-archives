I call test my home.. I&#39;ve always played there<br/>\nand love helping out, making a new character to test whatever it is they are<br/>\nrequesting at the time.. giving feedback on new things.. that&#39;s what we&#39;re<br/>\nthere for.. but I totally disagree with what they have done to our server..<br/>\nWe have all had to kind of look over the races and work together.. teams may<br/>\nconsist of one for every race just because that&#39;s who&#39;s on.. it&#39;s the person<br/>\nbehind the character and not the race of character that&#39;s important to me..<br/>\nI have many different races of characters myself.. so does that mean I&#39;d go<br/>\nto war against myself?  no.. so all these new people have flocked to our<br/>\nserver and wrecked havoc.. they won&#39;t just let us play the game with all of<br/>\nthe (what I feel is) childish pranks.. bothering everyone..  it&#39;s totally<br/>\nunfair the way they can do things to get you killed.. for instance, I had my<br/>\nlvl 8 human cleric in Blackburrow, killing gnolls.. too many got on me at<br/>\nonce so I was heading toward zone (calling out a shout to warn others, of<br/>\ncourse) then when I was just before zone I turned to try and kill at least<br/>\none.. there was an elf standing there and just as I was gonna zone he snared<br/>\nme.. then just stood there and laughed out loud about it.. I gave him a few<br/>\nchoice words and got down to about 10 or so health when I finally broke free<br/>\nand was able to zone.. he could have come up behind me and finished me off<br/>\nwith one hit and then looted my body of all coins and what ever one item he<br/>\nwanted (they have turned this off right now on test but I&#39;m speaking as if<br/>\nit was on the race war server).. now how is that a fair fight?  you have to<br/>\nwatch your back every single time you hunt or move?  who gets enjoyment out<br/>\nof that?  I don&#39;t.. and I hope that those that do please move on to the race<br/>\nwar server when it goes live.. Oh btw he zoned with me and healed me after<br/>\nwe zoned.. then profusely apologized for what he&#39;d done, saying he hadn&#39;t<br/>\neven attempted anything to another race and saw that &quot;opportunity&quot; and<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t pass it up.. heh.. I know test is just what it says, test.. but to<br/>\nforce this kind of thing on the people that have done nothing but helped you<br/>\nout isn&#39;t the way to go.. they could have just opened the race war server<br/>\nand let those that were into that sort of thing go there and test away!<br/>\nIt&#39;s an ever changing game anyway.. after all is said and done and these<br/>\nother people move on to it, I just hope my friends come back to their<br/>\nregular characters (who they put on a week vacation because of this) and we<br/>\ncan get on with what we&#39;ve been doing before.. my 4-5 copper worth, sorry<br/>\nfor the ramble..  there are many more examples of what they have done that<br/>\nis totally crazy but I won&#39;t go into them all..<br/>\n<br/>\nMitzi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHow has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\nShare your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
