It appears if you are not bound that you appear either near where you are currently standing, back at your starting place, or somewhere","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1880884475\">Salutations Christina!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt appears if you are not bound that you appear either<br/>\nnear where you are currently standing, back at your<br/>\nstarting place, or somewhere unknown, although this<br/>\nmay change at some level.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first started I was not bound but kept<br/>\nreappearing when I died somewhat near where I had been<br/>\nkilled. Of course, all this was at my starting poing,<br/>\nso I&#39;m not sure what was going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe interesting thing was that I was traveling with a<br/>\n10th lvl bard the other day in BB which is when I<br/>\nupped from 9th to 10th lvl and the guy didn&#39;t know<br/>\nanything about where or how to soul bind.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe kept dieing and I would ask where he was and he<br/>\nwould say I can&#39;t explain it but I&#39;ll be back in a<br/>\nlittle bit, so I would hang around and wait and sure<br/>\nenough he&#39;d show up in a couple minutes. After that we<br/>\nwent to Keledim, and he was saying he wanted to stay<br/>\nin that area even if he died because we were getting<br/>\nsome good exp and plat from the Greenbloods. <br/>\nI said that was fine with me so let&#39;s go see the soul<br/>\nbinder and he didn&#39;t know what I was talking about.<br/>\nAnyway, we went and I got bound and he kept saying the<br/>\nwrong thing. Finally, I had to &quot;hold his hand&quot; and<br/>\nwalk him through it step by step. Anyway, the only<br/>\npoint was that it made me think that sometimes I&#39;ve<br/>\njourned a ways from where I was bound and the got<br/>\nkilled before finding a place to get bound again and<br/>\nhad to make that long trip all over again, sigh. So I<br/>\nwondered if I could sort of pull up roots and maybe I<br/>\nwould stay on the same continent until I could find a<br/>\nplace to bind. Anyway, it was just a thought.<br/>\n:o)<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, we agreed to meet there at 7:00 PM my time<br/>\n7::00 his time, the next night and he didn&#39;t show . .<br/>\n. men!<br/>\n<br/>\n:o)<br/>\nBrangvyne<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Christina Norman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tina@...\">tina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your soul needs to be bound somewhere, that<br/>\n&gt; determines where you appear <br/>\n&gt; when you die.
