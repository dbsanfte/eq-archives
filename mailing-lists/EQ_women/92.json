Maybe it&#39;s the whole cleric<br/>\nthing, I dunno.  On the other hand, I DID meet one of the best roleplayers I&#39;ve<br/>\never seen on that server, and after he rescued me from a pretty hairy<br/>\nsituation, he gave me patchwork leggings....unsolicited! He had just upgraded<br/>\nand appreciated my roleplaying and effusive gratitude and thought I was worthy.<br/>\n&lt;shrugs&gt;  Nothing like that had ever happened to me on Povar.  The PvP server<br/>\nwasn&#39;t what I expected, I must say, and neither was playing a Dark elf<br/>\ncharacter.  It&#39;s actually been a good experience!<br/>\n<br/>\nSara, Povar<br/>\nValdaya, Rallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\nMJ Solomon wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;MJ Solomon&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mjsol@...\">mjsol@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My RL friend plays on Rallos Zek. He doesn&#39;t SAY he wants me to play there,<br/>\n&gt; but he keeps asking about the character I made on that server.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway Saturday I spent level 2 being chased by a &quot;female&quot; character named<br/>\n&gt; Typehere in the newbie area outside Kelethin. It was annoying, though<br/>\n&gt; there&#39;s no reason to whine and complain if you are playing on Rallos Zek.<br/>\n&gt; But I just no for certain that Typehere was NOT a real female.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So I&#39;m asking if there ARE any real females on Rallos Zek. I told my friend<br/>\n&gt; no, he said he thought there were.<br/>\n&gt; Anyone here play there? How do you put up with the annoyances? I&#39;m as tough<br/>\n&gt; as anyone, but the game is challenging enough as it is, without worrying<br/>\n&gt; about &quot;Typeheres.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking to expand your world?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ONElist has 170,000 e-mail communities from which to choose! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
