My best guess is that<br/>\n&gt;the sisters strive to be chaste because they don&#39;t want their love to be<br/>\n&gt;bound and focussed on any one person.  I&#39;d like to see the whole chaste<br/>\n&gt;thing as a role playing element we can use if we want to, and not use if<br/>\n&gt;we don&#39;t want to.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But do we have to be like the NPC Sisters?  Seems to me the player guild can<br/>\nbe<br/>\ndifferent (like allowing men in, for one thing).  Honestly, the ancient<br/>\ncustom<br/>\nof sacred prostitution (hence sharing the love of the Goddess with Her<br/>\nworshippers) seems more likely to me, but not something we would necessarily<br/>\nwant to implement!  But I am not too big on the chastity idea either - who<br/>\nsays<br/>\nSisters are monogamous in their love?<br/>\nIf nothing else, my character is unlikely to be chaste, but I would hate to<br/>\nhave<br/>\n<br/>\nto view this choice as violating her vows to the Goddess, if you see what I<br/>\nmean.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;As for the men-protecting-the-women thing, it can be taken that way, but<br/>\n&gt;it doesn&#39;t have to.  I was basicly just trying to identify a nice way in<br/>\n&gt;which men could be incoroporated into the guild.  Your character could<br/>\n&gt;choose to not have a warder, and that would be a valid choice.  If I were<br/>\n&gt;to have a warder, I would see him as a default following of Erollisi<br/>\n&gt;looking to serve his god, and not as someone I needed for protection.<br/>\n&gt;Others might choose to define their relationship with their Warder in a<br/>\n&gt;different way (love, protection, siblings, or even the sister protecting<br/>\n&gt;the Warder?)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would seriously have to ponder the issue for my own character.  Guess we<br/>\nwill<br/>\nsee how it goes.<br/>\nAnyway, good luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nICQ#23767351<br/>\n&quot;If Moses had been Pagan, there would have been drummers and dancers around<br/>\nthe burning bush.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow that you are &#39;For Women&#39; by using free email from 4wmn.com!<br/>\nwww.4wmn.com<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nONElist users:  YOU can win a $100 gift certificate to Amazon.com.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nCheck out the FRIENDS & FAMILY program to find out how.
