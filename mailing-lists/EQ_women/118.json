I enjoy the flirting perhaps because until maybe this <br/>\nyear I had never done so in RL. When I was young (I&#39;m 48 now) I thought I <br/>\nwas ugly and I was too serious and intelligent to flirt or want to flirt. <br/>\nThat was in the initial days of feminism when we rejected a lot of our <br/>\nfeminity in the name of equality. Then for about 15 years I was way over <br/>\nweight and no one was interested for a long time. Recently I have lost 50 <br/>\nlbs and become physically very attractive because of the weight loss and <br/>\nbecause I&#39;ve learned how to enhance and appreciate my natural and innate <br/>\nbeauty. Men respond at all levels including opening doors for me as well as <br/>\nactually coming on to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, it&#39;s been fun in EQ getting some attention similar to that I now <br/>\nget in RL. On the other hand, I am fairly happily married (17 years now) <br/>\nand am not interested in having any affairs. On EQ that could only happen <br/>\nif I gave someone my real name and contact information, which I don&#39;t <br/>\nintend to do. I have found a steady, however, who is very nice and <br/>\nromantic, saying chivalrous things to me, giving me trinkets, and helping <br/>\nme find my corpse, fight, etc.. Like most women, my RL husband, is not and <br/>\nnever has been romantic. Nor have any of the men in my life ever been. The <br/>\nrpg environment can lend itself  to that chivalry, romantic thing so many <br/>\nof us fantasize about. I very much enjoy hearing his compliments as well as <br/>\ncomplimenting him. We usually do that when one of us needs to leave. It&#39;s a <br/>\ngreat way to end the game evening. I also have genuinely learned a lot from <br/>\nwatching him play and playing with him. I suspect he&#39;s more experienced at <br/>\nEQ or role playing in general than I am and/or that he is a fairly mature <br/>\nperson in real life. So my compliments are genuine, not just romantic <br/>\nfrivolities.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s never asked me about my RL except to ask if I was really female. He <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t know my age or marital status nor do I know anything about him. <br/>\nWonder if it will ever come up or if we will continue to just interact <br/>\nwithin our game roles. Certainly I don&#39;t intend to bring it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Wednesday, June 16, 1999 12:48 PM, Heather Hire <br/>\n[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hrootbeer@...\">hrootbeer@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Heather Hire &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hrootbeer@...\">hrootbeer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m throwing out a topic ladies, just want to see what experiences you<br/>\n&gt; have had.....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Flirting<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My character is the biggest flirt!  I discovered early in the game that<br/>\n&gt; most males (no matter what race) liked the look of my character, a<br/>\n&gt; half-elf.  Many flirted with her before she even knew she was cute.  It<br/>\n&gt; was in-character for Genneth (a bard) to flirt, so she is constantly<br/>\n&gt; engaging in flirting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And to add to it, Genn has herself somewhat of a boyfriend in the game,<br/>\n&gt; another member of her guild, Teban. (&#39;Course she still flirts with<br/>\n&gt; others, but he understands that she is mostly committed to him ;) So,<br/>\n&gt; has this phenomenon hit anyone else?  Do you get flirted with?  Have<br/>\n&gt; you found yourself a steady??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just curious<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
