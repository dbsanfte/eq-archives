However, if you want to continue on to high end stuff<br/>\n(reinforced leather, 10-slot bags) it requires considerable time and money<br/>\ninvestment.  You can make good newbie-level money doing tailoring in<br/>\ngreater faydark.<br/>\n<br/>\nSmithing requires about a 200pp investment to master (less if you are<br/>\noptimal).  Smithing I found to be very rewarding early on in my server&#39;s<br/>\nlife, there were lots of tanks who wanted armor.  For various reasons<br/>\nthough, it can get boring.  To make small or large armor you have to<br/>\ntravel a lot to get your molds and metals and such.  To make medium armor,<br/>\nyou can do it in freeport, where all the materials are fairly available.<br/>\nSmithing is quite enjoyable I found though eventually it becomes tedious.<br/>\nYou can make good low level money smithing in freeport or greater fay.<br/>\nThis will probably work best if you are level 20 or under as you will be<br/>\nable to hunt in the near vicinity to freeport where people who will want<br/>\nyour wares will hang out.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh I almost forgot, smiths can make weapons now.  They couldn&#39;t when I<br/>\nsmithed.  I don&#39;t get the impression that forged weapons are a<br/>\nvery competitive business though.<br/>\n<br/>\nBaking and brewing are both more &#39;fun&#39; trades.  All the skilled bakers and<br/>\nbrewers I know are druids, which makes sense because getting your goods<br/>\nrequires a lot of travel.  These two skills require little investment to<br/>\nstart, but a lot of work and travel to master.  These are nice because you<br/>\ncan give people alcohol or food, I still remember with joy the day my<br/>\ndruid friend gave me chocolate! You won&#39;t make money doing this.<br/>\n<br/>\nJewlery is one of the few trades you can make serious money in but it is<br/>\nalso fairly competitive.  In order to make money in jewelcraft you usually<br/>\nneed a sizible investment.  Maxing your jewelcraft to 200 will cost<br/>\nseveral thousand plat.  On the other hand, 50pp will get you able to make<br/>\nsome jewelry.  If you are not an enchanter you will have to pay to get<br/>\nyour metal bars enchanted which is a pain.  If you have a close enchanter<br/>\nfriend you could do ok though =)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlchemy is shaman only and you have to be fairly high level to do it.<br/>\nShrink and SOW potions are pretty cool though, but they require a sizible<br/>\ninvestment (thus the high level).<br/>\n<br/>\nMeow meow<br/>\n<br/>\nTina/Luna<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 5 Jul 2000, Sandy Wright wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Do any of you do a trade?
