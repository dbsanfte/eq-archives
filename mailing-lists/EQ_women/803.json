The one I didn&#39;t group with kept<br/>\n&gt; contacting me with messages trying to find out if I<br/>\n&gt; was through with the other guy yet, and telling me how<br/>\n&gt; he knew better places to go. I want go into all the<br/>\n&gt; details, but I couldn&#39;t help but laugh.<br/>\n&gt; :o)<br/>\n&gt; OK, and the questions:<br/>\n&gt; Is it normal for guys to start calling you &quot;babe&quot;<br/>\n&gt; after you have grouped for a couple hours, and start<br/>\n&gt; trying to use the /hug and /kiss command, or do I just<br/>\n&gt; find all the &quot;good&quot; :o) ones? Is there a slap command,<br/>\n&gt; I didn&#39;t think of that last night but I guess I&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; have to check that one out.<br/>\n&gt; :o)<br/>\n&gt; If there is someone you have grouped with a couple<br/>\n&gt; times and, well, they are kind of a looser, is there a<br/>\n&gt; nice way to avoid them, not let them know if you are<br/>\n&gt; online etc. without just telling them flat out? (By<br/>\n&gt; looser I&#39;m saying this particular character is non<br/>\n&gt; comunicative, a problem I don&#39;t have, and never seems<br/>\n&gt; to understand me when they do communicate. They group<br/>\n&gt; and then run off by themselves and die instead of<br/>\n&gt; letting me come along and help, they are very quick<br/>\n&gt; and whenever we, usually I, kill something they always<br/>\n&gt; grab whatever it is carrying faster than I can. I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t want to be rude, and I don&#39;t want to hurt<br/>\n&gt; anyones feelings but I don&#39;t really want to group with<br/>\n&gt; them either, because it&#39;s not fun.<br/>\n&gt; The bad part is that they badgered me into agreeing to<br/>\n&gt; meet them Sat to group. Yes, I&#39;m a wimp. Should I try<br/>\n&gt; to sit down and have a heart to heart talk with them<br/>\n&gt; about what they are doing wrong?<br/>\n&gt; Suggestions please!<br/>\n&gt; Not sure how to handle it and thought maybe someone<br/>\n&gt; here might have been there and done that and could<br/>\n&gt; pass on a bit of advice.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for listening anyway,<br/>\n&gt; Hugs,<br/>\n&gt; :o)<br/>\n&gt; Brangvyne<br/>\n&gt; Ranger - 11th lvl<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- Christina Norman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tina@...\">tina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; You can petition and ask a guide to change your name<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for reasons of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; divorce.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; - Christina<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; On Thu, 14 Nov 2002, Brangvyne Accampo wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Salutation All!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Say is it possible to get unmarried in EQ?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I mean suppose your &quot;spouse&quot; quits playing and you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; find interest elsewhere or somehting.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just curious.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hugs!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; :o)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Brangvyne Nic Ne Sidhe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 10th lvl Ranger<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
