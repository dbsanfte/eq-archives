I don&#39;t really flirt back because it<br/>\n&gt;is not in character with my human Paladin. I really think it&#39;s the armor I<br/>\n&gt;wear. I guess its OK as long as it does not get in the way of my killing.<br/>\n&gt;:-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Heather Hire [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hrootbeer@...\">hrootbeer@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Wednesday, June 16, 1999 12:48 PM<br/>\n&gt;To: EQ_women<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ_women] Women on EQ: Flirting<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: Heather Hire &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hrootbeer@...\">hrootbeer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m throwing out a topic ladies, just want to see what experiences you<br/>\n&gt;have had.....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Flirting<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My character is the biggest flirt!  I discovered early in the game that<br/>\n&gt;most males (no matter what race) liked the look of my character, a<br/>\n&gt;half-elf.  Many flirted with her before she even knew she was cute.  It<br/>\n&gt;was in-character for Genneth (a bard) to flirt, so she is constantly<br/>\n&gt;engaging in flirting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And to add to it, Genn has herself somewhat of a boyfriend in the game,<br/>\n&gt;another member of her guild, Teban. (&#39;Course she still flirts with<br/>\n&gt;others, but he understands that she is mostly committed to him ;) So,<br/>\n&gt;has this phenomenon hit anyone else?  Do you get flirted with?  Have<br/>\n&gt;you found yourself a steady??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just curious<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt;Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt;Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Looking for a new hobby?
