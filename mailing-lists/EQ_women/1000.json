We had a trivia contest and<br/>\nkind of a scavenger hunt once in my old guild for<br/>\nprizes. It was fun. I&#39;ve seen dueling contests in<br/>\nguilds set up by levels and even contests in things<br/>\nlike swimming. All fun for me, but then I get tired fo<br/>\ngrinding exp all day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had my cleric&#39;s wedding in the big chruch looking<br/>\nbuilding on the moon . . . don&#39;t even remember the<br/>\nzone name off the top of my head. When my cleric got<br/>\nmarried it was by the sleeping dragon. This one was<br/>\nreally planned out with each of us and the cleric<br/>\nhaving a number of pre set buttons for certain parts<br/>\nwithout having to type so much on the spot. I wrote<br/>\nout vows and customized them for EQ and for our<br/>\nclasses . . . cleric and ranger. It was fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n:o)<br/>\nButtercup<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Dr. Mom&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drmom5@...\">drmom5@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I go to all the weddings I can.

Anywhoo. I have 2<br/>\n&gt; questions I hope you <br/>\n&gt; ____&gt;will all be able to help me with. Firstly, I<br/>\n&gt; have to plan a wedding <br/>\n&gt; ____&gt;for my 2 best friends. Of course there will be<br/>\n&gt; drinks and food. And <br/>\n&gt; ____&gt;they have a ritual planned for the actual<br/>\n&gt; joining. I am thinking or <br/>\n&gt; ____&gt;fireworks and such as well. Has anyone planned<br/>\n&gt; a wedding, would a <br/>\n&gt; ____&gt;guide officiate..any other ideas for how we<br/>\n&gt; could make it special. <br/>\n&gt; ____&gt;It&#39;s actually a double wedding. One is a 52 vah<br/>\n&gt; shir bard marying a <br/>\n&gt; ____&gt;50 high elf enchantress and the other couple<br/>\n&gt; are a pr of 52 pallies <br/>\n&gt; ____&gt;that share same deity, race, class ect!. and<br/>\n&gt; secondly, as a way to <br/>\n&gt; ____&gt;have more fun and move away from xp grinding as<br/>\n&gt; well as to promote <br/>\n&gt; ____&gt;new friendships within the guild i would like<br/>\n&gt; to host an rp event <br/>\n&gt; ____&gt;but i dont really know where or how to<br/>\n&gt; start..if anyone has done one <br/>\n&gt; ____&gt;before and could lend me some help or<br/>\n&gt; guidelines that would be <br/>\n&gt; ____&gt;great.
