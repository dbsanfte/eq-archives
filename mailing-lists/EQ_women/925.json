I <br/>\nknow for sure we had an 8 year old girl (her parents owned a gaming store <br/>\nand she had been involved in D&D her entire life) and a 12 year old boy.  <br/>\nThat in itself was great!  I was really proud of how well the young people <br/>\nwere doing on raids and such.  Also, that such young people would choose to <br/>\nbe anti-pk was a testiment to their character!  (RALLOS ZEK GHETTO FAB!!!)  <br/>\nHowever, as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve all noticed, sometimes guild chat can get rather <br/>\n.....  18 and over...  On one particular occasion, the 12 year old young man <br/>\nmentioned above was trying to relate to the others his own sexual experience <br/>\nto seem more a part of the group.  He wasnt impressing anyone apparently, <br/>\nand the older guys were making fun of him and calling him a liar.  He <br/>\naddmitted to having fabricated most of the story but insisted he had <br/>\n&quot;touched a boob&quot;...  Well the guys thought that was hillarious and proceeded <br/>\nto lay into the boy verbally.  I couldnt just sit there so I mentioned he <br/>\nwas only 12 and told them to let the boy have his childhood.  Then I made <br/>\nthe observation that it was 10pm on a Saturday night, and they were all <br/>\nspending it on the computer...  Unbelieveably they started agreeing with me! <br/>\n  By the way they responded to that, I&#39;m starting to wonder if ALL of that <br/>\nguild isnt under the age of 16......  I quit the guild for other reasons (if <br/>\nanyone has a nice guild 55+ on rallos, lemmie know...  i&#39;m guild shopping) <br/>\nbut that always bugged me.  EQ is not the right place for your sexual <br/>\nfrustrations!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAngie aka  Gizzi 55 necro (rallos zek)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Dr. Mom&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drmom5@...\">drmom5@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@yahoogroups.com\">EQ_women@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@yahoogroups.com\">EQ_women@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ_women] attention listowner<br/>\n&gt;Date: Mon, 30 Jun 2003 10:13:45 -0400<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Listowner!
