The wedding will take place on the<br/>\nQuellious server Sunday, Aug.7 at 5 PM Pacifc, 8 PM Eastern Daylight<br/>\ntime at the Temple of Marr in North Freeport.<br/>\n<br/>\n****<br/>\n<br/>\nI am Dnaice, a high elf wizard on Quellious server and, occasionally,<br/>\nTrisango a human cleric on Brell Serilis.  My love, Corellon and I met<br/>\nin  Norrath and know absolutely nothing about one another on any<br/>\ndimension outside of Norrath which, we feel, makes this romance and<br/>\nwedding extremely special.  Our tale, which I must complete today, is<br/>\nposted on <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://longroad.mpog.com\">http://longroad.mpog.com</a> under Tales/ Dnaice&#39;s Tale.<br/>\n<br/>\nTigeress and Swiftlion, who were wed last weekend will be in<br/>\nattendance.  I was priveleged to see their wedding and it was most<br/>\nspectacular.  If you have never attended one, you must come.  It is a<br/>\ngrand and glorious spectacle.<br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to getting to know other women who play, particularly<br/>\nroleplay.  I would dearly love to create an all female hunting party.  I<br/>\njust meet very few female tanks *smile*.<br/>\n<br/>\nDnaice on Quellious Server<br/>\nTrisango on Brill Serilis<br/>\nJudy 3T on Terra</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
