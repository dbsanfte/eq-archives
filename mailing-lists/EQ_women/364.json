I&#39;m not sure how they are going to go about any conflict<br/>\nof names that may occur. I heard that from now on, only one person<br/>\ncould have a name regardless of what server they are on so that name<br/>\nconflict would not occur. I hope they impliment the quest soon, I got a<br/>\nshaman I really like on a server I don&#39;t play on anymore. <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
