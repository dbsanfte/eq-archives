(Get up to 5 games of eq going at once in my house!) The problem is that you cannot run the same account on more than 1 computer at a time, and you have to reqister a differnet CD for every account. Example: When PoP came out we had to buy 5 copies of the game because we have 5 accounts (me plus 4 roomates), but we only used one of the CD&#39;s to install the expansion onto the computers. When it came time to register our expnasions we opened the rest of the boxes and each grabbed a cd so that we would each have our own registration code.</p><p><br><hr size=\"1\">Do you Yahoo!?<br>\nNew <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rd.yahoo.com/evt=1207/*http://sbc.yahoo.com/\">DSL Internet Access</a> from SBC & Yahoo!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
