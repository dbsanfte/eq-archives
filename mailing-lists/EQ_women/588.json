I&#39;ve always thought of a guild as a group of friends, people that want to play together, or chat or hang out. Just recently, I was on as a newbie character I have and someone I didn&#39;t know just walked up to her and invited her into a guild. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love to join a small guild that everyone is friendly, that people get together for fun once in a while, no matter what their levels. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what do you all think, have guilds changed from what they once were?<br/>\n<br/>\nZuki<br/>\n<br/>\n29 cleric of Tunare and one damn proud dwarf!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAngelfire for your free web-based e-mail. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.angelfire.com\">http://www.angelfire.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
