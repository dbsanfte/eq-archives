One of them was auctioning<br/>\nthat &quot;she&quot; wanted a set of patchwork leggings.  I /who&#39;d her, and found out she<br/>\nwas level four, so I offered them to her for 1 gold (I was feeling generous).<br/>\nShe /tell&#39;d me back, saying, and I quote, &quot;Hell NO I&#39;m not paying for it =)&quot;  I<br/>\nreplied, &quot;huh?&quot; She replied, &quot;hehe watch and learn&quot;.<br/>\n    I recently tossed around the idea of making a new character, exactly like my<br/>\nprimary but with my &quot;true&quot; elven name (Sara just doesn&#39;t sound very wood<br/>\nelvish).  A friend offered to hold my stuff and give it to my new character.<br/>\nNow, I have full banded, a combine, an ash bow, the works.  My dilemma is<br/>\nthis--I don&#39;t believe in power gaming or twinking.  Granted, it&#39;s the same exact<br/>\ncharacter, stats and all, just a different name......the stuff I have would just<br/>\nhelp me get to my current experience level quicker; at which point I would<br/>\ndelete my current primary.  So, to twink, or not to twink?<br/>\n<br/>\nSara, Povar<br/>\n<br/>\nMJ Solomon wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;MJ Solomon&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mjsol@...\">mjsol@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was had been playing on Bristlebane when I found out some real life<br/>\n&gt; friends were playing on Cazic-Thule. I switched to Cazic-Thule because I<br/>\n&gt; felt it was good to be around some folks I knew.  These fellow are guys I<br/>\n&gt; know from our paper and pencil role playing group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway we made arrangements when I first made my character. My friend<br/>\n&gt; brought me an entire set of cloth armour. He was a wizard so basically he<br/>\n&gt; just handed me his clothing. At level 1 I had a cracked staff, then later my<br/>\n&gt; friends brought me a fine steel staff. I was about level 5 then.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This mini-twinking did make it easier for me to advance. I did not die half<br/>\n&gt; as many times as I had as my first bristlebane character. I was able to more<br/>\n&gt; quickly save up for patchwork. A &quot;female&quot; player gave me a good deal on a<br/>\n&gt; set of patchwork when I was level 4.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think this was serious twinking. And I don&#39;t think I got the stuff<br/>\n&gt; because I was &quot;female.&quot; I  think they would have given it to a friend<br/>\n&gt; regardless.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Other than that, no one has given me anything. Maybe these other &quot;females&quot;<br/>\n&gt; are asking for stuff?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; By the way, one of my male friends plays a female high elf. He said he plays<br/>\n&gt; her because he likes to inviso people to killl their pets and likes the<br/>\n&gt; reaction he gets to his &quot;female&quot; self. Heh.

I&#39;ve been playing since Day one, and have noticed that most of<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;guys I work with have switched to female characters, supposedly because<br/>\n&gt; they get<br/>\n&gt; &gt;free stuff.  I wasn&#39;t ever given (nor did I solicit any) stuff until I<br/>\n&gt; joined a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;guild.  Now, my brothers take care of me, but since I reciprocate, I feel<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt;fair.  Every time I see a &quot;female&quot; character (especially wood elves since I<br/>\n&gt; play<br/>\n&gt; &gt;one) twinking, I /tell them....hehehe.......might not make me very popular<br/>\n&gt; but I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;feel better at night. =)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Tara Lea wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; From: Tara Lea &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dactyl5@...\">dactyl5@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I was intrigued to see RPG weddings... I have a boyfriend in RL who plays<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Barbarian Shaman at a higher level than myself, on the same server.  So,<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; get some perks from that :)  He normally plays from work with other<br/>\n&gt; friends<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and his brother, so it&#39;s like a close knit family. They just play the<br/>\n&gt; game,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and that&#39;s what they are there for...hunting and quests, no on line<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; relationships.   I group with all males, which proves to be interesting.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Flirting does take place and all members have significant others that do<br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; play EQ... soon to be single with the way the are on all the time!  I<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; been told most males will play female characters since they get more<br/>\n&gt; things<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and favors... I suppose I have noticed that.  I love the game and find I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; look forward to going home from work to play... it&#39;s a whole other world!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hope to hear from y&#39;all.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; -Aegea<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;From: Danette Barber &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shardesane@...\">shardesane@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@onelist.com\">EQ_women@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@onelist.com\">EQ_women@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [EQ_women] Digest Number 1<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Date: Thu, 17 Jun 1999 05:58:26 GMT<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;MIME-Version: 1.0<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;From errors-216133-29-dactyl5=<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hotmail.com@onelist.com\">hotmail.com@onelist.com</a> Thu Jun 17<br/>\n&gt; 05:58:26<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;1999<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Received: (qmail 6802 invoked by alias); 17 Jun 1999 05:58:27 -0000<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Received: (qmail 6797 invoked from network); 17 Jun 1999 05:58:27 -0000<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Received: from unknown (HELO hotmail.com) (209.185.130.218) by<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;pop.onelist.com with SMTP; 17 Jun 1999 05:58:27 -0000<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Received: (qmail 70049 invoked by uid 0); 17 Jun 1999 05:58:27 -0000<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Message-ID: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:19990617055827.70048.qmail@...\">19990617055827.70048.qmail@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Received: from 24.234.19.236 by www.hotmail.com with HTTP; Wed, 16 Jun<br/>\n&gt; 1999<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;22:58:26 PDT<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;X-Originating-IP: [24.234.19.236]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Mailing-List: list <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@onelist.com\">EQ_women@onelist.com</a>; contact<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women-owner@onelist.com\">EQ_women-owner@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Delivered-To: mailing list <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@onelist.com\">EQ_women@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Precedence: bulk<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;List-Unsubscribe: &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women-unsubscribe@...\">EQ_women-unsubscribe@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;From: Danette Barber &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shardesane@...\">shardesane@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Hello All,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  I have lot of different characters, but my two main ones are Dyrlia<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;RaverSong, a level 24 bearded Dwarven Cleric on Innoruuk server, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Dandara, a level 13 Human ShadowKnight on Cazic-Thule server.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  I have never been asked if I am a woman in real life, which I find<br/>\n&gt; rather<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;odd, but count my blessings for. I&#39;m sure it will happen someday, but it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;hasn&#39;t so far. (Crosses fingers).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  As far as flirting goes, I am a notorious flirt and I&#39;ll flirt with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;anyone<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;at any time.

I think human interaction is one of the best parts of the game, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;flirtation is one of the oldest of human interactions &lt;grin&gt;.

I&#39;m not even sure exactly why it bothers me, but its incredibly<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;annoying. Maybe it&#39;s because I feel like they are taking advantage of<br/>\n&gt; male<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;hormones, and I don&#39;t feel right doing that so I&#39;m jealous &lt;G&gt;. Dandara<br/>\n&gt; did<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;ask someone of higher level once to bring her back an ice goblin from<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Permafrost, but I don&#39;t exactly see that as being the same thing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Danette<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;_______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
