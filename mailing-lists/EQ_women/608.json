Did you perhaps send your<br/>\noriginal post from the eGroups EQ_women home page and<br/>\nsubsequent posts from your email account? This could<br/>\ncause what you are describing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m curious to hear if if your husband has a separate<br/>\naccount as well Sanna. I have had numerous friends on<br/>\nEQ where husband and wife played and when they used<br/>\nthe same account it hasn&#39;t been a pretty sight. I&#39;ve<br/>\nalso seen it create problems when a married couple<br/>\nplay on the same server and they find love interests<br/>\nin the game. My husband doesn&#39;t play EQ and I prefer<br/>\nit that way. I don&#39;t mean to appear pessimistic about<br/>\nyour playing together. I&#39;m sure that if you have a<br/>\ngreat relationship in RL that everything will be all<br/>\ngood. The best advice I could give you, take it or<br/>\nleave it, is for both of you to become a team that<br/>\nstrive to reach common goals. If you begin to outlevel<br/>\neach other I believe you might run into problems<br/>\nbecause you&#39;ll find yourselves less able to hunt<br/>\ntogether. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck and above all else...HAVE FUN!!<br/>\n<br/>\nLilyana<br/>\nLevel 47 Paladin - Karana Server<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Elizabeth  Adams &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ea9999@...\">ea9999@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi, Sanna, nice to see you here. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I assume your husband has a separate account and PC,<br/>\n&gt; or there could <br/>\n&gt; be some ugly scenes in store as the addiction<br/>\n&gt; grips....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How does playing with your RL partner work? My<br/>\n&gt; boyfriend thinks I am <br/>\n&gt; a half-crazed addict, and plans to stick to the odd<br/>\n&gt; blast of Quake <br/>\n&gt; and Unreal, but I rather imagine it to be nice to<br/>\n&gt; hunt together.
