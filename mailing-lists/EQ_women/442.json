I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1045565742\">I have a topic for discussion, actually.  Since this is a women&#39;s list what<br/>\nbetter place to talk about the number of men that play women characters on<br/>\nEQ?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t care what gender that people play in the game, but what I&#39;m finding<br/>\nparticularly disturbing is the amount of men that pretend they are women<br/>\ncharacters then start the typical &quot;romancing&quot; song and dance (be it fantasy<br/>\nor with the intention of bringing it to reality) of the male characters (or<br/>\nin some cases, other female characters).  For example, I know of a man who<br/>\nplays a female wizard on my server who started telling me how &quot;bonded&quot; they<br/>\nfelt to me...how well we connect. All the while, my male friends on EQ are<br/>\nstarting to wonder about the odd friendliness that the char exhibited toward<br/>\nme...but the guy didn&#39;t want our other EQ friends to know it was a guy<br/>\nplaying a girl. I&#39;ve extracted myself from that situation but know of other<br/>\nmale characters that he/she has started to be extra friendly with. When I<br/>\nlet those male char&#39;s know of the deception they are typically appalled, not<br/>\nso much from a homophobic standpoint, but from the idea that they were<br/>\ndeceived.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard that from other guys too...they start hanging out with a female<br/>\ncharacter and weeks after flirting online they discover that it is a guy<br/>\nthat they are with.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, the idea of flipping genders isn&#39;t too disturbing to me..it&#39;s how far<br/>\nthey carry the deception that gets me a bit riled up. And...I find that a<br/>\nlot of the male characters are really hesitant to believe that I am a woman.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wondering if any of you have had good, bad experiences or just general<br/>\ncomments?<br/>\n<br/>\nVoxana, lvl 15 Mage<br/>\nMith Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Christina Norman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tina@...\">tina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_women@onelist.com\">eq_women@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, February 22, 2000 12:58 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_women] EQ Update<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Christina Norman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tina@...\">tina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This list has grown pretty quiet, and that&#39;s ok.

In a way I miss the simpler dungeons, since plane and dragon<br/>\n&gt; raids are usually always lengthy undertakings, and 90% of the time you<br/>\n&gt; just sit around waiting for the next fight to happen.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I started a baby magician on Luclin mostly to visit a close friend who has<br/>\n&gt; moved there.
