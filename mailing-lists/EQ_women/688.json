I managed <br/>\nto save a young halfling druid&#39;s life, and it turned out that it was <br/>\nhis alt, and he had a high level enchanter on hold, so I received a <br/>\nrod of insidious glamour as a reward, I nearly died!<br/>\n<br/>\np.s Enchanters Rock!!<br/>\np.p.s I am not addicted, I can stop playing anytime I want to,.... <br/>\num..
