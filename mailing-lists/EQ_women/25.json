I am Beth Moursund, player of Windsong Wanderer, a female wood <br/>\nelf bard on Solusek Ro.  Windsong is currently struggling through the &quot;hell <br/>\nlevel&quot; 35, and has about one and an eighth bubbles to go.  (Players under <br/>\nlevel 30 may not have heard of &quot;hell levels.&quot;  For some reason known only <br/>\nto Verant, experience progression at levels 30, 35, 40, and 45 slows to a <br/>\ncrawl.  On the levels in between it returns to normal.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have a female human monk and a male troll shaman, both currently at <br/>\n9th level.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m interested in hearing from other female players.  Also, I&#39;m happy to <br/>\ngive any advice and tips I can that may be helpful to newer players.<br/>\n<br/>\n  - Beth &quot;BethMo&quot; Moursund</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
