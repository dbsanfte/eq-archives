That<br/>\nis one of the first things you should try to get.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext, if you can afford it, buy a minotaur axe.  Those run 4pp, but are<br/>\nwell worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d try hunting on Orc Hill.  Orc Hill is near the orc lift, which is the<br/>\nlift in Kelethin that is on an incline.  If you follow the path from<br/>\nthere, continuing on after it ends, you should see a hill surrounded by<br/>\norc tents.  This is a great place to hunt up to level 9.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of orcs on orc hill.  The most important thing to know is<br/>\nhow to run to the guards, if you have orcs on you.  That will save your<br/>\nlife.  With your speed song, you should be able to outrun the orcs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you get an orc, try and run on top of the hill, so other orcs won&#39;t<br/>\nwander by and join in on the fight.  They all spawn at the bottom of the<br/>\nhill.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel five is a hard level in greater faydark, but once you get to level 6<br/>\nyou&#39;ll find things a lot easier, that&#39;s when you get your healing song.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 16 Aug 1999, MJ Solomon wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I have a question!
