I don&#39;t play her often,<br/>\nwhat with the wedding and all.  She and my partner are already married in this<br/>\nstory, though.  Uprooted from her home to follow her childhood sweetheart on a<br/>\nridiculous quest (he insisted he had to be a monk during his &quot;death&quot; on<br/>\nQuellious) she is very lonely and hates Freeport and has fun aggravating her<br/>\nspouse by flirthing with other men *grin*.  I like her a lot *smile*<br/>\n<br/>\nCan she join?<br/>\n<br/>\nTrisango<br/>\n<br/>\nChristina Norman wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Christina Norman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tina@...\">tina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Suzanne,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The server is Brell Serelis.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A brief update, my character Luna has reached 16th level on Brell.  I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; pretty much given up on all my other characters to focus on her.  In part<br/>\n&gt; this is so I can provide items cheap to my guildmates.  She is a Jewler<br/>\n&gt; capable of making electrum and silver jewlery, and also a master smith.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll make items for the guild at cost.  I hope this will help everyone get<br/>\n&gt; their characters jump started.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When the guild is official I will also try and organize newbie nights,<br/>\n&gt; when we will hopefully be able to hunt together, make eachother patchwork,<br/>\n&gt; etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Christina<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Tue, 3 Aug 1999, Suzanne J.
