I&#39;ve made a <br/>\ncouple of good friends who are more experienced then me and don&#39;t <br/>\nseem to mind giving advice or helping out so that&#39;s very nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also been trying to learn more about my role as a Ranger in <br/>\nNorrath. I just found out last week what a handy thing taunt can be <br/>\nwhen trying to keep a mob off your healer? OK, I&#39;m slow but I&#39;m <br/>\ngetting there I think. And I&#39;ve gotten duel wield and double attack <br/>\nnow so that&#39;s interesting to play with.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night a Druid friend and I went to Paudal Cavern for my first <br/>\ntrip there. I would have died twice during the first fight we had I <br/>\nthink if they had not been there to keep me from deaths door. That <br/>\nwas a tough mob and red all the way for me at lvl 19 (20 now).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, enough ramblin, so it&#39;s question time:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.) I have been asked to get married and have said yes. :o) Any good <br/>\nsuggestions on locations that would be nice but not to hard for <br/>\nguests to get to? He has a place in mind, I forget the name, but it <br/>\nsounds like it might be hard for lower level characters to even <br/>\nreach. I have not traveled over much of Norrath still so I&#39;m not <br/>\nsure. Anyway, if anyone has ideas I&#39;d love to hear them.<br/>\nAlso, when things are set, which may be a while I&#39;ll post a note here <br/>\nletting everyone know. You are all invited, of course, feel free to <br/>\ncome if you have a character on the Xegony server, of if you want <br/>\njust create a quick one at the proper time and come anyway. I&#39;d love <br/>\nto meet anyone who might do me the honor of coming.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.) Can anyone give me advice on how to find a guild that might be <br/>\ninterested in letting a Ranger in the low 20&#39;s join? Would it be ok <br/>\nto just kind of start asking around? Is there a way to tell a better <br/>\nguild from one not as good?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I hope everyone had a nice Thanksgiving.<br/>\n<br/>\nHugs<br/>\n:o)<br/>\nBran<br/>\nlvl 20 Wood Elf Ranger</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
