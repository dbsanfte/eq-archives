Man they must be hounding<br/>\nyou day and night.  And Sow Whore works *big smile* I like the name and<br/>\nit fits :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel bad about asking for cash for Sow.  Get a sob story on how they<br/>\nlost there bodies or I just Sow them to shut them up :)  Now higher<br/>\nlevels<br/>\nor folks that have been playing a while will ask nicely and give me cash<br/>\nfor<br/>\nit.  While the beggers just will shout and don&#39;t even say thanks.  Some <br/>\ndo but most run off.  And then they wonder why I will not heal/buff/Sow<br/>\nthem another time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what they do to you sounds about normal.  When I played a cleric it<br/>\nseemed that they wanted me to heal them in a battle but would not take<br/>\nthe<br/>\ntime to help me or wait.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like the Higher levels are the best to give Sow too.  And like<br/>\nyou<br/>\nI always like them :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nAh an Enchanter, great class to play, but man I can just see how much he <br/>\ngets bugged.  I alway give SOW and the buffs I have if I get breezed.<br/>\n<br/>\nCool, my husband ( got him hooked on EQ ) want to get married in the<br/>\ngame too.<br/>\nAnyone know how to do it?<br/>\n<br/>\nYour guild sounds great :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nNever got into the skills like baking, always was too broke after buy<br/>\nspells :)<br/>\nI&#39;m going to have to try baking it sounds like fun and easy.<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message: 3<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sun, 2 Jul 2000 17:57:24 -0600 (MDT)<br/>\n&gt;    From: Christina Norman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tina@...\">tina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Grouping and Level-envy<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One good way to group is to try small groups.  Lots of people seem to<br/>\n&gt; think that you should try and get groups of 5 or 6, but groups of 2 or 3<br/>\n&gt; can work really well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As a druid, you are an ideal partner for a tank.  Pure tanks like warriors<br/>\n&gt; and rogues are usually happy to group with a healer.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I use to dislike twinking, but over time I have come to understand it.  I<br/>\n&gt; have twinked myself.  For me twinking is simply to avoid aspects of the<br/>\n&gt; game that I no longer find as entertaining.  Usually with twinks, as with<br/>\n&gt; any other players, it&#39;s fairly quick to figure out if they&#39;re decent<br/>\n&gt; people or not.  If someone is nice, whether they are twinked or not,<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re nice.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tina<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Tina<br/>\n<br/>\nI like small groups too. Now in Highpass with the Orcs a big group is<br/>\nneeded, but <br/>\nthat is the only time I have seen that you need to be in a big group. <br/>\nNow I have<br/>\nnot been to Kurank yet so I&#39;m not sure about there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yep I must say I&#39;m Twinked, but I got the stuff from my old cleric<br/>\nand tank.<br/>\nWhen out and got the stuff myself or on a guild raid.  So I don&#39;t feel<br/>\nbad about<br/>\nit.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen someone asks where I got something ( twinked with armor Lockjaw<br/>\nvest - I was lucky to get<br/>\nout of that fight alive :) , shield from named gnoll in highpass, and<br/>\nscreaming mace )<br/>\nI tell them they are gifts.  If they get mad and want to know more they<br/>\nget mad but most<br/>\nfolks just smile and seem to understand.  Think they are twinks too :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRanalla the Lost Druid of Prexus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
