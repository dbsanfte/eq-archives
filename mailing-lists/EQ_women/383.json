I<br/>\ntook my main character, Sara, gave her a great story line, including the<br/>\nreason a Wood Elf had a human name, and then decided to roleplay it<br/>\nout... which meant re-starting her with her Elven name so that when the<br/>\noriginal character completed a certain quest, she would earn the right<br/>\nto be called by her Elven name.  So I stopped Sara at 15 and started<br/>\nthis one (Aelwesara), who is currently 13.
