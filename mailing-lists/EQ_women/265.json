Not everyone agrees, but the majority is in favor, so lets go<br/>\nahead with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those of you who wish an official city, I&#39;d like to suggest<br/>\nKelethin/Felwithe.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to create the guild, I need at least nine people to join me in<br/>\nthe EQ chat tonight to go through the automated guild creation process.<br/>\nI&#39;ll arbitrarily ask that people show up at 10:30 EST in the Brell<br/>\nSerilis chat room.  I&#39;ll then create a &quot;Sisters of Erollisi&quot; chat room<br/>\nwhich we will move to, and the automated guild creation process will<br/>\nbegin.  I will then add players within the game as you send me tells.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a 6th level high-elf enchanter on Brell named Luna.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
