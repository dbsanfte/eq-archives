Running a guild <br/>\nis a lot of work!<br/>\n<br/>\nRetrieving bodies when you are level 10 or higher can be difficult. If you<br/>\nthink you&#39;re going to die it&#39;s a good idea to quickly type<br/>\n<br/>\n/l<br/>\n<br/>\nthis will tell you your current location. When you die, write down the <br/>\nnumber, then you can use /l to see how close you are to that location <br/>\nwhile you&#39;re trying to find your body.<br/>\n<br/>\nBards, Necromancers, and Shadow Knights can locate corpses with spells. If <br/>\nthere is one in the zone they will often help you if you are polite. <br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 11 Nov 2002, Brangvyne wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Salutations!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can anyone give me information about starting a guild, is that <br/>\n&gt; possible, or do you have to join an existing one?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can anyone give me some sewing tips? I&#39;ve figured out how to take a <br/>\n&gt; ruined wolf pelt and certain patterns and put them in the small <br/>\n&gt; sewing kit to make tunics, boots, etc. but what about other things. I <br/>\n&gt; have not gotten anything to work in my large sewing kit at all yet, <br/>\n&gt; keeps saying it&#39;s the wrong stuff. The instructions for sewing large <br/>\n&gt; items say use a ruined bear pelt and an appropriate pattern which <br/>\n&gt; patterns would those be?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Finally, for now I was with someone who died the other day and we <br/>\n&gt; were haveing a lot of trouble finding her body so she could get her <br/>\n&gt; stuff back. After a while she said that someone else had gotten the <br/>\n&gt; stuff for her. How does this work? If I die and can&#39;t find my body <br/>\n&gt; how do I get my stuff back? How can I do this for someone else?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for any help ya&#39;ll can give,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; :o)<br/>\n&gt; Brangvyne<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
