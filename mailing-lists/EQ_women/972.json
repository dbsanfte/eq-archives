I belong to the guild <br/>\nLegend of the Jokers www.lotj.net and I have just ran across this <br/>\nmailing list.  I would love to be a part of it and meet some new <br/>\neverquest players; female ones at that! <br/>\n<br/>\nI should also mention that I am doing a University paper on the <br/>\nwomen of everquest.  The other reason I decided to join this mail <br/>\nlist is to get some opinions from other women who play everquest and <br/>\nwhat it means to them to be involved in this type of mporpg.  If <br/>\nanyone is interested in finding more information out about my <br/>\nresearch paper and wouldn&#39;t mind answering a few questions, feel <br/>\nfree to contact me either through here or privately. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks and I look forward to meeting all of you!<br/>\n~Mary Beth</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
