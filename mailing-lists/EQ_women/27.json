I am fairly<br/>\nnew to online roleplaying but I&#39;ve been addicted to many computer RPGs in<br/>\nthe past. So, I&#39;m still working on developing Ardynn as a character. (It&#39;s<br/>\nbeen tough, with all those orcs chasing me all the time!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a question for those of you who are getting &quot;married&quot; online, or<br/>\nhave gotten married online in the past. Do any of you have offline<br/>\nboyfriends (or husbands)? If so, do they mind if you have an online<br/>\nsignificant other?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Alison<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.
