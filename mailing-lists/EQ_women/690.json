She&#39;s only 2 and I&#39;m sure I screwed everything up<br/>\nso I&#39;ll probably restart her.  Clan, name Iceiallana (surprise there :-).  I<br/>\ntried a Doctor on Rubi-Ka 1 last night, Omni-Tek Nano-human thingy.  Died in<br/>\nmy first mission but still figuring it out (think I got the program thingies<br/>\ndown, but I right clicked something in my inventory by accident and it went<br/>\naway so I&#39;ll probably restart her too.  Her name is Caedusia (favorite cleric<br/>\nname).  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo those were my guesses based on EQ.  I played a tanking druid, much to the<br/>\namusement of all my friends :-)  I did love ranger when I started one, but<br/>\nhated the exp. penalty.  Enjoy cleric and bard.  I really like the speed and<br/>\nhealing buffs, but I get bored if I just do the sit/med thing while the tanks<br/>\nare having all the fun pulling. <br/>\n<br/>\nSuggestions?  From reading the boards I thought eventually I&#39;d play a<br/>\nmeta-nanophysicist neutral.  Looks like that will be a total bitch to play,<br/>\nthough, but what great RP :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIce<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Lora Roa&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:loraroa@...\">loraroa@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; --------------------------------------------- <br/>\n&gt;\tAttachment:´┐¢ <br/>\n&gt;\tMIME Type:´┐¢multipart/alternative <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------- <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m in Anarchy Online now and was in the beta.  Yes you really can do stuff<br/>\nin an hour.  But - grouping probably isn&#39;t it, solo missions are great for<br/>\nthat time frame.  You also lose &quot;chat&quot; in solo missions at level 6 - and it<br/>\nmakes for a very lonely time after (high player turnover rate now too).<br/>\n<br/>\nI do like it though.   I&#39;m mainly on first dimension now since the second is<br/>\nsooo empty during the day when I play.  Let me know who you are I&#39;ll send<br/>\nyou a tell ;0  And if you describe your playstyle I can give you a list of<br/>\nclasses to fit.<br/>\n<br/>\nLora / Hechicera on boards<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: Judy Tyrer [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:judy3t@...\">judy3t@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, September 01, 2001 3:40 PM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@yahoogroups.com\">EQ_women@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: Re: [EQ_women] Digest Number 166<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Wow, I loved Brell.
