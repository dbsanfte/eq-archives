The two just seem to mesh so very well.  I<br/>\nstarted online gaming with The Realm and moved to Meridian 59 where I met my<br/>\nr/l best friend.  Hopefully he will soon have his computer up to speed and<br/>\nwill be joining me in EQ. Btw, he just turned 60.<br/>\n<br/>\nI come from a predominantly matriarchal family and the elder women have<br/>\nalways been strong role models.  My mother is 96 and still works full time<br/>\nin her craft shop.  Nobody ever taught any of us that age was a limiting<br/>\nfactor. lol<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I am disabled, and spend most of my time at home, I am very<br/>\nthankful for worlds such as EQ.  EQ gives me contact with the outside world<br/>\nthat is beyond my limited r/l world.  I live in a very small community in<br/>\nr/l so the larger one of EQ is very precious to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, happy news:  Kachine and Mondre were married in Rivervale, Bristlebane<br/>\non June 19th.   They are very happy and will be hosting a big party later so<br/>\nall of their friends can help them celebrate their love.  They were to be<br/>\nmarried July 10th but just couldn&#39;t wait so they eloped.  When the party<br/>\ndate has been set there will be an announcement here so that all of you who<br/>\nare on Bristlebane or just want to come visit Bristlebane, can come have<br/>\nsome fun with them.   There will be some games and lots of food and drink.<br/>\nGet those alcohol tolerance skills up for the drunken relay races. hehe<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you, Beth, for asking about my experiences with gaming.  I wish more<br/>\nof my generation would give it a try.  I think it is a great stress reliever<br/>\nand such a wonderful opportunity for expanding ones world.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood hunting and stay safe,<br/>\nJanice<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Beth Moursund &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scrybsprite@...\">scrybsprite@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_women@onelist.com\">eq_women@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, June 20, 1999 12:28 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_women] fun after 40<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Beth Moursund &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scrybsprite@...\">scrybsprite@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Janice writes:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;By the way, regarding the subject of &quot;older women&quot; playing EQ, I bet I am<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt;one of oldest.  I will be 49 next month.  Not that it matters.   Maybe it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;will give some of you young gals hope that there IS fun after 40.  Boy,<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; &gt;there ever fun after 40.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s great!  You&#39;re certainly on the tip of the demographic curve for<br/>\n&gt; computer games.  How did you happen to start playing Everquest?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; By the way, I&#39;m 35.  My mother is over 60, and she plays some computer<br/>\n&gt; games.  She has a Macintosh, though, so I can&#39;t introduce her to<br/>\nEverquest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   - Beth &quot;BethMo&quot; Moursund<br/>\n&gt;     Windsong Wanderer on Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking for a new hobby?
