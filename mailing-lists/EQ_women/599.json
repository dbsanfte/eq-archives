My ranger is now level 16, <br/>\nhunting crocs at oasis mainly, and soooo looking forward to dual <br/>\nwield. I have a silvery war axe, and a gnoll hide lariat for use in <br/>\noffhand (I hope the low delay will mean fast skill increases). I am <br/>\ncurrently building my 2HS skill to max (nearly there now) with an axe <br/>\nof the iron back, which I love.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy guild is presumably called the Fremen because its founder was a <br/>\nFrank Herbert fan. Anyway, the desert of Oasis seems eminently suited <br/>\nto the guild, but they are all in the US, and grouping with them <br/>\nmeans sleepless nights. For your information, the guild is very new, <br/>\nmainly lower level players and very friendly and helpful where <br/>\npossible. Of course, it lacks the resources of an old, high-level <br/>\nguild, but I didn&#39;t join to get twinked or power-levelled anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks and best wishes,<br/>\n<br/>\nLiz</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
