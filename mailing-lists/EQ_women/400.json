What advice would you give someone planning a wedding in<br/>\nthe near future? *clears her throat and grins shyly*<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd how many people would be interested in attending a wedding on Povar? And what<br/>\nare some sites you all would recommend for a wedding for two 20th level<br/>\ncharacters?  Please, anyone feel free to answer.  I have absolutely no ideas at<br/>\nthe present (course I still have a couple levels to go, and we level slowly, so<br/>\nit could be late December before we actually hit 20) and would welcome ANY.<br/>\n<br/>\nSara/Aelwesara, Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Brangvyne@...\">Brangvyne@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Brangvyne@...\">Brangvyne@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 11/11/1999 1:25:24 PM Central Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tina@...\">tina@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; My wedding on Brell Serelis will be at 8:00pm PST on Friday the 12th<br/>\n&gt;  of November (tomorrow).
