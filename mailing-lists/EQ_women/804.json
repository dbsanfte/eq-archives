My advice<br/>\nis have fun and try to not unnecessarily hurt people&#39;s<br/>\nfeelings, while at the same time ensuring people<br/>\nrespect your boundaries. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, your right of course. As I said just chatting<br/>\nmore than anything. I am having fun, otherwise I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be playing the game or here talking about it,<br/>\nbut I am aware that I tend to run on sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\n:o)<br/>\nBrangvyne<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - If I&#39;m &quot;chatting&quot; to much, or anything I say<br/>\nbothers anyone, or is just out of line or topic or<br/>\nwhatever for the list someone is welcome to just tell<br/>\nme to shut up. I sometimes get carried away but I&#39;m<br/>\nnot offended if someone says enough already.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
