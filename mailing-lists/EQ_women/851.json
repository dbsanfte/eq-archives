I finally<br/>\ntrived oak last night and immediately went out and<br/>\nruined my first attempt at an oak bow. I also made my<br/>\nfirst True Shot Bow last night. :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have a lvl 2 half elf bard also named Brangvyne<br/>\non Cazic-Thule too although you can tell I obviously<br/>\ndon&#39;t get on her a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do love to chat though and can talk about almost<br/>\nanything EQ or not.
