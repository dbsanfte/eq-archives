So i would play in the dy and he would <br/>\nplay at night. Now we just play together. I also think its a lot <br/>\neasier. you don&#39;t have to look for a group, and talking is a lot <br/>\neasier than typing when your in trouble. But yes there are times when <br/>\nwe get mad at each other over something in game , but we dont take it <br/>\nto seriously. He plays more than i do but if he starts to get to far <br/>\nahead he lets me take all the exp. for awhile<br/>\n   I also know couples who can&#39;t stand to play together. Mostly <br/>\nbecause when they play its an escape. We wanted to play together so we <br/>\ncould ahve a common interest . I think i&#39;m ranting now so i&#39;ll shut up <br/>\n ;P  Hope to hear from more of you soon.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
