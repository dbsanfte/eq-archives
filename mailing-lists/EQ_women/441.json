I play Addie Healnbear a level 27 cleric (and a few <br/>\nother baby characters) on Tunare.  I&#39;m currently in SK hunting outside of <br/>\nPaw.  I seem to be forever stuck on 27 right now.  It is just a little bad <br/>\nluck.  I get ahead and a cyclops sneaks up, then too many gnolls for my group <br/>\nto handle, etc.  Then real life calls and I log behind in skill unstead of <br/>\nahead.  I know she will get over the hump soon.  I really want some of those <br/>\n29 spells ).
