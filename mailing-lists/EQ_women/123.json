My RL paramour hated it.  I<br/>\nenjoyed the attention (yes, lack of romance in RL was probably a huge factor)<br/>\nand the pomp and circumstance and FUN of being able to be a medieval Lady with<br/>\nher Lord.  I actually dragged lots of people who were power gamers into my<br/>\nlittle mental playground, and they have told me they are the better for the<br/>\nexperience.  To this day, my online &quot;husband&quot; remains a friend, and he and I<br/>\ntalk about our significant others (his wife is expecting in July and I have the<br/>\nbaby present waiting to mail), the joys of parenthood, our respective fields,<br/>\nand just, well, life.  I do caution anyone that this experience isn&#39;t always<br/>\nthe case.  I have had friends who have been less fortunate and hooked up with<br/>\nsome real psychos.  On EQ I am not married.  My wood elf is barely out of her<br/>\nadolescence, and has some very protective guild brothers besides--which, by the<br/>\nway, is LOTS of fun.  She does have a hunting partner, and the two of them<br/>\ntogether make Abbott and Costello look serious, but it&#39;s all in character.  I<br/>\nfind it&#39;s safer, and easier on my real life relationship that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSara, Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Laura Chris Green, Ph.D.&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Laura Chris Green, Ph.D.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cgreen@...\">cgreen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As a level 9 paladin, I have been flirted with some and responded some.<br/>\n&gt; Mostly all of us are kind of busy running around killing, buying and<br/>\n&gt; selling, etc. though. I enjoy the flirting perhaps because until maybe this<br/>\n&gt; year I had never done so in RL. When I was young (I&#39;m 48 now) I thought I<br/>\n&gt; was ugly and I was too serious and intelligent to flirt or want to flirt.<br/>\n&gt; That was in the initial days of feminism when we rejected a lot of our<br/>\n&gt; feminity in the name of equality. Then for about 15 years I was way over<br/>\n&gt; weight and no one was interested for a long time. Recently I have lost 50<br/>\n&gt; lbs and become physically very attractive because of the weight loss and<br/>\n&gt; because I&#39;ve learned how to enhance and appreciate my natural and innate<br/>\n&gt; beauty. Men respond at all levels including opening doors for me as well as<br/>\n&gt; actually coming on to me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, it&#39;s been fun in EQ getting some attention similar to that I now<br/>\n&gt; get in RL. On the other hand, I am fairly happily married (17 years now)<br/>\n&gt; and am not interested in having any affairs. On EQ that could only happen<br/>\n&gt; if I gave someone my real name and contact information, which I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; intend to do. I have found a steady, however, who is very nice and<br/>\n&gt; romantic, saying chivalrous things to me, giving me trinkets, and helping<br/>\n&gt; me find my corpse, fight, etc.. Like most women, my RL husband, is not and<br/>\n&gt; never has been romantic. Nor have any of the men in my life ever been. The<br/>\n&gt; rpg environment can lend itself  to that chivalry, romantic thing so many<br/>\n&gt; of us fantasize about. I very much enjoy hearing his compliments as well as<br/>\n&gt; complimenting him. We usually do that when one of us needs to leave. It&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; great way to end the game evening. I also have genuinely learned a lot from<br/>\n&gt; watching him play and playing with him. I suspect he&#39;s more experienced at<br/>\n&gt; EQ or role playing in general than I am and/or that he is a fairly mature<br/>\n&gt; person in real life. So my compliments are genuine, not just romantic<br/>\n&gt; frivolities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s never asked me about my RL except to ask if I was really female. He<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t know my age or marital status nor do I know anything about him.<br/>\n&gt; Wonder if it will ever come up or if we will continue to just interact<br/>\n&gt; within our game roles. Certainly I don&#39;t intend to bring it up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Wednesday, June 16, 1999 12:48 PM, Heather Hire<br/>\n&gt; [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hrootbeer@...\">hrootbeer@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Heather Hire &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hrootbeer@...\">hrootbeer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m throwing out a topic ladies, just want to see what experiences you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have had.....<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Flirting<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My character is the biggest flirt!  I discovered early in the game that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; most males (no matter what race) liked the look of my character, a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; half-elf.  Many flirted with her before she even knew she was cute.  It<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was in-character for Genneth (a bard) to flirt, so she is constantly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; engaging in flirting.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And to add to it, Genn has herself somewhat of a boyfriend in the game,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; another member of her guild, Teban. (&#39;Course she still flirts with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; others, but he understands that she is mostly committed to him ;) So,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; has this phenomenon hit anyone else?  Do you get flirted with?  Have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you found yourself a steady??<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just curious<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
