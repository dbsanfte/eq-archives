As to which<br/>\nservers....don&#39;t know yet. My boyfriend and I live<br/>\nwith each other and are both gonna play EQ. We decided<br/>\nthat for our first set of characters, we will play<br/>\nidentical twin sisters. That is so we can watch out<br/>\nfor each other and learn the game easily without the<br/>\njealousy issue. Hope to see ya soon. The twins are<br/>\nKatia and Katya Nadine. If ya see us, see if you can<br/>\ntell which is which. Hope to hear from ya&#39;ll soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth<br/>\n <br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mystyrain8@...\">Mystyrain8@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mystyrain8@...\">Mystyrain8@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 6/17/99 8:07:24 AM Mountain<br/>\n&gt; Daylight Time, <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:janeways@...\">janeways@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; As for significant others I was quite amazed to<br/>\n&gt; read that some that are <br/>\n&gt; married don&#39;t &quot;play&quot; that in EQ &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I really dont find it that amazing, but then I am<br/>\n&gt; one of the ones that dont <br/>\n&gt; RP that relationship with my RL husband in game.  In<br/>\n&gt; game we RP brother and <br/>\n&gt; sister.  The main reason that came about was (no<br/>\n&gt; lectures please ::chuckles) <br/>\n&gt; we fought so much initially about the game.  He<br/>\n&gt; would die...and get upset <br/>\n&gt; with me.  I would level past him...he would get<br/>\n&gt; upset with me.  Basically <br/>\n&gt; what Im saying is that, though we love each other<br/>\n&gt; deeply, we are also <br/>\n&gt; entirely too competitive with each other.  Another<br/>\n&gt; reason was, we have <br/>\n&gt; complete opposite styles of RP (personality wise)<br/>\n&gt; and if i spend too long <br/>\n&gt; with him in game i want to do something (like give<br/>\n&gt; him the biggest wedgie of <br/>\n&gt; his life) to make him lighten up.  He can be a bit<br/>\n&gt; stuffy.  Needless to say, <br/>\n&gt; it makes me want to pull my hair out.  So we<br/>\n&gt; determined a very long time ago <br/>\n&gt; that our characters were not meant to be together in<br/>\n&gt; &quot;that&quot; way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It actually works very well for us.  And, from the<br/>\n&gt; brother and sister <br/>\n&gt; standpoint, we actually work very well.  We can also<br/>\n&gt; climb in bed at night <br/>\n&gt; without the danger of a &quot;game&quot; sending us off to<br/>\n&gt; sleep angry with each other. <br/>\n&gt;  And we DO get together from time to time to help<br/>\n&gt; each other out.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In Light,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The player behind Mystyrain<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Last chance to earn $5000 for your charity of<br/>\n&gt; choice!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Deadline for &quot;GROW TO GIVE&quot; is June 19.
