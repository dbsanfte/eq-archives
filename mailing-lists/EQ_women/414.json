We are<br/>\nheavily active on the Brell Serillis board in EQVault and it is fun to write<br/>\nup the story much as I did when I met my first partner and wrote Dnaice&#39;s<br/>\nstory on Longroads.com.  Look for the story starting with &quot;So you want to know<br/>\nCabri&quot; followed by a post from Trucid about &quot;.. when I saw&quot; and followed by<br/>\n&quot;Dnaisha&#39;s Dark Night of the Soul&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the game is still fun and I don&#39;t miss the last month of the partnership. <br/>\nBut I DO miss the first month.  I guess it will always be like that.  My new<br/>\n&quot;romantic interest&quot; is much less interested in the romantic story and much<br/>\nmore interested in the group story.  So be it.  Maybe I&#39;ll kill him afterall <br/>\n*smiles darkly*<br/>\n<br/>\nDnaisha on Brell Serillis<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet free email and a permanent address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amexmail.com/?A=1\">http://www.amexmail.com/?A=1</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
