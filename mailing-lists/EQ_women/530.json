My Barb Shaman (Kalara on the Veeshan server)<br/>\ngot her SoW spell at lvl 9 and ever since then I&#39;ve essentially been a SoW<br/>\nwhore (lol might be a bit crude, but apt). The big difference now that i&#39;m<br/>\nlvl 21 is that no one pays me for the SoW. They just come up to me (and<br/>\npretty soon you&#39;ll know what I mean...they&#39;ll come up, sort of stand there<br/>\nand before they can ask for the SoW I am already mid-spell to just get them<br/>\nto go away). They literally assume that it is for free, say thanks and walk<br/>\naway. Drives me nuts when they do it right after I&#39;ve just fought a mob, am<br/>\nat half-life, oom and my party is the same or worse. That&#39;s usually the only<br/>\ntime that I&#39;ll turn them down.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people just say thanks (but often not even that) and leave. Others,<br/>\nusually the higher levels, will  give me buffs and that I can always<br/>\nappreciate.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy in-game fiance (hey...THAT is a great topic, in-game marriages...anyone<br/>\nknow of a good place in Norrath to tie the knot?) is an enchanter and he<br/>\ngets asked for breezes far more than I do and they pay him...and often pay<br/>\nhim well. Hey, I have often paid several plat to get a good breeze or<br/>\nclarity. Can&#39;t live without my new addiction!  And seriously, I can&#39;t tell<br/>\nyou how great it is to have a perpetual sow and breeze when you are in a<br/>\ngroup.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy guild is a pretty big one but there is a big disparity between high level<br/>\ncharacters and lower ones. You can really tell the difference between the<br/>\nones that came into the guild at a later time and the ones that have been<br/>\nthere for awhile. Most of them are lvl 30+ and then the next group is pretty<br/>\nmuch right around 20, then it drops to a few new secondary char of people in<br/>\nthe guild who are really low levels. It sort of sucks because the guild<br/>\nraids are mostly planned by the higher levels and excludes a lot of people.<br/>\nBut it&#39;s growing and new people are coming on board all the time. I&#39;m<br/>\nfinding that I hang out mostly with people in my guild and it is a lot of<br/>\ncomradarie. It also doesn&#39;t hurt that 70% of the guild are druids (weird,<br/>\nhuh?) and so getting a port is never a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI play for the social aspects, but I love the questing and learning skills.<br/>\nI have half my totemic armor already and the getting it has been most of the<br/>\nfun...travelling all over, getting help from people. I&#39;m a lvl 68 in baking<br/>\n(funny because I&#39;m not a domestic sort in real life...I can cook well but<br/>\ndon&#39;t like to so much). Baking is an awesome skill to have because once you<br/>\nbuy a spit, you can bake while you meditate! And fresh meat there is<br/>\naplenty. I find it funny though that there aren&#39;t many bakers around. My<br/>\nfriends always laugh when I present them with beer braised lion or pickled<br/>\ngator. The food is also lighter than regular food (monks love that) at .01<br/>\nand it lasts a lot longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I&#39;m rambling...brought up lots of things we can use for topics later<br/>\n(guilds, skills, weddings, social stuff). :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nCrystal<br/>\nKalara, 21st Barbie Shamaness<br/>\nAzure Guard, Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
