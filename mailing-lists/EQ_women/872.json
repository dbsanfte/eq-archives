That <br/>\ncase inspired the Stella Awards for the most frivolous successful <br/>\nlawsuits in the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following are this year&#39;s candidates: <br/>\n<br/>\n1. Kathleen Robertson of Austin, Texas, was awarded $780,000 by a <br/>\njury of her peers after breaking her ankle tripping over a toddler <br/>\nwho was running inside a furniture store. The owners of the store <br/>\nwere understandably surprised at the verdict, considering the <br/>\nmisbehaving little toddler was<br/>\n<br/>\nKathleen Robertson&#39;s son.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. A 19-year-old, Carl Truman of Los Angeles, won $74,000 and medical<br/>\nexpenses when his neighbor ran over his hand with a Honda Accord. Mr.<br/>\nTruman apparently didn&#39;t notice there was someone at the wheel of <br/>\nthe car when he was trying to steal his neighbor&#39;s hub caps.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Terrence Dickinson of Bristol, Pennsylvania, was leaving a house <br/>\nhe had just finished robbing by way of the garage. He was not able <br/>\nto get the garage door to go up since the automatic door opener was <br/>\nmalfunctioning. He couldn&#39;t reenter the house because the door <br/>\nconnecting the house and garage locked when he pulled it shut. The <br/>\nfamily was on vacation, and Mr. Dickinson found himself locked in <br/>\nthe garage for eight days. He subsisted on a case of Pepsi he found, <br/>\nand a large bag of dry dog food. He sued the homeowner&#39;s insurance <br/>\nclaiming the situation caused him undue mental anguish. The jury <br/>\nagreed: to the tune of $500,000.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Jerry Williams of Little Rock, Arkansas, was awarded $14,500 and <br/>\nmedical expenses after being bitten on the buttocks by his next door <br/>\nneighbor&#39;s beagle. The beagle was on a chain in its owner&#39;s fenced <br/>\nyard. The award was less than sought because the jury felt the dog <br/>\nmight have been just a<br/>\nlittle provoked at the time by Mr. Williams who was shooting it <br/>\nrepeatedly with a pellet gun.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. A Philadelphia restaurant was ordered to pay Amber Carson of <br/>\nLancaster, Pennsylvania, $113,500 after she slipped on a soft drink <br/>\nand broke her coccyx. The beverage was on the floor because Ms. <br/>\nCarson had thrown it at her boyfriend 30 seconds earlier during an <br/>\nargument.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. Kara Walton of Claymont, Delaware, successfully sued the owner of <br/>\na night club in a neighboring city when she fell from the bathroom <br/>\nwindow to the floor and knocked out her two front teeth. This <br/>\noccurred while Ms. Walton was trying to sneak through the window in <br/>\nthe ladies room to avoid paying the $3.50 cover charge. She was <br/>\nawarded $12,000 and dental expenses.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. This year&#39;s favorite could easily be Mr. Merv Grazinski of <br/>\nOklahoma City, Oklahoma. Mr. Grazinski purchased a brand new 32-foot <br/>\nWinnebago motor home. On his first trip home, having driven onto the <br/>\nfreeway, he set the cruise control at 70 mph and calmly left the <br/>\ndrivers seat to go into the back and make himself a cup of coffee. <br/>\nNot surprisingly, the RV left the freeway, crashed and overturned. <br/>\nMr. Grazinski sued Winnebago for not advising him in the owner&#39;s <br/>\nmanual that he couldn&#39;t actually do this. The jury awarded him <br/>\n$1,750,000 plus a new motor home. The company actually changed their<br/>\nmanuals on the basis of this suit, just in case there were any other <br/>\ncomplete morons buying their recreation vehicles<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n._.~*~._.~*~.Beverly R._.~*~._.~*~.<br/>\nP.O.
