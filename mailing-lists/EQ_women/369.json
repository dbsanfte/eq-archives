We have decided five is definitely enough and<br/>\nwant to choose which ones to take to the next level (10 to 20).  It<br/>\ntakes little time to bring them up to 9 and longer through the teens.<br/>\nBut what we have noticed in the 20s is that it is a week or two per<br/>\nlevel and with the amount of time invested we want to pick the<br/>\ncharacters we like most to put that kind of time in.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, we may take all of them to 20 and then decide, but right now we<br/>\nneed to decide for the next level, 10ish to 20ish.  We roleplay and the<br/>\nstories are important, but we can always change them, we can&#39;t change<br/>\ncharacter and class.  We prefer to play together, we group when we meet<br/>\ngood people to group with, but there are times when we want to solo if<br/>\nthe other is not available.  That is the major drawback to High Elf<br/>\nwizard as if root fails I&#39;m toast against even low blues.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are our couples:<br/>\n<br/>\nHigh Elves:<br/>\n    Paladin     24<br/>\n    Wizard     22<br/>\n<br/>\nWood Elves:<br/>\n    Ranger    9<br/>\n    Druid      9<br/>\n<br/>\nHumans:<br/>\n    Monk    10<br/>\n    Cleric      9<br/>\n<br/>\nDark Elves:<br/>\n    Necro    14<br/>\n    Mage     11<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbarians:<br/>\n    Warrior    9<br/>\n    Shaman    9<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also roleplay and the Dark Elf story is the strangest and the human<br/>\nthe most boring.  So, if people have their own favorites or see certain<br/>\nadvantages or disadvantages to the pairing, I&#39;d love to hear opinions.<br/>\nWho likes to play what and why is always a subject of great interest.<br/>\nAnd as Wizard is the only role I have experience in past the newbie<br/>\nstages, I&#39;d love some advice on what makes good higher level play and<br/>\nwhy.<br/>\n<br/>\nJudy</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
