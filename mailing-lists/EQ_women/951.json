Just recently I tried it again though .. and wow!!! its nice <br/>\nagain!!! I gave up at lvl 54, somewhere along the line the game had changed <br/>\nfor me and I had lost the feeling I first had on being chased by a giant to <br/>\nthe bridge in the karanas.. I had started a few months after the game first <br/>\ncame out.. when they still announced when people made 50 and there were no <br/>\nexpansion packs. I had gained a new husband through the game and we had <br/>\ndecided we wanted to move on to other games (but no they were never as fun. <br/>\nI tred daoc, Anarchy on line and went back to first person shooters.. but <br/>\nnothing grabbed me..) Then I had a go on eqemu.. noticed verant were <br/>\noffering me a free week on real eq . and .. went on line on my old server <br/>\nInnouruuk again.. well that seemed much the same, and my characters were <br/>\nall still there and that wouldnt have caught my attention. but then I <br/>\nnoticed there were some new Euro serevers so I tried the new server and <br/>\nmade a cat person.. (ooh . I had bought the luclin expansion and never <br/>\nbothered to install it before..) and before you can say boo I loved it <br/>\nagain. and.. so many changes for the better!!!!! I became a froglock and <br/>\nall my family have joined in .. the server is near empty and all the people <br/>\nfriendly . no loud arguments in ooc ..  we didn&#39;t have the awful horror of <br/>\ncorpse searching at low lvls so we have been runing around exploring and we <br/>\ncan easlily move from one newbie zone to another via pok.. Its great!!!! <br/>\nLoads of new places to explore. and much much easier to play .. and the <br/>\natmosphere seems to have changed back to how it was.. with much <br/>\nfriendliness and many people willing to buff a small frog who croaks a <br/>\nlot.. I don&#39;t know if the game has been destroyed for high end play as I <br/>\nhave no intention at this time of playing my enchanter and having to play <br/>\nfor hours on end and join in massive raids that keep me up all night.. nor <br/>\ndo I wish to hear endlessly about server politics and the best way to share <br/>\nspawns and zones.. What I do want is what I have found, a family orientated <br/>\ngame (my partner, myself and my kids of 14 and 11 play as a group) where <br/>\nall of us can lvl up together and explore zones, get the occasional heart <br/>\nstopping scare as we walk through some dangerous cavern with beasts in it <br/>\nwe haven&#39;t seen before, chat in friendly way with people we meet and.. <br/>\nrelax.. Verant appear to have made the low lvl game much much easier but at <br/>\nthe same time have enough areas where you haven&#39;t been before to make <br/>\nexploring scary and fun. Mind you I would love a horse but that seems to be <br/>\nsomething I would have to work to hard to get...<br/>\n<br/>\nanyway hello all :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
