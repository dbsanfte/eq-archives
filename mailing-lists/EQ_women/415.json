I do appreciate the input I got and I did end up buying the game a few weeks ago. However, with one thing and another I did not get it installed onto my computer until today and as of right now I still have not signed on. That will probably be tomorrow sometime.<br/>\nAnyway, now that I am actually on the verge of getting started I had a couple of questions I was hoping some of you might help answer.<br/>\n1.) The tutorial that is included on the CD keeps locking up. Did anyone else have this problem? It has me a bit worried in that I am afraid that the game might do the same thing. It always happens shortly after leaving the guildmaster to go get some food. Any input, or suggestions?<br/>\nI will be contacting the website to see if they might know why but was wondering if any of you had the same problem.<br/>\n2.) Can anyone give me some suggestion on where to start or what to do first? Some suggestions from those who have been there and done that might be helpful/useful?<br/>\n3.) Anyone looking for a trainee or companion to go adventuring with. I plan on trying to start with a half-elf bard, and am looking forward to doing some adventuring with someone or several someones if anyone is interested in taking on a beginner.<br/>\nWell, I hope everyone had a good Christmas and look foward to chating a bit and seeing some of you in the world of EQ.<br/>\nHappy Adventuring,<br/>\nBrangvyne</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
