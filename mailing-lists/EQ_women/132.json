I&#39;ve run mailing lists for the past 5 years, and not<br/>\nallowing attachments saves alot of aggravation on the part of the list<br/>\nowner; and it&#39;s not just viruses that become a problem. I have never run a<br/>\nmailing list off a service such as onelist before, but I don&#39;t believe<br/>\nonelist had this option until the last few months with this Happy99 virus<br/>\nand then with the Melissa virus. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know some people on the EQ lists like to share screenshots from the game,<br/>\nbut the best way to do that is display it on a website and send out the<br/>\naddress, or tell the list you have one and then send it through private<br/>\nemail to those that ask for it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe best rule is what I&#39;ve read from others already, never open<br/>\nattachments. If you get something that you requested, you still need to<br/>\nvirus check it before opening it. <br/>\n<br/>\nOff for a late night hunt!<br/>\nTbaald</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
