The only difference is<br/>\nthat the retail version has a box and a manual, while the upgrade version<br/>\nhas just the CD (and maybe the cloth map?).<br/>\n<br/>\nA RoK CD contains the full Everquest and ROK installation files.  The CD<br/>\nKey can be used to either start a brand new Everquest account that can<br/>\naccess RoK (with a free month of gameplay) or it can be used to upgrade an<br/>\nexisting account to RoK (no free month of gameplay).  You can&#39;t however<br/>\nboth upgrade an existing account, and start a new one.  This paragraph is<br/>\nsomewhat speculative.  I personally used a store-bought RoK to upgrade my<br/>\nEQ account to be able to access RoK.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Tina<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 26 Apr 2000, Amanda S wrote:<br/>\n&gt;     *Shakes head* it just seems incredibly odd to me..
