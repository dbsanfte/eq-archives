I travel quite a<br/>\nbit and am a student of both languages and research.  I have friends from<br/>\nmany areas in Norath, mostly because I move around so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have had a few male characters ask me to marry them, but I feel that right<br/>\nnow this gnome is to busy exploring and discovering the world to settle<br/>\ndown.  (Plus I am a bit of a flirt from time to time.)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women-owner@onelist.com\">EQ_women-owner@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marji@...\">marji@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, August 02, 1999 5:24 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_women] Welcome to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@onelist.com\">EQ_women@onelist.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi there, and welcome to EQ Women!
