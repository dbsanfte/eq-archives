That<br/>\nrocks!<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore EQ, I hadn&#39;t been involved in gaming since my kids were born and I<br/>\nhad to quit AD&D because I didn&#39;t have 5 hours at once lick to play.  EQ<br/>\nhas been great because I can play it around MY schedule.  Putting shoes on<br/>\nkids and making breakfast in the morning is built around my wizard&#39;s med<br/>\ntime!  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*********** REPLY SEPARATOR  ***********<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 10/19/03 at Mary Beth wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n____&gt;Hello,<br/>\n____&gt;<br/>\n____&gt;I&#39;m Mary Beth and I play a 65 Dark Elf Cleric (Brinni) and a 65 <br/>\n____&gt;Human Monk (Naiya) on the Ayonae Ro server.  I belong to the guild <br/>\n____&gt;Legend of the Jokers www.lotj.net and I have just ran across this <br/>\n____&gt;mailing list.  I would love to be a part of it and meet some new <br/>\n____&gt;everquest players; female ones at that! <br/>\n____&gt;<br/>\n____&gt;I should also mention that I am doing a University paper on the <br/>\n____&gt;women of everquest.  The other reason I decided to join this mail <br/>\n____&gt;list is to get some opinions from other women who play everquest and <br/>\n____&gt;what it means to them to be involved in this type of mporpg.  If <br/>\n____&gt;anyone is interested in finding more information out about my <br/>\n____&gt;research paper and wouldn&#39;t mind answering a few questions, feel <br/>\n____&gt;free to contact me either through here or privately. <br/>\n____&gt;<br/>\n____&gt;Thanks and I look forward to meeting all of you!<br/>\n____&gt;~Mary Beth<br/>\n____&gt;<br/>\n____&gt;<br/>\n____&gt;<br/>\n____&gt;<br/>\n____&gt;------------------------ Yahoo!
