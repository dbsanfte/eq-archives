I&#39;m not exactly sure what my character (Guerrilla on <br/>\nTuneare) &#39;s personality is yet. I guess I&#39;m developing it, but you&#39;ve given <br/>\nme some good food for thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve met mostly nice and only a few rude characters on line. More of the <br/>\nrude ones tend to be male characters and I suspect that the rude ones, <br/>\nwhether their characters are male or female, in RL are probably those 13 <br/>\nyear old males you mentioned. Two of the nicest female characters are my <br/>\nguild sisters and they are for sure female in RL. What I&#39;ve noticed about <br/>\nEQ characters, both female and mostly male, is that some are very selfish <br/>\nand obnoxious.  They are impatient and lead their comrades into dangerous <br/>\nplaces too often. They take more than their share of the loot. And they <br/>\nnever say thank you. Somehow I think that most of these characters are <br/>\nyoung males in RL, but they could be older (some people never grow up) or <br/>\nfemale (good and bad are not limited by gender).<br/>\n<br/>\nI chose to play a female to begin with on EQ because I figured I would have <br/>\nenough to learn about the game environment and my race/class without having <br/>\nto worry about role playing a gender I&#39;m less familiar with than my own. <br/>\nPerhaps later I&#39;ll try a male character and see how it works. Do any of you <br/>\nreal women every play male characters? Do you recommend it and if so why?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thursday, June 17, 1999 3:16 AM, Janice [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcjc@...\">jcjc@...</a>] wrote:<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Janice&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jcjc@...\">jcjc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello Everyone,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It has been a long night of fighting orcs and watching the beautiful <br/>\nunicorn<br/>\n&gt; in Lesser so I will keep this short.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My girls all live on Bristlebane and they are:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bitty lvl 3 halfling Druid  -- However, Bitty has had a head injury and <br/>\ndoes<br/>\n&gt; not acknowledge she is a Druid, she believes she is a pirate and that<br/>\n&gt; someone has stolen her ship, The Miss Lady Red Toes. Please be kind to <br/>\nher,<br/>\n&gt; she is quite insane.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Garnet lvl 7 human Ranger -- A bit tough but has a good heart but, shhhh,<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t tell that to anyone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Honi lvl 6 human Bard --  Honi was named for her sweet voice and<br/>\n&gt; disposition.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ivory lvl 6 high elf Cleric -- Ivory is a tailor as well as a healer. <br/>\n Quiet<br/>\n&gt; but good at her job.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kachine lvl 12 human Monk -- Very shy, Kachine is to be married to <br/>\nMondre, a<br/>\n&gt; 15th level Cleric.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Zuzu lvl 9 troll Warrior -- Zuzu also has some mental problems but we <br/>\ndon&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; mention them to her because we don&#39;t want to get &quot;barshed on de hed&quot;. <br/>\n  She<br/>\n&gt; is convinced she is beautiful and boasts about it on a regular basis. <br/>\n She<br/>\n&gt; thinks she has won some sort of beauty contest to prove it but, when<br/>\n&gt; questioned about it, she changes the subject with song or threats of<br/>\n&gt; barshing.  She also thinks she is always right.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, there you have it, my girls.  If you are ever on Bristlebane, take a<br/>\n&gt; moment and say hello.  Another female and I were discussing how difficult <br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; is to make female friends on our server.  We have both encountered many <br/>\nrude<br/>\n&gt; female chars. and it was beyond role-play.   I told her I felt most were <br/>\n13<br/>\n&gt; year old males, lol.  Seriously though, she and I have talked about this <br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; would like some input regarding the subject. Do you find this on the <br/>\nother<br/>\n&gt; servers?  I love my male friends dearly but, come on, we all need a <br/>\nlittle<br/>\n&gt; girl-talk now and then, don&#39;t we?  I am looking forward to some feedback <br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, so much for short.
