The one I didn&#39;t group with kept<br/>\ncontacting me with messages trying to find out if I<br/>\nwas through with the other guy yet, and telling me how<br/>\nhe knew better places to go. I want go into all the<br/>\ndetails, but I couldn&#39;t help but laugh.<br/>\n:o)<br/>\nOK, and the questions:<br/>\nIs it normal for guys to start calling you &quot;babe&quot;<br/>\nafter you have grouped for a couple hours, and start<br/>\ntrying to use the /hug and /kiss command, or do I just<br/>\nfind all the &quot;good&quot; :o) ones? Is there a slap command,<br/>\nI didn&#39;t think of that last night but I guess I&#39;ll<br/>\nhave to check that one out.<br/>\n:o)<br/>\nIf there is someone you have grouped with a couple<br/>\ntimes and, well, they are kind of a looser, is there a<br/>\nnice way to avoid them, not let them know if you are<br/>\nonline etc. without just telling them flat out? (By<br/>\nlooser I&#39;m saying this particular character is non<br/>\ncomunicative, a problem I don&#39;t have, and never seems<br/>\nto understand me when they do communicate. They group<br/>\nand then run off by themselves and die instead of<br/>\nletting me come along and help, they are very quick<br/>\nand whenever we, usually I, kill something they always<br/>\ngrab whatever it is carrying faster than I can. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to be rude, and I don&#39;t want to hurt<br/>\nanyones feelings but I don&#39;t really want to group with<br/>\nthem either, because it&#39;s not fun.<br/>\nThe bad part is that they badgered me into agreeing to<br/>\nmeet them Sat to group. Yes, I&#39;m a wimp. Should I try<br/>\nto sit down and have a heart to heart talk with them<br/>\nabout what they are doing wrong?<br/>\nSuggestions please!<br/>\nNot sure how to handle it and thought maybe someone<br/>\nhere might have been there and done that and could<br/>\npass on a bit of advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening anyway,<br/>\nHugs,<br/>\n:o)<br/>\nBrangvyne<br/>\nRanger - 11th lvl<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Christina Norman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tina@...\">tina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; You can petition and ask a guide to change your name<br/>\n&gt; for reasons of <br/>\n&gt; divorce.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - Christina<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Thu, 14 Nov 2002, Brangvyne Accampo wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Salutation All!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Say is it possible to get unmarried in EQ?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I mean suppose your &quot;spouse&quot; quits playing and you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; find interest elsewhere or somehting.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just curious.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hugs!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; :o)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Brangvyne Nic Ne Sidhe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 10th lvl Ranger<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
