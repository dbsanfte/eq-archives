If I wanted to play a game where people ran around killing each<br/>\nother I would go back to Ultima Online. Which I wouldn&#39;t because I left<br/>\nthat damn game just for the pvp reason. (I&#39;m very upset with the whole<br/>\npvp thing as you may have noticed.) My sweetie says he and his friends<br/>\nare going to go play on it and would I like to join. Isn&#39;t it funny<br/>\nthat all the people I&#39;ve heard of that want to go kill each other are<br/>\nguys!? hmmm? If I wanted to play with a bunch of asinine 13 yr old boys<br/>\nI would go back to UO. Ok, I&#39;m a little bitter. *laughs* Btw, have you<br/>\nguys been to that page where EQ players can have their pics put up? I<br/>\nwent and had a look around and to my suprise half of the pics up there<br/>\nwere women! I&#39;m thinking maybe we aren&#39;t as rare as I had thought! :) I<br/>\njust sent mine in today so maybe he will have it up in a couple days.<br/>\nYou guys have to go look at it, they&#39;re funny I promise. Ok, two of<br/>\nthem should make you laugh. One definitely will. *snickers*<br/>\nI have a char already on Quellious and would be thrilled to get<br/>\ntogether with ya&#39;ll. I hope the time is ok, I have a volunteer project<br/>\ngoing on from July 26th to the 6th of August and won&#39;t be home until<br/>\nafter 6 those nights. If I can&#39;t make it, maybe we can plan for another<br/>\ntime again later? *Smiles* Happy Hunting!<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nAttention ONElist list owners!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html</a><br/>\nCheck out the new &quot;DEFAULT MODERATED STATUS&quot; option.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
