I found a really pretty glade in Lesser Faydark, but again there&#39;s<br/>\nsome ooc and shout traffic.  The Arena in Lake Rathe is a really good spot!  I think<br/>\nyou&#39;ll have a beautiful wedding, Wendy.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou see, we&#39;ve been betrothed since June.  We had certain things we wanted to<br/>\naccomplish, and we&#39;re almost there, but it&#39;s been a long wait.  So I want everything to<br/>\nbe beautiful and perfect and all that good stuff. =)  When I was playing UO, it was<br/>\ndifferent... you could have a wedding dress, and bridesmaid&#39;s colors, and colored armor<br/>\nfor the guys, and we even had a red carpet in our castle, hehe.  Flowers and food and<br/>\nwine set out and alla that good stuff.  I don&#39;t know how to make it special here.<br/>\n*sighs*<br/>\n<br/>\nSuzanne<br/>\nSara/Aelwesara, Povar<br/>\n<br/>\nChristina Norman wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Christina Norman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tina@...\">tina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The wedding was awesome! We had a wonderful ceremony by Imaryn the head<br/>\n&gt; guide of the server.  After the ceremony we had a celebration with<br/>\n&gt; friends.

Not too deep but that&#39;s it ;) Location is the most<br/>\n&gt; important thing to think of.  I chose ocean of tears so we wouldn&#39;t be<br/>\n&gt; spammed by lots of OOC talk (and the sisters isle was just so perfect for<br/>\n&gt; Luna).<br/>\n&gt; - Tina </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
