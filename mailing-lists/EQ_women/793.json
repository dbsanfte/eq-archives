Is there a penalty for this of some kind,<br/>\nlosing items, exp. or something?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Check the /who for the zone to get the names of the<br/>\nclerics in the zone before you start fighting if the<br/>\nnearest city is rather far away that way you can send<br/>\nthem a tell when you die, most of the time they are<br/>\nquiet willing to help you out. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, the example of what happened late last night<br/>\nmight be a good one. I had last bound in Kaladim (sp)<br/>\nand needed to go to Steamfont in search of a Micro<br/>\nServo. I was wondering around doing OK but not finding<br/>\nwhat I needed. There were a few fights but nothing I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t handle when I came across some Minatour<br/>\nSlavers. They were dark blue and there were a couple<br/>\nof them so I didn&#39;t want to chance it alone. I started<br/>\nback toward town to see if I could enlist someone to<br/>\ncome back with me and help free the Gnome slaves. On<br/>\nthe way I stopped and fought something and got about<br/>\nhalf way wounded. I was standing there tossing a<br/>\ncouple minor heals on myself just in case I ran into<br/>\nsomehting else when I was attacked from behind by a<br/>\nskeleton. I turned to fight but it was a white threat<br/>\nand being half wounded already it finished me off.<br/>\nI reappeared in Kelethin and started back to get my<br/>\nbody, but in the dark I think I missed my turn in<br/>\nLesser Feydark and I was ambushed by a Brownie and<br/>\nkilled again, so back to Kelethin.<br/>\nFortunately, a found a very kind lvl 54 Shadow night<br/>\nthat I knew who was online and met me and helped me<br/>\nretrieve my bodies.<br/>\n:o)<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t even the first time I&#39;ve died once or twice<br/>\nsimply trying to retrieve the body from when I died<br/>\nthe first time.<br/>\nJust gets kind of frustrating at times.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s one game feature I would happily have done<br/>\nwithout.<br/>\n:o)<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter helping me get my body she literally sat me down<br/>\nin the game and had a long time with me about EQ and<br/>\npointed out a few facts of life on Narreth etc. :o) It<br/>\nwas very sweet of her, and I picked up a few pointers<br/>\nas well.<br/>\n<br/>\n:o)<br/>\nBrangvyne<br/>\nlvl 10 Wood Elf Ranger<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nU2 on LAUNCH - Exclusive greatest hits videos<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://launch.yahoo.com/u2\">http://launch.yahoo.com/u2</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
