The swamp was a new experience alright, and so<br/>\nwas the famed troll regeneration (watch those HPs zoooom up!). But the<br/>\nfunniest thing was when I flirted with an ogre warrior in Grobb (some big<br/>\nbad &#39;un with a last name). After all the recent discussion here on flirting<br/>\nand females getting items, I decided to try out my trollie charms on this<br/>\nogre. All I did was to comment (in my well spoken troll dialect) on what a<br/>\nfine basher he seemed to be and emote &quot;:bats her eyelashes at [player]&quot; and<br/>\nall of a sudden I received 1 platinum! For a lvl 2 trollie SK, this was<br/>\nindeed a fine gift... I guess trollie women have something to teach my<br/>\ndwarven cleric when it comes to turning mens heads because my cleric never<br/>\nreceived such a fine gift... :)<br/>\nAfter this encounter, my trollie character is convinced she is indeed<br/>\nattractive, but I doubt she will carry her flirting further than the<br/>\neyelashes at the moment. Still it&#39;s proof that it&#39;s not just the wood elves<br/>\nthat can make a killing by flirting... :) /em smiles fiercely<br/>\n<br/>\nGobba, alias Disa, alias me</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
