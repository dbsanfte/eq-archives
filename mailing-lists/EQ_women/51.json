Even though its not very much fun, I find it <br/>\ngood to stay near your city of origin until you hit level 6.  That is when you <br/>\nbegin to have a week to retrieve your corpse.  I have a level 2 human ranger <br/>\nnamed Lanla on the Prexus server.  Perhaps if we are on at the same time we <br/>\ncan adventure together.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;===== Original Message From <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@onelist.com\">EQ_women@onelist.com</a> =====<br/>\n&gt;From: sgj &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sgj31@...\">sgj31@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hello Everyone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m Tbaald, only a level 3 Half-Elf Ranger on the Prexus Server.

Right now that&#39;s about all I can offer a group.<br/>\n&gt;:) I&#39;m trying to make my way back to High Hold Pass to retrieve my corpse.<br/>\n&gt;( I believe I have a week of real time while I&#39;m below Level 5 or 6. ) The<br/>\n&gt;group I was with got separated from me while zoning and I subsequently had<br/>\n&gt;no protectors when a Lion decided to take me out. I also had no one to loot<br/>\n&gt;my corpse for me and bring back my stuff.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Looking forward to getting to know everyone here, and in the game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tbaald<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Where do some of the Internet&#39;s largest email lists reside?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;At ONElist - the most scalable and reliable service on the Internet. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
