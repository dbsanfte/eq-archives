That&#39;s really the only thing you have to think about.  I dated<br/>\nsomeone 14 years older than me and since our life experiences were so<br/>\ndifferent, and our aims and goals so different, we were unable to resolve<br/>\nour disparity.  Of course, we couldn&#39;t tell that at the beginning of the<br/>\nrelationship.  It took three years out of our lives and caused a great deal<br/>\nof anguish, as neither of us could forgive the other for not bridging that<br/>\ngap more perfectly.  Like I said (IMO), that&#39;s the big question.

A friend got me<br/>\n&gt; into the game, and I played it just as a game. I don&#39;t think I<br/>\n&gt; realized how much I looked forward to running into certain<br/>\n&gt; friends/characters in the game. I have made what I feel to be many<br/>\n&gt; good friendships. Ok to the question. One friend that I felt very<br/>\n&gt; close to became closer. We talked on the phone and kept in touch<br/>\n&gt; almost everyday. I am divorced and single and he is single. He came<br/>\n&gt; to Arizona to visit me and sure one thing led to another and the<br/>\n&gt; rest is history. We are both wildly happy and in love, want to spend<br/>\n&gt; the rest of our lives together and fade into the sunset happily ever<br/>\n&gt; after. Here is my dilema ~ like I said I am 43, a young 43 (and its<br/>\n&gt; not me saying that) my picture is on my profile ~ he is 20, a very<br/>\n&gt; mature, responsible 20 but none the less 20. What in the hell do I<br/>\n&gt; do??? Most of me wants to say screw what others might think and just<br/>\n&gt; be happy with him, but the rest of me says leave him to live his<br/>\n&gt; life. When I discuss that with him he just says stop trying to find<br/>\n&gt; excuses why we can&#39;t be together and just be happy. How can I argue<br/>\n&gt; with that??? Some advice ladies?? please<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
