Is it just <br>me? Have I got too much wussiness \n  factor in me? Or am I just a <br>mediocre role-player? Or both?!?! ;)</tt></p>\n  <p><tt><font color=\"#0000ff\">I only tried playing a male character once and it \n  felt just too strange.&nbsp; In fact, I also have trouble playing the less \n  feminine style characters.&nbsp; I find myself drawn to the graphics and so \n  finally gave up.&nbsp; I like the sexy little female things like wood elves, \n  humans, and barbarians.&nbsp; I think it is because I&#39;ll never have a young \n  perky body again and I miss it.&nbsp; Getting old has very negative impact on \n  the body (the mind, on the other hand, makes it an almost fair \n  trade).</font></tt></p>\n  <p><tt></tt><tt>Also.. has anyone else had their heart broken in eq? Silly \n  question I <br>know, but i guess I just want reassurance that I&#39;m not alone \n  here ;P </tt></p>\n  <p><tt><font color=\"#0000ff\">More than once, in fact.&nbsp; And I don&#39;t think \n  it&#39;s a silly question or even silly.&nbsp; The game is so immersive that I \n  have found it has a greater emotional impact on me than my real life.&nbsp; \n  Now, perhaps that is because my real life is stable and very happy and my \n  biggest worry is finding a good landscape architect.&nbsp; </font></tt></p>\n  <p><font color=\"#0000ff\"><tt>But recently when the RL girlfriend of my in-game \n  fiancee decided to be jealous and paranoid and asked him to stop seeing me I \n  was heartbroken.&nbsp; The game just felt so flat without that \n  relationship.&nbsp; I think a big reason I&#39;m not playing right now, other than \n  being on vacation for the month, has been the loss of that \n  relationship.</tt></font></p>\n  <p><tt></tt><tt></tt><tt>In fact, I met a guy the other day whose heart was \n  broken by a girl <br>in eq, so it&#39;s not just a girlie thing i guess..</tt></p>\n  <p><tt><font color=\"#0000ff\">No, I know a young man who has been through three \n  heartbreaking relationships in the course of my knowing him.&nbsp; For him \n  Norrath presents a way of &quot;testing the waters&quot; of relationships as he is just \n  starting college this year.&nbsp; </font></tt></p>\n  <p><tt>Btw, i&#39;m in Australia in rl, and my Tunare chars are Athens, Rynni \n  <br>and Lrynn (tho Lrynn may be taking a break..) and on Morell-Thule are \n  <br>Jhasper, Leilanni and Volare.</tt></p>\n  <p><font color=\"#0000ff\"><tt>Iceiallana and Cerres </tt></font></p>\n  <p><font color=\"#0000ff\"><tt>Brell \nServer</tt></font></p></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
