I love being able to heal my group, yet get in there and fight it out by their side. I enjoy buffing my friends and debuffing the bad guys, and then there&#39;s always panic-burn. A Shaman can do *anything!*<br/>\n<br/>\nThough I&#39;ve been grouping with these two *wonderful* little wood elves lately and they make me feel uncomfortably tall....<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and 5 being a Shaman so far. I was always frustrated with my<br/>\n&gt;limitations as a Cleric and took on way too much responsibility for<br/>\n&gt;other people&#39;s lives, which made grouping a very un-fun experience. I<br/>\n&gt;love being a Shaman so far. ( I&#39;ve made 2 new characters in Quellios.<br/>\n&gt;Bloodless and Blacksatin) Go ahead and laugh at the names, it&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt;best I can do on such short notice! I agonized believe me. Someone even<br/>\n&gt;called me &quot;campy&quot;!- whatever that means. I&#39;m only 25, that term&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;before my time. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a definition of campy, but, as a friend of mine put it &quot;I know camp when I see it.&quot; So some good examples of campy are Xena: Warrior Princess and The Mummy. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I have noticed that a lot of us have said that we play clerics, it<br/>\n&gt;seems more than any other class. (Or maybe I only notice the clerics<br/>\n&gt;because I play one.)I hope this doesn&#39;t offend you all, but I wonder if<br/>\n&gt;we have chosen to play one because we are by nature nurturing and<br/>\n&gt;helpfull, or because we have been raised in our society to act servile<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think being a healer is servile.. on the contrary, I feel a small surge of power when I keep someone from dying! I think &quot;If it wasn&#39;t for me, that person would have a long run for his corpse.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPix/Shalka/Megan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGet your FREE Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mailcity.lycos.com\">http://mailcity.lycos.com</a><br/>\nGet your PERSONALIZED START PAGE at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://my.lycos.com\">http://my.lycos.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
