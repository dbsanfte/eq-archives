I foresee a great<br/>\nnumber of the people I currently have on ignore suddenly leaving<br/>\nPovar........heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I&#39;ve mentioned before that I have a character on the PvP server, Rallos<br/>\nZek.  I made her after a couple of my guild brothers scoped it out and decided<br/>\nit was alot cooler than previously thought.  People who kill newbies are<br/>\nostracized and ridiculed.  I had others of my race calling me &quot;little sister&quot;<br/>\nand giving me things that they had outgrown.  People who kill others of their<br/>\nrace (at least, the dark elves work this way) are also ostracized.  And I must<br/>\nadmit, with shame, that I had a great time hunting down humans in the forest<br/>\naround Neriak.  I never actually killed one by myself, so I never looted, and I<br/>\nprobably wouldn&#39;t anyway.  The point is, it was a darker side of RP that I found<br/>\ninteresting to explore.  Will it change when the race server opens up?<br/>\nProbably.  Will I check out the race war server? Probably.  Will that be my new<br/>\n&quot;home&quot;? Decidedly not. I&#39;ve lived with pk&#39;s in MUDS, RPG&#39;s (UO for sure, plus a<br/>\ncouple other more obscure games), and even RTS&#39;s.  I like not having to deal<br/>\nwith them daily on EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nSara, Povar<br/>\n<br/>\nMitzi wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Mitzi&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mitzi@...\">mitzi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Had to speak up on this one..
