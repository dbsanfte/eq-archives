Never hurts <br/>\nto have proof when you petition... GMs will give you a email address you can <br/>\nsend the screenshots to so they can see them.  And if you dont know how to <br/>\ntake a screenshot... its the - key (minus key) on the number key pad.  It <br/>\nwill tell you whenever you take a shot.  it will save the pictuire in your <br/>\neverquest folder and they will be called EQ000001.bmp... EQ000002.bmp.... <br/>\netc.... if you are going to email them, be nice cuz they are 901k in size... <br/>\nzip them or change them to jpgs (zip is better, doesnt mess up the picture <br/>\nany)<br/>\n<br/>\ni always have tons of sceenshots, of anything that happens... if someones <br/>\nrude, mean, anything.... just in case i ever need it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Page Kennon &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pickone@...\">pickone@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@onelist.com\">EQ_women@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@onelist.com\">EQ_women@onelist.com</a>&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@onelist.com\">EQ_women@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [EQ_women] happenings<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wed, 07 Jul 1999 05:07:21 -0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi everyone,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have a question for You all, i dont know if anyone else has<br/>\n&gt;experianced this but well here goes.  I wont go in to which server and<br/>\n&gt;what characters but on the server that i play on a friend of mine was<br/>\n&gt;accused of stealing from another player, they say they didnt see the<br/>\n&gt;other person in the room and the other party involved swears on them<br/>\n&gt;sitting on top of this item for some reason they have dropped in the<br/>\n&gt;floor.  Now for the reasons this was in the floor i still dont<br/>\n&gt;understand.  Now this is me but if something is laying there its open<br/>\n&gt;for the taking people drop unwanted stuff all the time.  I wont go into<br/>\n&gt;all the deltails but there was a big todo about it and i was trying to<br/>\n&gt;talk my friend into giving it back and had them talked into it when the<br/>\n&gt;other party in question and their friends started threating.  Ok now<br/>\n&gt;this makes me angery be cause they threaten them with having a GM friend<br/>\n&gt;delete their character.  By this point i am angery one because i do what<br/>\n&gt;ever i can to help people, so i let them know how stupid i though this<br/>\n&gt;whole matter was to try to get someone deleted.... this lovely female if<br/>\n&gt;she was inturn desided she wanted to call me a bitch while all along i<br/>\n&gt;am trying to get her her things back in which i did.  Now i will take<br/>\n&gt;alot but that was something that was uncalled for me knowing if all of<br/>\n&gt;them had just kept their mouths shut i could have gotten the stuff back<br/>\n&gt;with out any furth happenings other than what had gone on before i<br/>\n&gt;logged on.  Has this happened to anyone else or is my server just full<br/>\n&gt;of rude Arse people?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Page :o) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
