We chatted and agreed that Brell Serelis would be a great server to<br/>\n&gt; have the meeting on.  This way we can all meet eachother, and also have a<br/>\n&gt; subsequent guild event.  The subsequent event would be a newbie hunt,<br/>\n&gt; during which newbies could hunt critters, and higher level guild members<br/>\n&gt; could help them out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d like to hold a brief vote on the time and place of the meeting on<br/>\n&gt; brell.

Even<br/>\n&gt; if you&#39;re not planning on playing on Brell, you can make a newbie and join<br/>\n&gt; the guild, to use this feature.  It allows us to send tells to our entire<br/>\n&gt; guild, so we can hear conversation even if we&#39;re not exactly in the same<br/>\n&gt; physical area.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d also like to suggest an unofficial guild hunt Saturday August 7th at<br/>\n&gt; noon PST.  The location will be wherever the official one will be held<br/>\n&gt; (results posted Friday evening).

It<br/>\n&gt; may be primitive, but it is virtual reality, and to anyone who&#39;s ever had<br/>\n&gt; someone tap them on the shoulder because they&#39;ve been talking to you for<br/>\n&gt; five minutes and you haven&#39;t heard a damned thing knows, it&#39;s immersive<br/>\n&gt; virtual reality.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; People naturally try and relate to their virtual reality experience like<br/>\n&gt; they would to their real life experience.  This doesn&#39;t mean they take<br/>\n&gt; everything as seriously (otherwise death would reallly suck) but they will<br/>\n&gt; naturally impose real life qualities in terms of how them form<br/>\n&gt; relationships and socialize online.  These natural social tendancies may<br/>\n&gt; be modified by concious choice, but at the root they are all there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; People are used to classifying another person&#39;s gender.  You don&#39;t walk up<br/>\n&gt; to someone on the street (usually) and say &quot;you look like a boy, you act<br/>\n&gt; like a boy, are you a boy?&quot; We&#39;re expected to recognize these qualities,<br/>\n&gt; classify the person as a boy, and then relate to them as a boy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; People do this same thing naturally in EQ, though not to as an extreme.<br/>\n&gt; For example:<br/>\n&gt;     - You see a male character, you assume this is a male player, you&#39;d<br/>\n&gt;       probably need to be told outright by the person they were female<br/>\n&gt;       to believe otherwise.<br/>\n&gt;     - You see a female character, things are more complicated:<br/>\n&gt;         - Most people will not try and classify her gender directly I<br/>\n&gt;           think.  They&#39;ll be aware that most female EQ characters are<br/>\n&gt;           played by males.  This introduces gender confusion.  They don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;           know how to really deal with a person with a female body but<br/>\n&gt;           a male mind so they&#39;ll basicly treat the person like a female<br/>\n&gt;           on the surface, but probably not commit to their gender.<br/>\n&gt;         - If that female character exhibits behavioral characteristics<br/>\n&gt;           that seem female it is very comfortable to allow your gender<br/>\n&gt;           &#39;no commitment&#39; stance to slip into &#39;this person is a female<br/>\n&gt;           in real life&#39;.<br/>\n&gt;         - Likewise if this character exhibits male characteristics,<br/>\n&gt;           the person may slip into the assumption the player is male.<br/>\n&gt;           All this avoids the need to ask the person what their gender is.<br/>\n&gt;         - FLIRTING OF ANY KIND is assumed to indicate gender under the<br/>\n&gt;           assumption the player is heterosexual.<br/>\n&gt;         - Some people are aware enough of the complexity of online gender,<br/>\n&gt;           and care enough about real life gender, to skip all this and ask<br/>\n&gt;           (usually to confirm their assumptions)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Queer people get screwed by this in many ways.  Lots of people who<br/>\n&gt; probably wouldn&#39;t ID as queer also get screwed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The above rules are arbitrary, and dumb! They are the rules most people go<br/>\n&gt; by.  If a person decides on your real life gender by these rules, even<br/>\n&gt; worse if a group of people decide on your gender, their is the fundamental<br/>\n&gt; assumption that you actively deceived them.  Lets not pull punches,<br/>\n&gt; everyone who decides your gender, when you reveal you are of the other<br/>\n&gt; gender, will basicly have their entire gender model of you flipped upside<br/>\n&gt; down.  This will create confusion, and potentially hostility.  Of course<br/>\n&gt; anyone who is not a jerk should realize that their assumptions were wrong,<br/>\n&gt; but most people are jerks about gender.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So what can you do to protect yourself in this environment?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You can be up front about your real-life gender.  This will however to<br/>\n&gt; some degree prevent you from getting into intense gender interaction with<br/>\n&gt; people as a member of your online perceived gender.  Playing a person of<br/>\n&gt; the opposite gender in EQ is a great way to explore gender in a fun<br/>\n&gt; environment.  Exploring gender is fun and good.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You can be passive about your gender.  This is what our list boys have<br/>\n&gt; done.  They let people assume their genders as females, since they didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; actively in this way deceive anyone.  I think this is perfectly 100% ok.<br/>\n&gt; Now however they&#39;re getting screwed over by the realization that they can<br/>\n&gt; no longer safely come out without alienating some of their friends.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You can lie outright about your gender.  I think this is perfectly ok as<br/>\n&gt; well.  Why? Because you&#39;re not hurting anyone.  Really the gender / sexual<br/>\n&gt; orientation hangups of other people is not our problem.  Really, our<br/>\n&gt; gender in real life is irrelevant to the game of Everquest.  People<br/>\n&gt; demand to know real life gender because they have hangups about online /<br/>\n&gt; real life gender continuity.  Tough luck! It&#39;s not your responsibility to<br/>\n&gt; support their environment where they have this kind of knowledge.  You<br/>\n&gt; never aksed to be part of that environment.  You can also say &quot;I won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; answer that question&quot; but people will eventually assume you&#39;re not of your<br/>\n&gt; perceived gender, and they&#39;ll mistrust you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; People don&#39;t like to lie.  They like to be honest, especially with people<br/>\n&gt; they have good social relationships with.  I think it&#39;s important to<br/>\n&gt; realize that an relationship in an online virtual reality is not like a<br/>\n&gt; real life social relationship.  Unless you are going to have some kind of<br/>\n&gt; real life social relationship with someone online, I think it&#39;s perfectly<br/>\n&gt; reasonable to lie about your gender, your sexual orientation, anything if<br/>\n&gt; it creates an environment you&#39;re more comfortable with.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We are the queer gender-exploring fringe, moving into an online virtual<br/>\n&gt; environment.  The straight heterosexist establishment is imposing on VR<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s own moral code, but I feel no need to participate in it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Christina<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 3<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sat, 7 Aug 1999 11:03:05 -0600 (MDT)<br/>\n&gt;    From: Christina Norman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tina@...\">tina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Online Gaming Gender Rant<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Whoops, that last message was actually intended for EQ_rainbow, where<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;re having a discussion about when online gender and real life gender<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t coincide.

The subsequent event would be a newbie hunt,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;during which newbies could hunt critters, and higher level guild<br/>\nmembers<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;could help them out.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I&#39;d like to hold a brief vote on the time and place of the meeting on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;brell.  The time matters because we all have different schedules.  The<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;place only matters in terms of where the newbie hunt will take place.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Please respond to this email if you have a preference (if you don&#39;t<br/>\ncare,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;you dont need to respond).  If any given meeting time is impossible<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;you, please say that, I&#39;ll try and minimize those conflicts.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Meeting places:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;    - Greater Faydark stone ring (kelethin newbie zone)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;    - East Freeport newbie zone<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Meeting times:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;    - Tuesday August 10th 6pm-8pm PST<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;    - Thursday August 10th 6pm-8pm PST<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;    - Saturday August 14th 10am-12pm PST<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Vote will be closed friday at 6pm PST and I&#39;ll post the results that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;evening.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I&#39;d like to use the guild chat feature to make our meeting easier.<br/>\nEven<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;if you&#39;re not planning on playing on Brell, you can make a newbie and<br/>\njoin<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the guild, to use this feature.  It allows us to send tells to our<br/>\nentire<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;guild, so we can hear conversation even if we&#39;re not exactly in the<br/>\nsame<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;physical area.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I&#39;d also like to suggest an unofficial guild hunt Saturday August 7th<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;noon PST.  The location will be wherever the official one will be held<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;(results posted Friday evening).  This is for those of us who&#39;d like<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;get into playing together ASAP.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;- Christina<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;--------------------------- ONElist<br/>\nSponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;How do you enter ONElist&#39;s WEEKLY DRAWING for $100?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;By joining the FRIENDS & FAMILY program.

The disadvantage was not being able to look<br/>\ninto his<br/>\n&gt; eyes.  The advantage was no interruptive shouts, casting, ooc, auctions<br/>\netc.<br/>\n&gt; *grin*  We discussed the honeymoon and both agreed &quot;PG&quot; and he said he is<br/>\nnot a<br/>\n&gt; minor *really, a BIG concern on my part* so we can play it a little more<br/>\nadult<br/>\n&gt; *grin*.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As for the RL thing, we both share the same fear.  We got into it a<br/>\nlittle, out<br/>\n&gt; of curiousity, neither of us wanting to lose the fun of the roleplay.  He<br/>\nguessed<br/>\n&gt; I was 21 *bwahahahahahah*  I don&#39;t think knowing he was off by 25 years<br/>\nwas the<br/>\n&gt; best news he heard all night, but on the other hand the roleplay at the<br/>\ntime went<br/>\n&gt; well.  And we had a good time travelling back to Freeport, but got<br/>\ndisconnected<br/>\n&gt; once there as he smiths and orders started pouring in as soon as he showed<br/>\nup on<br/>\n&gt; /w and I got about 10 requests for binds and had bows and arrows to sell<br/>\nand and<br/>\n&gt; and - it was like being in a busy city - I hated it *grin*.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I still don&#39;t know if it has an effect.  This morning started out okay,<br/>\nthen he<br/>\n&gt; announced he thinks our characters are on the wrong servers and we should<br/>\nbring<br/>\n&gt; the humans to Vallon since he doesn&#39;t want to be a warrior and lose his<br/>\nfavorite<br/>\n&gt; weapon to another player (MEN!).  I was TOTALLY disappointed as I like my<br/>\n&gt; Barbarian shaman a lot, even if she is only 4.  And before we had a chance<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; talk, he went afk, then returned with &quot;gotta go&quot; which is more abrupt than<br/>\n&gt; normal.  An old friend had just popped in out of nowhere.  So I suddently<br/>\nfelt<br/>\n&gt; like it HAD mattered, and also feel like I&quot;m overly paranoid.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The good news is I switched to Quellious, met up with one of my<br/>\nbridesmaids and<br/>\n&gt; her ranger friend, we hunted and the more I thought the more I realized it<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; just bad timing.  Well, this couple (though not anything but friends they<br/>\nprotest<br/>\n&gt; overly much all the time *grin*) is also human on Vallon so I think I&#39;ll<br/>\nhonor<br/>\n&gt; Cor&#39;s request and we&#39;ll move our humans there only instead of being a<br/>\ncleric to<br/>\n&gt; his monk, I&#39;m going to be a Druid and Sibonay&#39;s little sister.  Her<br/>\nfriend,<br/>\n&gt; Tenadar on Quellious is a  monk, Andus, so we&#39;d be matched couples. And<br/>\nnow it<br/>\n&gt; sounds kind of fun.  As all four of us roleplay, we should have a blast.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And if it does affect the roleplay then it is better to find out now,<br/>\nright?  The<br/>\n&gt; problem is if one partner wants it to evolve into more than it can ever be<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; the other does not.  As it can&#39;t on my part, that was my concern (leading<br/>\nhim<br/>\n&gt; along) and that being settled is probably important.  And if he starts<br/>\nsleeping<br/>\n&gt; instead of playing with me, it&#39;s probabaly a good thing too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dnaice, Trisango, Troxfo<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (RP doesn&#39;t escape any of the complexities of RL, does it &lt;well other than<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; toilet thing&gt;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:weya@...\">weya@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:weya@...\">weya@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Greetings everyone!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;ooc&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well it seems I may have spoken just a bit too soon, lol!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Yesterday I wrote that I expected to have to face the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; honeymoon roleplay eventually.  Well, it seems eventually<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is coming sooner than I thought! &lt;g&gt;  Ok, ok, I&#39;ll spit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it out. :-)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;ic&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Last night Rezok proposed to me ... and I accepted!! :-)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Isn&#39;t it thrilling?! &lt;claps her hands in excitement&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We&#39;ve not set a date or ironed out any plans yet.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think I was just too excited being *betrothed* to think<br/>\n&gt; &gt; clearly on all the details.  And oh! there&#39;s so many<br/>\n&gt; &gt; details. &lt;mind races&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It was sooooo romantic.  He secretly planned to have two<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of our closest friends there to witness.  And then he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; recited a beautiful poem to me ... the last line of which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was &quot;Will you marry me, we&#39;d make quite a pair&quot;.  I sat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stunned for a moment, then blurted out &quot;Really?&quot; (what a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fool I felt later).  It took me some doing to find my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; voice and answer &quot;YES&quot; ... poor fellow had to sit there<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and wait while I got my brain to working again. &lt;s&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anyways, I could ramble on and on ... so I&#39;ll spare you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all. :-)  Once we have the wedding details ironed out, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shall let you all know ... for of course, you&#39;re all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; invited. &lt;s&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Safe travels,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Wynsong<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; P.S. - Dnaice, I shall try very hard to attend your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wedding. :-)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ~~~ Remember that our illusion of control is just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that ... an illusion ~~~<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:weya@...\">weya@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:weya@...\">weya@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; ICQ#1976509<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;___________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n_<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ___<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;___________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n_<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ___<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Message: 9<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Date: Thu, 05 Aug 1999 11:41:54 -0700<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   From: Judy Tyrer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:judy3t@...\">judy3t@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Subject: Re: Marriage<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;It is so interesting to read one another&#39;s experiences.  We are<br/>\nstarting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to talk a bit more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;about RL, he has a Golden Retriever, lives in VA, etc.  He knows<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am a CS and AI is my hobby<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;(I explained I had learned why he runs around in circles and then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; disappers and his brain<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;went into overdrive *smile*).  I suspect he may be a student as he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t have &quot;regular&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;work hours, but then I&#39;m &quot;on the beach&quot; at work since the recent<br/>\n&gt; &gt; take-over obsoleted my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;technology so one never really knows *smile*.   I did make my first<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reference to &quot;our&quot; when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;discussing missing my dog (OES, she died 2 mos. ago) and he didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cringe outwardly.  Didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;comment either so it could have gone right over his head.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Okay, I&#39;m neurotic.  I&#39;m afraid if he finds out I&#39;m a married mother<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of 2 he might lose<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;interest and he is the most fun part of the game.  *sigh*  This is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; worse then RL.  Oh, and as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;for the toilets, I noticed their lack when I got drunk and needed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to throw up.  There was no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;place to puke!  Very embarassing.  And as my aclohol level is 3,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the wedding party itself may<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;be a disaster.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;The honeymoon will definitely be PG.  I sort of view this is my<br/>\nequivalent<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to the romance<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;novel *grin*.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Dnaice on Quellious<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Trisango on Brel Serillis<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Troxfo on Vallon Zek<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;P.S.  The wedding is Sunday, Aug. 7 at the Temple of Marr (outside)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in N.

When we roleplay we do it in talk rather than say - but our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; /ems have been known to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;produce a lot of puking and &quot;Get a room&quot; comments from those around<br/>\n&gt; &gt; us *smile*<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:weya@...\">weya@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:weya@...\">weya@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Dnaice,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; You bring up a bridge that I know I will have to cross eventually<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as well.  My character,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Wynsong, is very serious about a high elf named Rezok on Fenin<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ro.  OOC, I know very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; little about the person behind the character save that he&#39;s male,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a few years younger<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; than me, and married (his r/l wife plays a character that is like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a big sister to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Wynsong).  Because I&#39;m very happily married in r/l, very soon into<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the rp &quot;relationship&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I set some expectations that the relationship was rp-only ... which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; his response was &quot;of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; course&quot;  (what a relief that was).  I felt stupid bringing it up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at all, but after some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; experiences in Realm where ppl wanted the char&#39;s relationship to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spill over to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; players, I learned to speak up front to avoid sticky situations<br/>\n&gt; &gt; later.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; As for the honeymoon ... you can rp that any way you wish.  It<br/>\n&gt; &gt; depends upon what &quot;rating&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;g&gt; you want that portion of the rp to be.  It can simply be the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; two of you &quot;retire&quot; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the honeymoon suite and then chat about the weather while everyone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; accepts that it&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; wedding night.  You could decide to go on a trip to a &quot;romantic&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spot in Norrath and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; hunt, explore, etc.  Or if you wish, you could take the roleplay<br/>\n&gt; &gt; further ....   To me,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the roleplaying is about how the character(s) is perceived in<br/>\nNorrath.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  So that doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mean I have to roleplay every single detail.  Heck, we don&#39;t roleplay<br/>\n&gt; &gt; going to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; bathroom or showering or any of the hundreds of mundane (or not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so mundane) personal<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; things we do irl.  Personally, my honeymoon will probably be rated<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pg to pg-13 &lt;g&gt; ...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Disney would prolly be able to put it in one of their movies, lol.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  But the concept of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; honeymoon will be there<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; for everyone (us, friends, &quot;family&quot;) ... and that&#39;s the important<br/>\n&gt; &gt; part.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; As a side note ... I did have a marriage on Realm and while the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; characters were<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; roleplaying their &quot;true love&quot; for the world ... the other player<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and I would be /t&#39;ing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; each other chatting about all kinds of &lt;ic&gt; and &lt;ooc&gt; stuff.  When<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it came time for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; honeymoon, we retired to the bedroom while our friends partied<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in the next room ... and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; just joked around and chatted some more.  For the role play, we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; had gone to the marriage<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; bed ... for us, the players, we had not crossed any lines that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would complicate our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; personal r/l relationships.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Ok, well I&#39;ve rambled enough.  Thanks for putting up with it as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I thought through my own<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; eventual situation.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Hey, btw ...

Unlike<br/>\n&gt; &gt; many who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; develop relationships in Norrath, my beloved and I are unknown<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to one another in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; RL.  For all I know he weighs 300 pounds, guzzles beer, and is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hygenically<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; challenged *smile*<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; There are times if I wonder if this is a positive thing to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doing.  I mean,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; what if he is some starry eyed adolescent and I ruin him for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; life *grin*.  I know<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; MY lines are clearly drawn in fuzz (okay, I think I know the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; difference between<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; reality and fantasy though I swear I saw a Pixie Trickster in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the airport the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; other day *grin*).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Anyway, this is all fun and games and I am having fun.  But there<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is this part in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the back of my mind that wonders.  Because unlike reading romance<br/>\n&gt; &gt; novels (blech -<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; persish the thought) there is another person involved in my little<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fantasy and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; must never forget that.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Any other hard core role players out there struggle with these<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ridiculous<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; issues?  Any other players over the age of 25, for that matter<br/>\n&gt; &gt; *smile*<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dnaice on Quellious<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Trisango on Brell Serilis<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; --------------------------- ONElist<br/>\nSponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;___________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n_<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ___<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;___________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n_<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ___<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You can WIN $100 to Amazon.com by starting a new list at ONElist.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Drawing is held each week through August 20.
