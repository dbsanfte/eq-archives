Guys are just too silly aren&#39;t they? They see a blonde graphic and <br/>\n&gt;start<br/>\n&gt;to follow it around, but won&#39;t do the same for a brunette graphic? No <br/>\n&gt;wonder<br/>\n&gt;they fall for silicone breasts and bleach blondes in real life! :)<br/>\n&gt;As I play a dwarf I have a less &quot;seductive&quot; look in-game, something I share<br/>\n&gt;with other short people like gnomes and halflings (and of course ogres and<br/>\n&gt;trolls :) I guess the programmers like the long legged half nudes, but kept<br/>\n&gt;us short and stumpy folk in more sensible knee socks and heftier underwear.<br/>\n&gt;I personally think a lot of the female clothing looks beautiful (wood elf<br/>\n&gt;banded is one of my favourites), but I do understand the comments about it<br/>\n&gt;looking rather trampy and downright hard to wear in battle. It would be <br/>\n&gt;nice<br/>\n&gt;if there was an option to have your outfit either revealing or not so<br/>\n&gt;revealing. Like a roleplay switch sort of :) Then the female casters could<br/>\n&gt;choose a bustier look, and the warriors could (if they so wished) choose to<br/>\n&gt;cover themselves a bit more.<br/>\n&gt;Anyway, I hope this clothing issue doesn&#39;t discourage too many players. <br/>\n&gt;Male<br/>\n&gt;hormones must not be allowed to destroy our gaming experience!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Maria, aka Disa, dwarven cleric on Tunare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Congratulations to RON MARTINO<br/>\n&gt;This week&#39;s FRIENDS & FAMILY WINNER!<br/>\n&gt;To join ONElist&#39;s Friends & Family program, go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
