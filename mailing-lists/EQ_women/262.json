But if we want to party together, it will take a long<br/>\ntime to get up to a level where we could safely travel to other cities. If<br/>\nwe pick some place that already has some higher levels they could watch out<br/>\nfor us while we get to a level to party.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for newbe cities I started off as a high elf cleric, got to level 5 then<br/>\nstumbled across Halas, and I tried to start a few characters basically<br/>\nbecause of where I had friends playing and found Halas to be the perfect<br/>\ncity. Just a thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really do think if we&#39;re going to start off new characters we should do<br/>\nit at the same city so we can have someone to watch out backs.<br/>\n<br/>\nB<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Christina Norman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tina@...\">tina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A new server (not the race wars server) will be going up in the next two<br/>\n&gt;weeks.  That would seem to be the sensible server on which to try this, so<br/>\n&gt;no one is directly advantaged from previous connections on an old server.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In terms of a city, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary to have an official guild<br/>\n&gt;city.  It may be useful however to have an unofficial city, so that those<br/>\n&gt;of us who wish to group while newbies can choose to group in that city.<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;d personally recommend Kelethin/Felwithe.  My experience has been this<br/>\n&gt;is one of the best newbie zones, and one of the best social zones.<br/>\n&gt;Butcherblock, Lesser Faydark, Unrest, and Crushbone also offer a great<br/>\n&gt;range of close by zones to adventure in.  Really I think almost any newbie<br/>\n&gt;zone would suffice, there are great places to adventure everywhere.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I personally plan on playing either a High Elf or Human Cleric or<br/>\n&gt;Enchanter (can&#39;t quite choose!)  I also plan on being either a blacksmith<br/>\n&gt;or a jeweler, and will do my best to provide either armor or jewlery at a<br/>\n&gt;low cost to my guildmates.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Christina </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
