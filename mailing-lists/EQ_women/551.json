You won&#39;t make money \n  doing this.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jewlery is one of the few trades you \n  can make serious money in but it is<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; also fairly \n  competitive.&nbsp; In order to make money in jewelcraft you \n  usually<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; need a sizible investment.&nbsp; Maxing your \n  jewelcraft to 200 will cost<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; several thousand plat.&nbsp; \n  On the other hand, 50pp will get you able to make<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; some \n  jewelry.&nbsp; If you are not an enchanter you will have to pay to \n  get<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; your metal bars enchanted which is a pain.&nbsp; If \n  you have a close enchanter<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; friend you could do ok though \n  =)<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alchemy is shaman only and you have to be \n  fairly high level to do it.<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shrink and SOW potions are \n  pretty cool though, but they require a sizible<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; investment \n  (thus the high level).<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meow meow<br>&gt; \n  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tina/Luna<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Wed, 5 Jul \n  2000, Sandy Wright wrote:<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; Do any of you do a \n  trade?&nbsp; I am thinking about starting one, but can&#39;t<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  &gt; decide which.&nbsp; I am leaning toward tailoring or baking.&nbsp; If \n  anyone has<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; any tips or advice, please let me \n  know.<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; \n  Sandy-<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; ICQ- #9462081<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; AIM- \n  SandyW62<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; \n  Kulienea-<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; lvl 5 Druid<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; \n  Torvonnilous<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; \n  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; \n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  &gt; Free, Unlimited Calls Anywhere!<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; Visit \n  Firetalk.com - click below.<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/5479/14/_/552123/_/962809117/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/5479/14/_/552123/_/962809117/</a><br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  &gt; \n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  &gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&gt; \n  <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&gt; \n  <br>&gt; <br><br></tt></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
