Can you tell us a bit about it?  Getting a little<br/>\nbored in Albion *sigh*.  Are there new classes and races one can try out? <br/>\nThat might bring me to Luclin for a bit to see.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTrying to play an MMORPG with only 3-10 hours a week is a challenge.  It&#39;s<br/>\nhard to stay connected to the community with that little time.  And I will<br/>\nnever again have the time to devote to a plane raid.  Hmmm... maybe I don&#39;t<br/>\nhave the lifestyle for this anymore *cries pitifully*  <br/>\n<br/>\nIce<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet free e-mail and a permanent address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amexmail.com/?A=1\">http://www.amexmail.com/?A=1</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
