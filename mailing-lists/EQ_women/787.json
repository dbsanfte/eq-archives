Running a guild <br/>\n&gt; is a lot of work!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Retrieving bodies when you are level 10 or higher<br/>\n&gt; can be difficult. If you<br/>\n&gt; think you&#39;re going to die it&#39;s a good idea to<br/>\n&gt; quickly type<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; /l<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; this will tell you your current location. When you<br/>\n&gt; die, write down the <br/>\n&gt; number, then you can use /l to see how close you are<br/>\n&gt; to that location <br/>\n&gt; while you&#39;re trying to find your body.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Bards, Necromancers, and Shadow Knights can locate<br/>\n&gt; corpses with spells. If <br/>\n&gt; there is one in the zone they will often help you if<br/>\n&gt; you are polite. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - Christina<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Mon, 11 Nov 2002, Brangvyne wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Salutations!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Can anyone give me information about starting a<br/>\n&gt; guild, is that <br/>\n&gt; &gt; possible, or do you have to join an existing one?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Can anyone give me some sewing tips? I&#39;ve figured<br/>\n&gt; out how to take a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ruined wolf pelt and certain patterns and put them<br/>\n&gt; in the small <br/>\n&gt; &gt; sewing kit to make tunics, boots, etc. but what<br/>\n&gt; about other things. I <br/>\n&gt; &gt; have not gotten anything to work in my large<br/>\n&gt; sewing kit at all yet, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; keeps saying it&#39;s the wrong stuff. The<br/>\n&gt; instructions for sewing large <br/>\n&gt; &gt; items say use a ruined bear pelt and an<br/>\n&gt; appropriate pattern which <br/>\n&gt; &gt; patterns would those be?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Finally, for now I was with someone who died the<br/>\n&gt; other day and we <br/>\n&gt; &gt; were haveing a lot of trouble finding her body so<br/>\n&gt; she could get her <br/>\n&gt; &gt; stuff back. After a while she said that someone<br/>\n&gt; else had gotten the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; stuff for her. How does this work? If I die and<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t find my body <br/>\n&gt; &gt; how do I get my stuff back? How can I do this for<br/>\n&gt; someone else?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for any help ya&#39;ll can give,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; :o)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Brangvyne<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
