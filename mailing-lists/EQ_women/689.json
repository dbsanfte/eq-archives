I got Anarchy Online<br/>\nas well, because I was so sick of EQ when I quit, but he wanted me to play<br/>\nwith him and being at that &quot;awkward adolescent&quot; age where mothers and sons<br/>\nhave a hard enough time finding things to talk about, seemed like I should.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I started my HE enchanter (never played enchanter past 7 and he wanted to<br/>\nplay Wood Elf Warrior) and eep, I got hooked all over again!!!!  She&#39;s 4 now<br/>\nand I was having a blast mes&#39;ing cents, pulling pawns, and letting my pet kill<br/>\nwhile I meditated *hurry up 35 so I can dump the stupid book*.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I have to find all the EQ sites all over again because I threw absolutely<br/>\neverything away.  Oh, but after 9 mos. of not playing, my level 54 druid was<br/>\nstill alive and well and virtually naked (on Brell) as I gave almost all her<br/>\ngood stuff away before quitting.  Oh, yeah, we&#39;re playing on Xev.  My son had<br/>\na friend in his Scout troup that plays there.  Know nothing about it yet other<br/>\nthan GFay is still a spam zone. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, played until 1 AM last night and beat myself up for it this morning,<br/>\nbut wasn&#39;t too sleepy and got my workout in and got to work on time so all&#39;s<br/>\nwell I hope.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, if anyone can figure out AO, it looks cool, but I don&#39;t really understand<br/>\nthe game yet.  Looking for web sites there as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nIceiallana now Iceafara :-)<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nthis email group is alive after all. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nmy fiance and I both play on Veeshan. <br/>\nI started out playing a druid on the Rathe, in July got her to about <br/>\nlevel 11, and then decided that wasn&#39;t the profession for me.  We had <br/>\nheard some good things about Veeshan, so we made the switch!<br/>\nHaving a wonderful time. Have met some very wonderful people, and had <br/>\nthe good fortune to join a guild, the Honorable Knights.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has a level 6 Barbarian Shaman called Tavvish, and my character is <br/>\na Level 7 (so close to 8 it is painful) High Elf Enchantress named <br/>\nNyndari.<br/>\n<br/>\nSend a tell and say hi if you are on!  *smile*<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are currently in misty thicket, doing some adventuring.  I managed <br/>\nto save a young halfling druid&#39;s life, and it turned out that it was <br/>\nhis alt, and he had a high level enchanter on hold, so I received a <br/>\nrod of insidious glamour as a reward, I nearly died!<br/>\n<br/>\np.s Enchanters Rock!!<br/>\np.p.s I am not addicted, I can stop playing anytime I want to,.... <br/>\num.. I just don&#39;t want to! *LOL*<br/>\nSomeone mentioned they didn&#39;t know how to get to the website? this is <br/>\nthe address:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EQ_women/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EQ_women/</a><br/>\nCheers<br/>\nBec<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In EQ_women@y..., zen7598610@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Is anyone else here on Veeshan?
