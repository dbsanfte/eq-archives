Did<br/>\n&gt;it occur to you that there was likely a problem before<br/>\n&gt;she started playing EQ?  As with any sort of game,<br/>\n&gt;book, or even television, it can be a wonderful tool<br/>\n&gt;to relax and get away from the trials of life.  Some<br/>\n&gt;people get carried away with it and you must look at<br/>\n&gt;it from an outside view.  What made her feel like life<br/>\n&gt;was so much more bearable in the EQ world?  Have you<br/>\n&gt;considered that there may have been a communication<br/>\n&gt;problem before she started playing?  That maybe<br/>\n&gt;something was bothering her?  Did you even ask?  Or<br/>\n&gt;perhaps you did...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As for snooping through her files...  This tells me<br/>\n&gt;that you had lost trust for her and beyond that,<br/>\n&gt;communication.  As far as I am concerned, this problem<br/>\n&gt;really had nothing to do with EQ other than it being<br/>\n&gt;the medium she used to escape whatever the problem<br/>\n&gt;was.  It could have been anything, really.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Instead of hopping on an EQ forum tossing out advice<br/>\n&gt;or warning, consider what it is that you really are<br/>\n&gt;telling us.  Buecause I am not so sure that it occures<br/>\n&gt;to you that 9 chances out of 10 the problem was hidden<br/>\n&gt;there far before she started playing EQ and it just<br/>\n&gt;then became noticable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have been happily married for 7 years and during<br/>\n&gt;that time, I have found myself getting deep into<br/>\n&gt;something (Artwork, reading, webpages... never EQ)<br/>\n&gt;when I was experiencing trials in my marriage.  After<br/>\n&gt;we would work things out and get our communication<br/>\n&gt;back, I found that those things were not nearly as<br/>\n&gt;intriguing to me and I would much rather spend time<br/>\n&gt;with my Husband.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So tossing the medium (EQ in this case) aside, a far<br/>\n&gt;better warning would be &quot;Be careful not to let<br/>\n&gt;communication and happiness with your family slip<br/>\n&gt;through the cracks for so long that you get wrapped up<br/>\n&gt;in another world&quot;.  Instead of saying, &quot;She turned<br/>\n&gt;away from her family because of EQ!&quot;  Say &quot;We stopped<br/>\n&gt;communicating and grew unhappy so she turned to EQ&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This is not putting the blame on you, for<br/>\n&gt;communication takes 2 or more people.  It is just as<br/>\n&gt;much her fault as your own.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Sorgaine<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--- Dave &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zedzink@...\">zedzink@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I pour out my life story of my marriage to an EQ<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fiend, who stopped<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everything else in her life for a game...and you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; find my snooping to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be disturbing??  All depends on your point of view,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I guess...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Never found any evidence of any online or RL affairs<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (as many EQ<br/>\n&gt; &gt; widows and widowers have experienced); just line<br/>\n&gt; &gt; after line of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; insipid dribble about ports, spells, gear, etc,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; occassionally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; puncuated by a nasty reference to me (&quot;Hubby getting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; upset again<br/>\n&gt; &gt; better log soon :( &quot;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Oh, and as for the Lexus...sorry, can&#39;t help you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there.  In fact,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when ours is done, we&#39;ll likely have to replace it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with a Toyota or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Nissan; since she quit her $30K job back in 2000 to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; play UO (then EQ)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fulltime, some cutbacks have become necessary.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;=====<br/>\n&gt;Come check out &#39;The Masquerade&#39;.
