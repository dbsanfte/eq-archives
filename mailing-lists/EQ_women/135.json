I am a 31 year old married mother of 3 all under the age of 5.<br/>\nMy husband is one of my group mates and plays a female. He gets more<br/>\nflirting and stuff than I do, which rather makes me jealous I think. (Of<br/>\ncourse when his character runs around half nekkid when he dies he can&#39;t help<br/>\nbut get flirted with ya know?) When asked about my age I am honest and tell<br/>\nthem how old I am. And I have openly made a point of telling those that ask<br/>\nthat I am married because my husband is the jealous type. About the only<br/>\ncomments I have gotten so far are about the new banded mail I am wearing, it<br/>\nis rather um...form fitting on the top. My husband does not tell others his<br/>\nage, marital status nor his gender. Oh well that is his business and this<br/>\nlist is not about him right? :) Sorry to ramble on.<br/>\n<br/>\nZoya (Dawn)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
