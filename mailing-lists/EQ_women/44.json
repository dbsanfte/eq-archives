I play the same race/class (character name: Katheryn), however, I am only on level 5 (by the way, I am also on the Bristlebane Server). I was wondering if you could give me any tips that might help me out. Obviously, since your character is at a much higher level, you probably have a few bits of advice to throw my way! :-) Believe me, I would really, really appreciate it! <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks...I look forward to hearing from you and I will look for you next time I play! <br/>\n<br/>\nKathleen <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kathleen.kirk@...\">kathleen.kirk@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
