He is a man with 2<br/>\nkids and a wife.  I am a woman with a husband.  We are just<br/>\nrole-playing our characters.  <br/>\nSometimes I still feel a bit &quot;wrong&quot; about our flirtation, but really,<br/>\nI know there is nothing to it and we live in totally different<br/>\ncountries (he is from Canada).  So.  I really don&#39;t know if I have<br/>\nhelped or not.  I say make sure you and he are both aware of the real<br/>\nperson behind the pixels on the screen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Judy Tyrer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:judy3t@...\">judy3t@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Judy Tyrer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:judy3t@...\">judy3t@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As my character is marrying on Sunday I must confess<br/>\n&gt; to a few minor qualms.  In<br/>\n&gt; particular, er, how does one roleplay a honeymoon<br/>\n&gt; *smile*.  Unlike many who<br/>\n&gt; develop relationships in Norrath, my beloved and I<br/>\n&gt; are unknown to one another in<br/>\n&gt; RL.  For all I know he weighs 300 pounds, guzzles<br/>\n&gt; beer, and is hygenically<br/>\n&gt; challenged *smile*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are times if I wonder if this is a positive<br/>\n&gt; thing to be doing.  I mean,<br/>\n&gt; what if he is some starry eyed adolescent and I ruin<br/>\n&gt; him for life *grin*.  I know<br/>\n&gt; MY lines are clearly drawn in fuzz (okay, I think I<br/>\n&gt; know the difference between<br/>\n&gt; reality and fantasy though I swear I saw a Pixie<br/>\n&gt; Trickster in the airport the<br/>\n&gt; other day *grin*).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, this is all fun and games and I am having<br/>\n&gt; fun.  But there is this part in<br/>\n&gt; the back of my mind that wonders.  Because unlike<br/>\n&gt; reading romance novels (blech -<br/>\n&gt; persish the thought) there is another person<br/>\n&gt; involved in my little fantasy and I<br/>\n&gt; must never forget that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any other hard core role players out there struggle<br/>\n&gt; with these ridiculous<br/>\n&gt; issues?
