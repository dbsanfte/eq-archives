Didnt receive my copy either, <br/>\nalthough I ordered the very first day. Yesterday I tried to call the 888 <br/>\nnumber to check my order and guess what? Its a USA-only free of charge <br/>\nnumber, not accessable from outside the USA.<br/>\nLike with the GM hours and the downtimes (which is always during primetime <br/>\nfor Europe) this proves again that Varant totally ignores their European <br/>\ncustomers. We pay as much as any of the others but we dont have any support <br/>\nwhatsoever.<br/>\nI wonder if I will get my refund. I wonder if I get my CD.<br/>\nI even wonder if it wont spoil my gamefun.<br/>\n<br/>\nTharca/Keshia/Elyane/Nastyi/Naomi/Chanti on The Tribunal<br/>\n<br/>\n(hehehe...yes I know I have a lot of chars, but hey..I love them all )<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Judy Tyrer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:judy3t@...\">judy3t@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@egroups.com\">EQ_women@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@egroups.com\">EQ_women@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ_women] LIZARDS ARE CUTE<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 25 Apr 2000 12:14:20 -0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;LOL, Rose.  I even went to Comp USA today, since it was to hit retail<br/>\n&gt;shelves.  HAHAHAHA!!!  Nope, they haven&#39;t gotten THEIR order in either<br/>\n&gt;;-(.  The good news is I FINALLY got all the way through to getting to<br/>\n&gt;hold at the 800 number.  This after 3 days of calling, once getting<br/>\n&gt;through to be told &quot;everyone will get their order&quot; and then hung up on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Oh, and just called.  They have no record of my order.  However, I<br/>\n&gt;cannot order again because I&#39;ve already ordered and no, the shipping<br/>\n&gt;company people can&#39;t do anything, I have to call Sony.  But, of course,<br/>\n&gt;Sony can&#39;t do anything I have to call the shipping company.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sorry, this IS a rant.  I have had a lot of respect for Verant in the<br/>\n&gt;past, but the way they have handled Kunark is totally and completely<br/>\n&gt;unacceptable.
