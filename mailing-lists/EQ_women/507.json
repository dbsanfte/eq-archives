I have been keeping all my skills maxed except 2h<br/>\nblunt... but I&#39;ll get that going soon as I find a weapon to use.  :)  I&#39;ve been<br/>\nwatching how the 2h slash and the 1h slash compare, and it seems the 2h slash is<br/>\nslower, but deals more damage, while the 1h slash is faster, deals less damage,<br/>\nbut has the added benefit of the shield to bash.  So it&#39;s rather a toss up it<br/>\nseems. I&#39;ve heard that the 2h slash is the paladin&#39;s best weapon, so I&#39;ll<br/>\nprobably stick with that and see how it goes. AFter all others are maxed, of<br/>\ncourse. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think they do still have the weekly market on Mith Marr, but I&#39;ve never been.<br/>\nWent to N freeport yesterday and wow it was busy.<br/>\nPiqa<br/>\n<br/>\nChristina Norman wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m not a Paladin but I&#39;m good friends with a 53rd level Paladin.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Paladins actually have exciting weapons of almost every type.  Off hand I<br/>\n&gt; can think of excellent 1h blunt, 2h blunt, 1h slashing, and 2h slashing<br/>\n&gt; weapons.  Accordingly, I&#39;d suggest trying to train them all to some<br/>\n&gt; extent.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you don&#39;t want to train them all, I think one handed slashing is<br/>\n&gt; probably your most defining weapon type.  Paladins are skilled shield<br/>\n&gt; bashers.  Ghoulbane, a relatively easy to obtain Paladin weapon is one<br/>\n&gt; handed slashing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; However without an exceptional one handed slashing weapon like Ghoulbane,<br/>\n&gt; most of the time you will benefit from using a two handed slashing<br/>\n&gt; weapons.  They are more commonly available, and generally do far more<br/>\n&gt; damage, then normal one handed slashing weapons.  Exceptional one handed<br/>\n&gt; slashing weapons are usually paladin only.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A good lower-priced two handed slashing weapon is an axe of the iron<br/>\n&gt; black.  They are easily found Kunark weapons.  BBCs are common Antonica<br/>\n&gt; 2-handed slashing weapons as are shiny brass halberds, and should be<br/>\n&gt; cheaper than an axe.  GZs are also good.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For one handed slashing, until you obtain ghoulbane, there really aren&#39;t a<br/>\n&gt; lot of great one handed slashers.  I&#39;d suggest keep your bash and slash<br/>\n&gt; maxed with a fine steel longsword and a shield, then switch back to your<br/>\n&gt; two-hander once both skills are maxed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hope this helps =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tina<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--<br/>\n&quot;What does that mean?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;It means the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nICQ #10306498<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.utahdogs.com\">http://www.utahdogs.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
