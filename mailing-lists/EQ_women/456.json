However, should we continue to group and<br/>\nperhaps it becomes clear that our in-game roleplay is taking a decidedly<br/>\nromantic turn, then I abosultely believe that without question it is my<br/>\nresponsibility to tell him at least that I am married with 2 children<br/>\nand there is no chance that any in-game relationship will transfer into<br/>\nreal life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I think there is an even stronger moral issue when it comes to any<br/>\nkind of sexual innuendo in the roleplay and that is that the players be<br/>\n&quot;of an age&quot;.  If two 16 YOs want to go at it who am I to object.  But if<br/>\na 25 YO wants to do that kind of roleplay with a 16 YO I will object and<br/>\nobject STRONGLY!  That sort of thing is bordering on pederasty and is<br/>\nintolerable.  Esp. since there are children as young as 10 playing this<br/>\ngame unsupervised.  [resists the temptation to pull out her parents<br/>\nshould know what their children are doing on-line soapbox].<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I think the same goes for men.  Men (and women, though fewer women<br/>\nchoose to play men) have a rare opportunity to see how the world treats<br/>\nthe opposite sex by taking on a female character.  I know some men who<br/>\ndo it because women get lots of free buffs and twinks.  But they begin<br/>\nto understand the price the women are paying through expectations etc.<br/>\npretty quickly.  There is no such thing as a free buff (grins).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen to disclose is a question for each individual.  But we each have<br/>\nresponsibility for our own emotional attachment and if one goes off<br/>\nattaching to someone without knowing anything about the player behind<br/>\nthe character, that is also that person&#39;s responsibility.  Should a man<br/>\nlie and say &quot;oh, no I really AM a woman&quot; that is reprehensible.  But if<br/>\nyou don&#39;t ask then you can&#39;t be pissed off when you find out later.<br/>\n<br/>\nIceiallana<br/>\nDruid of the 33rd circle<br/>\nBrell Serillis<br/>\n<br/>\nChristina Norman wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Christina Norman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tina@...\">tina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is a woman using emotional deceit if she flirts with a 20 year old<br/>\n&gt; boy,<br/>\n&gt; when she is 50, and doesn&#39;t tell him her age, allowing him to assume<br/>\n&gt; she<br/>\n&gt; is around his age?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is a woman using emotional deceit if she flirts with a boy, and<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; tell him her racial background, allowing him to assume she is white<br/>\n&gt; when<br/>\n&gt; she is not?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is a woman using emotional deceit if she flirts with a boy, and<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; send him a picture, so he&#39;ll know whether or not he&#39;d be attracted to<br/>\n&gt; her<br/>\n&gt; in real life?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is a woman using emotional deceit, if she flirts with a boy, and<br/>\n&gt; allows<br/>\n&gt; him to assume she&#39;s not married, when she is?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What exactly must we disclose when we flirt with someone online before<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;re being emotionally deceitful?
