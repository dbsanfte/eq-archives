Have<br/>\na class tonight.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are a sisterhood.  Only women may join.  If we find out that a<br/>\nman has joined, he will be deguilded. (And trained.  Just kidding.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone can &quot;serve and protect&quot; but not to the degree that women are<br/>\ncapable of.  We vow to cover for each other when someone hears a<br/>\nTHUMP from in the playroom.  We vow to tutor each others youngsters<br/>\nin the ways of the game.  When they are 18, they must seek their<br/>\nown guilds.  We vow to watch our sisters&#39; backs when they smell<br/>\nsmoke in the kitchen.  We vow to be there for each other when<br/>\nsomeone needs to talk.  We vow to never leave a comrade&#39;s body<br/>\nunrezzed or unobtainable.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, this is only a game.  We vow not to take it so seriously<br/>\nour egos could be threatened.  Raids are not mandatory.  We will<br/>\nset buffing schedules for those who need to solo early in the AM or<br/>\nlate at night.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you breathe a sigh of relief to see these vows, apply today at<br/>\nour guild website.&lt;insert link&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat did I forget?<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone see if the last name, Amazon, is available?<br/>\nThose who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little<br/>\ntemporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. <br/>\n - Benjamin Franklin,  motto to Historical Review of Pennsylvania <br/>\n<br/>\nMuriel Hykes<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drmom@...\">drmom@...</a><br/>\nwww.geocities.com/muriel_drmom</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
