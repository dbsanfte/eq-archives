Although I do not play on this server<br/>\nwith my primary characters, I have made a Dwarven Paladin named Mytee to<br/>\nhunt with you.   I had initally created a Dark Elven Necromancer named<br/>\nKarrma (after my primary char) But decided that it was in my best interest<br/>\nto make a character that will be able to travel with you all.  I look<br/>\nforward to meeting you.  See you on Monday!!  PS I have not begun her<br/>\ntraining as yet, but she has traveled to Freeport and been bound for the<br/>\nfirst hunt. &lt;Claps hands excitedly&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Message: 1<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 10 Aug 1999 12:25:37 -0600 (MDT)<br/>\n&gt;    From: Christina Norman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tina@...\">tina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: List Meeting / Guild Meeting<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hey Everyone,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The time for the meeting has been set for Monday August 16th at 6pm PST in<br/>\n&gt; East Freeport on Brell Serelis.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The meeting is an opportunity for us all to meet eachother and chat.<br/>\n&gt; You can either make a newbie character just to attend the meeting, or you<br/>\n&gt; can use your existing Brell Serelis character.  While Evil races are not<br/>\n&gt; allowed inside East Freeport, the newbie zone is not patrolled.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My character Luna will be hosting the event, and you can send her a tell<br/>\n&gt; if you have any questions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; After the chat, there will be a subequent newbie hunt for any who are<br/>\n&gt; interested.  This will be an opportunity to group and hunt together.  East<br/>\n&gt; Freeport has an excellent newbie zone.  North Ro, which borders East<br/>\n&gt; Freeport, has numerous creatures levels 1-4 for hunting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please note the boat from Butcherblock takes about an hour in total travel<br/>\n&gt; and waiting time, so be sure to boat early.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I realize not everyone will be able to attend during this time, but this<br/>\n&gt; was the best match available.  I&#39;ll try to have another event, and make<br/>\n&gt; sure that it works with the time schedule of those who can&#39;t attend.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Christina<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n___<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
