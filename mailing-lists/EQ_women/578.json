She&#39;ll bat her eyes at nearly any passing male. Weirdly enough, I feel very &quot;safe&quot; with this character emotionally because any male that spends more than 10 minutes with her sees her flirtations are not exclusively his. I guess its a way to put up a wall of safety but still have some flirtatious fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe does have a true love, a barbarian warrior who she sometimes groups with, but around him, she&#39;s strangely quiet.....hmmmmm.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the person behind the keyboard in RL, I&#39;m really not that interested in forming any outside relationships from the game. Its great to have friends in game, but its gets too scary for me when it goes beyond the monitor. It almost happened once when someone asked me to &quot;marry them in-game&quot;, but a friend adviced me not to do it. Said the complications could be draining and relationship would almost definitely change over time. As it turned out just a few months later, I found out they were absolutely right. Now, I&#39;m very, very glad I never &quot;married&quot; anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, as always, to each her own.<br/>\n<br/>\nZuki Vekk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAngelfire for your free web-based e-mail. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.angelfire.com\">http://www.angelfire.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
