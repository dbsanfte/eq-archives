We chatted and agreed that Brell Serelis<br/>\n&gt; would be a great server to<br/>\n&gt; have the meeting on.  This way we can all meet<br/>\n&gt; eachother, and also have a<br/>\n&gt; subsequent guild event.  The subsequent event would<br/>\n&gt; be a newbie hunt,<br/>\n&gt; during which newbies could hunt critters, and higher<br/>\n&gt; level guild members<br/>\n&gt; could help them out.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d like to hold a brief vote on the time and place<br/>\n&gt; of the meeting on<br/>\n&gt; brell.  The time matters because we all have<br/>\n&gt; different schedules.  The<br/>\n&gt; place only matters in terms of where the newbie hunt<br/>\n&gt; will take place.<br/>\n&gt; Please respond to this email if you have a<br/>\n&gt; preference (if you don&#39;t care,<br/>\n&gt; you dont need to respond).  If any given meeting<br/>\n&gt; time is impossible for<br/>\n&gt; you, please say that, I&#39;ll try and minimize those<br/>\n&gt; conflicts.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Meeting places:<br/>\n&gt;     - Greater Faydark stone ring (kelethin newbie<br/>\n&gt; zone)<br/>\n&gt;     - East Freeport newbie zone<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Meeting times:<br/>\n&gt;     - Tuesday August 10th 6pm-8pm PST<br/>\n&gt;     - Thursday August 10th 6pm-8pm PST<br/>\n&gt;     - Saturday August 14th 10am-12pm PST<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Vote will be closed friday at 6pm PST and I&#39;ll post<br/>\n&gt; the results that<br/>\n&gt; evening.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d like to use the guild chat feature to make our<br/>\n&gt; meeting easier.  Even<br/>\n&gt; if you&#39;re not planning on playing on Brell, you can<br/>\n&gt; make a newbie and join<br/>\n&gt; the guild, to use this feature.  It allows us to<br/>\n&gt; send tells to our entire<br/>\n&gt; guild, so we can hear conversation even if we&#39;re not<br/>\n&gt; exactly in the same<br/>\n&gt; physical area.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d also like to suggest an unofficial guild hunt<br/>\n&gt; Saturday August 7th at<br/>\n&gt; noon PST.  The location will be wherever the<br/>\n&gt; official one will be held<br/>\n&gt; (results posted Friday evening).  This is for those<br/>\n&gt; of us who&#39;d like to<br/>\n&gt; get into playing together ASAP.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - Christina<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to people who share your<br/>\n&gt; interests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_____________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
