(BTW, great descriptions, Dnaisha, though I don t know if I necessarily agree with your classification","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1721647350\">Bran,<br/>\n<br/>\nSome bard-specific advice from a seasoned Bard...  (BTW, great<br/>\ndescriptions, Dnaisha, though I don&#39;t know if I necessarily agree with your<br/>\nclassification of a bard as a healer....the bard kind of fits outside your<br/>\ncategories).  To the bard, your charisma is your life... at lower levels,<br/>\nyou get phenomenal prices for the items you sell and buy and it makes a<br/>\ngreat difference.  Where your charisma really kicks in is when you get your<br/>\nLullybye song (which puts the mobs your group is NOT fighting to sleep and<br/>\ntherefore helps with crowd control) and really increases the effectiveness<br/>\nof most of your songs.  Your second most important stat as a bard is<br/>\nDexterity... for the reason that you miss your song notes less often,<br/>\nincrease your instrument skills faster based on your dex (starting with<br/>\npercussion at lvl 5, then string at lvl 8, brass at 12 and wind at 14).<br/>\nUsing instruments increase the effectiveness of your songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrength is also a primary stat for a bard.  I really wouldn&#39;t worry a huge<br/>\namount about it.  Put it at around 80 or 85 so that you can wear some<br/>\ndecent armor and still be able to carry stuff (I would still suggest to<br/>\nstick with banded armor and not bronze until you are ready to quest for the<br/>\nlambent armor around lvl 30 or so...lambent armor is the special bard-only<br/>\nquest armor).<br/>\n<br/>\nYour songs are your life.  Sing them ALWAYS (chant of battle will be your<br/>\nfirst and is a great song for increasing party strength and effectiveness<br/>\nin combat) to keep your singing skill maxed.  Also, learn how to &quot;twist&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;medley&quot; your songs so that you can have the effects of more than one at a<br/>\ntime.  I have a fast connection to the internet and therefore when there&#39;s<br/>\nno server lag can twist 3 and sometimes 4 songs at a time easily.  Others<br/>\nwith slower connections or lots of lag can only get 2 going...whatever the<br/>\nnumber, you as the bard can greatly help out any party with your songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe great thing about a bard is that you can pretty much solo through the<br/>\nfirst 12 levels or so without a problem.   Until about 16th level, you will<br/>\nhave decent melee skills and you will be able to stand toe-to-toe with the<br/>\ntanks.  After that, however, and you will really start to become pathetic<br/>\nin combat and will find yourself sometimes switching to become and<br/>\nall-instrument bard when your party has enough tanks.  <br/>\n<br/>\nParties love you because you are so versatile.  You can get them around<br/>\nquickly with Selo&#39;s accelerando.  You can tank when needed to or pull out<br/>\nyour instruments for an extra punch.  You can pulse-heal hit points with<br/>\nHymn of Restoration.  You can increase attack speed with Anthem de Arms.<br/>\nYou can also increase group magic resistance with your songs among other<br/>\nthings such as : slow down attack speed and AC of your enemies, root, fear,<br/>\ncharm, etc. (at higher levles--these abilities come in the 20&#39;s).  I often<br/>\nget tells from people in my zone asking if I am grouped and would I like to<br/>\ngroup (I don&#39;t go anon most of the time).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be items you can buy or trade for that increase your<br/>\nstats...right now my bard, with items, has a 110 charisma, 104 dex and 88<br/>\nstrength.  So, if your stats are not what you like when you start, you can<br/>\nadjust them with items, however I do suggest you do what I suggested<br/>\nabove... You can always re-roll your character when she is still low level<br/>\n...it hurts a lot less than those who get to, say, 10th level and wish they<br/>\nhad done one thing or another with their stats and end up re-rolling their<br/>\ncharacters then and have to do all 10 levels over again.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I most love about the bard is that it is a really fun class to<br/>\nplay..it has a complexity to it and your strategies change with each new<br/>\nlevel and new song.  It is always interesting and there&#39;s always something<br/>\nnew to look forward to with the advancement of levels.  I really think that<br/>\nthe bard is one of the most strategically complex classes in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome great bard sites that explain in more detail the stuff I&#39;ve discussed<br/>\nhere are:<br/>\nThe Concert Hall: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/index.html\">http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBard Song Analysis: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/\">http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBard Forums:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.soerbaird.com/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro&category=3\">http://www.soerbaird.com/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro&category=3</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPlus, the bard guide and board at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everlore.com\">http://www.everlore.com</a> is also very good.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this has helped and feel free to email me with any of your bard<br/>\nconcerns or questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Journey to you,<br/>\n<br/>\nArsiana Gaillarde<br/>\nWood-elf Bard of the 20th Song<br/>\nThe Tribunal Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 11:55 AM 12/28/99 -0500, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Brangvyne@...\">Brangvyne@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Brangvyne@...\">Brangvyne@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In a message dated 12/28/1999 10:38:05 AM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:judy3t@...\">judy3t@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; Welcome to the addiction... &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Salutations Dnaisha!<br/>\n&gt;Wow! and thank you for all the great advice!
