Lots of people seem to<br/>\nthink that you should try and get groups of 5 or 6, but groups of 2 or 3<br/>\ncan work really well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a druid, you are an ideal partner for a tank.  Pure tanks like warriors<br/>\nand rogues are usually happy to group with a healer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI use to dislike twinking, but over time I have come to understand it.  I<br/>\nhave twinked myself.  For me twinking is simply to avoid aspects of the<br/>\ngame that I no longer find as entertaining.  Usually with twinks, as with<br/>\nany other players, it&#39;s fairly quick to figure out if they&#39;re decent<br/>\npeople or not.  If someone is nice, whether they are twinked or not,<br/>\nthey&#39;re nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nTina<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sat, 1 Jul 2000, Sandy Wright wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Ranalla,<br/>\n&gt; I envy you being a 14 lv druid,  when I tell people I am ONLY lv 6,<br/>\n&gt; nobody wants to group with me!  :(<br/>\n&gt; As far as grouping,  I have only been in 3 different groups for any<br/>\n&gt; length of time (1-6 hours)<br/>\n&gt; The first group didn&#39;t know what they were doing.

I don&#39;t believe in twinking (sp?) but it is nice to<br/>\n&gt; get advice from more experienced folks.<br/>\n&gt; The third group didn&#39;t go so well.
