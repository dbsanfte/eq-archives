In<br/>\n&gt; &gt; particular, er, how does one roleplay a honeymoon *smile*.  Unlike many who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; develop relationships in Norrath, my beloved and I are unknown to one another in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; RL.  For all I know he weighs 300 pounds, guzzles beer, and is hygenically<br/>\n&gt; &gt; challenged *smile*<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; There are times if I wonder if this is a positive thing to be doing.  I mean,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what if he is some starry eyed adolescent and I ruin him for life *grin*.  I know<br/>\n&gt; &gt; MY lines are clearly drawn in fuzz (okay, I think I know the difference between<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reality and fantasy though I swear I saw a Pixie Trickster in the airport the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other day *grin*).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anyway, this is all fun and games and I am having fun.  But there is this part in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the back of my mind that wonders.  Because unlike reading romance novels (blech -<br/>\n&gt; &gt; persish the thought) there is another person involved in my little fantasy and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; must never forget that.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Any other hard core role players out there struggle with these ridiculous<br/>\n&gt; &gt; issues?  Any other players over the age of 25, for that matter *smile*<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Dnaice on Quellious<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Trisango on Brell Serilis<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ONElist announces &quot;FRIENDS & FAMILY!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; For details, including our weekly drawing, go to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Congratulations to Richard van den Brink<br/>\n&gt; This week&#39;s FRIENDS & FAMILY WINNER!<br/>\n&gt; To enter go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
