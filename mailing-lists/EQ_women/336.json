The meeting is an opportunity for us","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1425319744\">Hey Everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nThe time for the meeting has been set for Monday August 16th at 6pm PST in<br/>\nEast Freeport on Brell Serelis.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe meeting is an opportunity for us all to meet eachother and chat.<br/>\nYou can either make a newbie character just to attend the meeting, or you<br/>\ncan use your existing Brell Serelis character.  While Evil races are not<br/>\nallowed inside East Freeport, the newbie zone is not patrolled.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy character Luna will be hosting the event, and you can send her a tell<br/>\nif you have any questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the chat, there will be a subequent newbie hunt for any who are<br/>\ninterested.  This will be an opportunity to group and hunt together.  East<br/>\nFreeport has an excellent newbie zone.  North Ro, which borders East<br/>\nFreeport, has numerous creatures levels 1-4 for hunting.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease note the boat from Butcherblock takes about an hour in total travel<br/>\nand waiting time, so be sure to boat early.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize not everyone will be able to attend during this time, but this<br/>\nwas the best match available.  I&#39;ll try to have another event, and make<br/>\nsure that it works with the time schedule of those who can&#39;t attend.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
