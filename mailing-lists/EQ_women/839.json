I&#39;ve made a <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; couple of good friends who are more \n  experienced<br>&gt; then me and don&#39;t <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; seem to mind giving \n  advice or helping out so<br>&gt; that&#39;s very nice.<br>&gt; \n  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;ve also been trying to learn more about my role<br>&gt; \n  as a Ranger in <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Norrath. I just found out last week what a \n  handy<br>&gt; thing taunt can be <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; when trying to keep a \n  mob off your healer? OK, I&#39;m<br>&gt; slow but I&#39;m <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; getting \n  there I think. And I&#39;ve gotten duel wield<br>&gt; and double attack \n  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; now so that&#39;s interesting to play with.<br>&gt; \n  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night a Druid friend and I went to Paudal<br>&gt; \n  Cavern for my first <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; trip there. I would have died twice \n  during the<br>&gt; first fight we had I <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; think if they had \n  not been there to keep me from<br>&gt; deaths door. That <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  was a tough mob and red all the way for me at lvl<br>&gt; 19 (20 now).<br>&gt; \n  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, enough ramblin, so it&#39;s question time:<br>&gt; \n  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.) I have been asked to get married and have \n  said<br>&gt; yes. :o) Any good <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; suggestions on locations \n  that would be nice but<br>&gt; not to hard for <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; guests to \n  get to? He has a place in mind, I forget<br>&gt; the name, but it \n  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; sounds like it might be hard for lower level<br>&gt; \n  characters to even <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; reach. I have not traveled over much \n  of Norrath<br>&gt; still so I&#39;m not <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; sure. Anyway, if \n  anyone has ideas I&#39;d love to hear<br>&gt; them.<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, when \n  things are set, which may be a while<br>&gt; I&#39;ll post a note here \n  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; letting everyone know. You are all invited, of<br>&gt; \n  course, feel free to <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; come if you have a character on the \n  Xegony server,<br>&gt; of if you want <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; just create a quick \n  one at the proper time and<br>&gt; come anyway. I&#39;d love <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  to meet anyone who might do me the honor of<br>&gt; coming.<br>&gt; \n  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.) Can anyone give me advice on how to find a<br>&gt; \n  guild that might be <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; interested in letting a Ranger in the \n  low 20&#39;s<br>&gt; join? Would it be ok <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; to just kind of \n  start asking around? Is there a<br>&gt; way to tell a better \n  <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; guild from one not as good?<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  Anyway, I hope everyone had a nice Thanksgiving.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  Hugs<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; :o)<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bran<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; lvl \n  20 Wood Elf Ranger<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your use of \n  Yahoo!
