Sorry, my other characters are on Eci<br/>\nand The Seventh Hammer. I enjoy chatting when I can, but I work, raise 2<br/>\nteenagers and care for older parents. My EQ playtime is my only spot of<br/>\nR & R, so I hurry through the mail a lot. I started my characters at the<br/>\nbeginning of the game, and I still enjoy playing. Mainly, because I am<br/>\nnot rushing through my EQ life, trying to powerlevel, twinking or<br/>\nrushing the storyline. Deneyu has finally earned her chainmail through<br/>\nearnest efforts. She often will expend her whole mana reserves, healing<br/>\nthe needy adventurers that she meets.  She has too often, been placed in<br/>\njeopardy from less cautious hunting partners, so while Deneyu has made<br/>\nmany friends but perfers to hunt alone. Lately, she has been hunting in<br/>\nthe LavaStorm, but is happy to even just explore the environment around<br/>\nher without worrying about kills. <br/>\n\tSometimes I also play my level 17 High Elf Enchanter Yadienu on Eci or<br/>\nmy new baby lvl 12 Halfling Druid Whirlwinda on Seventh Hammer. While I<br/>\nhave other characters created, these are my most often played ones. If<br/>\nyou are on any of these servers let me know, I am always happy to meet<br/>\nnew folk. <br/>\n                 Meet you on EQ.... <br/>\n                                   Donna C.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
