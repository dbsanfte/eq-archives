The main advantage they offer is a chat interface<br/>\nwhere you can talk to everyone in your guild.  Using this interface you<br/>\ncan then find people to hunt with.  Hopefully, you come to hunt with these<br/>\npeople semi regularly, which helps create a more enjoyable play<br/>\nexperience.  Looking for people to hunt with all the time can be<br/>\ndifficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s good to join a guild where the people in the guild are around your<br/>\nlevel.  It&#39;s good to join a guild where the people in the guild play about<br/>\nthe same frequency as you (so you don&#39;t pull too far ahead, or get left<br/>\ntoo far behind).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s ok to leave your guild or change guilds.  Over time you may<br/>\nfind your guild doesn&#39;t serve your needs any more, and at that point it&#39;s<br/>\na good time to consider another guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuild politics can be a pain.  Guilds often have rules or regulations, and<br/>\nif they don&#39;t sit well with you, the guild won&#39;t work for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nSmall guilds can be annoying because, unless they are close personal<br/>\nfriends, you&#39;ll probably get frustrated that usually no one from your<br/>\nguild is on.  Larger more established guilds tend to provide a more stable<br/>\nconstant environment, but can be more difficult to get into.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps,<br/>\n<br/>\nTina<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 26 Jun 2000, Sandy Wright wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hello again,<br/>\n&gt; I hope I am not being a pest, but I would like some info on Guilds.<br/>\n&gt; What exactly do they do?
