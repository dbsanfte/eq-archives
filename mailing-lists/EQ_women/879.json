I was just <br/>\nhappy that there were females that played EQ... ROFL! Anyways she met <br/>\na guy in another country after her divorce. He came out to visit with <br/>\nher. He was there for about a month. They played EQ, she went to <br/>\nwork, and they started a romance. She ended up pregnant. She moved to <br/>\nhis country, than back to the USA, had the child. They no longer play <br/>\nEQ but have a family here now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew another women who found a husband through EQ. They happen to <br/>\nlive close to each other, hooked up, married, and no longer play EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently heard from a male friend that came back to EQ after a year <br/>\noff. He was looking for cheap entertainment for him and his wife so <br/>\nthey went back to EQ. She&#39;s now divorcing him for another man she met <br/>\nthrough EQ. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo any of you have any stories? I heard on a message board once from <br/>\none guy about how his GF left him because he was addicted to EQ. <br/>\nGross story though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n._.~*~._.~*~.Beverly R._.~*~._.~*~.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.O.
