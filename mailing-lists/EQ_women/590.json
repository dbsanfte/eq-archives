One of them that I am a member of, required me <br/>\nto group with two of the officers before they would even consider my <br/>\napplication.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe quality of the guilds that I have come across on Tunare, has <br/>\ndeteriorated SEVERELY.  You get people who zone in and ooc that they&#39;re <br/>\nlooking for a guild.  Why don&#39;t you take the time to get to know someone?<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to be a leader of a guild on Tunare, and we were quite stringent <br/>\nabout who could and could not be in our guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was relatively nice.  I quit because I was sick of the crap but that was <br/>\njust personal issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just rejoined a new guild that is like family.  They are very small,  but <br/>\nthey are SO close to one another.  Which is what&#39;s important.  It&#39;s not <br/>\nimportant to have 300 people logged on at a time.  It&#39;s important to be able <br/>\nto talk to one another and work together.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 2cp<br/>\n<br/>\nSoril Tenderleaf<br/>\nLevel 31 Druid<br/>\nTunare<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
