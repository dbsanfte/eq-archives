I haven t had a lot of people ask me for heals ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-638771449\">I tend to heal anyone who is in danger of dying in <br/>\ncombat, but if a person is not in danger I generally <br/>\ndon&#39;t.  I haven&#39;t had a lot of people ask me for heals <br/>\nthough.  If I am asked for heals, I&#39;ll usually say I&#39;m <br/>\nlow on mana (if I am) or throw a single heal on them if <br/>\nI&#39;m full.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, if I am full of mana and I&#39;m in the <br/>\nmood, I sometimes heal or buff people randomly for no <br/>\nreason at all.  It&#39;s an easy way to be nice to someone, <br/>\nand make new friends.  People seem in particular to <br/>\nappreciate getting Spirit of the Wolf.<br/>\n<br/>\nI spent three hours last night in Kelethin disguised as <br/>\na tree.  I went about bolting orcs, healing, and buffing <br/>\nnewbies as they valiantly tried to face off orcs.  That <br/>\nwas a lot of fun.  I didn&#39;t get any XP, or any treasure,<br/>\nbut I had set asside the time to do it and it was fun.<br/>\nA few newbies were freaked out by this moving tree.  Others speculated as to whether I was an enchanter or a druid.  I saved several people&#39;s lives, and they were very greatful.  A few newbies role played with me, as I presented myself as &#39;The Great Tree&#39;, a protective Kelethin forest spirit.  All in all, it was fun.  I recommend you healers and buffers give a shot at some community service some time, it can be rewarding 8)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ---- you wrote: <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:greenloafers@...\">greenloafers@...</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>been pretty fun a lot of the time, though it is getting boring having people ask for heals all the time. Every person I heal means I have to sit staring at that damn spellbook waiting for my mana to regen. I don&#39;t mind doing that for my partymembers because that&#39;s my job, but not if it&#39;s going to take out of my playing time and I get nothing out of it. <br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGet free personalized email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.iname.com\">http://www.iname.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
