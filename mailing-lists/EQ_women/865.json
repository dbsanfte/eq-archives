Does anyone here <br/>\nplay this version, and is on the same server as me? I think its great <br/>\nthat we women have a forum for our EQ addiction. I used to play PC <br/>\nversion, but got bored, and pissed off when all my friends had no <br/>\nlife and would level way above me, always causing me to find new <br/>\npeople to group with. I am curretly an Elder of the Arcane Blades <br/>\nguild. Should anyone here play this game, I would love to meet up <br/>\nwith you in game. I am 27/f(of course)/Canada,BC. So hopefully I am <br/>\nnot alone in this. :)<br/>\nGod bless and God speed,<br/>\nRose</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
