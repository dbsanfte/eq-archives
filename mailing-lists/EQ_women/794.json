The message can be translated as &quot;Want to sell (WTS) banded <br/>\nboots, please send a tell (PST) if you&#39;re interested&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly to auction, people can use shout to shout to the entire zone, or <br/>\nooc to speak &quot;out of character&quot; to the entire zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe intention for the use of these channels is:<br/>\n<br/>\nshout - your character wants to shout loud enough that people not near <br/>\nthem will still be able to hear them, the intention is that you use this <br/>\n&quot;in character&quot; speaking as if you were your character. For example &quot;watch <br/>\nout, there is a sand giant near the beach&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nooc - speaking out of character, this is you speaking as yourself. For <br/>\nexample, &quot;Does anyone know what level rangers get double attack at?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nauction - this is reserved for selling items, and inquiring about buying <br/>\nitems.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother usefull command is /yell, or /y. This will cause people near you <br/>\nto get a message like &quot;Brangvyne yells for help from your left&quot;. Sometimes <br/>\nit&#39;s hard to find someone, and having them /yell will let you know where <br/>\nthey are (if you&#39;re close enough to hear the yell).<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, 12 Nov 2002, Brangvyne Accampo wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Salutations,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sorry to sound so dumb but what is auction channel,<br/>\n&gt; and ooc?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; :o)<br/>\n&gt; Bran<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- Christina Norman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tina@...\">tina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The accepted way is to ask in a zone using the ooc<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or auction channels. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also watch for other people auctioning that they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; want to sell jewlery.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Enchanters level 16+ are most commonly jewlers as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they get spells that <br/>\n&gt; &gt; allow them to make magic jewlery.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; - Christina<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; On Tue, 12 Nov 2002, Brangvyne Accampo wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cool, but how do you find such people? is there an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; easier way other than asking everyone you meet?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; U2 on LAUNCH - Exclusive greatest hits videos<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://launch.yahoo.com/u2\">http://launch.yahoo.com/u2</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
