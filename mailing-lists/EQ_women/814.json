You don t even want to know what I did last night with that quest. ... But maybe someone will get a laugh out of my stupidity. ... I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-626481348\">Salutations Sinrianna!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t even want to know what I did last night with<br/>\nthat quest.<br/>\n:o)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut maybe someone will get a laugh out of my<br/>\nstupidity.<br/>\n:o)<br/>\n<br/>\nI finally got together all the things I needed for the<br/>\ntunic. I never did find the forest drakling scale but<br/>\nI found someone who had one and offered to sell it to<br/>\nme and asked what I would give them. I told them that<br/>\nI didn&#39;t have any idea what anything cost but would<br/>\npay them whatever the fair price was. They told me<br/>\nthat they used to get 50pp but that they would sell it<br/>\nto me for 20pp and that to be nice they would let me<br/>\nhave it for 10pp if that was all I could afford. Well<br/>\nI had the 20pp and I didn&#39;t want to take advantage of<br/>\nanyone so I gave it to them. (Yes, I&#39;m a sucker)<br/>\n:o)<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I took all my stuff back to the Ranger guild<br/>\nhouse and gave it to the Ranger who gave me the quest,<br/>\nI forget the name. He took all the stuff, told me<br/>\nthank you, and that was it. I didn&#39;t get anything, no<br/>\ntunic, no exp., no nothing. I was so upset I didn&#39;t<br/>\nknow whether to laugh or cry . . .<br/>\n:o)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, after standing there for a long time kicking<br/>\nmyself I asked them for the quest all over again.<br/>\nOddly, this time they gave me the box to put<br/>\neverything in and they also gave me a pattern for an<br/>\n&quot;enchanted tunic&quot;? Not sure what that is all about as<br/>\nthere are not enough slots in the box to fit the stuff<br/>\nand the tunic.<br/>\n:o)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I went back out and started gathering stuff<br/>\nagain. Still need to regain a couple items, including<br/>\nthat silly Forest Drakling Scale, but now I&#39;m paranoid<br/>\nabout the exact approach to take to not lose<br/>\neverything again. Apparently, I did or said something<br/>\nwrong last time.<br/>\n:o)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh well, live and learn I guess, but it certainly<br/>\ndidn&#39;t make me feel any better when I was telling<br/>\nsomeone about the whole thing later and they told me I<br/>\nhad been ripped off on the price of the Forest<br/>\nDrakling Scale . . . ouch!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just thought I&#39;d throw that out in case anyone<br/>\nwas interested at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n:o)<br/>\nBrangvyne<br/>\n13th lvl Wood Elf Ranger<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - I came across a master key in CB last night and I<br/>\nhave the two Orc eyes for the sword. For any more<br/>\nexperienced rangers out there, is there anything<br/>\nspecial I need to do to give this to the Ranger in the<br/>\nguild and actually get the sword instead of losing<br/>\nthat too.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Sinrianna Soulsteal &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sinrianna@...\">sinrianna@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; LOL ... someone in guild was just complaining about<br/>\n&gt; that earlier today :) ... they&#39;re a pain but, the<br/>\n&gt; newbie armor quests are worth it in the long run :)<br/>\n&gt; Have fun, and hunt safe ~<br/>\n&gt; Sinrianna Soulsteal<br/>\n&gt;  Brangvyne Accampo &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brangvyne7@...\">brangvyne7@...</a>&gt; wrote:PS -<br/>\n&gt; I never would have thought how much trouble it<br/>\n&gt; can be to find a pristine forest drakling scale.<br/>\n&gt; :o)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
