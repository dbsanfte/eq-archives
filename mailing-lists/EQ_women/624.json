I have played since <br/>\n24 August 2000, and I tend to feel that I could carry on playing for <br/>\naround a year, so long as I could get groups. EQ does not strike me <br/>\nas a game I could easily play casually though, so I probably wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nplay fewer hours per week over a longer period.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the decisive factor would be in-game; it&#39;s a miserable <br/>\noccupation if you can&#39;t play as part of a group, so if it comes to <br/>\nthe point where my ranger cannot get into groups, it will probably be <br/>\ntime to move on. I suppose I might try another class, but I am not <br/>\nthat interested in doing so.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of you have played far longer than me, and some have retired. I <br/>\nshould be very interested to know how this worked for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne further point; are any of you intending to play any of the new <br/>\ngames slated to open up in 2001? eg Shadowbane, Dark Age of Camelot<br/>\n<br/>\nLove, <br/>\n<br/>\nLiz xx<br/>\n<br/>\naka Gyngermynx, ranger of the 32nd season, Quellious</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
