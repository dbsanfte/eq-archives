Any<br/>\nrelief for the &quot;evil among you&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have a young Cleric I made with my last open slot that I&#39;m toying with<br/>\nthe idea of tagging her with the guild name, as per the suggestion of<br/>\ncommunicating via guild chat.  However as I wanted her to worship Rodcet<br/>\nNife, she started in Qeynos and at 2 would be unable to traverse Highpass<br/>\n:(.

We chatted and agreed that Brell Serelis would be a great server to<br/>\n&gt;have the meeting on.  This way we can all meet eachother, and also have a<br/>\n&gt;subsequent guild event.  The subsequent event would be a newbie hunt,<br/>\n&gt;during which newbies could hunt critters, and higher level guild members<br/>\n&gt;could help them out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;d like to hold a brief vote on the time and place of the meeting on<br/>\n&gt;brell.  The time matters because we all have different schedules.  The<br/>\n&gt;place only matters in terms of where the newbie hunt will take place.<br/>\n&gt;Please respond to this email if you have a preference (if you don&#39;t care,<br/>\n&gt;you dont need to respond).  If any given meeting time is impossible for<br/>\n&gt;you, please say that, I&#39;ll try and minimize those conflicts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Meeting places:<br/>\n&gt;    - Greater Faydark stone ring (kelethin newbie zone)<br/>\n&gt;    - East Freeport newbie zone<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Meeting times:<br/>\n&gt;    - Tuesday August 10th 6pm-8pm PST<br/>\n&gt;    - Thursday August 10th 6pm-8pm PST<br/>\n&gt;    - Saturday August 14th 10am-12pm PST<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Vote will be closed friday at 6pm PST and I&#39;ll post the results that<br/>\n&gt;evening.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;d like to use the guild chat feature to make our meeting easier.  Even<br/>\n&gt;if you&#39;re not planning on playing on Brell, you can make a newbie and join<br/>\n&gt;the guild, to use this feature.  It allows us to send tells to our entire<br/>\n&gt;guild, so we can hear conversation even if we&#39;re not exactly in the same<br/>\n&gt;physical area.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;d also like to suggest an unofficial guild hunt Saturday August 7th at<br/>\n&gt;noon PST.  The location will be wherever the official one will be held<br/>\n&gt;(results posted Friday evening).  This is for those of us who&#39;d like to<br/>\n&gt;get into playing together ASAP.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Christina<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How do you enter ONElist´┐¢s WEEKLY DRAWING for $100?<br/>\n&gt;By joining the FRIENDS & FAMILY program.
