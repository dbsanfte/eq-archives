The other thing that bothers me is the idea of <br/>\n<br/>\nthe Warders - why do a group of warrior women need men to protect them?  Kind of <br/>\n<br/>\nimplies that even tough warrior women need a big strong man to help them, you <br/>\nknow?  Maybe we could come up with some other way men could belong?  Maybe the <br/>\nmen could belong to a brother order, The Brothers of Mithaniel, with a close <br/>\nassociation with the Sisters of Erollisi?<br/>\nOther than those two quibbles, I think the idea in general is sound and I would <br/>\nenjoy belonging to this guild on a new server.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nICQ#23767351<br/>\n&quot;If Moses had been Pagan, there would have been drummers and dancers around the burning bush.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow that you are &#39;For Women&#39; by using free email from 4wmn.com!  www.4wmn.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
