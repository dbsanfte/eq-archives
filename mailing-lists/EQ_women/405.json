Level 35 is actually really hard for a soloing necro,<br/>\nespecially with the recent nerfs to DOT spells.  In butcherblock however<br/>\nthere are a wide range of dwarven NPCs, some that will give very good xp<br/>\nfor your level.  You don&#39;t want to attack anything that isn&#39;t blue.  I<br/>\nbelieve for example that south of the docks area there are some NPC<br/>\ndwarven guards that should be blue to you, but I would strongly<br/>\nrecommend you get a SOW before trying them, I haven&#39;t fought them myself<br/>\nand they might be really tough.<br/>\n<br/>\nAsking other level 40+ necros on your server should also help you find<br/>\ngood sources of xp.  Most people are happy to talk about where they got<br/>\ntheir xp 5 levels ago or more.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
