Is it just <br/>\nme? Have I got too much wussiness factor in me? Or am I just a <br/>\nmediocre role-player? Or both?!?! ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso.. has anyone else had their heart broken in eq? Silly question I <br/>\nknow, but i guess I just want reassurance that I&#39;m not alone here ;P <br/>\nIn fact, I met a guy the other day whose heart was broken by a girl <br/>\nin eq, so it&#39;s not just a girlie thing i guess..<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, i&#39;m in Australia in rl, and my Tunare chars are Athens, Rynni <br/>\nand Lrynn (tho Lrynn may be taking a break..) and on Morell-Thule are <br/>\nJhasper, Leilanni and Volare.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
