For the suggestions offered by you ladies, let me thank you, <br/>\nalthough I doubt I&#39;ll be using them.  &quot;Life is good&quot; for me, too...as <br/>\nmy wife has gradually weaned herself out of EQ&#39;s grip.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the record, I agree:<br/>\n1. EQ, as with any pasttime, is harmless - in moderation<br/>\n2. The game itself is not &quot;evil&quot;; SOE is not Satan<br/>\n3. What people do with their time is their own business<br/>\nand...<br/>\n4. The vast majority of EQ players play responsibly<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, my wife did not.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe began playing playing in Sep 01, and by May 02 was up to about 18 <br/>\nhours a day, 7 days a week (with some - few - exceptions).  Her life <br/>\nconsisted of rolling off of the couch at noon, slumping directly to <br/>\nher PC, and battling mobs until dawn.  She would not leave the house <br/>\nfor 20-30 days at a stretch (seriously, not even step foot into the <br/>\nyard, let alone get into her Lexus)<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, I worked about 12 hours a day (active duty military), plus <br/>\na 1-hour commute to-and-from work.  When I got home, all the chores - <br/>\nand I mean ALL - fell to me: cook, clean, laundry, home repair, <br/>\nshopping, trash, entertainment of our daughter (5), bills, etc, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn weekends she suggested I take our daughter &quot;out somewhere&quot;...so <br/>\nshe could play uninterrupted.  Later she would say that her playing <br/>\nwhile I did chores all day made her feel guilty.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor six months, I went to bed alone, listening to her typing away <br/>\namid all the EQ-sounds.  In the morning, as I got dressed for work, <br/>\nshe&#39;d be there slumped on the couch.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOccasionally, I&#39;d read her character logs while she slept, because <br/>\nI&#39;d wonder what a 36-y.o. woman could possibly have to discuss with <br/>\nteenage and 20-something males for endless hours...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friends suggested throwing her PC out with the trash.  My MOTHER <br/>\nIN LAW (!) suggested I move out (she has 3 EQ-addicted daughters).<br/>\n<br/>\nEventually...inevitably...we had a confrontation over EQ; I said <br/>\nshe&#39;d become a BUM, she admitted the game controlled her life.  I <br/>\nmade it clear that I&#39;d be there for her when she&#39;s ready to rejoin <br/>\nRL; meanwhile, I&#39;m living my life too.  Now, at 39, I&#39;m in the best <br/>\nshape of my life (run 30 miles a week), have finished my 2nd masters, <br/>\nready to retire from military next year comfortably.  Life IS good.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe continues to play, but her playtime has greatly diminished (about <br/>\n10 hours a week now, mostly due to our daughter beginning grade <br/>\nschool).<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the long post, but when I read the original message, it <br/>\nstruck a nerve.  To you ladies who play EQ responsibly, I&#39;m sorry if <br/>\nyou were offended.  But I hope you can appreciate my feelings, and <br/>\nthe reasons for them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll keep my future rants in more appropriate forums (EQ Widows, <br/>\nSpousesAgainstEQ, OLGAnon.org)<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@yahoogroups.com\">EQ_women@yahoogroups.com</a>, Denise Fullenwider <br/>\n&lt;d_fullenwider@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Ok this is to much to let go by.

I started<br/>\n&gt; playing EQ because it was my husband&#39;s game for 3<br/>\n&gt; years before I started, and I wanted to share the time<br/>\n&gt; with him not away from him! I was lonely for his<br/>\n&gt; attention. He didn&#39;t have to raise the kids, cook the<br/>\n&gt; meals, go to practice, clean the house, I DID. If<br/>\n&gt; anyone was neglected from their family it was me. Get<br/>\n&gt; a clue! If you have a regret of neglecting your family<br/>\n&gt; look at yourself, but don&#39;t throw your dirty laundry<br/>\n&gt; in my yard wash it! Judgemental people really irritate<br/>\n&gt; me! You play what you want and I&#39;ll play what I want,<br/>\n&gt; right along with my family and friends.

As far as MY mother <br/>\n&gt; &gt; goes, she&#39;s recently divorced (and i had to go to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; her 47th cake-and-icecream <br/>\n&gt; &gt; birthday party w/ HER parents this weekend) and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; quite insane.

My 21 year old brother who still<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lives with her is on <br/>\n&gt; &gt; some HEAVY ass drugs (they can make him walk home<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from a 70mph collision and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; go to sleep, but make him angry when the police wake<br/>\n&gt; &gt; him up to come clean up <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the dmg done..*amazingly no charges were pressed in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that matter*)...  My <br/>\n&gt; &gt; dear sister...  well i promised never to talk about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; her hehehehe....  really <br/>\n&gt; &gt; i did...  Anything I write about her has to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; approved for public <br/>\n&gt; &gt; release...  even a yahoogroup...  Now...  What I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doing when I should be <br/>\n&gt; &gt; tending to my family...  I am lvling a necro of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; course, and also GOING TO <br/>\n&gt; &gt; COLLEGE so that i wont make the thrilling 2.17 an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hour of a waitress for the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; rest of my accursed days.  So shame on us!  Shame on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; us women who have less <br/>\n&gt; &gt; than perfect families where mothers are sluts and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; brothers fight cops and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; husbands whine like toddlers over the slightest<br/>\n&gt; &gt; diversion of a wife&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; &gt; attention.

You<br/>\n&gt; &gt; probably made her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;feel as if you didn&#39;t care about her anymore.  Her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guildies did.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Frankly, at 47 yrs old, I have seen enough<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fireworks (twice a year<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;off my back deck.)  I have no other family alive<br/>\n&gt; &gt; except the hubby<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;and the kids.  (And his family is in California.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t go along<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;because 5 hour plane rides are bad for my health.) <br/>\n&gt; &gt; And parades are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;just flat-out boring.  I DO have hot, fresh food<br/>\n&gt; &gt; every night for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the boys.  I am a substitute teacher, part-time<br/>\n&gt; &gt; grad. student,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;computer repair technician, run 17 yahoo groups and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do nutritional<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;consulting.  I got into EQ so I would have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; something to talk about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;with my boys who are also bored by parades.  Maybe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the real world<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;just isn&#39;t as challenging as learning to &quot;swim&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; underwater in a 3-D<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;castle.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Having them at their father&#39;s, on the weekends,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; really helps my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;relationship with my husband and allows me to have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a really clean<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;house for two days a week.  He just lets them sit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; around and watch<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;tv all the time.  At least when they are playing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; EQ, they are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;thinking.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Your reminder is well-taken though as my hubby does<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sometimes feel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;neglected because I am not ready when he is.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;*********** REPLY SEPARATOR  ***********<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;On 7/6/03 at Dave wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;____Oh, thank goodness your holiday won&#39;t be ruined<br/>\n&gt; &gt; by the presence<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;____your family.
