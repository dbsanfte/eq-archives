Now, I think that<br/>\n20-year-old boys are a mass of emotion anyway, and I wouldn&#39;t be caught dead<br/>\nflirting with one (too much potential to cause lasting damage), but as long as<br/>\nshe is only flirting, and not letting him get serious... no, she shouldn&#39;t send<br/>\nhim anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is a woman using emotional deceit, if she flirts with a boy, and allows<br/>\n&gt; him to assume she&#39;s not married, when she is?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What exactly must we disclose when we flirt with someone online before<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;re being emotionally deceitful? Why do people get so worked up over<br/>\n&gt; disclosing gender, in comparison with other qualities that define us?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Flirting has always relied on non verbal cues, up to this point in history;<br/>\nallowing the physical chemistry or lack thereof to place a natural limitation or<br/>\nacceleration on the process.  Those cues are missing, as is the knowledge of<br/>\nwhether someone is physically attractive when met on the &#39;Net.  What we now have<br/>\nis a nation trying to reinvent the rules for romance, and flirting is considered<br/>\nthe first rule of romance.  No more sidelong glances, no more looking at each<br/>\nother admiringly; for the most part, not even phone contact.  When flirting<br/>\ncrosses the line--and it doesn&#39;t always--it&#39;s now romance.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn romance, the rules are no different on the &#39;Net than in real life (although I,<br/>\nfrankly, would use extreme caution when getting involved romantically on the<br/>\n&#39;Net).  Full disclosure is mandatory before you transition from flirting to<br/>\ndating.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe should be able to control that transition on the &#39;Net as well as we do in real<br/>\nlife (or better, I would hope).  If you are comfortable, as a married black man,<br/>\nflirting as a single blonde female wood elf, my only concern would be that you<br/>\nmaintain the relationships you initiate in exactly the fashion you started them.<br/>\nI cannot stress enough that otherwise, by allowing the relationship to<br/>\ntransition, you are being deceitful.  When you create a character with the intent<br/>\nand purpose to &#39;become&#39; that character for others, then you are only deceitful<br/>\nwhen you stop being that character.  If you commit to a certain personality, then<br/>\nyou are only deceitful when you stop being that personality.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; On the other hand, that 20-year-old boy is going to be way hurt if he EVER<br/>\n&gt; finds out.  That&#39;s why I pick on people my own size, hehe, or as my cousin<br/>\n&gt; would say, &#39;He&#39;s below the legal limit!  Throw &#39;em back!&#39;  But then, that&#39;s my<br/>\n&gt; take as a 30-year-old woman who shares her age with anyone.  I have a few boys<br/>\n&gt; related to me that are very wounded now, and I just want to kill the women<br/>\n&gt; responsible because they knew full well what they were doing.  Maybe I hold<br/>\n&gt; women to a higher standard, and maybe it&#39;s wrong, but I don&#39;t expect men to<br/>\n&gt; think of others because they&#39;re well, men, and I expect women to.  &lt;sigh&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; apologize if I have offended.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Aelwesara, Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
