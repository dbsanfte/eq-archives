I dated somebody 10 years<br/>\nolder than myself and after a short while into our<br/>\nrelationship, it caused problems.  I thought he was<br/>\nthe perfect person, and he was, however...  I was<br/>\nyoung, just a few years out of High School and had<br/>\ndifferant dreams and ambitions.  He had already<br/>\nexperienced those things 10 years earlier.  It became<br/>\na big problem because he wanted to move forward, have<br/>\nkids, get a house, and everything.  Where as I wanted<br/>\nto play, party, and generally be a 20 year old.  I<br/>\nhave seen some relationships work with that big of an<br/>\nage gap, however, it is very very tough.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Suzanne J.

The generation<br/>\n&gt; gap causing difficulties<br/>\n&gt; later on?  That&#39;s really the only thing you have to<br/>\n&gt; think about.  I dated<br/>\n&gt; someone 14 years older than me and since our life<br/>\n&gt; experiences were so<br/>\n&gt; different, and our aims and goals so different, we<br/>\n&gt; were unable to resolve<br/>\n&gt; our disparity.  Of course, we couldn&#39;t tell that at<br/>\n&gt; the beginning of the<br/>\n&gt; relationship.  It took three years out of our lives<br/>\n&gt; and caused a great deal<br/>\n&gt; of anguish, as neither of us could forgive the other<br/>\n&gt; for not bridging that<br/>\n&gt; gap more perfectly.  Like I said (IMO), that&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt; big question.

I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t think I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; realized how much I looked forward to running into<br/>\n&gt; certain<br/>\n&gt; &gt; friends/characters in the game. I have made what I<br/>\n&gt; feel to be many<br/>\n&gt; &gt; good friendships. Ok to the question. One friend<br/>\n&gt; that I felt very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; close to became closer. We talked on the phone and<br/>\n&gt; kept in touch<br/>\n&gt; &gt; almost everyday. I am divorced and single and he<br/>\n&gt; is single. He came<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to Arizona to visit me and sure one thing led to<br/>\n&gt; another and the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rest is history. We are both wildly happy and in<br/>\n&gt; love, want to spend<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the rest of our lives together and fade into the<br/>\n&gt; sunset happily ever<br/>\n&gt; &gt; after. Here is my dilema ~ like I said I am 43, a<br/>\n&gt; young 43 (and its<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not me saying that) my picture is on my profile ~<br/>\n&gt; he is 20, a very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mature, responsible 20 but none the less 20. What<br/>\n&gt; in the hell do I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do??? Most of me wants to say screw what others<br/>\n&gt; might think and just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be happy with him, but the rest of me says leave<br/>\n&gt; him to live his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; life. When I discuss that with him he just says<br/>\n&gt; stop trying to find<br/>\n&gt; &gt; excuses why we can&#39;t be together and just be<br/>\n&gt; happy. How can I argue<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with that??? Some advice ladies?? please<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====<br/>\nCome check out &#39;The Masquerade&#39;.
