My partner almost since I<br/>\nbegan playing and in-game mate for most of my characters seems to have<br/>\ndecided not to play.  I wanted to settle onto Brell where I got involved<br/>\nwith a fun RPG guild.  He decided, after umpteen changes of characters,<br/>\nin retrospect we changed everytime I started making friends outside the<br/>\npartnership, that he didn&#39;t want to play on Brell anymore, and wanted to<br/>\ngo back to our original couple.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the loss has really taken its toll on my joy in EQ.  I have<br/>\nanother sometime partner romantically for one of my new characters (he<br/>\nplays my &quot;sugar daddy&quot;) but now his RL is falling apart.  *sigh*<br/>\n<br/>\nMy RL is TOTALLY stable, okay, so maybe that is why I look for a little<br/>\nfun and romance in-game.  But, this is so much like the old days of<br/>\ndating.  Anyway, I&#39;m drifting between characters right now, mostly<br/>\nthinking Necromancer is my all time favorite class.  But as she was<br/>\nformed with my partner, it&#39;s hard to separate them.  Just before we<br/>\nsplit, she had moved from apprentice to journeyman and he asked her to<br/>\nmarry him at her second naming.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to ramble on.  Just needing someone to listen, I guess.  I&#39;m kind<br/>\nof sad about it all.  And confused.<br/>\n<br/>\nDnaisha on Brell<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Draigen@...\">Draigen@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hail & Well Met,<br/>\n&gt; I just joined the mailing list and I am looking forward to meeting all<br/>\n&gt; of you.
