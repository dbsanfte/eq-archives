Only problem is, I can&#39;t find any of my old emails telling me which<br/>\none you ladies decided on (I had to reformat my hard drive due to virus<br/>\ninfestation, caught immediately, so no harm done to anyone but me), and the<br/>\nname of the guild that was created especially for us, by us.

The wedding will take place on the<br/>\n&gt; Quellious server Sunday, Aug.7 at 5 PM Pacifc, 8 PM Eastern Daylight<br/>\n&gt; time at the Temple of Marr in North Freeport.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ****<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am Dnaice, a high elf wizard on Quellious server and, occasionally,<br/>\n&gt; Trisango a human cleric on Brell Serilis.  My love, Corellon and I met<br/>\n&gt; in  Norrath and know absolutely nothing about one another on any<br/>\n&gt; dimension outside of Norrath which, we feel, makes this romance and<br/>\n&gt; wedding extremely special.

It is a<br/>\n&gt; grand and glorious spectacle.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I look forward to getting to know other women who play, particularly<br/>\n&gt; roleplay.  I would dearly love to create an all female hunting party.
