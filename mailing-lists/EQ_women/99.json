I&#39;ve personally just yesterday started one major twink.  We<br/>\n&gt; always seem to have a shortage of clerics, so I created a dwarven cleric<br/>\n&gt; and equipped it with my 36th level character&#39;s backup armor.  This means<br/>\n&gt; several pieces of bronze (including chest and helmet), lizard cloak and<br/>\n&gt; mantle, bear hide belt, and everything else banded.  And a mucking bit<br/>\n&gt; 2handed blunt weapon called Midnight Mallet that I picked up at an auction<br/>\n&gt; (11 damage, 44 delay, sometimes squashes 1st level monsters in one hit).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The dwarf&#39;s name is Staar. In the description area of the character I wrote<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Twinkle twinkle little Staar, what a twinked-up Dwarf you are. Armored up<br/>\n&gt; in shiny bronze -- that stuff&#39;s not from Orcish pawns!  - Windsong&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   - Beth &quot;BethMo&quot; Moursund<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
