Well, it seems eventually <br/>\nis coming sooner than I thought! &lt;g&gt;  Ok, ok, I&#39;ll spit <br/>\nit out. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;ic&gt;<br/>\nLast night Rezok proposed to me ... and I accepted!! :-) <br/>\n Isn&#39;t it thrilling?! &lt;claps her hands in excitement&gt;  <br/>\nWe&#39;ve not set a date or ironed out any plans yet.  I <br/>\nthink I was just too excited being *betrothed* to think <br/>\nclearly on all the details.  And oh! there&#39;s so many <br/>\ndetails. &lt;mind races&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was sooooo romantic.  He secretly planned to have two <br/>\nof our closest friends there to witness.  And then he <br/>\nrecited a beautiful poem to me ... the last line of which <br/>\nwas &quot;Will you marry me, we&#39;d make quite a pair&quot;.  I sat <br/>\nstunned for a moment, then blurted out &quot;Really?&quot; (what a <br/>\nfool I felt later).  It took me some doing to find my <br/>\nvoice and answer &quot;YES&quot; ... poor fellow had to sit there <br/>\nand wait while I got my brain to working again. &lt;s&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, I could ramble on and on ... so I&#39;ll spare you <br/>\nall. :-)  Once we have the wedding details ironed out, I <br/>\nshall let you all know ... for of course, you&#39;re all <br/>\ninvited. &lt;s&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSafe travels,<br/>\nWynsong<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. - Dnaice, I shall try very hard to attend your <br/>\nwedding. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n~~~ Remember that our illusion of control is just <br/>\nthat ... an illusion ~~~<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:weya@...\">weya@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:weya@...\">weya@...</a><br/>\nICQ#1976509<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n </span></blockquote>___<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n </span></blockquote>___<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 9<br/>\n&gt;   Date: Thu, 05 Aug 1999 11:41:54 -0700<br/>\n&gt;   From: Judy Tyrer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:judy3t@...\">judy3t@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Marriage<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It is so interesting to read one another&#39;s experiences.

It <br/>\n </span></blockquote>depends upon what &quot;rating&quot;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; &lt;g&gt; you want that portion of the rp to be.

You could decide to go on a trip to a &quot;romantic&quot; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>spot in Norrath and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; hunt, explore, etc.  Or if you wish, you could take the roleplay <br/>\n </span></blockquote>further ....   To me,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; the roleplaying is about how the character(s) is perceived in Norrath. <br/>\n </span></blockquote> So that doesn&#39;t<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; mean I have to roleplay every single detail.  Heck, we don&#39;t roleplay <br/>\n </span></blockquote>going to the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; bathroom or showering or any of the hundreds of mundane (or not <br/>\n </span></blockquote>so mundane) personal<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; things we do irl.  Personally, my honeymoon will probably be rated <br/>\n </span></blockquote>pg to pg-13 &lt;g&gt; ...<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Disney would prolly be able to put it in one of their movies, lol. <br/>\n </span></blockquote> But the concept of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; honeymoon will be there<br/>\n&gt;&gt; for everyone (us, friends, &quot;family&quot;) ... and that&#39;s the important <br/>\n </span></blockquote>part.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; As a side note ... I did have a marriage on Realm and while the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>characters were<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; roleplaying their &quot;true love&quot; for the world ... the other player <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and I would be /t&#39;ing<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; each other chatting about all kinds of &lt;ic&gt; and &lt;ooc&gt; stuff.  When <br/>\n </span></blockquote>it came time for the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; honeymoon, we retired to the bedroom while our friends partied <br/>\n </span></blockquote>in the next room ... and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; just joked around and chatted some more.
