Please let us know when<br/>\nyou finalize your plans.  A friend of mine just recently got married in the<br/>\nforest outside Erud, and we kept having to kill an NPC necromancer.  During<br/>\nthe ceremony.   =P<br/>\nAnyway, congrats again!<br/>\nLove,<br/>\nAelwesara/Sara, Povar<br/>\n<br/>\nChristina Norman wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Christina Norman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tina@...\">tina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I never intended to get married in EQ, but somehow it has happened.  Luna<br/>\n&gt; my 50th level enchanter will be marrying Duna a 45th level monk on Brell<br/>\n&gt; Serelis. Details of the wedding have not been finalized, but it will<br/>\n&gt; probably happen in about two weeks.  I&#39;ll try and post more information to<br/>\n&gt; the list when I get it.  We may be married in the throne room of King<br/>\n&gt; Tranix the fire giant, in which case attendence of the wedding would be<br/>\n&gt; limited to those levels 40+.  We may have a more mundane wedding, in which<br/>\n&gt; case I would like to invite everyone to attend.  I think a nice alternate<br/>\n&gt; wedding spot would be the erollisi sisters island, only I&#39;m worried some<br/>\n&gt; of the guests would be KOS =/ Nothing makes a wedding suck more than NPCs<br/>\n&gt; trying to kill your friends. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
