We were \n  married<br>&gt; in game&nbsp; at the little dock in nro at sunset that<br>&gt; \n  takes you to IC when we&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&gt; made lvl 20&nbsp; and that was \n  about a 1 1/2 ago. We<br>&gt; spent almost every night eather grped or we \n  would<br>&gt; talk in game, after about a month we started talking<br>&gt; \n  over the phone, slowly our friendship grew in the<br>&gt; real world. <br>&gt; \n  The only problem was he was on the other side of the<br>&gt; US from me so it \n  was limited to just talking on the<br>&gt; phone, the feelings for each other \n  grew and we found<br>&gt; we had we had fell in love for real. we wanted \n  to<br>&gt; meet&nbsp; but at that time it wasnt a thing we could do.<br>&gt; \n  we continued to talk daily on eq and on the phone<br>&gt; for about a year. We \n  then started to talk using<br>&gt; netmeeting and did that for a few months. \n  We started<br>&gt; both feeling<br>&gt; of wanting to be togeather very \n  strongly. we then<br>&gt; started making plans for him to come down so \n  we<br>&gt; could meet for real. This last July he spent 3 weeks<br>&gt; here \n  wiht me. we had so much fun and both of us<br>&gt; realized how much we&nbsp; \n  loved being with each other.<br>&gt; We both realized how hard it was going to \n  be for him<br>&gt; to go back home. We talked about him moving here.<br>&gt; \n  At the end of aug he moved him self down here to<br>&gt; move in with \n  me.<br>&gt; We are very happy togeather and cant imagine what it<br>&gt; would \n  be to be wiht one an other now. He is a very<br>&gt; loving person and im very \n  happy and feel very luck<br>&gt; to have found him. The odds of us meeting in \n  game<br>&gt; are huge and the odds of us grping in the same grp<br>&gt; that \n  night are even bigger. So we&nbsp; feel it was<br>&gt; totally ment to be. \n  <br>&gt; So see wonderful things can happen from playing a<br>&gt; game and \n  ingame marrage.<br>&gt; so i guess that is my answer about getting \n  married<br>&gt; in the game.<br>&gt; Tyhana Storm<br>&gt; 55 cleric<br>&gt; \n  Bertoxx <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Ps my cleric as preformed a few marrages now \n  also<br>&gt; and those ppl are still very happy with there<br>&gt; partner in \n  the game.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br>&gt; From: \n  &quot;Brangvyne&quot; &lt;brangvyne7@...&gt;<br>&gt; Date: Wed, 06 Nov 2002 \n  22:24:26 -0000<br>&gt; To: EQ_women@yahoogroups.com<br>&gt; Subject: \n  [EQ_women] Question Me This . . .<br>&gt; <br>&gt; \n  &lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; &lt;tt&gt;<br>&gt; \n  :o)&lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; Hi!&lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; I sent a long post the other day and hoped on the<br>&gt; \n  list today only to &lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; realize that it had not made it to this \n  list at all.<br>&gt; In fact, &lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; apparently my last couple of \n  posts didn&#39;t make it to<br>&gt; the list.&lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; \n  Sometimes I can be so dumb . . . but I can&#39;t help<br>&gt; but wonder where I \n  &lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; sent the crazy things.&lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; \n  :o)&lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; Anyway, a little question for anyone \n  who might think<br>&gt; about &lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; answering . . \n  .&lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; &lt;BR&gt;<br>&gt; Is there a level limit you need to be \n  to get married<br>&gt; in EQ?
