I&#39;ve personally just yesterday started one major twink.  We <br/>\nalways seem to have a shortage of clerics, so I created a dwarven cleric <br/>\nand equipped it with my 36th level character&#39;s backup armor.  This means <br/>\nseveral pieces of bronze (including chest and helmet), lizard cloak and <br/>\nmantle, bear hide belt, and everything else banded.  And a mucking bit <br/>\n2handed blunt weapon called Midnight Mallet that I picked up at an auction <br/>\n(11 damage, 44 delay, sometimes squashes 1st level monsters in one hit).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dwarf&#39;s name is Staar. In the description area of the character I wrote <br/>\n&quot;Twinkle twinkle little Staar, what a twinked-up Dwarf you are. Armored up <br/>\nin shiny bronze -- that stuff&#39;s not from Orcish pawns!  - Windsong&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  - Beth &quot;BethMo&quot; Moursund</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
