I sent over there and took a<br/>\nlook around. There is a lot of good information there,<br/>\nabout different professions. I&#39;m actually tailoring<br/>\nnow more than fletching but it appears that lots and<br/>\nlots of time could be spent on these activities if you<br/>\nreally wanted to get good at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nApparently there is a market for this kind of stuff<br/>\nthough. I carry around sewing kits, patterns etc. with<br/>\nme pretty much wherever I go lately and in the last<br/>\ncouple days I&#39;ve had three people ask me about if I<br/>\nwas a tailor and could I do something for them.<br/>\nAt this point me skills are so poor that I decline<br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fletching question came about more from getting<br/>\nthe treant bow staff and wanting to turn it into a<br/>\nbow. Well it&#39;s clear from the little I read on<br/>\nfletching last night that even if I go get the rest of<br/>\nthe materials I need my chances of actually making a<br/>\nbow are slim untill I had a lot more practive, so any<br/>\nsuggestions on how I would be able to find someone<br/>\nwith enough skill in bowmaking that if I gave them the<br/>\nmaterial and offered to pay them some platinum they<br/>\nmight make the bow for me?<br/>\n<br/>\n:o)<br/>\nBran<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Christina Norman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tina@...\">tina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Fletching can be fun but it takes a lot of money,<br/>\n&gt; you can find more <br/>\n&gt; information on fletching and other trade skills<br/>\n&gt; here:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eqtraders.com/learn/learn_fletching.htm\">http://www.eqtraders.com/learn/learn_fletching.htm</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s generally cheaper to buy bows and arrows from<br/>\n&gt; merchants than fletch <br/>\n&gt; them.
