I&#39;m wondering how people think it will be?  I was kind of interested in race wars, since is was an unusual form of PvP.  I&#39;ve never really been interested in killing other players, but having the possibility available changes the dynamic of the game, and that is interesting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I&#39;m worried based on what I&#39;ve heard on the test server that race wars is just going to be a bloodbath.  The fact that you can&#39;t kill your own team is perhaps giving people the extra motivation to kill people on other teams for no reason other than the fact that they can.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else have any thoughts on this one?<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGet free personalized email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.iname.com\">http://www.iname.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
