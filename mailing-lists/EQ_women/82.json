I have been a computer<br/>\n&gt; addict for about 15 years.  The two just seem to mesh so very well.  I<br/>\n&gt; started online gaming with The Realm and moved to Meridian 59 where I met my<br/>\n&gt; r/l best friend.  Hopefully he will soon have his computer up to speed and<br/>\n&gt; will be joining me in EQ. Btw, he just turned 60.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I come from a predominantly matriarchal family and the elder women have<br/>\n&gt; always been strong role models.  My mother is 96 and still works full time<br/>\n&gt; in her craft shop.  Nobody ever taught any of us that age was a limiting<br/>\n&gt; factor. lol<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now that I am disabled, and spend most of my time at home, I am very<br/>\n&gt; thankful for worlds such as EQ.  EQ gives me contact with the outside world<br/>\n&gt; that is beyond my limited r/l world.  I live in a very small community in<br/>\n&gt; r/l so the larger one of EQ is very precious to me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh, happy news:  Kachine and Mondre were married in Rivervale, Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt; on June 19th.   They are very happy and will be hosting a big party later so<br/>\n&gt; all of their friends can help them celebrate their love.  They were to be<br/>\n&gt; married July 10th but just couldn&#39;t wait so they eloped.  When the party<br/>\n&gt; date has been set there will be an announcement here so that all of you who<br/>\n&gt; are on Bristlebane or just want to come visit Bristlebane, can come have<br/>\n&gt; some fun with them.   There will be some games and lots of food and drink.<br/>\n&gt; Get those alcohol tolerance skills up for the drunken relay races. hehe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you, Beth, for asking about my experiences with gaming.  I wish more<br/>\n&gt; of my generation would give it a try.  I think it is a great stress reliever<br/>\n&gt; and such a wonderful opportunity for expanding ones world.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good hunting and stay safe,<br/>\n&gt; Janice<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Beth Moursund &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scrybsprite@...\">scrybsprite@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_women@onelist.com\">eq_women@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, June 20, 1999 12:28 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EQ_women] fun after 40<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Beth Moursund &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scrybsprite@...\">scrybsprite@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Janice writes:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;By the way, regarding the subject of &quot;older women&quot; playing EQ, I bet I am<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;one of oldest.  I will be 49 next month.  Not that it matters.   Maybe it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;will give some of you young gals hope that there IS fun after 40.  Boy,<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;there ever fun after 40.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s great!  You&#39;re certainly on the tip of the demographic curve for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; computer games.  How did you happen to start playing Everquest?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; By the way, I&#39;m 35.  My mother is over 60, and she plays some computer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; games.
