My cleric is level 17 and engaged to <br/>\nbe married to a level 19 Barbarian Shaman.<br/>\nWe always play together and we really do some bad damage. He is playing the <br/>\nhealer and the tank and so do I. And both we rely on eachoter to heal and <br/>\ntank. We have the perfect relationship hehehe.<br/>\nSometimes when we group I see that the others expect me to do nothing else <br/>\nthan healing..and yes..my spellbook becomes my world. Thats why I prefer to <br/>\nexplore the world at the side of my love, being respected as a fully equal <br/>\npartner.<br/>\n<br/>\nTharca<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Suzanne Johnson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katannah@...\">katannah@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@onelist.com\">EQ_women@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@onelist.com\">EQ_women@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ_women] Shamans and Clerics<br/>\n&gt;Date: Sun, 27 Jun 1999 23:09:47 -0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: Suzanne Johnson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katannah@...\">katannah@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Funny you should mention our nurturing vs. servile sterotypes. I was quite<br/>\n&gt;the little healer in a previous game, and yes, I got heartily sick of it.<br/>\n&gt;So I play a tank.  Granted, this tank has a tiny little healing spell that<br/>\n&gt;does come in handy, but she is primarily a TANK.  I spend alot of time<br/>\n&gt;guarding our male clerics and paladins while they&#39;re medding after healing<br/>\n&gt;my fanny back up to full while I kept them alive long enough to bash the<br/>\n&gt;mobs on the head a few times and cast Strike or Ward Undead or whichever.  <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;love the role reversal!  And they really do appreciate me taunting critters<br/>\n&gt;off them and watching them while they meditate.  I have received many<br/>\n&gt;expressions of gratitude, and I love being the one dishin&#39; out the damage.<br/>\n&gt;The funniest part is that I play a wood elf, who is tiny, and they play <br/>\n&gt;high<br/>\n&gt;elves and humans, who are much larger.  &lt;chuckles&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     I even have a special emote set up for them:  &quot;Sara stands guard over<br/>\n&gt;the tall one, looking quite fierce!&quot;  Got that sucker hotkeyed, and they<br/>\n&gt;know I&#39;m on duty. =)<br/>\n&gt;     The cleric I play is a dark elf, so she&#39;s not really the nurturing <br/>\n&gt;type<br/>\n&gt;either.  I chose to play a cleric on that server (Rallos Zek) because some<br/>\n&gt;of the guys from my guild crossed over, and I thought it&#39;d be neat to have<br/>\n&gt;some ingame role reversal.  Also, I liked the concept of being able to<br/>\n&gt;wander around, pondering aloud whether someone would make an appropriate<br/>\n&gt;sacrifice to my God, the Prince of Hate.  I would like to do that in real<br/>\n&gt;life some days.<br/>\n&gt;     By the way, Barbarian Shaman ROCK!!!!  They&#39;re a really cool class, <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;the ones I have met enjoy themselves thoroughly. =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sara, Povar<br/>\n&gt;Valdaya, Rallos Zek<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;terrence wallingford wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: terrence wallingford &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:greenloafers@...\">greenloafers@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would just like to tell everyone out there who is a Cleric that they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just might like to try out a shaman. I spent 18 levels being a Cleric<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and 5 being a Shaman so far. I was always frustrated with my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; limitations as a Cleric and took on way too much responsibility for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other people&#39;s lives, which made grouping a very un-fun experience. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; love being a Shaman so far. ( I&#39;ve made 2 new characters in Quellios.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bloodless and Blacksatin) Go ahead and laugh at the names, it&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; best I can do on such short notice! I agonized believe me. Someone even<br/>\n&gt; &gt; called me &quot;campy&quot;!- whatever that means. I&#39;m only 25, that term&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; before my time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anyway, I&#39;ve played on that server for a total of 3 days and have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; noticed, not just me - also complete strangers, that most people on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that server are really helpfull and nice. Or maybe just the people in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Halas as that&#39;s the only town I&#39;ve been in. I encourage you guys to try<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it out as I have been so happy. I don&#39;t die constantly and I don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to sit out the action all the time. I get to actually participate as a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; part of the group instead of staring at my spellbook all the time with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; nothing to do but chat. Not that chatting is at all bad, but I want to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have some fun too!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have noticed that a lot of us have said that we play clerics, it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; seems more than any other class. (Or maybe I only notice the clerics<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because I play one.)I hope this doesn&#39;t offend you all, but I wonder if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we have chosen to play one because we are by nature nurturing and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; helpfull, or because we have been raised in our society to act servile<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to men. (I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve raised a few hackles-sorry!) It bothered me that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would be one of the only women in rl playing a female character in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; any given group and I would be forced to sit and heal all the male<br/>\n&gt; &gt; warriors. I grew resentfull. I&#39;m wondering if many of you have done the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; same thing, or if this just says a lot about me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks! :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Looking to expand your world?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; ONElist has 175,000 e-mail communities from which to choose!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Where do some of the Internet&#39;s largest email lists reside?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;At ONElist - the most scalable and reliable service on the Internet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
