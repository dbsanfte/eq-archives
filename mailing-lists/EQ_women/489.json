We&#39;re both non-competitive, have as much fun as you can, love-to-explore-and-do-quests kinda gals. We&#39;ve both been playing for well over a year and our primaries are still low thirties. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe saddest issue I&#39;ve had to come to terms with in EQ is my friends who in the early days used to love to do all the above mentioned, but have since become power levellers and (shudders as she says it) *Kewl Lewt* campers. From what used to be a friends list that was always crammed with 20 names, its down to low teens now as my friends have slowly turned away from the fun playing times we used to have. A couple of &quot;Bless-Yer-Heart&quot; friends have played as we always have and I thank the Gods for them, they&#39;ve kept me playing EQ. The others I have learned to wish the best and let them go their own way without any hurt feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, the most amazing part to me is when I do group with strangers and do my role-playing thing, within the hour, all but the hard-core powergamers are rp&#39;ing back with me and having a blast. Go figure.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, would I play a RP-devoted on-line game. Where the heck do I sign up? <br/>\n<br/>\nZuki<br/>\nTunare Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAngelfire for your free web-based e-mail. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.angelfire.com\">http://www.angelfire.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
