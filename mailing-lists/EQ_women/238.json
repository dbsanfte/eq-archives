Please let me know what<br/>\ndays are good for you, if you&#39;re interested in attending.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note, ladies, I&#39;m moving to MD tomorrow via cross-country truck *groans* so I will be<br/>\nout of contact for a WHOLE WEEK. *sniffles*But I hope to have lots to read when I get my computer<br/>\nset back up. (not so subtle hint) This is an interesting move for me because I&#39;ve quit my job and<br/>\nleft my significant other at the same time, so bear with me and my &quot;growing pains&quot; as I move back<br/>\nin with my parents to go back to college full-time (me and my two kids).  Hope no one out there<br/>\ncan relate, but I&#39;m sure some of you can.  Anyway, good luck in your hunts, your friends, and your<br/>\nfate, and I will see you all in about a week!<br/>\n<br/>\nSara, Povar<br/>\nValdaya, Rallos Zek<br/>\nIshtarre, Quellios</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
