Since I ve been in FRP a while, and realize the target audience is the younger ( ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1240412653\">Actually I sent an e-mail to eq (may be in the bit bucket for all I know).<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I&#39;ve been in FRP a while, and realize the target audience is the<br/>\nyounger ( &lt; 30) male .. I expected some as I put it: &quot;T&A&quot;.  However I<br/>\nwould want to have some more choice on being able to present my character<br/>\nas &quot;vamp&quot;/&quot;non-vamp professional&quot;.  I pretty much accept the characters<br/>\nstart in thier &quot;undies&quot;. :)  Its actually the graphics of worn items that<br/>\nI&#39;d like to see offer more choices, both in the less revealing and the more<br/>\nrevealing directions.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, here are the four main points of my e-mail.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. I accept skimpy clothing as a market necessity, as well a male playing a<br/>\nfemale character fantasizes looking that way in the role.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Depending on how the female playing a female created the character, she<br/>\nwill want a choice of revealing vs. non revealing, as well as busty vs.<br/>\nathletic in look.<br/>\n  a) Case in point .. I don&#39;t visualize myself looking like I&#39;m nursing<br/>\ntwins and wearing something I&#39;d be afraid to turn quickly in (and I do mean<br/>\nthe armors here) while going toe-to-toe, screaming orcish obscenities at an<br/>\norc in the snow!<br/>\n  b) Case in point .. I am an evil female mage and prefer to stay far from<br/>\ndirect combat and taunt, torment and distract my victims ... of course all<br/>\nthe clothing available to me makes me look like Nancy Reagan at a formal<br/>\nball!  (Disney does better evil female mage clothes!) <br/>\n<br/>\n3. The revealing wearable clothing vs. non-revealing clothing is BACKWARDS<br/>\nacross the classes.<br/>\n  a) Case in point .. A female Erudite Paladin upon purchase of her first<br/>\nlether tunic, finds herself going from a moderatly Paladinish cloth top to<br/>\n... a PINK HALTER TOP?  (from an RP stand point .. yeah right)  Leather<br/>\narmor across the board and most banded looks kinky not anything I&#39;d try and<br/>\nactually fight in.<br/>\n  b) Case in point .. see b above.  Mages aren&#39;t front-line.  I&#39;d love from<br/>\nan RP standppoint to imagine the female enchantress flashing a bit of chest<br/>\nright as that charm spell goes off ;)  But .. no back to nunnery with mages.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  As a long time RPer, I&#39;ve played as many male characters as female.<br/>\nWhy?  In the wrong crowd .. harassment.  EQ is pretty good IMHO on this<br/>\nscore.  But if you *know* you&#39;re playing in an area with many immature<br/>\nplayers .. a choice of a &quot;non-vamp&quot; character can make the difference<br/>\nbetween enjoyment and logging early and returning as a male character.<br/>\nAlso, an option if you fear some regular players whom you play with often<br/>\nare getting over &quot;fixated&quot; on your character.  Play long enough on-line ..<br/>\nyou&#39;ll find that there are times its better to tone it down.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, it was long.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, has anyone tested the &quot;Blonde Factor&quot;?  My daughter and I made test<br/>\ncharacters and tried to measure the number of males that started following<br/>\nthe character about, giving her items .. etc.  A Blonde human and a Blonde<br/>\nWood Elf .. no matter how sternly played ... attract a veritable HOST of<br/>\nmale groupies :)  Remake the character and replay in the same setting<br/>\n(modify name), but as a brunette .. and *poof* .. where&#39;d they all go?   My<br/>\ndaughter at 10 is flustered by all the male attention and now avoids Blonde<br/>\ncharacters like the plague.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Lora & her daughter Christina (Nooo not a Blonde!)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
