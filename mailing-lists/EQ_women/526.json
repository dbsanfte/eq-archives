Of course, neither<br/>\ndid I but they abandoned me in Lesser Feydark AND didn&#39;t split the loot<br/>\nfairly.<br/>\nThe second group I was with was great!  They were mostly lowbies (more<br/>\nexperienced players with fairly low level characters).  Lots of fun, and<br/>\nthey really helped me out with strategies and not getting lost (dumb<br/>\nblonde syndrome!)  I don&#39;t believe in twinking (sp?) but it is nice to<br/>\nget advice from more experienced folks.<br/>\nThe third group didn&#39;t go so well.  Each person had their own agenda,<br/>\nand couldn&#39;t agree on where to go and what to hunt.  I didn&#39;t stay with<br/>\nthem long.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice for grouping-make sure everyone agrees on plan of action<br/>\nbefore you start-including where to go, what to hunt, any quests people<br/>\nare on, and order of looting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nSandy-<br/>\nICQ- #9462081<br/>\nAIM- SandyW62<br/>\nLinenu-lvl 6 Druid-Torvonnilous</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
