I don&#39;t really flirt back because it<br/>\nis not in character with my human Paladin. I really think it&#39;s the armor I<br/>\nwear.

I discovered early in the game that<br/>\nmost males (no matter what race) liked the look of my character, a<br/>\nhalf-elf.  Many flirted with her before she even knew she was cute.  It<br/>\nwas in-character for Genneth (a bard) to flirt, so she is constantly<br/>\nengaging in flirting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to add to it, Genn has herself somewhat of a boyfriend in the game,<br/>\nanother member of her guild, Teban. (&#39;Course she still flirts with<br/>\nothers, but he understands that she is mostly committed to him ;) So,<br/>\nhas this phenomenon hit anyone else?  Do you get flirted with?  Have<br/>\nyou found yourself a steady??<br/>\n<br/>\nJust curious<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nHow has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\nShare your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
