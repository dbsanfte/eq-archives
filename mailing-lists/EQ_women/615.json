He calculated that half the <br/>\nfemale characters on EQ at any time are played  by males, but very <br/>\nfew women play male personae. This seems odd, but I have to say that <br/>\nI have very little interest in playing male characters, and it seems <br/>\nthat I am far from alone in this. Is our researcher correct, do you <br/>\nthink?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an aside, I wondered if I could tell which females were  male, and <br/>\nI conclude that, on the whole, I can&#39;t, if they don&#39;t want me to. <br/>\nSure, there are boys who give the game away with abuse and bad <br/>\nlanguage (or am I just stereotyping boyish behaviour?) and a <br/>\nproportion making their gender clear (the surname Crossdresser was a <br/>\ngiveaway,I though ;), but on the whole, I have no idea. To be honest, <br/>\nthe only ones I really assume to be women are those who keep going <br/>\nafk to deal with domestic issues; more stereotyping?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a few thoughts, if anyone is still there.....<br/>\nLove,<br/>\n<br/>\nLiz, aka Gyngermynx, ranger of the 27th hunt, Quellious</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
