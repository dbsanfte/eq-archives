The theory is that it&#39;s better for a cleric to heal a tank (so the tank can fight longer) than it is for the cleric to tank herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of ways you can play a cleric who doesn&#39;t just heal though! Here are a few.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, during the first 20 levels clerics can tank pretty good.  It&#39;s only at really high levels, when the warriors have dual wield, double attack, and much higher weapon skills, that the clerics start to fall way behind.  If you&#39;re not a power gamer, you may find that you can have most or all of your fun playing your character up to level 20 or so, tanking away.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, you can hunt in the undead dungeons like Unrest and Befallen.  These dungeons are amazing for clerics--it turns you basicly into a wizard who can heal and wear plate mail.  In fact, your spells do more damage and cost less mana than those of wizards the same level as you! So wade straight into combat with those undead.  Smack them with your hammer, burn them with your magic.  Submissive? I don&#39;t think so.  It&#39;s hard to be submissive when everyone in the dungeon is pleading with you to join their party.<br/>\n<br/>\nDruids have also been mentioned as a great alternative to clerics.  Druids have some of the highest damage spells in the game.  Our stinging swarm spells pack serious punch.  Our bolts are second only to those of wizards.  At high levels we can transform ourselves into wolves and get an attack bonus.  We can even transform our party tanks into wolves so they get an attack bonus. We also can heal very well, though not as good as clerics.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladins are another great option.  These girls can tank, dealing out damage toe on toe with warriors (well, almost quite toe on toe).  We have the added bonus of decent healing spells, some undead burn, and the incredible lay-on-hands that lets us &#39;emergency&#39; heal a party member for up to 1000 points of damage.  That&#39;s not bad for an ability you can use for free every 90 minutes.  You can be sure if you&#39;re a Paladin, no one is going to ask you to go med while other people fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast and perhaps most importantly of all, if you don&#39;t like medding during combat, don&#39;t do it.  Tell your party members you&#39;re not here to be a walking bandaid, and you&#39;re going to be tanking because you like to tank.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGet free personalized email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.iname.com\">http://www.iname.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
