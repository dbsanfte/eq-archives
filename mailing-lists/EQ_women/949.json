I am writing because Everquest has changed too much from the game that I originally","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1333122515\">To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:accounts@...\">accounts@...</a><br/>\nDear Friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy station name is (Edited).<br/>\n<br/>\nI am writing because Everquest has changed too much from the game <br/>\nthat I originally purchased to play. I have also purchased several <br/>\nexpansion packs.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly, there seems to be this occurrence called &quot;nerfing&quot; where Sony<br/>\nlimits a game feature by either discontinuing or severely limiting it,<br/>\nwhen in the past it was widely available.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpecifically, I play a druid character that has been rendered <br/>\nessentially<br/>\nuseless because of changes in the way the game is applied to the <br/>\ncharacter and its level (spells, etc). I only play that character <br/>\nand am not interested in starting another from scratch just because <br/>\nsomeone reprogrammed the game. I&#39;d rather quit.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, I have heard that Sony is trying to &quot;level out the playing <br/>\nfield&quot; with respect to these changes. What you have done is leveled <br/>\nmy character o the point that I cannot play without finding a large <br/>\ngroup.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did not intend to play with large groups, now or ever. And even <br/>\nwhen I do find a large group, my character&#39;s group value is useless <br/>\nto them. I can offer them nothing of value because my character now <br/>\ncannot contribute<br/>\nanymore either by direct attack or by &quot;buffing&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, the general feature called &quot;mana&quot; is severely defective <br/>\nin that it takes eons to regenrate. To counter this defect, I relied <br/>\non a spell that helped &quot;mana&quot; regenerate faster, named Kodiaks <br/>\nEndless Intellect. This spell has recently been &quot;nerfed&quot; to work <br/>\nonly on high level characters. Now, I sit and stare at a computer <br/>\nscreen, bored out of my mind. Where&#39;s the pleasure in playing your <br/>\ngame when all I do is sit. Its a waste of my time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, the issue of &quot;mana&quot;, and the amount of &quot;mana&quot; that spells <br/>\nrequire should be reassessed. The game is for fun. I am not having <br/>\nfun. I can only cast 3 or 4 spells before the &quot;mana&quot; runs out. Then, <br/>\nit takes a lifetime to regenerate &quot;mana&quot;. I could go fry up a pound <br/>\nof bacon before my &quot;mana&quot; regenerates (I did that last night).<br/>\n<br/>\nEither make &quot;mana&quot; regenerate faster, make spells use less &quot;mana&quot;, or <br/>\nlet us &quot;pay&quot; for Kodiaks Endless Intellect. Whatever you do, you&#39;ve <br/>\ngot to do something, I am reluctant to play anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nFourth, it appears that many NPC&#39;s have been enhanced in some way. <br/>\nMany things that used to &quot;con&quot; light blue or green now &quot;con&quot; dark <br/>\nblue. And in the past, I used to be able to kill these NPC&#39;s by <br/>\nmyself, even without Kodiaks Endless Intellect. Now, I die every <br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, overall, I believe that the game&#39;s features should remain <br/>\nstatic. One plans and strategizes based on the parameters of the <br/>\ngame. When the parameters continually change, as they have been, one <br/>\ncannot strategize and the game becomes a waste of time and money.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way I look at it, I am a customer that is now not getting what I<br/>\noriginally paid for. Please correct these problems. If you would <br/>\nlike a comprehensive list of other problems, I can compile it for <br/>\nyou. The ones that Im complaining about are the worst offenders.<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________<br/>\nsorry about the spelling in the previous post, not a good day for me<br/>\n^_^  hopefully this one is better, and yes i do spell like a man my <br/>\nmother tells me that too LOL <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@yahoogroups.com\">EQ_women@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dr. Mom&quot; &lt;drmom5@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; OK, but you spell like an man, so let me proofread it first.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Frankly, I don&#39;t WANT realism in my games.
