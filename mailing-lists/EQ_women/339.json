We were a bit delayed in<br/>\nstarting because one of the guests kept getting attacked by the guards.  After he<br/>\ndispatched 6 of them  in haste, they left him alone and the wedding continued.  Logos<br/>\ngave a WONDERFUL service (highly recommend him).  And many were there who remembered<br/>\nour first meeting and who had stood by me through Corellon&#39;s long illness.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe wedding night was also disturbed, this time by a Dark Elf whom we dispatched with<br/>\nextreme prejudice *grin*.  We are now honeymooning in Unrest, and I got to see the<br/>\ngreat Agathorn today, though the circumstances were less than ideal as he was called to<br/>\nmediate a dispute, it was truely wonderful as I had never seen him before.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if you&#39;re in Unrest on Quellious, say hi.<br/>\n<br/>\nDnaice<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Suzanne J.

Dnaice, I wanted so<br/>\n&gt; badly to be at your festivities, but there isn&#39;t a way possible.  I hope you will<br/>\n&gt; forgive me and appreciate the sentiment that I wanted to be there.  I hope your big<br/>\n&gt; day is as wondrous as a girl could wish for, and that you are surrounded by your<br/>\n&gt; friends and chosen family, and feel truly loved, respected, and cherished.  I wish<br/>\n&gt; you the best of adventures and most glorious of hunts, and I hope Corellon<br/>\n&gt; appreciates the treasure he is being gifted with--your love and companionship.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sara, Povar<br/>\n&gt; Ishtarre, Quellios<br/>\n&gt; Valdaya, Rallos Zek<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Judy Tyrer wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Judy Tyrer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:judy3t@...\">judy3t@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Dnaice, Trisango, Troxfo<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (RP doesn&#39;t escape any of the complexities of RL, does it &lt;well other than the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; toilet thing&gt;)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;              Free Games & Cash Prizes!<br/>\n&gt; Gamesville - The World&#39;s Biggest & Best Game Show Site!<br/>\n&gt;         <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/gamesville0</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
