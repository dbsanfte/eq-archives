Not just <br/>\ngetting to choose whether our clothing is revealing or not, but what we wear <br/>\njust in general.  I would enjoy being able to buy skirts for feminine characters <br/>\n<br/>\nand pants for more athletic ones.  Why must clothes be limited to starting <br/>\ngarments and armor?  Being able to choose clothing in general would also help <br/>\nmore characters look distinctive, rather than all the same.  With such a limited <br/>\n<br/>\nchoice of faces, anything that can help differentiate one character from another <br/>\n<br/>\nis a Good Thing, imho.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\naka Ilieriena Ashanti<br/>\nHouse Ashanti Council Seat, Domus Sangreal<br/>\nICQ #23767351<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:moontiger@...\">moontiger@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tygermoon@...\">tygermoon@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow that you are &#39;For Women&#39; by using free email from 4wmn.com!  www.4wmn.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
