I get this often too. I<br/>\n&gt; usually just tell them that my boyfriend plays the game and I already<br/>\n&gt; have a partner (even though he quit playing) because it&#39;s easier than<br/>\n&gt; dealing with all these personal questions from strangers.  My boyfriend<br/>\n&gt; tells me that it&#39;s because they think it&#39;s great to meet an actual woman<br/>\n&gt; gamer.
