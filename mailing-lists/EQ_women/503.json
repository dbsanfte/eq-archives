Was looking at my <br/>\nguild roster (I&#39;m still a dedicated, not full member yet) and there <br/>\nare only three listed.  All of us are wives or girlfriends of the men <br/>\nin the guild.  Hmmm... but it is fun though. Any Paladins on this <br/>\nlist?  I&#39;m always looking for Paladin advice.  What sort of weapons <br/>\nare best... and should I practice 2H blunt?  My Cleric bf says no... <br/>\nbut he also admits he&#39;s a cleric and never played a fighter class.<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nPiqa</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
