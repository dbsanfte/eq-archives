My Barb Shaman (Kalara on the Veeshan server)<br/>\n&gt;got her SoW spell at lvl 9 and ever since then I&#39;ve essentially been a SoW<br/>\n&gt;whore (lol might be a bit crude, but apt). The big difference now that i&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;lvl 21 is that no one pays me for the SoW. They just come up to me (and<br/>\n&gt;pretty soon you&#39;ll know what I mean...they&#39;ll come up, sort of stand there<br/>\n&gt;and before they can ask for the SoW I am already mid-spell to just get them<br/>\n&gt;to go away). They literally assume that it is for free, say thanks and walk<br/>\n&gt;away. Drives me nuts when they do it right after I&#39;ve just fought a mob, am<br/>\n&gt;at half-life, oom and my party is the same or worse. That&#39;s usually the only<br/>\n&gt;time that I&#39;ll turn them down.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>as a bard, our little thing to be begged for is corpse loc. thing is, unlike<br/>\njust standing there and casting, we have to 1) wait for the (usually)whiner<br/>\nto eventually get to us or run around while we try to find them. 2) have<br/>\nthem DEMAND that we protect them (never mind that everything is kos to them,<br/>\nand they&#39;re lev 5 in a 16 dungeon with not armor (or something like that. 3)<br/>\ngo hunting for their body (and finally figure out that there are two corpses<br/>\nin the zone (at least) and so you have to figure out which direction to<br/>\nactually go. 4) HAVE to sit there while they loot 5) escort them back to<br/>\nsafety (since we&#39;ve already bent over backwards, how dare we say no, now)<br/>\nand 6)get no thanks, no reimbursement for the time/effort/stress - even<br/>\nthough they said they would pay.<br/>\n<br/>\na load of crap. i was getting harassed for it a long time before i got the<br/>\nsong. when i ask people, i go - can i buy a sow/breeze off of you so i can<br/>\nrun to town/practise skills. i don&#39;t just demand it and i always pay. i try<br/>\nto give 1pp as that&#39;s usually more than i can afford. i try to give total<br/>\nand utter appreciation (and try to make them smile too) for anyone who helps<br/>\nme. just like i&#39;m perfectly willing to go cure a zone of disease *G* <br/>\n<br/>\nanyways...slight tangent *Grins* <br/>\n<br/>\ni was playing my cleric last night - just hit lev 15 *beams* that would be 5<br/>\nlevels in 3 days of my playing, 15 levels in 3 days of eq reckonning. i&#39;m<br/>\nNOT a powerleveler or even a super twink. by my figuring, all my gear i<br/>\nwould be able to buy myself by now. but just goes to show you the power of a<br/>\ndamn good group. i was so lucky - i got great groups 4 out of 5 times. and<br/>\nthe bad group just wouldn&#39;t share loot. <br/>\n<br/>\ni&#39;m just so happy i thought i would share it with you. *grins*<br/>\n<br/>\noh yeah - being a de, and loosing my lev b/c of this....how does one up your<br/>\nfaction with druids?<br/>\n<br/>\nanerak<br/>\n14/5 cleric<br/>\n<br/>\nlynnara starspinner<br/>\n24/5 bard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
