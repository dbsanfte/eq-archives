The game at the local Best Buy does not <br/>\ngive the monthly charge on it at all.<br/>\nI have never been in an online game before so this will be a first.<br/>\nPlease feel free to contact me at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Brangvyne@...\">Brangvyne@...</a> if you can answer any of <br/>\nthese questions.<br/>\nAnd don&#39;t worry, I wont clutter your list up with any other posts until I&#39;m <br/>\nofficially a member of the game.<br/>\n:o)<br/>\nBrangvyne</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
