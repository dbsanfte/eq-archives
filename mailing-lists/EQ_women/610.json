My boyfriend thinks I am <br/>\na half-crazed addict, and plans to stick to the odd blast of Quake <br/>\nand Unreal, but I rather imagine it to be nice to hunt together. That <br/>\nsaid, there are earlier threads on the board saying the opposite, as <br/>\nwell as supporting the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, can anyone tell me why my very first post appeared under my <br/>\nname, while subsequent ones appear under my e-mail address?<br/>\n<br/>\nLiz, aka Gyngermynx, ranger of the 23rd season, Quellious</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
