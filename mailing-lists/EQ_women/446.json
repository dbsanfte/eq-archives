We<br/>\nboth like roleplaying and gaming so it helps.  However, we too spent too<br/>\nmuch time on EQ and took a break for several months and became involved in<br/>\nother things.  We then went back to it later and had even more fun.  We also<br/>\nlimit ourselves if we get to involved in it.  I think that EQ is very<br/>\naddicting and it can ruin a relationship if someone is always on-line and<br/>\nthe other person has no interest in it at all. You have to balance your time<br/>\ntogether and sometimes it means spending time doing things you may not<br/>\nnormally do.  You might create a character to play with him on-line and in<br/>\nreturn he spends time doing a hobby you like, or just going to dinner,<br/>\nmovie, etc.  EQ is NOT the real world, and taking off from work to play is a<br/>\nbit scary... but I can see how it can happen.  I hope you can find a<br/>\nbalance, it is difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nKat<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Jennifer McNitt&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jenmcnitt@...\">jenmcnitt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_women@onelist.com\">EQ_women@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, February 23, 2000 11:39 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_women] balancing EQ with real life :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Jennifer McNitt &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jenmcnitt@...\">jenmcnitt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was just wondering how you all balance playing EQ with real life<br/>\n&gt; roles/duties.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not actually a EQ player myself, but my husband is.  Since he started<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; play EQ (over 6 months ago), we haven&#39;t done as much as we used to<br/>\ntogether.<br/>\n&gt; Before EQ he played Ultima Online but was able to log whenever he felt<br/>\nlike<br/>\n&gt; it in that game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With EQ it seems like he has to be on longer to get anywhere in the game<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; he isn&#39;t able to log whenever he wants to.  He is a level 50 ranger and is<br/>\n&gt; in the Plain of Fear a lot right now.  Due to the spawn rates he has to<br/>\nstay<br/>\n&gt; up late, and be online every day.  He even has taken off work periodically<br/>\n&gt; to be in the game more.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know a lot of the game just because it is mostly all of what we talk<br/>\nabout<br/>\n&gt; right now.  :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I understand online role playing as I ran my own computer BBS for over 5<br/>\n&gt; years.  I was an avid MUD/MUSH player myself for a while and did play<br/>\nUltima<br/>\n&gt; Online for a bit too.   My husband and I actually meet on my BBS when I<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; on college dated for about 3 years and have been married 3 1/2 years.  We<br/>\n&gt; are both avid computer game players.  Due to life/new hobbies/etc. I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; been in online games myself for the past 3 years.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I really don&#39;t mind him playing EQ as I know it is what he likes to do.<br/>\nWe<br/>\n&gt; have an understanding that I let him play EQ and I spend my free time<br/>\ndoing<br/>\n&gt; SCA (medieval re-inactment group) activities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For Christmas all he wanted was anything EQ related.  He also tells me if<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; want to spend more time with him, that I should get a EQ account myself<br/>\n(we<br/>\n&gt; have a home network which would make this possible). :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was just wondering how others balance their life with their significant<br/>\n&gt; others and EQ playing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jen<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get 100% FREE Internet Access powered by Excite<br/>\n&gt; Visit <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://freeworld.excite.com\">http://freeworld.excite.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; @Backup-The Easiest Way to Protect and Access your files.<br/>\n&gt; Automatic backups and off-site storage of your critical data.
