She&#39;s my main character. I also have a lvl 2 Shaman called Tilamily and I am starting a wood-elf druid named Ayenla.  I have enjoyed reading all the nice EQ women mails dropping down in my mailbox.\r<br/>\nSome comments:\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI have not been flirted with all that much *grin , maybe that&#39;s because I&#39;m not much of a RL flirt....However I am a Half-elf and I have been known to get some flirty comments about my looks. But nothing offensive, just kinda juvenile and what you could maybe label as &quot;cute&quot;. Well, I guess it&#39;s my own fault chosing a half-elf, they are among the worst looking female characters from that respect.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAbout the female characters&#39; looks, by the way. The way they dress, or should I say undress, the lady characters in this game almost put me off from playing it. Fortunately I decided to play anyway (I had to choose a half-elf too ha *grins) but I still wish we could be allowed to decide what we want to wear or not wear. I mean leggings that do cover ones but *grin and skirts would be nice once in a while. I mean obviously there are REAL girls playing this game so I think we should have some say in the matter. What do you girls/women/ladies say??\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs for significant others I was quite amazed to read that some that are married don&#39;t &quot;play&quot; that in EQ ....I guess I am a hopeless romantic *smiles...well whatever as long as you are all happy with your choices. I dont have one in EQ but I am awfully available *laughs . Hmm, well if I had a hubby to play EQ with I would sure wanna team up with him *smile.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs for making female friends on EQ I have to agree on the hardships to some extent. At least for starters it was kinda hard to get any social activity at all. Everyone was so occupied with lvling that they just didn&#39;t wanna chat, male or female. Everone told me it would get better later when you start grouping and that I should play solo for starters. Well, I don&#39;t mind playing solo but that doesn&#39;t stop you from talking with others does it? Online gaming is, to me at least, about being social, right? Otherwise I might just a well keep on playing my other RPGs. But maybe boys/men are more into the power lvl side and less social-but then what about the girls/women? But maybe alot of them are males as you say?  I have one friend who is male in RL and female in the game. He is married in RL too. *smile. Noone has ever asked me if I am a RL girl though... Well, it has improved somewhat and I am now very addicted to the game. I have some really nice female and male friends. But I am constantly on the lookout for friends and &quot;talkative&quot; people *smile. So if you feel lonely or talkative or whatever ...just /t me, okey.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSee ya around EQ!! Don&#39;t forget to /t me!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nNiph</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
