I figured Dvinn&#39;s dagger for our resident rogue was a cool<br/>\nreturn. =)  And it really made me feel good to share the wealth, as it<br/>\nwere.  Our rogue was thrilled, and I felt like I was finally contributing.<br/>\nI agree--that&#39;s not twinking; that&#39;s part of why we join guilds.<br/>\nSara, Povar<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather Hire wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Heather Hire &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hrootbeer@...\">hrootbeer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Most of the twinking I&#39;ve seen done is male characters switching from<br/>\n&gt; one to another.  I have seen female characters begging for things<br/>\n&gt; either free or for less than the going price...saw this yesterday and<br/>\n&gt; was VERY verbal to the young lady as she was not only a half-elf, but<br/>\n&gt; also a bard...Needless to say that Genneth got quite righteous!  (but<br/>\n&gt; totally in character)  As for myself, most of the things that I have<br/>\n&gt; been given came from guildmembers either passing along outdated items<br/>\n&gt; (which I have also done for newer guild members)or just being nice<br/>\n&gt; because a bard is always poor (I have a Qeynos guard shield that was<br/>\n&gt; such a gift).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t consider this gift giving twinking.  And if someone in my guild<br/>\n&gt; gave me a full set of armor, I would take it and when I earned enough<br/>\n&gt; to replace it with better, I would pass the gift along...I never sell<br/>\n&gt; gifts...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Genneth<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
