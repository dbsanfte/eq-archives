The idea seems wrong to me; the<br/>\n&gt; opposite seems much more likely.  The other thing that bothers me is the idea of<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; the Warders - why do a group of warrior women need men to protect them?  Kind of<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; implies that even tough warrior women need a big strong man to help them, you<br/>\n&gt; know?  Maybe we could come up with some other way men could belong?  Maybe the<br/>\n&gt; men could belong to a brother order, The Brothers of Mithaniel, with a close<br/>\n&gt; association with the Sisters of Erollisi?<br/>\n&gt; Other than those two quibbles, I think the idea in general is sound and I would<br/>\n&gt; enjoy belonging to this guild on a new server. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
