(Get up to 5 games of eq going at once in my house!) The problem is \n  that you cannot run the same account on more than 1 computer at a time, and \n  you have to reqister a differnet CD for every account. Example: When PoP came \n  out we had to buy 5 copies of the game because we have 5 accounts (me plus 4 \n  roomates), but we only used one of the CD&#39;s to install the expansion onto the \n  computers. When it came time to register our expnasions we opened the rest of \n  the boxes and each grabbed a cd so that we would each have our own \n  registration code.</p>\n  <p><br>\n  <hr SIZE=\"1\">\n  Do you Yahoo!?<br>New <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rd.yahoo.com/evt=1207/*http://sbc.yahoo.com/\">DSL Internet \n  Access</a> from SBC &amp; Yahoo! <br><tt>Your use of Yahoo!
