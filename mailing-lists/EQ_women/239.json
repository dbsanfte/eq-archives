Please let me know what<br/>\n&gt; days are good for you, if you&#39;re interested in<br/>\n&gt; attending.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On a side note, ladies, I&#39;m moving to MD tomorrow<br/>\n&gt; via cross-country truck *groans* so I will be<br/>\n&gt; out of contact for a WHOLE WEEK. *sniffles*But I<br/>\n&gt; hope to have lots to read when I get my computer<br/>\n&gt; set back up. (not so subtle hint) This is an<br/>\n&gt; interesting move for me because I&#39;ve quit my job and<br/>\n&gt; left my significant other at the same time, so bear<br/>\n&gt; with me and my &quot;growing pains&quot; as I move back<br/>\n&gt; in with my parents to go back to college full-time<br/>\n&gt; (me and my two kids).  Hope no one out there<br/>\n&gt; can relate, but I&#39;m sure some of you can.  Anyway,<br/>\n&gt; good luck in your hunts, your friends, and your<br/>\n&gt; fate, and I will see you all in about a week!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sara, Povar<br/>\n&gt; Valdaya, Rallos Zek<br/>\n&gt; Ishtarre, Quellios<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great<br/>\n&gt; ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
