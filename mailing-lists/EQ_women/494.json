We have a kind of Penn and Teller routine going,<br/>\nand have given our characters quirks (he thinks he can fly or at least safe fall,<br/>\nso he jumps off things alot, I always wince and announce to the zone, &#39;How many<br/>\ntimes do I have to tell you rangers DON&#39;T FLY&#39; which always gets chuckles), I get<br/>\nlost in dungeons and everyone indulges my slightly breathless and wide-eyed look<br/>\nat life.  We&#39;re very efficient as a &#39;combat force,&#39; but alot of times we lose<br/>\ntrack of fighting to trade oneliners. &lt;grin&gt;  We also toss insults at dark elves<br/>\n(we tell them it&#39;s in character only, most are really wonderful) and oh, the fun<br/>\nwe&#39;ve been having with lizards.  And lots of them have been having fun back.<br/>\nMostly we like to point out the difference between succulent, tender, city-bred<br/>\nhigh elves, and tough, stringy, hardworking wood elves.  One lizard even took<br/>\nnotes and confided that gnomes are wonderful hors d&#39;oeurves.<br/>\n<br/>\nAelwesara C├╗thalion, Ranger, Povar server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
