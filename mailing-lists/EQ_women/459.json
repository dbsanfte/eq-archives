He is trying to get all of his<br/>\nranger armour right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have beent thinking of getting an account lately, but wouldn&#39;t it be hard<br/>\nfor me to play with me since I would be a newbie character and he would be<br/>\nlevel 50?  I could see if he would create a second character to just play<br/>\nwith me maybe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso his 50 level ranger is a female.  It would be hard for us to be able to<br/>\nflirt unless it was a different character.  I think I&#39;ll need to talk to him<br/>\nabout this more.<br/>\n<br/>\nJen<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Okay, to be honest, I don&#39;t balance well at all.  It&#39;s a chronic<br/>\n&gt;  struggle and I consider EQ an addiction with a WHOLE LOT of<br/>\n&gt;  rationalization why I can play it.   If he is playing the raids on Fear<br/>\n&gt;  and Hate and the dragon raids then he really is committing himself for<br/>\n&gt;  the duration of the raid.  At the earlier levels one can log on and log<br/>\n&gt;  off pretty freely as there is less coordination with other people.  But<br/>\n&gt;  the raids require commitment.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  If he IS level 50, he doesn&#39;t really have to play every night.  He is at<br/>\n&gt;  the maximum level.  One suggestion would be to set aside one night a<br/>\n&gt;  week as &quot;date night&quot; where the two of you spend time together.  And,<br/>\n&gt;  yes, you might look into getting your own EQ account.  It really doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;  cost that much.  Not so you can spend more time playing with him as much<br/>\n&gt;  as so you can learn a bit more about the environment and community.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Or just hang out with him.  There is enough downtime in the game that I<br/>\n&gt;  often read a book while other watch TV while playing.  It is interrupted<br/>\n&gt;  conversation, but it is possible to have.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  At any rate, good luck.  I don&#39;t know that there is a solution,<br/>\n&gt;  honestly.  If I had a real life group like SCA I might enjoy that more.<br/>\n&gt;  I suspect it is a LOT healthier.  &lt;sigh&gt;  Oh well, good luck.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Iceiallana Forestfury<br/>\n&gt;  Brell<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet 100% FREE Internet Access powered by Excite<br/>\nVisit <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://freeworld.excite.com\">http://freeworld.excite.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
