When EQ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-249422024\">I&#39;ve never played PvP on EQ.  I have too many sad memories of having my character on Ultima Online killed by dweebs who were just doing it to be mean.  When EQ came out, I was very glad there was a non PvP option.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve head little snippets about PvP in the game that suggest that it isn&#39;t just a killing spree.  I&#39;d be interested in knowing from people who are actually there, how mature and how restrained is player killing in PvP? Do people go like jackles after anyone who is weak? Is it impossible to build up any decent equipment because people will try and kill you to take it?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou all may have heard that a Race Wars server is in development.  This will basicly be a PvP server with four teams:<br/>\n<br/>\nTeam 1:<br/>\n  Humans, Barbarians, Erudites<br/>\n<br/>\nTeam 2:<br/>\n  Dark Elves, Trolls, Ogres<br/>\n<br/>\nTeam 3:<br/>\n  Gnomes, Halflings, Dwarves<br/>\n<br/>\nTeam 4:<br/>\n  High Elves, Wood Elves, Half Elves<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone may PvP anyone who is not on their team.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis seems like an interestign approach to me, since it gives some structure to PvP, and allows you to identify people who will not PvP you.  I wish there fewer, larger, teams though 8)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve considered playing on this server when it comes out.  I suspect I&#39;ll play a cleric because I haven&#39;t played a cleric seriously yet, and a cleric seem to be very useful potentially in healing the group in a PvP situation.  Another possibility would be a Shaman (another class I haven&#39;t played).<br/>\n<br/>\nAny insight from you PvP girls out there would be appreciated 8)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Christina<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGet free personalized email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.iname.com\">http://www.iname.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
