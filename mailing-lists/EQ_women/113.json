This is my first post since joining the group. I am a 24 year old female from New Jersey who will be married in Oct.  I am a Everquest addict.  I was wondering how many here also play on Xeqony?  Also, I play a druid her name is Renaya, I just leveled to 12.  Does anyone here have helpful hints for where there is good hunting for druids?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Melly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
