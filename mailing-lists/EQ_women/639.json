The best way to stop that is to<br/>\nensure that people don&#39;t die or lose items because of bugs. The second is<br/>\nto design the entire game model so dying or losing an item is not so big a<br/>\ndeal. Unfortunately EQ makes it so losing an item, or dying, is a huge<br/>\npenalty so people demand customer service when this happens because of a<br/>\nbug.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople abuse guides and GMs all the time also it&#39;s really sad. I know my<br/>\nown guild on Tholuxe does this. They trick guides/GMs into ressing them,<br/>\nor porting them around, it&#39;s no good.<br/>\n<br/>\nMMRPGs are really young, hopefully we will see them evolve so guides are<br/>\nonly there to answer questions, and not to compensates for technical flaws<br/>\nin the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nChristina<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 12 Jan 2001, Rosalind Skinner wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Yeah it&#39;s going to be all about timing and improvement.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They need to get their CS dept in gear too.
