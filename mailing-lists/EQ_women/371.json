I find that I like the<br/>\nidea of love crossing all boundaries.  And a ranger/cleric combination is<br/>\npretty good; I am a pretty effective tank and it&#39;s really nice to have a<br/>\nhealer standing behind you. =) Maybe you will find that you can accept the<br/>\nidea of cross-racing too.<br/>\n<br/>\n Although two finger wigglers are very impressive, it&#39;s nice to have the<br/>\ntank ability for when either you&#39;re soloing or you want to take on something<br/>\nmore resistant to magic.  Lately, my ranger has paired with an enchanter,<br/>\nand I must say the combination is incredibly powerful.  The enchanter is<br/>\nplayed by the same person who plays my character&#39;s betrothed, so we know<br/>\neach others&#39; style of play already, but it was certainly an eye-opener to<br/>\nlearn to play with an effective, knowledgeable enchanter.  He hasn&#39;t let me<br/>\ndie yet, and we&#39;ve been taking out mostly yellows and some even monsters.<br/>\nHis ability to keep more than one monster from hitting me at a time<br/>\n(Mesmerize), combined with his long-term-damage (DoT) spells allow me to<br/>\nhack and slash and whittle the sucker down with relative ease.  Not to<br/>\nmention I ALWAYS go into combat with Strength and Haze. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething to consider.  I know you don&#39;t want to start another character.<br/>\nYou may wish to examine each class and decide what you can&#39;t live without,<br/>\nand work from there.  I restarted my character, Sara, with her full elven<br/>\nname, and her beloved ranger is waiting patiently for her to &#39;grow up.&#39;<br/>\nObviously, the enchanter is a much better partner for her until she comes<br/>\ninto her own (and we usually pick up a cleric or druid from our guild to<br/>\nstand by for healing, hehe).  So we have a case of one person being more<br/>\npowerful than the other, and the two unable to play together.  This will<br/>\npass, and my character will be stronger than ever, and our patience will be<br/>\nrewarded.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some thoughts. =)<br/>\nSara (Aelwesara), Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJudy Tyrer wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Judy Tyrer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:judy3t@...\">judy3t@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My partner and in game husband in four out of five of our character<br/>\n&gt; pairs and boyfriend in one (the only chance I get to flirt with other<br/>\n&gt; men *grin*) gets restless easily, as you can tell by the number of<br/>\n&gt; character pairs we have.  We have decided five is definitely enough and<br/>\n&gt; want to choose which ones to take to the next level (10 to 20).  It<br/>\n&gt; takes little time to bring them up to 9 and longer through the teens.<br/>\n&gt; But what we have noticed in the 20s is that it is a week or two per<br/>\n&gt; level and with the amount of time invested we want to pick the<br/>\n&gt; characters we like most to put that kind of time in.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
