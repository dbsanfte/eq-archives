I am","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-305718085\">Luna, I noticed you organize the calendars for the FG, Dragon, and Plane<br/>\nraids.  I have now hit my 40th season and am at the minimum level for<br/>\nthe FGs.  I am hoping within the next 3 weeks to be up to where I can<br/>\nstart doing more, but would dearly like to begin meeting and getting<br/>\ninvolved so that when eligible I can be considered.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat advice would you give for doing such.   From the outside it seems<br/>\nthe lists fill up quickly and it is necessary to either be in one of the<br/>\nbig guilds or be an under-represented class to get in (perhaps just fear<br/>\non my part).  While I have some friends who go, I&#39;d kind of like to get<br/>\nmyself in on my own (stubborn female pride, but I don&#39;t want to depend<br/>\non my man to take care of me nor do I want him to think I&#39;m only with<br/>\nhim because he can get me into raids).<br/>\n<br/>\nI found the board where the schedules are posted.  Do I just contact the<br/>\norganizers and let them know I want to go?  Best to do that in tells<br/>\nin-game?  Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, Mithril Empire has a strong group now of 8 soldiers in the 40th<br/>\nrank and above who  hunt together almost nightly.  Since I seem to be<br/>\nthe Guild&#39;s social director by default (not complaining, I think it&#39;s a<br/>\ntotal rush to pull a bunch of people together and organize a dungeon<br/>\nraid and clearly Druid is the prefect class for me as I can pick people<br/>\nup to make sure everyone arrives), how would I go about, say, putting<br/>\ntogether an ME based FG raid?  We would clearly need more players than<br/>\nwe.  And while Sylvanar has been, it would be nice to have other<br/>\nveterans as well to guide us and show us the ropes (broad hint there<br/>\n;-).  And I&#39;d like to include others who are just hitting the ranks as I<br/>\nsuspect my eagerness to try these areas is not unique.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to reply in private, my e-mail address is <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:judy3t@...\">judy3t@...</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sincerest thanks,<br/>\nIceiallana Forestfury<br/>\nDruid of the 40th circle<br/>\nMithril Empire</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
