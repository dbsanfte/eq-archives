Disa, my dwarven cleric, isn&#39;t really a flirt but<br/>\nshe does have somewhat of a weak spot for wood elves and especially gallant<br/>\nbehaviour. After being escorted by an ogre warrior across Antonica, she did<br/>\neven develop a sweet spot for him! Disa is otherwise more into the grind of<br/>\nbattle and the healing and casting business, though she enjoys the verbal<br/>\nsparring of flirting none the less if the opportunity presents itself.<br/>\nThe &quot; r u a girl in rl&quot; seems to happen less now than it used to... In beta<br/>\nwhen I was a half elf ranger, I had several comments on my bust size... Now<br/>\nmy bust is about the same, but my legs are shorter so maybe that&#39;s why I<br/>\ndon&#39;t hear the wolf whistles :)<br/>\nI haven&#39;t had any real problems with sexism, but I guess the /ignore has to<br/>\nbe good for something :)<br/>\n<br/>\nGood hunting to all sisters!<br/>\nDisa</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
