Once you reach the higher end of the game, you<br/>\nfind it sort of loses it&#39;s challenge.  For those that<br/>\nfeel this way, it has been a blessing and has<br/>\nheightened their game play.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThough some of the zones are harder and require a<br/>\nlarger force, or a higher level to enter, there are<br/>\nmany higher level folks that will be greatful for<br/>\nthat.  There are many lower level zones, but once you<br/>\nnear the top, you found yourself stuck in the planes<br/>\nor having to have a raid force for about everything. <br/>\nI never ran into a lack of places to go when lower<br/>\nlevel.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2cp<br/>\n<br/>\nSorgaine<br/>\nDruid of Vazaelle<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Yushi  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dayna_stormangel@...\">dayna_stormangel@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; DUe to the frequent changes sony/varent has induced<br/>\n&gt; into this game <br/>\n&gt; such as revamping some perfectly fine zones and make<br/>\n&gt; them harder than <br/>\n&gt; orginaly, and swiping c3 and even c2 from our<br/>\n&gt; collective grasp, my <br/>\n&gt; famley members who play this game will be writing<br/>\n&gt; sony and they will <br/>\n&gt; shortly and most likely <br/>\n&gt; be quiting this game, which in effect may lead to my<br/>\n&gt; defection as <br/>\n&gt; well due to the incressing dificulty of this so call<br/>\n&gt; &quot;class balancing&quot;<br/>\n&gt; now mind you this is total horse shit on sonys part,<br/>\n&gt; and they are <br/>\n&gt; taking all the fun and adventur out of this game by<br/>\n&gt; making every <br/>\n&gt; thing totaly impossible and un reachable, now i know<br/>\n&gt; not every one <br/>\n&gt; feels like this but not every one is a druid who<br/>\n&gt; with out c3 can <br/>\n&gt; cast no more that 3 spells with out haveing to sit<br/>\n&gt; for 20 minets and <br/>\n&gt; meddititing for example<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What im asking my fellow everquest players and there<br/>\n&gt; friends is for <br/>\n&gt; there suport in the effort we are trying to get sony<br/>\n&gt; to see, that <br/>\n&gt; they are systematicly desimating a game that once<br/>\n&gt; was fun and <br/>\n&gt; enjoyable.
