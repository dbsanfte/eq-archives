<div id="ygrps-yiv-1730140492">I died in a strange manner this noon in the mino caves of the Steamfont mountains, from Meldrath (or however it&#39;s spelled) and his guards...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m gonna try to get my corpse back tonight, and am willing to accept any advice or help one can provide.<br/>
<br/>
I think it should be around 6:30pm, PST, so if one of you is willing to drop by and help, you&#39;ll be welcome!<br/>
<br/>
Else some email advice would be great too.<br/>
