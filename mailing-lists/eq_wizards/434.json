Hold on there, Iggie didn&#39;t say YOU, he said that there are a<br/>\nlot<br/>\n&gt; of +pvp players that are jerks. There are also a ton of -pvp players that<br/>\n&gt; are jerks as well. I&#39;ll tell you about Elyas the loser Paladin on Solusek<br/>\nRo<br/>\n&gt; sometime. Enabling +pvp or -pvp is a choice you make, and because Verant<br/>\nhas<br/>\n&gt; decided to offer you this choice, it is also up to them to protect players<br/>\n&gt; that don&#39;t share a +pvp view. They&#39;ve given you &#39;free zones&#39; where<br/>\neven -pvp<br/>\n&gt; players are fair game, they&#39;ve given you an entire +pvp server. I don&#39;t<br/>\nsee<br/>\n&gt; what more they can offer? Are thee bugs, yes that&#39;s true, but I think that<br/>\n&gt; fixing global bugs that affect everyone will be more of a priority than<br/>\nbugs<br/>\n&gt; that affect a single class. So you have restrictions that I do not have as<br/>\n&gt; a -pvp wizard. It was your choice, so live with it. Learn to get around<br/>\nit,<br/>\n&gt; and I&#39;m sure that you&#39;ll have a much better experience for it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     You also have to remember that it&#39;s THEIR world  you&#39;re in, so you<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; to conform to them, they don&#39;t have to conform to you, even though a lot<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; player suggestions have been implemented. I&#39;m still waiting for a patch<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; will save the choice of how I view servers. Why would anyone want to view<br/>\nby<br/>\n&gt; number of players once you&#39;ve created and levelled your characters is a<br/>\n&gt; mystery to me. : )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Try and remember that there&#39;s nothing that they&#39;ve done is to be<br/>\n&gt; intentionally harmful to the -pvp class, but given a choice the majority<br/>\nhas<br/>\n&gt; to rule, and that majority is -pvp. Their priorities concerning +pvp will<br/>\n&gt; always come first. However, non combat spells you should be able to cast<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; others. Bind Affinity, O&#39;Keils radiation, Invisibility, great spells, and<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m behind you 110% in that you should be able to use them on others. I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; sure they&#39;ll change it in the future, but how long depends on how hard it<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; to code.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Zalbar<br/>\n&gt; 14th Wizard<br/>\n&gt; Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: John Cuyle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johncuyle@...\">johncuyle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: 22 avril, 1999 12:08<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eq_wizards] Re: Digest Number 18<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;John Cuyle&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johncuyle@...\">johncuyle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;There you have it, even players say &quot;screw you, +PvP people.
