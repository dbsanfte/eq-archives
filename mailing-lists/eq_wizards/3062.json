I still talk with some of those ppl from those days and i miss em.<br/>\nI thought that Everquest would take me back but oboy i was up for a big disappointment, i thought this game would be about adveturing and make friends. Doing quests, slay creatures of saga and alot of fun. But hell you have to play this game like quake to get something out of it if you arent an real RPlayer. I can admit that iï¿½m not that good at RP but i try sometime and i have also tried to powergame. my paladin who is now lv 17 i took him from lv 1 to 10 in under 20 hours playtime and the only twinking i did was to give him rawhide armor i got from orcs in butcherblock and 5 pp.<br/>\nBut that wasnt any fun either.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to make a long story short, couse i think not many ppl want me to write a book here. he hehehe<br/>\n<br/>\n         I WANT THE FUN BACK IN EQ, NOW<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that dosent mean that evry wizard at lv 10 should run around with Oracle robe etc. etc. but why isnt there more variety on items ? i mean like it is now when your around lv 20 to 30 and are in range of where some nice items can be obtained they are so rare drops, lore item, no drop and camped by much higher ppl.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSigning of for this time<br/>\n<br/>\n/Askur Wizard of Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\nPS. Does anyone know of a good guild on Veeshan ? i play on CET time and most of my in game friends live in USA so for me to play with them i have to stay up all night almost and it dosent agre with my work any more :-((<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SPRUSBRUCE@...\">SPRUSBRUCE@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, September 14, 1999 1:16 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: SV: [eq_wizards] Wizard critique<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SPRUSBRUCE@...\">SPRUSBRUCE@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Askur go find groupds in cazic people are always lokoing for blasters I could <br/>\n&gt; get you a nice de sk to hunt with all the time hes camped in cazic all the <br/>\n&gt; time hes propablys level 30 now but its nice you can always get more friends <br/>\n&gt; or treants are very nice      <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ??
