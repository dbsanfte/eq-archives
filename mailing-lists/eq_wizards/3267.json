I don&#39;t know what good Thunder Strike<br/>\nis, though. Is it just useless?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a must have when fighting blue and white casters(yellow and red<br/>\nresist too often for it to be effective). This spell, along with Force Shock<br/>\nand Tishan&#39;s Clash and Markar&#39;s Clash, are interrupters. Also, as you have<br/>\nprobably noticed, if any of the mentioned spells are not resisted they hit<br/>\nfor FULL damage every time. But back to the usefulness. When fighting<br/>\ncasters you can open up with Tishan&#39;s and get 30-50 damage(depending on<br/>\nlevel), interrupt any spell that they were casting and get a 4-6 second<br/>\nstun. This gives you just enough time to drop a quicker nuke, in your case<br/>\nyour 16th or 24th level one, then immediately start in with Thunder Strike<br/>\nand generally kill them(if your tanks have been working on them or another<br/>\ncaster has dropped a spell). Even if it doesn&#39;t kill them the Strike will<br/>\ninterrupt whatever they were casting(in the case of healers it would have<br/>\nbeen a heal spell at this point) and knock them back a good ways. If that<br/>\ngets them low enough on health most will turn and start running away, making<br/>\nit easy pickings for the tanks. These tactics have worked effectively for me<br/>\nall the way up to the king room in Sol B and the Fort in Lower Guk live<br/>\nside(my current camping spots). The combination has allowed my group to take<br/>\n4 casters at a time and not lose a single person.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, hope that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nYours,<br/>\n<br/>\n~Aereuss Ravins of Tarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - Is the interest in this mailing list going away? I haven&#39;t had many<br/>\nupdates in the past week or so and was wondering.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
