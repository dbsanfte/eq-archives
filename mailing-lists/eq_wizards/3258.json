There have been no banners or anything,  I<br/>\nuse Cazic Thule server and so far it&#39;s been pretty reliable.and crowded.  I<br/>\nam begining to think the problem may be either my modem or my ISP  I have a<br/>\nwinmodem and i understand from some recent articals that they aren&#39;t really<br/>\nvery good and use some of the cpu to process the data comming in ans<br/>\ntherefor slow my system down.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
