It is rare but<br/>\nnothing strange to see a warrior under 20 in full crafted or rubicite with<br/>\npowerfull weapon. Or druid with Pawn weapon and fear armour on 28! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;You know, sometimes root holds all the battle and let&#39;s you med and fire<br/>\n&gt;some more. Rarely, but sometimes. A warrior seeing this would go and<br/>\n&gt;complain about the overpowered wizards.
