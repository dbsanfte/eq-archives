Most of these new spells is to reinforce the ability <br/>\n&gt;for wizards to travel, so far it appears that Druids are just as good, or <br/>\n&gt;even better then wizards with Spirt of the Wolf for traveling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Summon - Teleports group member inside the zone to your location<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To be sure that this is not one exploit for running from combat he must be<br/>\nsitting and be in full health<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Phase - Teleports yourself to location of other group member inside zone<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>i like this one<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Greater Summon - Teleports group member to your location, even across zones<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to strong i think it gives a warriors fast transportation and annulate need<br/>\nof SOW <br/>\nYou gate and summon<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Greater Phase - Teleports yourself to a group members location, even across <br/>\n&gt;zones<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Group Gate - Slow casting spell which teleports group to your bind spot, <br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t leave anyone behind<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It is group teleport anywere as you as a wizard can bind an any place you<br/>\nwish so you can cast evacuate from dragon lair heal by others out of group<br/>\nand gate back in lair to finish wounded dragon only to mention one example<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Retreat - Evacuate version of group gate<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>same as above<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Haste - Increases movement rate for self only.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>this can be nice two attacks, faster movement but same time for casting<br/>\nspells self only spell.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to seeing other classes get some or all of these <br/>\n&gt;spells, such as magicians getting Summon, Clerics Phase, druids group gate, <br/>\n&gt;etc.  As a wizard, with my teleportation spells, I never bind myself in the <br/>\n&gt;city anymore, now generally only at a zone border, for quick pick up when I <br/>\n&gt;get a bit too active with my burns.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Phase and Summon would be just terribly useful, as quite often the puller <br/>\n&gt;sometimes grabs a bit more then he can chew, where the magician, wizard, <br/>\n&gt;whatever can pull his bacon out of the fire so to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the problem is that varant have fear thay will make advance in game too<br/>\nfast if you get too powerfull transportation spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Phase also would be quite useful, as the wizard, I generally get delegated <br/>\n&gt;to go on town runs (by the way, great way of making money, buy silver/copper <br/>\n&gt;for plat, various weapons.  Just gate back to the bank, or the nearest gate <br/>\n&gt;to your town and sell sell sell) and sometimes my group wandered off <br/>\n&gt;somewhere, or I don&#39;t want to run through nasties to get to my group.  So <br/>\n&gt;far I lost about half a level in Najena as I&#39;ve discovered Orges can see <br/>\n&gt;invis.
