When I was a<br/>\nranger I noticed this with invoke lightning as well.  You would cast and see<br/>\nthe monsters get hit for damage yet no animation.  Pretty sucky if you ask<br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far the coolest animation I think we have on any spell throught the 3rd<br/>\ncircle is the measly little 1st circle spell, numbing cold.  The ring of<br/>\nfrost around the opponents slowly rising up into the air is way cool.  Our<br/>\nrain spells look incredibly gay.  Shock of Lightning looks like a million<br/>\nother spells including shock of blades (magician) and all the cleric spells<br/>\n(strike, furor, smite).  I am big time in favor of seeing more unique<br/>\nanimations for spells.  Some might just call it eye candy and who cares, but<br/>\nI think it add a lot to the RP aspects.  Unique looks for spells is what<br/>\nmakes them what they are, and what gives the caster that mysterious and<br/>\npowerful air.<br/>\n<br/>\nComments?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Solric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Karl Hatteland&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:karlh@...\">karlh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we have to quest to cast Ice comet. I mean you can cast it once then<br/>\nyou have to do a quest to cast it once more. Its a rumor so correct me if<br/>\nanybody knows<br/>\n<br/>\nAvari</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
