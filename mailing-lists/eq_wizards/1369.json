You have chosen this life<br/>\nbecause you seek to be the knowledge keeper of this land.  You should seek<br/>\nto gain the knowledge of where items are and how to get them.  You are not a<br/>\nsolo machine.  You are meticulous, thinking.  Not a tank that jumps into<br/>\nbattle and gets his head bashed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeek a tank to stay close to you.  He/she is your armor.  The tank is what<br/>\nkeeps you back to from the blows.  let him take the blows and with YOUR<br/>\npower he will not take the massive damage.  Tell me what 12th level warrior<br/>\nis going to do 72 hps of damage at once or 30 hps to multiple targets.  NONE<br/>\nwill.   Yes we have no armor but that is because you are not suppose to be<br/>\nin there hand to hand.  That is not becoming of us to be hand to handing it<br/>\nwith some stupid Creature.  Let the tank get dirty.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are a wizard act as one.  You are the thinker of this world.  You are<br/>\nthe keeper of knowledge in this world.<br/>\n<br/>\nFadil<br/>\nSousek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
