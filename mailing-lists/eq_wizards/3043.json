Waiting for 18 hours for a pair of<br/>\njourneyman&#39;s boots was one of my worst experiences in the game.  Especially<br/>\nwhen  after 15 hours it was my turn and I went linkdead and missed it.  When<br/>\nI managed to get back on,  I was able to keep my place in line but I missed<br/>\nthe spawn and the number two person got them.  It took me four more<br/>\nagonizing hours before she finally had them again.  My only consulation was<br/>\nall the money I got for selling her ear rings later.  After that, I feel it<br/>\nwould be much better if the item was on the MOB evertime unless they drop<br/>\ndifferent things like Najena does.  In that case alternate each time.  Rove<br/>\nthen Book.  This would speed up te process and in my opinion make the game<br/>\nmore enjoyable for us all.  Shoot I was so bored I had everyone in the room<br/>\nfloating....</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
