I am talking about stuff around lvl 15<br/>\nor blow.   This method of teaming up with just wizards works great,  mobs arond<br/>\nthis lvl hit me for around 30 dmg a pop,  and with 210 hp, i can stand for a few<br/>\nshots. they also miss a lot too, so not to worry.  come on, with 3 wizards<br/>\nblasting, how long do you THINK the mob is gona live huh ??   it will be dead<br/>\nwithin the fist 4 shots.   Everyone use Shock of LIghtning in my groups and hit<br/>\nfor around 79 dmg each time.  thats 3 x 79 at the first shot, and 237 dmg done<br/>\nalready.  Most will not resist, if some resist, fine,  we can still combine hit<br/>\nfor around 100 dmg at least.  If root works, great, mob is gone in seconds, if<br/>\nroot don&#39;t work, mob will also die within 20 seconds.    Just kill it fast and<br/>\nwe won&#39;t need those dumb tanks.   Anyways, 2 or 3 wizzies together also make<br/>\ngreat KS team.  Both can stand at opposite sides of a derv camp and blast, those<br/>\nother ppl don&#39;t even know we are teamed haha.     anyways, just some ways for<br/>\nall u power gamers out there to gain lvl even faster.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRe:<br/>\nMessage: 8<br/>\n   Date: Tue, 15 Jun 1999 12:40:39 -0500<br/>\n   From: &quot;Tom Bratina&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gbratina@...\">gbratina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Wizard cast and wait method<br/>\n<br/>\nhaha. won&#39;t work to &quot;stand and melee&quot; at higher lvls (not many classes can<br/>\nactually do this without a healer).  believe me, when you&#39;ve got a total of<br/>\nroughly 450-500 hp and the monsters are hitting for anywhere from 50-70 in<br/>\nthe mid to high 20&#39;s and kicking/bashing for a descent amount of dmg (and<br/>\njust about all monsters stun on a regular basis), then you WILL NOT STAND<br/>\nAND MELEE.  And no, the mob will not leave you if he senses that he can kill<br/>\nyou (ie. once your health is down far enough, there&#39;s no getting him off of<br/>\nyou. period).<br/>\n<br/>\nyour best bet is just to stay back and make sure he doesn&#39;t come after you,<br/>\nor root the son-of-a-bitch.  if he does get a hold of you, you&#39;re gonna die<br/>\nreal quick if you don&#39;t do something about it (and no, that doesn&#39;t mean<br/>\nmelee).<br/>\n<br/>\nkeep on with your melee, as it is not suicide at lvl 13...  but make sure<br/>\nyou don&#39;t make a habit of it, as when you pass 20, and move into the mid<br/>\n20&#39;s and higher, you&#39;ll see the light, and realize why some of us don&#39;t even<br/>\ncarry a weapon anymore :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSinlaru Ce`alen<br/>\nRallos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
