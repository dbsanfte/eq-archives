Seeing as we are<br/>\none of the greatest classes out there we wizards should know each other.<br/>\nI propose a gathering of names of all the wizards we can find! I see all<br/>\nthese posts about sharing languages here, and trading items there, but<br/>\nmost of the time they are on different servers and what not.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many wizards on this list are from Xegony? Email me your character<br/>\nnames so I can put this list together and we will be able to share our<br/>\nknowledge, experience, and adventures together. I would be most<br/>\ninterested in getting a group of like-minded, like-leveled wizards<br/>\ntogether and seeing how we fare. Sharing languages and whipping mobs<br/>\ninto iobs, we can show those other classes that we are a force to be<br/>\nreckoned with!<br/>\n<br/>\nCroesus Illuminatus (Xegony)<br/>\nLevel 20 ( doesn&#39;t want to die )<br/>\n*You stab em, we slab em*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
