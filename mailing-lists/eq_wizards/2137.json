I made some very minor changes to the petition, and<br/>\n&gt; unless a lot of people have major problems with it, I think its time to<br/>\n&gt; start posting it around (maybe Wed, or Thursday).  Since nobody really<br/>\n&gt; wants to spend the time collecting names I Feel we should post the<br/>\n&gt; petition to EQ-Vault, Stratistics, alt.games.everquest, etc. and ask<br/>\n&gt; people that agree with the petition to send an in-game /feedback to<br/>\n&gt; express their support.  In addition, we can mail a copy to everquest<br/>\n&gt; with an e-mail address for feedback.  Does this sound okay with<br/>\n&gt; everybody?  Also, by using the in game feedback you can have the<br/>\n&gt; opportunity to add examples to the items, if you feel it necessary.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Malkin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---Start Post---<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dear EverQuest Staff,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We are a large group of wizards who have come together through a mailing<br/>\n&gt; list. Through much discussion and debate, we have agreed to send you<br/>\n&gt; this feedback concerning improvements to the wizard. We would like to<br/>\n&gt; thank you in advance for your careful consideration of these<br/>\n&gt; modifications.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1) Spells are 100% resisted by mobs 6+ levels above the caster. In large<br/>\n&gt; groups hunting big prey this level cap turns a wizard from the main<br/>\n&gt; dealer of damage to a useless member in the group. Our suggestion is<br/>\n&gt; that either the cap be raised to 6+ levels of the highest member in the<br/>\n&gt; group, or the cap be raised to 8+ levels higher than the caster.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2) Spells that both stun and damage targets are often resisted by mobs<br/>\n&gt; that /con green and blue. If this is the result of the stun effect, we<br/>\n&gt; would like one spell without this effect at the same level.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3) Many spell suggestions have crossed this list. Here is one that we<br/>\n&gt; all feel would be a great addition.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tap Affinity - Teleport targeted group member to their own bind spot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 4) O&#39;Kiels Radiation seems that it would be the beginning of a great<br/>\n&gt; line of spells. Why should it end there? Additional spells of this type<br/>\n&gt; would be a very welcome addition.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 5) Wizards seem to be very neglected when it comes to carrying or<br/>\n&gt; wearing items that enhance our appearance. In addition, many completely<br/>\n&gt; different spells have the same visual effects.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We would like to thank you again for your time. Any type of feedback<br/>\n&gt; would be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sincerely,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Wizards of Norrath<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you wish to join this petition, please send a /feedback to Verant and<br/>\n&gt; express your support.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s finally here!
