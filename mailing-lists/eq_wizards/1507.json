Get behind your target and<br/>\ncast bolt while it&#39;s walking away from you, start backing up until you can<br/>\ncast again, cast a shock spell, back up til you can cast again and hit with<br/>\nanother shock spell(or root if you feel it&#39;s necessary) I found that I could<br/>\ntake on yellow grizzlies in this manner and get 3 hits in before they got to<br/>\nme. If you want to play this dangerous(yellows that is) make sure you stay<br/>\nin the area of a guard.....<br/>\n<br/>\n(I by no means invented this but this is what got me over the level 10<br/>\nhump...)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCinius Shade(Mith Marr)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Another strategy that someone posted (should have been obvious but I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>didnt<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; think of it) uses the fact that your bolt spells dont actually hit until<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; bolt reaches them (using the distance tactic).  Cast your most powerful<br/>\n </span></blockquote>bolt<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; at maximum distance (I haven&#39;t done this but it should work) and while it<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; still on the way you can recover enough to root the enemy, then blast<br/>\n </span></blockquote>away.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I would change this tact for slightly easier enemies and instead of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>rooting,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; cast your best shock spell and then you might even be able to cast again<br/>\n&gt; before the monster gets to you.
