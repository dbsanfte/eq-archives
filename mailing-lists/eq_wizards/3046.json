I have a regular group where myself and a<br/>\nmagician in the<br/>\ngroup both turned 34th level.  We immediately scribed our new spells and began to<br/>\n<br/>\ntest them.  At 34th level, my direct damage shock spell does 306 (might have been<br/>\n<br/>\n307, but it was very close to this).  The magician&#39;s did 287.  Not much<br/>\ndifference, but<br/>\nthat is fine.  My second direct damage spell, which is research only and I have<br/>\nheard is bugged and does not work, I did not have.  The magician had a 34th level<br/>\n<br/>\nbolt spell which did 326 points of damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo basically at 34th level, a magician can do more direct damage than me (true it<br/>\nis<br/>\na bolt spell, but not a large issue) and has a pet that double attacks for over<br/>\n20 points<br/>\na hit.  Hmmm, really made me wonder.  I know at 39th level I will again surpass<br/>\nthe<br/>\nmagician damage, but still a little annoying.<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                            Soren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SPRUSBRUCE@...\">SPRUSBRUCE@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SPRUSBRUCE@...\">SPRUSBRUCE@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well I was going through somma my old mail I never read and a guy was asking<br/>\n&gt; about a magician and wizard...there not similar at all at level 50 my wizard<br/>\n&gt; friend does 1200...which Im sure you all know and the magician does 850 and a<br/>\n&gt; wave spell of 300 each and has 3 waves....Well I was wondering if the slime<br/>\n&gt; pet is real a level 43 mag said he researched it with his other charecter but<br/>\n&gt; I dont beilive him but thats supposed to be there ultimate spell....Does<br/>\n&gt; anyone know?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Enter ONElist&#39;s Friends & Family Program<br/>\n&gt; WIN $100 to Amazon.com!
