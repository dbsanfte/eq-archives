I was running with a monk that became pk (I ll use pk and nonpk because it s less confusing to me) and the cleric in the party","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1985177508\">That&#39;s another annoying problem. I was running with a monk that became<br/>\npk (I&#39;ll use pk and nonpk because it&#39;s less confusing to me) and the cleric<br/>\nin the party wouldn&#39;t help him at all. He even said, don&#39;t heal me, don&#39;t<br/>\nbuff me or you&#39;ll become pk. Very cool of him.<br/>\n<br/>\n    As to the looting issue, that&#39;s absurd. (In your favor) NO ONE should be<br/>\nable to loot your body unless they personally killed you. Another point for<br/>\nyou, and that&#39;s something that I think they need to address. I didn&#39;t know<br/>\nthat just anyone could pick stuff off your body. As a matter of fact, I&#39;d<br/>\nmake looting a pk body that you didn&#39;t kill turn you pk. That&#39;d be more<br/>\nreasonable I think. Believe me, no one&#39;s picking on you, maybe taking the<br/>\neasy way out, but not singling out pk players.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to coding the changes. It&#39;s more than likely that it&#39;s easier to make<br/>\nthem not be able to cast anything on you instead of being selective. As a<br/>\nmatter of fact I KNOW it&#39;d be easier that way. It&#39;s like having 1 switch to<br/>\nturn on all the lights in your house, or running around and turning some on<br/>\nand some off.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all though, I think that for the moment, it&#39;d be better to just enjoy<br/>\nthe game as is for the moment, and work towards what changes you&#39;d like.<br/>\nThere&#39;s a fdback button there, use it and have all the pk players you know<br/>\nuse it as well.

What are you talking about?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;     You also have to remember that it&#39;s THEIR world  you&#39;re in, so you<br/>\n&gt;have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to conform to them, they don&#39;t have to conform to you, even though a lot<br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; player suggestions have been implemented. I&#39;m still waiting for a patch<br/>\n&gt;that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; will save the choice of how I view servers. Why would anyone want to view<br/>\n&gt;by<br/>\n&gt;&gt; number of players once you&#39;ve created and levelled your characters is a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; mystery to me. : )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;No kidding.  That&#39;s kinda annoying.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;     Try and remember that there&#39;s nothing that they&#39;ve done is to be<br/>\n&gt;&gt; intentionally harmful to the -pvp class, but given a choice the majority<br/>\n&gt;has<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to rule, and that majority is -pvp. Their priorities concerning +pvp will<br/>\n&gt;&gt; always come first.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Um, you are wrong.  Their priority is -PvP.  This should be pretty obvious<br/>\n&gt;if you have played the game at all.  -PvP has no real problems (I play<br/>\n&gt;a -PvP ranger on the Rathe).  +PvP still has a couple HUGE, game balance<br/>\n&gt;destroying issues that would be pretty simple to fix.  From what I read<br/>\n&gt;about the testing on the test server, it looks like they may finally have<br/>\n&gt;addressed the issue as the looting for +PvP is supposed to have changed.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;give you a brief rundown of the current problem, you are a lvl 35 (insert<br/>\n&gt;any class here) player.

Bind Affinity, O&#39;Keils radiation, Invisibility, great spells, and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m behind you 110% in that you should be able to use them on others. I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;&gt; sure they&#39;ll change it in the future, but how long depends on how hard it<br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to code.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I wouldn&#39;t think it would be that hard as most players can already cast<br/>\n </span></blockquote>them<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;on others, just not +PvP for some reason.  +PvP spells would work exactly<br/>\n&gt;as -PvP spells on a -PvP person.  There is no difference whatsoever in how<br/>\n&gt;they should behave.  if a -PvP can cast it on a -PvP, a +PvP should be able<br/>\n&gt;to.  The code is all there, and all works, except they aren&#39;t using it.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;only sane explanation is they are punishing +PvP for something.  BTW, if<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;are +PvP you can forget about -PvP helping you ever.  They can&#39;t cast<br/>\n&gt;helpful spells on you without becoming +PvP themselves.
