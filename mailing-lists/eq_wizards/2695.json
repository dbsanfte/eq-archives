I am still<br/>\ninterested<br/>\n<br/>\nVerin<br/>\nLevel 13 Wizard <br/>\nKarana Server<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Barry Ward &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blw164@...\">blw164@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Barry Ward&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blw164@...\">blw164@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am currently in the process of creating a Wizard<br/>\n&gt; Guild on Karana.<br/>\n&gt; We have half of the members necessary to send in our<br/>\n&gt; info to Verant. We have<br/>\n&gt; many plans on the basis of this guild.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sick of having to deal with the KS&#39;ing reputation<br/>\n&gt; that Wizards have? We will<br/>\n&gt; help others who are having problems with ANY KS&#39;ers<br/>\n&gt; and promote Wizards&#39;<br/>\n&gt; abilities in a very positive manner.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sick of having less-than-ideal equipment because no<br/>\n&gt; one cares that you want<br/>\n&gt; to go to location X to get item Y? I have grouped<br/>\n&gt; with many Wizards at once,<br/>\n&gt; we get the items that we want that no one else cares<br/>\n&gt; about. We have<br/>\n&gt; developed very effective strategies that doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have any down time that you<br/>\n&gt; think a group of wizards would have. Also, I believe<br/>\n&gt; that there is anything<br/>\n&gt; wrong with GIVING fellow Wizards hand-me-downs<br/>\n&gt; (making sure that the item in<br/>\n&gt; question isn&#39;t too powerful for person in question).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We always GIVE extra runes or extra spells (which<br/>\n&gt; ever the person prefers)<br/>\n&gt; to those who need them.<br/>\n&gt; This is the only problem that Wizards have with<br/>\n&gt; joining this guild. Some<br/>\n&gt; feel that they are given more runes by being<br/>\n&gt; surrounded by those who don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; need them. I totally agree with them.<br/>\n&gt; I totally feel, however, that this disadvantage is<br/>\n&gt; far out-weighed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; These are just some of the main focuses of our<br/>\n&gt; guild.<br/>\n&gt; If you have any comments or suggestions or desire to<br/>\n&gt; join, PLEASE email me.<br/>\n&gt; I love to hear what people think about this guild.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, if you want to start a Wizard guild on a<br/>\n&gt; different server, email me<br/>\n&gt; and I will give you all kinds of info and help to<br/>\n&gt; get you started.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for reading,<br/>\n&gt; Telor<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What do lizards and rock music have in common?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; They both have communities at ONElist.
