I have been a lurker for a while & I have<br/>\n&gt; a question. First, I would like to get my hands on<br/>\n&gt; some rubies. Don&#39;t want to pay the 159pp that they<br/>\n&gt; sell for in High Keep. (I&#39;m still a poor Wizard.) I<br/>\n&gt; have heard that you can get one from the High Shaman<br/>\n&gt; in Splitpaw lair. Is this true? Next, on The<br/>\n&gt; EQlizer, I have read about a quest. It is involving<br/>\n&gt; Lyunga in Innothule swamp. (Only open to dark races)<br/>\n&gt; When you hail her she says something about needing a<br/>\n&gt; Ruby. When you give one to her you get 1 of three<br/>\n&gt; things. 1) Midnight mallot, 2) Bruthchopper, 3rd) A<br/>\n&gt; +6 int, +6 wis earing, with some charges of a necro<br/>\n&gt; spell on it!!!!!    What a prize!! Has anyone tried<br/>\n&gt; this and gotten any? Any other place to get rubies? <br/>\n&gt; As for me I thing I will be camping Splitpaw. Since<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m kinda high for it I&#39;ll see if I can make a deal<br/>\n&gt; with the campers. =) May Innorruk Guide Me!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kilrathos Dragonslayer<br/>\n&gt; 25th Dark Elf Wizard<br/>\n&gt; Xegony Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great<br/>\n&gt; ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
