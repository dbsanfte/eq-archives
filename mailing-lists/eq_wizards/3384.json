I saw that &quot;decoration&quot; and didn&#39;t even realize it might be a<br/>\n&gt;trap.  So I walked right into it.  And nothing happened at all.  In fact,<br/>\n&gt;until someone else mentioned the word trap in-game, I didn&#39;t even think <br/>\n&gt;that<br/>\n&gt;was what it might be.  The next time I was there, I stood under it, and<br/>\n&gt;still, no effect.  I never take damage from it.  Has anyone out there ever<br/>\n&gt;been damaged by it?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You know...that&#39;s what I was thinking.  I&#39;ve only been to Sol once...that <br/>\ntime I encountered the blade but nothing happened to me.  My buddies say it <br/>\nhasn&#39;t ever hurt anybody but they don&#39;t take chances and time it anyway just <br/>\nin case.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
