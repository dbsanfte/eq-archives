I decided on Guk to try to score<br/>\n&gt;some Netted, Woven and/or Mesh armor.

Netted<br/>\nstuff you can get off the frogoks, fisherman, and tads. What a tadpole is<br/>\ndoing with armor, I have NO clue.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;there who can give me some advice on what and where to hunt in Guk or<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you go into Guk stay to the first three rooms. do NOT venture past the<br/>\ncircular wooden bridge. You will only die, and it&#39;s a long and dangerous run<br/>\nfrom freeport to reclaim your corpse. My troll warrior is level 8 and<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t go past those areas. Also watch out for trains. If there&#39;s a troll<br/>\nin the tunnel you won&#39;t be able to get by. Sometimes jumping works,<br/>\nsometimes not. Hopefully it&#39;ll work for you !<br/>\n<br/>\nZalbar<br/>\n20th Wizard<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
