In UO, i had alot of magery, i liked there spells<br/>\nbetter than the Wizard in here cuz they could do all sorts of fun stuff,<br/>\nlike conjure 2 animals and make them fight(great fun with eles :P) and<br/>\nall kinds of stuff. But I like a wizard, and I for one think they are<br/>\njust fine. If you got a problem with a wizard, I think you should play<br/>\nanother class, not whine about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. the /feedback helps ALOT! I also want to say that everyone here<br/>\nshould spend some special time to talk to guides if you see em around.<br/>\nThey give up there EQ playing time to help others, and thats GREAT! I<br/>\npersonally talk to each of em for about 5 min or more every time I see<br/>\nem, I even get along pretty well and kinda know this guide on The Rathe<br/>\nserver :)<br/>\n-Malvos, my 2pp 3gp 1sp and 9cp!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
