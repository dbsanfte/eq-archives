From lvl 12 on is a<br/>\n&gt; good time to start.  As I mentioned in an earlier post, only myself and a<br/>\n&gt; cleric friend went there at lvl 12 and gained 4 lvls in 2 days.  Just stay<br/>\n&gt; in the courtyard and kill Death Beetles, Tormented Dead, Greater<br/>\nSkeletons,<br/>\n&gt; Jack o Laterns, and the occasional Ghoul, if your friend has any magical<br/>\n&gt; attacks.  Also, don&#39;t be afraid when you con the Death Beetles and they<br/>\nturn<br/>\n&gt; out to be blue, that you waited too long.  For some reason, the Death<br/>\n&gt; Beetles give out excellent xp and I was still gaining decent xp off of<br/>\nthem<br/>\n&gt; at lvl 16.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On another note, Unrest is a great place to revist once you hit 20th or<br/>\nso.<br/>\n&gt; The house has mobs anywhere from 18th lvl up to 36th lvl.  Again, great xp<br/>\n&gt; and awesome loot, they drop fine steel weapons, bloodstained armor, and<br/>\n&gt; bronze plate mail.  So for any of you that have reached the higher lvls<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; are looking for a place to hunt, Unrest is better than most ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Talarin, High Elven Wizard<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Ken Lee &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kenlee@...\">kenlee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, April 21, 1999 10:06 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eq_wizards] Soloing in Kaladim<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Ken Lee&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kenlee@...\">kenlee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Well, on someone&#39;s advice, forget whom it was, but I made the trip to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kaladim to plumb the depths of Unrest. I&#39;m 14th level and just coming<br/>\ninto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my power right now. Right now the rest of the people in my group are<br/>\n&gt; between<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3-5 levels below me. So I figure I&#39;ll just solo and get xps slower, but<br/>\n&gt; also<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not hinder their progress either. Where should I go? I&#39;ve gone to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; chessboard and killed pawns, bishops and their annoying pets, as well as<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; odd King that shows up. A dwarven friend of mine was telling me how his<br/>\n6<br/>\n&gt; &gt; member lvl 10 party was completely wiped out in Unrest down to the last<br/>\n&gt; man.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I made the following conclusions:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a. Unrest is nasty<br/>\n&gt; &gt; b. My dwarven friend&#39;s party is stupid for not running from something<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t win<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I can admire going out gloriously next to your comrade, but not when<br/>\ndeath<br/>\n&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t permanent.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, question, if I take my group into unrest what should I be looking to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kill? Is there somwhere else that is nearby that I should go instead? My<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dwarf friend said to hit the steamfonts, suggestions?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Zalbar<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 14th Wizard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; New hobbies?
