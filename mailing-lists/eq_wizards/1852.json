Thanks for the info.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Karim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kam@...\">kam@...</a>&gt; 05/26 2:35 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: Karim &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kam@...\">kam@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHello folks,glad i found this community, here is the rant i sent to eq<br/>\ngod GZ and his response (he responded today).<br/>\nAll Notes are are my thoughts only,they werent sent in my original<br/>\nemail.<br/>\n<br/>\nME:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;1/Radiation shield:<br/>\n&gt;Our radiation shield is the only combat related spell that we can cast<br/>\n&gt;on others,and yet it is worthless past newby initiation.<br/>\n&gt;I am lvl 34th now,i see other casters doing slightly less damage than<br/>\n&gt;myself with slightly lower damage/mana ratio (magiciants come to mind) ,<br/>\n&gt;when i was 24th it was the same with necros ect...even enchanters do<br/>\n&gt;have very decent damage/mana ratio<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(Note: i wasnt entirelly correct on this one,i realized that only after<br/>\nit was too late, but we do get cancel magic that is castable on others<br/>\nand is a combat related spell.)<br/>\n<br/>\nGZ:<br/>\n        Wizards should not actually get damage shields - this one was<br/>\nkept<br/>\nin because it was in our origional design doc, and people liked it. <br/>\nWizards<br/>\nto have the best damage ratios, the quickest spell casting times and the<br/>\nbest variety of damage of any class in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nME:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Since these classes can do a whole lot more than just damage, isnt it<br/>\n&gt;fitting for wizards to have a slight upgrade to our radiation shield? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(Note:GZ didnt answer me on that last one, my point was certain classes<br/>\ndo almost same damage as us (magiciant do almost same, think, its 7%<br/>\ndifference at my lvl) but they can do much more than dd,i was pressing<br/>\nfor anything extra &lt;grin&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nME:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2/Gates and evacuates:<br/>\n&gt;Is there any difference at all between the mass gate and the evacs?? the<br/>\n&gt;duration of the cast seem to be identical,is this a bug that will be<br/>\n&gt;fixed?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>GZ:        Evac is quicker to cast.  It also has a chance of leaving<br/>\npeople<br/>\nbehind (about a 1% chance).<br/>\n<br/>\nME:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Mass gates: Many wizards are very diasapointed with the locations of the<br/>\n&gt;gates,i know i am. Why have 2 gates in the karanas 2 min from each<br/>\n&gt;other?? why are all 3 other gates ro,neriak,and common so close to each<br/>\n&gt;other while a vast expense of land is unreachable?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote> GZ:       Teleportation cheapens the game - it makes it easy to get<br/>\naround<br/>\n(look at UO).  We wanted to keep our world big.  That is why so few<br/>\nclasses<br/>\nget teleportation.<br/>\n<br/>\n(note: Druid locations are far superior to ours and much better located,<br/>\nguess that is to compensate for the lack of the dimensional planes.also<br/>\nand i am not sure if this is true but i hear druid mass gates sometimes<br/>\ndrop party in a random loc)<br/>\n<br/>\nME:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Now understand we love mass gating, it is a lot of fun to have special<br/>\n&gt;abilities that not many others enjoy, but there are large portion of the<br/>\n&gt;norath world that far far from our gates,i wish our gates were more<br/>\n&gt;strategically placed. Also i surelly hope you will not forget to include<br/>\n&gt;a gate to all future continents.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote> GZ:       Future continents will have gates for sure.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nME:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;3/Eye of Zomm: this is the most fun in my inventory i get a kick out of<br/>\n&gt;using it everytime,but for the life of me i do not understand why it is<br/>\n&gt;of such short duration.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote> GZ:       It has a short duration to prevent players from mapping<br/>\ndungeons<br/>\nwith no risk.<br/>\n<br/>\n(note: i am wondering if he realizes it only last like 15 seconds)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nME:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;4/bind sight: another great fun spell, its only problem is imo way way<br/>\n&gt;too short range on pcs, i think it must be bugged that is the only<br/>\n&gt;explaination i can come up with. if i binded sight on a player and the<br/>\n&gt;player walks away just a short distance all i can see is a static<br/>\n&gt;display.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote> GZ:       Hmm - i will check that out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nME:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;5/Root: wile enchanter whirl seem to have been fixed in such a way as<br/>\n&gt;not to break while the mob is taking -bash-damage, i could also point<br/>\n&gt;out that root certainly seem to behave the way whirl used to prior to<br/>\n&gt;patch.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;From my own experience root seem to last a lot longer if the mob is not<br/>\n&gt;taking damage but would tend to break after nuking. If in fact this is<br/>\n&gt;true,then doesnt root also need to be fixed in the same way that whirl<br/>\n&gt;was? As far as i can see both spells have the same purpose more or less.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>GZ:        Root has a % chance of breaking when the creature takes<br/>\ndamage - the<br/>\nsame as we changed whirl to.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;6/Finally my rant would be that wizards arent set that far apart in<br/>\n&gt;damage dealing nor in damage/mana efficiency then any of the other<br/>\n&gt;casters save maybe shamans (i am only 34th though i havent seen yet what<br/>\n&gt;is to come). Yet these other classes can do magical damage and much much<br/>\n&gt;more. I must say at this point, only mass gating make me continue to<br/>\n&gt;want to be a wizard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>GZ:       Try another class for a bit and see the difference in the<br/>\namount of<br/>\ntime that it takes you to deal out similar damage.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                             Geoffrey C.<br/>\nZatkin                              <br/>\n                            Arch-Magi of Norrath<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(Note: well GZ seem to think that because we cast the nukes slightly<br/>\nfaster that puts us way ahead of the pack, well he is entitled to his<br/>\nopinion of course,mine is that the fact that i can cast spells 1 sec<br/>\nfaster than everyone else is totally worthless.The only advantage that i<br/>\ncan see is for soloing and i quit doing that long time ago. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe also seem to think that wizard having -almost- same damage/mana<br/>\nefficiency as magiciant is quiet ok as long as our damage is dealt<br/>\nslightly faster. This really bugs me. i see no purpose whatsoever in<br/>\nmyself doing a mob 1000 damage in 4 shots vs a magiciant doing it in<br/>\n5.With both of us having used the same mana spent. That is suppose to be<br/>\na big asset??<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, glad i took the whine of my chest, now at least i know he is<br/>\naware of some of our grivences.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n     Saltin of Solusek<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nONElist:  where the world talks!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> <br/>\nJoin a new list today.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
