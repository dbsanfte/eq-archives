We decided to explore.  THIS WAS A VERY BAD IDEA.  Some type of<br/>\n&gt; mind warp to over me and I ran right to Meridith (or whatever his name is)<br/>\n&gt; and 3 minotaur guards.  But I did not die.  I got stuck in a wall and could<br/>\n&gt; not run out or gate out.  I filed a petition and while I was waiting I tried<br/>\n&gt; to fill out a bug report.  But that crashed the game -- power off.  When I<br/>\n&gt; log back on I drop right in front of Meridith and the guards (BAM, BAM,<br/>\n&gt; DEAD).  Probably would have had better luck from a guard.  Anyway after 3<br/>\n&gt; more deaths and some help from an enchanter&#39;s invisibility, my friend and I<br/>\n&gt; got our stuff back -- the other members of the party ran.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Question 1:<br/>\n&gt; Has anybody killed this guy and what level were you, etc. etc.?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Question 2:<br/>\n&gt; Is magic resistance used to resist the mind warp?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Question 3:<br/>\n&gt; When I was still 12th level I cast Bind on myself and my friend.  I got a<br/>\n&gt; message that I feel bound to the area (or something like that).  My friend<br/>\n&gt; did not.  I cast it on him 4 times and he did not get that message.  I tried<br/>\n&gt; to cast it by the gnome city if that matters.  The only message that I got<br/>\n&gt; was that I had started to cast a spell.  When we died, I appeared near the<br/>\n&gt; gnome city and he had a much longer walk.  It appears that the bind did not<br/>\n&gt; work for him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another Story:<br/>\n&gt; I have mostly been fighting in Crushbone, so my standing with the orcs<br/>\n&gt; really sucks.  Sometimes a legionaire or slaver will attack me without me<br/>\n&gt; attacking them and the &quot;tanks&quot; have been totally unable to pull them off<br/>\n&gt; while I am standing and trying to move away.  I don&#39;t think that the &quot;tanks&quot;<br/>\n&gt; are at the top of the orcs most wanted list like I am.  If it matters, I<br/>\n&gt; helped kill Crush with a large party.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Question 4:<br/>\n&gt; Has anybody else experienced this?  Any ideas?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ****Spoiler****<br/>\n&gt; I have figured out what to do with some of the shackle keys that you get off<br/>\n&gt; of the slavers in CrushBone.  Each number corresponds to a specific race/sex<br/>\n&gt; combination.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here are the combinations that I know:<br/>\n&gt; Male Dwarf 16<br/>\n&gt; Female Dwarf 17<br/>\n&gt; Male Wood Elf 18<br/>\n&gt; Female Wood Elf 19<br/>\n&gt; Male High Elf 20<br/>\n&gt; Female High Elf 21<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Question 5:<br/>\n&gt; What do the other keys do?  So far I know that I have also gotten shackle<br/>\n&gt; keys #15, 23 and 24.  I have not seen any halflings or gnomes, but have<br/>\n&gt; heard reports of them.  If you know who to give these keys to or where the<br/>\n&gt; other slaves might be (I have not gone in the castle), please reply to the<br/>\n&gt; group with the answer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Laugh<br/>\n&gt; Has anybody noticed that it is empOREr cruch and not empEROr crush.  The<br/>\n&gt; stupid orcs hail empOREr crush to.  I turned that in as a bug.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
