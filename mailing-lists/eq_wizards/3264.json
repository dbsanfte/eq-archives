Has anyone done it yet?  I think it&#39;s really no big deal so <br/>\nI&#39;m not sweating it yet, but it would be a nice accomplishment to do it <br/>\nanyway.  I think I&#39;m going to pass up the extra AC and just try for that <br/>\nMolten Cloak instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, 29th level is one heck of a fun set of spells.  I&#39;m not using <br/>\nthe DD yet as they tend to fizzle still, but we can cast those frost shock <br/>\nspells with impunity it seems.  And until it gets old, thse group teleports <br/>\nare fun to play with.  They make it easy to get some quick cash or some free <br/>\nbuffs.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, enough rambling.  Just trying to create some conversation again. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
