You can&#39;t have your way without affecting me, and I<br/>\ncan&#39;t have mine without affecting you.  Let&#39;s consider your argument:<br/>\n<br/>\nYou speak of role playing mad ogres and anti social elves?  Can we play<br/>\nthem?  Certainly.  Should they be tolerated by their own races?  There is<br/>\nnothing even remotely realistic about butchering your own people, regardless<br/>\nof alignment, and getting away with it.  So do it and be KOS in your own<br/>\ncity.  That&#39;s role-playing.  Anything else is mindless nonsense.  Being evil<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean being stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a related subject, people have also argued that duels shouldn&#39;t result in<br/>\nfaction hits.  Stop and think for a moment how many societies you can name<br/>\nthat smiled on dueling.  In western culture, it has generally been an<br/>\nillegal (but sometimes tolerated) practice limited to aristocracy.  You<br/>\noften risked execution if caught.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would agree with you on is that the faction system is far too<br/>\nsimplistic.  Dueling ought to raise your faction with the enemies of your<br/>\nantagonist, and with certain others within your own group who favor that<br/>\nsort of behavior.  General militia ought to hate duels, and elite guards (in<br/>\nsome societies) ought to favor it.  But, personally, I think that faction<br/>\nideally should be an order of magnitude more complex than even this.  Did<br/>\nyou power game to level 15 attacking low blues?  Then perhaps you&#39;ve earned<br/>\nthe respect of conservative factions, but those who consider themselves true<br/>\nwarriors ought to scoff at you.  Did you always throw yourself into battle,<br/>\ntaking massive damage, on your march up through the levels?  Then maybe you<br/>\nare adored by the plebes and chum with the guards, but the rest of the world<br/>\nconsiders you an idiot.  And, of course, in duels, the assailant ought to<br/>\nincur the brunt of the faction adjustment.  And, also, if no one sees it and<br/>\nno rumor gets out, it didn&#39;t happen, etc.  Very tricky thing to implement<br/>\ncorrectly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ideal is ultimately very simple.  NPC&#39;s should treat you--based on your<br/>\nbehavior--just like a PC would of similar station.  Here&#39;s an example for<br/>\nyou to chew on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day in S. Karanas, a PvP player assisted in an attack on Grimrot.<br/>\nAt the end of the fight when everyone was healing, another PvP player came<br/>\nin and attacked, without warning, eventually killing the PvP player.  Many<br/>\nnon-PvP players were upset because they couldn&#39;t do anything to help and<br/>\nsimply had to watch their comrade die.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou think the PvP assailant lost &quot;faction&quot; with the PCs?  You bet.  Should<br/>\nhe therefore have lost it with certain NPCs?  Of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are problems with faction right now.  And of course that&#39;s why Verant<br/>\nannounced that they had eliminated faction hits on PvP kills as of yesterday<br/>\nand are working on a more elaborate system, including (possibly) an<br/>\naggressor flag.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing you need to keep in mind is that many of us non-PvP players would<br/>\nlove to play PvP if the system were set up with realistic consequences.<br/>\nWhy?  Because we like to role play and the non-PvP system makes it very<br/>\ndifficult to do so under certain situations.  Persistent kill stealing, for<br/>\ninstance, and severe twinking of characters (you know, the 4th lvl wizard<br/>\nwith observer&#39;s staff and oracle&#39;s robes?) are not things that could persist<br/>\nin a realistic gaming environment.  But to argue for a system of no faction<br/>\nhit on PvP kill just encourages the mindless butchering of PCs in the so<br/>\ncalled name of &quot;role-playing.&quot;  And it is something I will argue against<br/>\nanytime someone advocates it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlyphin E&#39;Mondredon<br/>\nThe Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
