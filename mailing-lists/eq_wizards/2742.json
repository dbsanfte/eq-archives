How many of you out there have played<br/>\nAD&D?  They have a rather decent random loot method that I think would<br/>\nbe *fine* for EQ.  I too am dissapointed that there tends to be only one<br/>\nBEST set of equipment for us, and therefore, those poor mobs are always<br/>\ncamped to death.  I would like to see a simple random loot factor.  I<br/>\nkill a goblin wizard, there is a 50% chance he has a robe.  It would be<br/>\na robe appropriate to a wizard as well.  Then create a second random<br/>\nchart that says it has 0,1, or 2 effects.  (Maybe on higher level mobs,<br/>\nthat would be 2-4, etc..).  The effect could be +(1 to 3) int, or<br/>\n+(5-10) hp, or something appropriate.  Nothing signifincantly better<br/>\nthan quest items you can already get, but just SOMETHING different!  Can<br/>\nyou seriously think of seeing a wizard over level 30 that is happy with<br/>\na robe that isnt a FRB or Robe of the Oracle?  No, unless he killed the<br/>\nreclusive ghoul magi, and got one that *looks* like a newbie robe, but<br/>\ngives him +3 int, stamina and str!  Yes, of course, it would need<br/>\nbalancing, but I think it would be a lot more interesting and give us<br/>\nsome MUCH sought after variety.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a thought in my bleery eyed, sleepless state.<br/>\n<br/>\nMicon <br/>\nKarana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
