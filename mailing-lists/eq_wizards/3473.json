The big boys resist cold spells much more than they do<br/>\n&gt;fire spells.  I am lvl 35 and most of them are yellow to me.  Just a lil<br/>\n&gt;food for thought.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, I spent some time killing those suckers too.  Good fun!  Not so sure <br/>\nout the resistance though, I&#39;ve been sticking to my lvl 24 ice (frost?) <br/>\nspell for the past 10 levels as my initial strikes.  I&#39;ve had no problems <br/>\ngetting them to hit despite the giants being red to me when I was 32-33.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve felt the shock spells have been fairly reliable so far.  I&#39;ve heard <br/>\nweather patterns affect our spells too but I haven&#39;t devoted the time to <br/>\nconfirm that. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t those giants and cyclops make the coolest sounds when dying? :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
