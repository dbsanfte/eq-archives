I too have a lot of friends that I used to party <br/>\nwith.  They eventually left me behind in levels as typical of my <br/>\nWizardry...but every now and again, they DO help me find items that might <br/>\nhelp my cause. (ie. Savant&#39;s cap).  I find no problem with this.  Yes, it <br/>\nbenefits me of course!  :)  But on the other hand, this is not so much <br/>\ndifferent from real life where you need the help of friends to get ahead.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s all part of being social and working with the people you meet online.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut other posts here have convinced me that &quot;twinking&quot; is not all that good <br/>\neither.  If a 1st Lvl Wizard uses his Observer Robes and RTS to an unfair <br/>\nadvantage over other 1st level users by stealing kills and such, I CAN see <br/>\nhow this will ruin the experience for others.  Should this be banned?  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think this can or should be policed.  I&#39;d rather have the Verant team <br/>\nworking on other things to improve the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing we can do is to foster an environment that discourages <br/>\nplaying in this fashion.  Ban these players from getting <br/>\nbuffs/binds/guilds/etc. ?   If I&#39;m in a situation like this where I don&#39;t <br/>\nget help from anybody...I&#39;ll give it up pretty fast!  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Message: 6<br/>\n </span></blockquote>   Date: Mon, 24 May 1999 11:28:18 -0400<br/>\n   From: &quot;Mata&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mata_eq@...\">mata_eq@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Subject: Re: Twinking = Diablo = UO<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Well who is really to say what is considered twinking . . .  I think we<br/>\n&gt;should just play the game and let people do whatever.    I would rather<br/>\n&gt;discuss spells and stuff in this list than people getting mad cus JOE <br/>\n&gt;FRIDAY<br/>\n&gt;has full plate or whatever.  I don&#39;t really like twinking but it happens <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;to BAN it seems weird kinda strict.   There are too many scenerios.  I mean<br/>\n </span></blockquote>there is this friend of mine in real life and he plays more than I do and is<br/>\nhigher lvl and he gave me a cool Savant Cap and I like it.  So should I be<br/>\nbanned?   Dunno, but I&#39;d rather talk about cool &quot;in-game&quot; stuff . . .<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
