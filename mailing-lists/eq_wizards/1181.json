I carefully checked the locations, and the wizard spells<br/>\nare almost all sold at the top of the building. If I remember right, it&#39;s<br/>\nthree stairs up from the entrance.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I remember, I would get the spells at about 4pp and 2gp, which is why<br/>\nI preferred to make my shopping in Felwithe, where they sold to me for 3pp<br/>\nand 9gp. And Felwithe has a nice selection of spells, including all the<br/>\nhigh level (up to 49 level) teleports, gates and portals.  Takes about an<br/>\nhour to go there, however, depending on where the ship is when you want to<br/>\ntake it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I had the need to see Faydark again at the time.
