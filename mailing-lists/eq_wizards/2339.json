Thus at those levels you can do an initial blast<br/>\nthen wait. At 16th level our damage is enough to draw any mob right on<br/>\nus when we blast. Thus, after 16th it is best to wait until the tanks do<br/>\nsome damage first.<br/>\n<br/>\nCroesus Illuminatus (Xegony)<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil Lambert wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Neil Lambert&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smartass@...\">smartass@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 5 seconds isn&#39;t enough... wait until your tanks do almost as much if not<br/>\n&gt; more dmg as the spell you just cast... then cast again.. i can usually cast,<br/>\n&gt; meditate half the mana just used, then cast again and i&#39;m still very useful<br/>\n&gt; to my party and i&#39;m 17th level<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jay Hollums &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhollums@...\">jhollums@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Saturday, June 12, 1999 7:05 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eq_wizards] General new observations from a level 13 wiz<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Jay Hollums&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhollums@...\">jhollums@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; You won&#39;t see any major difference in dmg until lvl 29+... then we begin<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; shine.  And another thing, you DO NOT use your most power spell as soon<br/>\n&gt; as<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you reach that lvl for it.  Sit back and throw your previous most<br/>\n&gt; powerful<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; spell at the baddies and they won&#39;t come at you.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I am not using my most powerful spell as soon as I got It I&#39;m level 13<br/>\n&gt; &gt;now...  next?  Oh and I know all the tricks to wait and such... but you<br/>\n&gt; also<br/>\n&gt; &gt;want to help as much as you can... I have found there is a find line...<br/>\n&gt; cast<br/>\n&gt; &gt;once to start off... then again after about 3 seconds... then wait for<br/>\n&gt; about<br/>\n&gt; &gt;5 seconds... if the battle is still a long way from finishing usually my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;tanks are not doing so well so I have to go heavy and dump into the mob, if<br/>\n&gt; &gt;they are doing well I watch to try to finish...  I also know about rooting<br/>\n&gt; &gt;if the Mob runs...  believe me I know most of the tricks... chuckle.  So<br/>\n&gt; &gt;even though our only benefit is that we are damage doers we have to wait<br/>\n&gt; &gt;till 29th?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Rutreeii<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Cazic-Thul<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Looking for your kindred spirit?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Go to ONElist: where kindred spirits connect and stay connected.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking for a new hobby?
