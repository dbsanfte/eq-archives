In fact, I tend to get exp <br/>\nfaster that way, it seems.  I do believe that grouping is better for <br/>\nenjoying the game, but when you can&#39;t find a competent group, soloing is <br/>\nviable for the long haul.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now I solo caiman in Oasis.  I still sit near the zone border, but I <br/>\nhave killed 20 or so and never lost.  Did have to pull out the snake fang <br/>\nonce, but I still got him.<br/>\n<br/>\nGroups are better, but with a little practice you should have no fear of <br/>\nsoloing.  Just make sure you test the creature out near a guard or zone <br/>\nbefore you jump in.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;According to Ken Morris:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; For the record, I don&#39;t believe wizards should solo past 5th lvl.  Your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; chances of dying increase dramatically when soloing.  Having said that, <br/>\n&gt;we<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you know what you take in. For example, I&#39;m now soloing (at 9th) Desert<br/>\n&gt;Tarantula, because, by experience, these critters don&#39;t hit me enough. The<br/>\n&gt;only time it is borderline is when I get three fizzle in the fight. *Then*<br/>\n&gt;I start to sweat. At 10th, I know I&#39;ll get into Sand Scarabs, because these<br/>\n&gt;guys are almost doable on my own right now (if I don&#39;t get a fizzle at <br/>\n&gt;all).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;When soloing, the trick is to know which target to hunt. Pumas are <br/>\n&gt;significantly<br/>\n&gt;weaker than Tarantulas, but they tend to hit more often (without Poison), <br/>\n&gt;so<br/>\n&gt;I usually end up with less HP remaining after a fight with a Puma.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; strategize carefully and leave yourself a way to escape if things go <br/>\n&gt;bad,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; there&#39;s no lvl that you can&#39;t solo.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Agreed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;Vincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Tel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n&gt;         01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Did you know ONElist has over 300 Star Wars lists?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Join one today!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
