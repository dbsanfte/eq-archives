I found that until lvl 8 the wizard is<br/>\nvery weak, and once he hits 12 he becomes incredible powerful.  At lvl 14, I<br/>\nwould chose my magic over weak mage or necro magic any day.  As you get<br/>\nhigher in lvls getting money becomes much easier.  I&#39;m still almost always<br/>\nbroke, while my warrior friends run around with 50 pp on them, but I never<br/>\nhave problems making enough to buy the spells (hence why I am always broke).<br/>\nIf you&#39;re below the lvls I mentioned then I would suggest just hanging in<br/>\nthere until you reach them, you will be amazed by the leap in power the<br/>\nwizard takes.<br/>\n<br/>\nTandeyan, Dark Elf Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Gregory Egan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gemd@...\">gemd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Sunday, April 18, 1999 1:52 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Our class<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Gregory Egan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gemd@...\">gemd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just wondering how other people feel about our Wizard class. It seems to me<br/>\n&gt;that we are short-changed compared to magicians and necromancers, whose<br/>\n&gt;spells seem a lot better, and can have &quot;pets&quot; fight for them. It&#39;s also<br/>\n&gt;hard to make signifant amounts of money to buy spells.
