Fade pretty much is just to practice the skill<br/>\nwith, but shadowstep and gate has saved my life more times than I remember.<br/>\nAnd Yonder is even better!  It casts Ultra fast, and you end up with a great<br/>\ndeal of time to cast gate and get out of there.  Only very rarely has Yonder<br/>\nnot moved me far enough to cast gate.  Usually I have enough time to cast<br/>\ntwo gates before the mob even finds me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Jay Hollums &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnh@...\">johnh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, September 27, 1999 6:37 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Guide to Wizardry<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jay Hollums&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnh@...\">johnh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ROOT is the most important spell you can use in a dungeon or in solo... it<br/>\n&gt; is the only thing that makes you a true force to be faced!  Here is the<br/>\n&gt; accepted method for group / solo for me:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Group:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; let some one pull it... let the tank beat on it for about a count of 15<br/>\n&gt; (slow 15... if you get excited count to 30) and unleash with 2 of your<br/>\nbest<br/>\n&gt; DD spells... If one is resisted then you can try a third... but beware...<br/>\n&gt; Count another 10 and let loose with another spell...<br/>\n&gt; When the creature gets to about 25-40 percent of its life, ROOT it... then<br/>\n&gt; nuke as hard as you can.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Solo:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; BOLT SPELL BOLT SPELL BOLT SPELL!<br/>\n&gt; okay here is the sequence...:<br/>\n&gt; cast your most powerful bolt spell at long range.  As the bolt flies out<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; are already in spell reset stage... when the bolt hits you are ready to<br/>\n&gt; ROOT... heck half the time I have to keep hitting the ROOT hot key just<br/>\ntill<br/>\n&gt; the monster gets in range!  You will start casting as soon as it gets in<br/>\n&gt; range and get the spell off well before it gets to you.  Now to the<br/>\n&gt; important part... BACK OFF!  backup  till the monster looks about the same<br/>\n&gt; size on the screen as it did when you first cast the first bolt... then<br/>\n&gt; recast the bolt..  if the monster breaks after a hit just start recasting<br/>\n&gt; the root (it is still out of range like the first time right?) fast till<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; goes off... back up and repeat...  If the creature ever gets into melee<br/>\n&gt; range just take a deep breath wait till you see his attack attempt and hit<br/>\n&gt; that ROOT!  You should get it off before he can attack you.  (this does<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; mean that he wont get another attack on you)  Then back up till just in<br/>\nbolt<br/>\n&gt; range and repeat!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the off chance your group is pulling too red a creature for you... mem<br/>\n&gt; your fire shield and hold off attacking that thing till it has less than<br/>\n25%<br/>\n&gt; hps... you have a little better chance at hitting it... plus cast a spell<br/>\n&gt; that is one circle back from what your capable of at the time any way<br/>\n most<br/>\n&gt; likely a deep red will resist at least partially if not all the time even<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; 25% hps so you might as well do less (max damage) so it doesn&#39;t pull on<br/>\n&gt; you...  Oh yea ... bind in the zone near the zone point... and make sure<br/>\n&gt; gate is a mem&#39;d spell... if your going to be useless make sure you atleast<br/>\n&gt; wont die with the rest of the silly&#39;s.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Rutreeii&#39;s condensed guide to wizardry!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: PHAEDRA WHITLOCK &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PWHITLOCK@...\">PWHITLOCK@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, September 27, 1999 9:08 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eq_wizards] Spells<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;PHAEDRA WHITLOCK&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PWHITLOCK@...\">PWHITLOCK@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have few spells, maybe 4/level, and cant wait till we can rearrange<br/>\nour<br/>\n&gt; spellbooks.

My friend who is a lvl 5 enchanter almost has<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more spells then I do.  They gave us so many useless spells.  Like the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; low lvl Sphere of light.
