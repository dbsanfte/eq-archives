Thats how.  If you die..  and you consent someone else to retrieve your belongings.. they can take your robe.  Then, they cant give it back to you.   <br/>\n<br/>\nEXAMPLE:  You want that black robe from Neriak..   problem is..  you&#39;re a High Elf.  You travel into Neriak..  just near the zone..  do a /who all and find a wizard in there...  start telling people to help you out.   Heres the deal...  your &quot;friend&quot; the dark elf has to go buy it.  Whether you give him money or whatever is inconsequential.  He gets the robe, and goes to meet you.  He has to die.  After he dies, he /consent s you to retrieve things off of his corpse.  You take the robe.   Now you&#39;ve got it.   If you try to give it back to him, you&#39;ll get the error message &quot;This item cannot be dropped, traded, or sold.&quot;  but its yours now.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me know if there are any questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrev</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
