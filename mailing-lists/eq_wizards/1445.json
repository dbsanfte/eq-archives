Hm, I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-305916463\">Responding to magician/wizard comparison, there may be some spoiler<br/>\ninformation contained within of damage and casting times of mid-level<br/>\nspells.<br/>\n<br/>\n.<br/>\n.<br/>\n<br/>\nHm, I hear the magician blast spell at lvl 16 does about 80-95 pts of<br/>\ndamage. I guess I don&#39;t see why your using flame shock (102 damage at<br/>\nlvl<br/>\n16). I use the Lightning Bolt ( 117 damage at lvl 16 ) which uses only<br/>\n10<br/>\nmore mana. So you have to aim, I usually tell my group not to fidget<br/>\nwhen<br/>\nfighting :P Or just circle stafe the melee for a good position.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe actual damage/mana ratio is the same, ours just does more per blast.<br/>\nAccording to eq stratics the base casting time for magician blast spell<br/>\nat<br/>\n16 is 3 seconds. Ours is 2 seconds. If this is true then that is an<br/>\nadvantage on our part.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiffnab MageStorm wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Ziffnab MageStorm &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_ziffnab@...\">eq_ziffnab@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; During my adventures over the past weekend I happened to group with a<br/>\n&gt; very nice magician and his pet &quot;Gonaker.&quot;  We did very well together<br/>\n&gt; and had fun.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The problem was that he made claims that he can strike a target for DD<br/>\n&gt; equal to mine.  We were both level 19 and sad thing is, I think he is<br/>\n&gt; right!  Can anyone tell me how much mana is used and damage delivered<br/>\n&gt; for the magician DD spell (16th level) equivelant to Fire Shock?  I<br/>\n&gt; have a feeling it will be the same which is sad really.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Before I rant on my class I will need to know the truth on this matter.<br/>\n&gt;  I love being a wizard and believe the long road to true power is a<br/>\n&gt; long one.  But we should be doing more damage than a damn magician and<br/>\n&gt; plus he gets a pet.  Let me know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Ziffnab of Xegony<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _____________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Free instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
