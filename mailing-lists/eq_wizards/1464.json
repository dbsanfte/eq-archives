It has<br/>\nsaved my life on many occasions.  Of course, it has failed on others but I<br/>\nreally didn&#39;t expect it to work all the time.<br/>\n    I would have to say that over all Shadow Step (in cunjunction with Gate<br/>\nor a zone run) has saved me about a full level of exp. (level 16 now)  Now<br/>\nit doesn&#39;t always work perfectly, sometimes I have to cast it multiple times<br/>\nto get far enough away to gate, and sometimes just once will do it.  I have<br/>\nseen (and experienced) it go terribly wrong, like the time I watched a<br/>\nfellow wizard trying to escape from two undead pawns at the chessboard,<br/>\nShadow Step into the arms of a freshly spawned pawn.  But in the end all I<br/>\nknow is that when the going gets too tough with Shadow Step I have a chance,<br/>\nand without it not much of one.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrystesa High-Elf Wizard on Tunare<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Marziani, Michael D.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Marziani@...\">Michael.Marziani@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote> &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My main gripes (I don&#39;t have many) are that like Alhassim stated, our<br/>\n&gt; utility spells really arent very useful.

If we are supposedly the masters of teleport spells<br/>\n&gt; then why the heck is shadowstep and fade so random?  Ok maybe these lower<br/>\n&gt; circle spells should be a little random as we are low level and maybe not<br/>\n&gt; very good at wizardry yet, but how about having a 4th or 5th circle spell<br/>\n&gt; upgrade from shadowstep to a spell that will reliably teleport us a decent<br/>\n&gt; distance in a fairly straight line in the direction we are facing?
