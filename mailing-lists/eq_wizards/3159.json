I&#39;m also a level 10 enchanter and if that mob is<br/>\nyellow or red there is about a 1 in 7 chance that it is fully resisted on<br/>\nboth my enfeeble spell and my mez(until I Tashan the creature, after which<br/>\nit is about 1 in 10).  I do have a incredible ability to control the flow of<br/>\nbattle as long as I have a group that is willing to take a few hits from a<br/>\nmonster until I can target the monster and unleash a mez.  If they don&#39;t<br/>\nwait and attack any way my mez has no effect because after the creature<br/>\ntakes damage it reactivates...(DOT&#39;s break the mez too... figured that out<br/>\nlast night with a shaman that poisoned one before I started trying to mez<br/>\nit)  so far I can say this... It comes down to whether I want to draw out<br/>\nthe combat or cut it off quickly.  The wizard can end a combat in 7 seconds<br/>\nof spell casting... the enchanter can draw out the battle but make it much<br/>\nsafer.  Both have advantages and minuses, but here is my sticking point:<br/>\n<br/>\nWizards are penalized at early levels (1-28) because they are suppose to be<br/>\nso good above that.  However, I feel, enchanters AND ALL classes balance out<br/>\nat the upper levels.  (Is this due to incredible amounts of whining about<br/>\nhow much more powerful x is than y?  YES)  Therefore, Wizards are just a<br/>\nvaluable as any other class above 28, but we pay a penalty of being not so<br/>\nvaluable at a lower level.  Is this fair?  NO.  Is this life?  yes...<br/>\nsadly...  Will GZ ever see the error of his way&#39;s?  I doubt it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRutreeii Wizard level 20<br/>\nMylin Enchanter level 10<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: mstokes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mstokes@...\">mstokes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 23, 1999 1:30 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_wizards] Wizards<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: mstokes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mstokes@...\">mstokes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Also talking to the enchanter<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mesmerize and MemBlur has never been resisted, He even used it on a Hill<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Giant when he was 20th just to check.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thats a crock.  It gets resisted all the time.  One of an Enchanters<br/>\nbiggest<br/>\n&gt; drawbacks is their resistability.  Imagine, every single spell is magic<br/>\nbased, and<br/>\n&gt; is therefore about as reliable as root.  Of course, they get tashen(i) to<br/>\nmake up<br/>\n&gt; for this, but that spell benifits all in a group, not just the Enchanters.<br/>\nOn a<br/>\n&gt; side note, Tashen(i) does not have a savings throw, and will not be<br/>\nresisted by<br/>\n&gt; either Resistance or level limitations.  Perhaps this was the spell he<br/>\nused on th<br/>\n&gt; HG.  Other enchanters spells are capped the same as a wizards.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
