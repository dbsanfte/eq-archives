As I was not twinked, but had many hundreds of platinum by level <br/>\n12.  There have been in the past messages posted requesting language <br/>\nassitance.  Well, if someone has mastered all of the main languages in the <br/>\ngame, player languages, monster languages, and most importantly the research <br/>\nlanguages (Old Erudian through elder Dragon).  Its amazing how well people <br/>\nwill pay to become excellent in the research languages.  Its really not that <br/>\nhard to become excellent either, the most difficult thing is to find the <br/>\nlanguages. Just search the land, looking for someone who will train you one <br/>\npoint in the language, and then get a friend, sit by a zone.  Whomever has <br/>\nlearned the language begins by speaking while one sits on the ground <br/>\nlistening.  When you have stopped improving, stand up and zone.  Then your <br/>\nfriend sits down, and you speak in the language until your friend improves <br/>\ntwo points.   Then your friend stands up and you both zone again.  Repeat the <br/>\ntwo point then zone process till your tired of it, or you&#39;re excellent.  This <br/>\nmethod will take you from awful or higher to excellent, in an hour or two.  <br/>\nEnjoy.  If anyone finds this info helpful, then I would appreciate a few <br/>\nalcoholic beverages!  Enjoy, and good learning.<br/>\nZaeq, Wizard and Boozer of E&#39;ci.
