Since the implementation of faction hits for PvP I am now <br/>\nregarded dubiously by most of the guards and have some Drow brethren who <br/>\ncannot enter the forest safely anymore.  Yes, it is my own fault for the <br/>\nmost part, but how can I fix it?  GMs and Guides can&#39;t help, other players <br/>\nthat I have talked with so far haven&#39;t been of much help, either.  I was <br/>\ntold to try the Halflings that roam Nek Forest, but that was misleading.  <br/>\nEven the Leatherfoot Deputy doesn&#39;t help you gain faction in Neriak.  I just <br/>\nheard tonight to try Lavastorm and Najena, but I had been there for many, <br/>\nmany levels and haven&#39;t noticed any gains.  Any advice would be most <br/>\nappreciated.  Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nErdrick, The Regulators<br/>\nwww.theregulators.org<br/>\n(Rallos Zek)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
