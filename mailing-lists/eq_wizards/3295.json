I camped the other day with two of my level 40+ friends (warrior and a cleric) and we killed shadowed men nonstop (as fast as was possible.  We were constantly waiting for them to respawn, and they respawn in about 5 min or so) for about 3 hours strait and I saw several shadowed patches, eye, fist, mask, book, shining stone, and numberless weapons, but no ball.  Is it possible to get it or is it super rare??<br/>\n<br/>\n-Shadowwalker</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
