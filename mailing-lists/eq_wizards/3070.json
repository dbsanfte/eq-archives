Yet, it still doesn&#39;t make camping any more <br/>\nenjoyable does it?  All it does is delay the inevitable.  Assuming the MoB <br/>\ndropped your item everytime...your guild would STILL be the first ones to <br/>\nget it.  It doesn&#39;t mean you tried any harder...it just meant you didn&#39;t <br/>\nhave to waste so much time doing it.  How is that a bad thing?  Item Rarity <br/>\nshould be dependant upon the difficulty in the MoB itself IMHO.  An item can <br/>\neven be made rare by making the MoB spawn less often... they DO that <br/>\nalready...but the frustration is made worse when the item is not on the MoB. <br/>\n  It&#39;s like they want to double-up on your tension.  This point is not as <br/>\nimportant...but you gotta remember we are all on paid time.  Verant has no <br/>\nproblem making us sit for 18hours at a time for an item now do they?  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI liked the other post I read earlier that suggested random spawns...if it <br/>\ncould be designed in such a way that a NPC would spawn *anywhere* in the <br/>\nlevel itself.  Now that&#39;s a fun challenge!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, now that the powergamers have gotten all there is to get, your point <br/>\nis moot my friend.  I have no desire to be the &quot;first&quot; to get an item...I <br/>\njust want it for personal satisfaction.  I killed the Mob...I got my item.  <br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, by the way Askur, the advice to go to Cazic is a good one.  From 24 and <br/>\nup....it&#39;s a haven for xp!  And I&#39;m not going to begin to say how much money <br/>\nyou can get there hehe.   I&#39;ll probably run into you there.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n26 Wiz Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
