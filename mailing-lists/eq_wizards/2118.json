It<br/>\n&gt; is Tishan&#39;s Clash. It will stun your opponent for about 2 seconds (much like<br/>\n&gt; a skel might stun you), and does approx. 30dmg.  The recover time for it is<br/>\n&gt; about the same as force shock, so you cannot cast it several times in<br/>\n&gt; succession if you were hoping to keep the opponent stunned. The mana cost on<br/>\n&gt; it is very high though, so I don&#39;t really see a valid use for it (if the<br/>\n&gt; stun time were longer, it would be a nice spell, but 2 seconds just isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; long enough).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Clash is a wonderfull spell<br/>\nfor soloing for exemple when you want to fetch a monster and bring him<br/>\nto <br/>\na safe place for killing it .<br/>\nfor spellcaster mob it is a MUST some mob can cast a greater heal <br/>\nthat mean that they can nearly completly heal themself <br/>\nand you dont want that to happen so you just stun them <br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nHanidus level 33 wizard on KARANA</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
