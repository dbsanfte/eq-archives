Char last night. Was in<br/>\nhighpass and tried to take a green gnoll. Actually hit him for 171(Was<br/>\nshocked at this). Then enstill didn&#39;t work and I got the crap beat out of<br/>\nme, but zoned in time. After regen I headed back in. There was a 20th lvl<br/>\nranger. ( I know it&#39;s a hybrid class.)  She took out three blues (Blues to<br/>\nme) without a resting period.  And I questioned our &quot;power&quot; as wizards.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I have noticed in Blizzard games. (Don&#39;t get me wrong here) is<br/>\nthey spent enough time before release finding BALANCE in a game.  Yeah they<br/>\nhad a ton a problems with cheating but the underlying BALANCE was there.<br/>\nEverquest can be a GREAT game if they can work these out.  If you have<br/>\nnoticed the patches flying around they totally deal with balace in the game.<br/>\nPerhpas they should look at the wizard class to see if there is any balance<br/>\nthere at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nCongratulations to &quot;M-K-ROSES,&quot; our latest ONElist of the Week.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nVisit our homepage and share with us how ONElist is changing YOUR life!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
