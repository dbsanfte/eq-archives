Was going cracked staff for awhile till I saw that the dagger does better damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for the advice. I appreciate it. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I met a group of higher levels (30ish) and got to joking with one of them. He gave me a raw silk cloak out of the blue! So I gave him a HQ bear skin and after some quick negotiations with his friends, he offered to buy all the other quality pelts I had in the bank. I didnt know the &#39;market value&#39; so just said whatever he felt was right, and got 30 plat out of it for 8 pelts. More than Ive EVER had before in my life! Any future pelts I catch, Im to let him know. This is what I love about EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nA pity theres no Gate to Other Server spell. Wouldnt that be something? :)<br/>\n<br/>\nShannyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marvin@...\">marvin@...</a>&gt; 09/27/99 11:43AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marvin@...\">marvin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 27 Sep 1999, PHAEDRA WHITLOCK wrote:<br/>\n&gt; An Enchanter I group with often is up to 11th now, and Im hoping he&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; be able to turn out some things.

Ive gotten a nearly complete suit of silk, the rings I<br/>\n&gt; mentioned, the amulet, and a blackened wand (15 magic resistance)  <br/>\n&gt; and given out gifts of pelts and various items I came across. But you<br/>\n&gt; dont get a lot of cash this way.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, i do that too...though it does come back to you eventually...i just<br/>\nrecently benafitted from the same thing on a higher level...got a shear<br/>\nbone mask (+3 int and a decent ac) from a really nice really high level<br/>\nenchanter...<br/>\n <br/>\n&gt; Wavering on if I should turn into a miser or deal with breaking even.<br/>\n&gt; :D Some people charge for Binds, some dont, and I can bind now. :z<br/>\n<br/>\npersionally i just tell them to pay me what they think it&#39;s worth if they<br/>\nask..true you dont&#39; make much from it, but sometimes you get lucky...and<br/>\nsometimes you make a friend..believe it or not a lot of folks will rember<br/>\nlittle things like binding them for free...reputation does mean something,<br/>\nespecially when you get to higher levels..<br/>\n <br/>\n&gt; At what level do you tend to start going to pick up nice magic user<br/>\n&gt; items? Most quests that grant such things seem geared for lvl 30 and<br/>\n&gt; up.<br/>\n<br/>\nnot counting the player made jewlery i&#39;d say in your 20&#39; up...<br/>\nat least that&#39;s the point where you start to really be able to kill stuff<br/>\nthat drops decent magical items...you&#39;ll probibly start making enough coin<br/>\nto buy magical stuff from the mid teens on..oh, and a suggestion, get a<br/>\ndragoon dir instead of a runed totem staff...while you don&#39;t melee much<br/>\nat higher levels, your better off having your decent melee skill being<br/>\nsomthing one handed(piercing would be my choice if i had it to do<br/>\nagain...)<br/>\n<br/>\nStannis Starslyder<br/>\nWizard of the Moon<br/>\nInnoruuk </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
