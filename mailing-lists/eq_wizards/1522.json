I had travelled<br/>\nfrom my home in felwithe across antonica and was battling the gnolls of<br/>\nblackburrow.  Well at level 13 which I was last night (till i leveled to 14)<br/>\nI easily found a similarly leveled party to fight the gnoll elites and<br/>\ncommanders.  Even with 5 members in our party the loot each of us got was<br/>\nincredible.  The gnoll elites and commanders each have the chance of having<br/>\na bronze weapon (2 or 3pp), studded or spiked collars (1pp to store, more to<br/>\nplayers), and the commanders additionally have the chance of having onyx<br/>\nearrings (2 or 3pp to players) and I think bloodstone rings as well.<br/>\nOccasionally you would get more than 1 of those items at a time and one of<br/>\nthe fellows in our group said that he once got a bronze weapon, spiked<br/>\ncollar, onyx earring, and bloodstone ring off a single commander.  The best<br/>\nI have gotten is a bronze weapon and a spiked collar (which was off a single<br/>\nelite).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was intestesting to note that although blackburrow is very crowded (and<br/>\nlaggy in some areas) there were not all that many groups fighting elites and<br/>\ncommanders, so we had plenty to kill.  Once you hit level 12 if you are in<br/>\nthe area this is a good place to earn cash if you are in a group or can find<br/>\none.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Solric of the 4th circle</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
