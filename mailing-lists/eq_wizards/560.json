It is a quest that he gives out to paladins, clerics and those in<br/>\ngood standing with the guild. If you don&#39;t have standing you can still give<br/>\nthe item to him, but don&#39;t expect much more than a faction raise in return<br/>\nfor it.<br/>\nThis can also be done with the Orc Runner pouches.
