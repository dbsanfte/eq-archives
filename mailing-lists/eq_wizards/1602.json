Although even 10pp pieces seems like<br/>\n&gt;an impossibility to me. This server seems to be dominated by guild<br/>\n&gt;campers and privateers.  In the time I have been here (on nearly<br/>\n&gt;constantly) for instance there is one and only one person offering int<br/>\n&gt;raising bracelets (Radigan) and I beleive they are ac+3, mana+15 and<br/>\n&gt;he is asking a FIRM 15pp each.  I bought an entire set of banded<br/>\n&gt;armour (for my bard who is stinking rich by my wizards standards and<br/>\n&gt;can make 30 pp in 5 hours of play) less cloak for nearly that price!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As for other items, I have seen a few auctions for woven, magical<br/>\n&gt;staffs or other lore items.  When they are auctioned they are gone<br/>\n&gt;immediately and the prices they fetch are insane (unless you know the<br/>\n&gt;camper .... err seller).  I have seen simple pieces of netted at<br/>\n&gt;starting prices of 30pp!  As for the majority which are never<br/>\n&gt;auctioned they are either camped then kept within the camping click or<br/>\n&gt;selfishly horded to prevent anyone else from attaining them.  Like I<br/>\n&gt;have said before the game should actually be renamed to everGREED,<br/>\n&gt;GREEDquest, PRIVATEERquest, BARTERquest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I guess on a bright side I have heard stories (actually I know of<br/>\n&gt;several lucky Bast@#ds) that have aquired the runed totem staff for a<br/>\n&gt;mere 20pp.  Which is close to the asking price of the FS GS here in<br/>\n&gt;mithaniel (over priced land of powergammers) marr.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have a 9th level wizard that currently walks Narrath in a shoddy sr<br/>\n&gt;apprentise robe with a worn great staff.  I have lost count of the<br/>\n&gt;number of times I have died as a result of trying to do the last 3<br/>\n&gt;points of damage to a fleeing creature swinging once in what seems<br/>\n&gt;like every 10 seconds yet not willing to wasted the precious 8 mana to<br/>\n&gt;frost the critter to death.  Or was forced to run as a result of 2<br/>\n&gt;successful blows from an enemy.  Sye....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have only been able to buy 8 spells TOTAL and have 7pp in the bank.<br/>\n&gt;I played yesterday and had one of the most productive (highest kill to<br/>\n&gt;time ratios) nights I can recall and after 18 straight hours of play I<br/>\n&gt;had aquired 8pp! :(  How is one ever to afford anything?  You can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;fight for it as it is camped. In the slim chance that you do get the<br/>\n&gt;opportunity to fight, Varent has reduced the odds of anything good<br/>\n&gt;dropping so low after the latest patchs (and keep in mind it must be<br/>\n&gt;your turn to loot) that I have projected I would age 30 real years<br/>\n&gt;before I could ever hope of aquiring one decent item!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t even want to think about the 12th level spells and the fact I<br/>\n&gt;will have to play 7 by 24 for a week to buy one spell!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Guile (disillusioned wizard) of the 9th circle.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(To twink or not to twink alas that is the question)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Cristie&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cristie@...\">cristie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Date: Thu, 20 May 1999 12:05:52 -0700<br/>\n&gt;&gt; X-Priority: 3<br/>\n&gt;&gt; X-MSMail-Priority: Normal<br/>\n&gt;&gt; X-MimeOLE: Produced By Microsoft MimeOLE V4.72.3110.3<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Mailing-List: list <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>; contact<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards-owner@onelist.com\">eq_wizards-owner@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; Delivered-To: mailing list <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; List-Unsubscribe: &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards-unsubscribe@...\">eq_wizards-unsubscribe@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Mime-Version: 1.0<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [eq_wizards] Armor Question<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Cristie&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cristie@...\">cristie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Goss yields an AC of 8, and is magical, yet I don&#39;t know what the<br/>\n&gt;magic does<br/>\n&gt;&gt; exactly.  I have one.  I have no idea what you could auction it for<br/>\n&gt;because<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t plan to give it up anytime soon.. or at least til I get a<br/>\n&gt;Flowing<br/>\n&gt;&gt; black robe :)... I would guess, however, you could probably ask<br/>\n&gt;8p-10p+ and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; get it.  I don&#39;t recall what the jr. and sr. app robes went for in<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; guild.. that might be a good reference point though.
