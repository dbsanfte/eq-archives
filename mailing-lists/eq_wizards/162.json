I found lvl 8 and 9 to be my<br/>\n&gt; hardest thus<br/>\n&gt; far simply because when you go solo everything is either too hard, or too<br/>\n&gt; easy.. there aren&#39;t many in betweens.  (at least that is what I found for<br/>\n&gt; the creatures around the neriak/freeport area)  The way I made it through<br/>\n&gt; was by meeting people who played the game well, and we went out<br/>\n&gt; and hunted.<br/>\n&gt; For a lower lvl wizard going solo can be disastrous.. at 14 I still have<br/>\n&gt; tons of problems solo.  The only advice I can give you, is keep trying in<br/>\n&gt; the parties.. eventually you will find some good people who play well, and<br/>\n&gt; who you get along with.  Then when you play after that you&#39;ll know who to<br/>\n&gt; look for a little better so that you can get back together as a<br/>\n&gt; good group.<br/>\n&gt; Sorry I have nothing really conforting to say.. but grouping is a<br/>\n&gt; major part<br/>\n&gt; of playing a wizard.  If it&#39;s impossible to find anyone around<br/>\n&gt; the freeport<br/>\n&gt; area, then you try moving to another city.  Travelling to Qeynos is not<br/>\n&gt; extremely hard from freeport (1 really hard zone) and I&#39;m sure you could<br/>\n&gt; find someone there to bind you, and hopefully more people who you would be<br/>\n&gt; able to group with.  Good luck to you...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tandayen, Dark Elf Wizard<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ulrich1@...\">ulrich1@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ulrich1@...\">ulrich1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Sunday, April 18, 1999 8:23 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eq_wizards] What should I do<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ulrich1@...\">ulrich1@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Ok I have a problem....<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I am a level 8 Human Wizard in Freeport, Xegony server. My<br/>\n&gt; problem is I do<br/>\n&gt; not have any friends playing EQ. My game so far has been solo. The levels<br/>\n&gt; are coming very slow. I have grouped up with people several times. This<br/>\n&gt; turns into a nightmare. Most of the time we all just run around aimlessly,<br/>\n&gt; it takes so much time just to get sometime going its not really worth it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Anyone have any suggestions? I have a friend who is going to buy the game<br/>\n&gt; soon, its just hard to wait. It took me 1 week to level up from 7 to 8.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Not to mention Humans can&#39;t see in the dark.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sorry for the long winning post.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Thanks<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Cornn (I love this game)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;New hobbies?
