The only info I <br/>\nmanaged to get was this, off of EQ&#39;lizer:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;These magical rings can be foud off the second Shadowknight in <br/>\nBefallen. They grant +2 armor class.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was just curious if there&#39;s anything else special about it, aside <br/>\nfrom the increase in AC -- an NPC offered to buy it for 4platinum, I <br/>\nbelieve, as opposed to the 1platinum offered for a Cutthroat Dervish <br/>\nRing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance, for any help.<br/>\n<br/>\nErdrick, The Regulators<br/>\nwww.theregulators.org<br/>\n(Rallos Zek)<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
