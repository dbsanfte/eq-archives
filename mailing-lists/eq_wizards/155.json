Najena is a prime example as there are Elementals all over the place there.  Elementals are considered summoned creatures and so the spell will point out the nearest one to you, giving you an idea of what&#39;s ahead and how powerful they are.  It isn&#39;t until you hit 18th or higher that the true beauty of this spell is realized.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalarin High Elven Wizard<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: d <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, April 18, 1999 2:45 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [eq_wizards] Re: Anyone Know<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sense summoned is pretty useless as a spell, but think of it as a trainer, its not too costly mana wise and it&#39;s one of the few divination spells you get early on so just cast a few bars of mana and max out your div whenever you have the time, im sure theres a useful divination spell eventually<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Aralan, 10th level wizard </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
