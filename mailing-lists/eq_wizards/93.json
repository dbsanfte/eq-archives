Yes it is a low<br/>\nlevel, low damage spell but it effects anything that attacks you each time it<br/>\nattacks you, and it&#39;s a pretty cheap spell to purchase as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI use O&#39;Keils Radiation to hunt Orc pawns and Goblin whelps, it uses little mana<br/>\nand between it and my staff i can usually take one out in a couple of seconds.  By<br/>\nthe way dont discount these guys, I have found backpacks, good armor, and other<br/>\nitems of cash value on them.  No they don&#39;t provide exp once you get past the<br/>\nearly levels but in numbers they can pay for that extra spell you want so badly,<br/>\nand its something you can hunt solo.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour friendly neighborhood Wizard ; )<br/>\n<br/>\n - Malebion -<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthony Lee wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Anthony Lee &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:saleengt@...\">saleengt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At 01:31 PM 4/16/99 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Donald Taber &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dtaber@...\">dtaber@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I have a few questions...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;1.  Spell damage seems to be linked to level somehow, anyone<br/>\n&gt; &gt;have any idea how?  Is it just 1 extra point per level?  Is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it spell dependant?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;For example, as a fifth level wizard using Shock of Fire, I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;consistantly doing 13 points of damage.  After going to 6th<br/>\n&gt; &gt;level, I am consistantly doing 14 points.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes it does 1 additional damage per lvl but there is a cap. Shock of Fire<br/>\n&gt; caps at 15 dmg if i remember correctly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;2.  Also, I have been playing around with the spells, and I am having<br/>\n&gt; &gt;trouble getting O&#39;keils Radiation to work.  How does it work and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;what is the best way to use it?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; My opinion is O&#39;keils is really a waste of mana, i bought it for my Wiz<br/>\n&gt; during P4 (of course it wasn&#39;t working during P4)<br/>\n&gt; Since then i have seen it cast on others and people have cast it on me.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s like a shielding spell that does damage to<br/>\n&gt; monsters that are close to you. The problem with it in my opinion is that<br/>\n&gt; it doesn&#39;t last nearly long enough to make it<br/>\n&gt; worth casting. Total time it lasts about 30 secs or so.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;3.  Any idea where I can find a Glimpse spell in Freeport?  I have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;tried the guild and can not find it for sale.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;great<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of a spell, but I think it&#39;s the only one I don&#39;t have.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No idea .. sorry ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;                                                        Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;                                                            Soren<br/>\n&gt; &gt;                                                            Wizard Level<br/>\n&gt; &gt;6<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Visit our homepage and share with us your experiences at ONElist of the Week!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Did you know that ONElist hosts some of the largest lists on the Internet?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Our scaleable system is the most reliable free e-mail service on the Internet! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
