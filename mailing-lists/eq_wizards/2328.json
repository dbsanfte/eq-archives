Put the text in /gsay also. Group with a friend and then just spamm spamm spamm by continually pressing the hotkey number that your language lesson text is on.  If you do this for about 10 minutes or less you will see the improvement come rather quickly. Also, you can only teach someone a language one point better than you know it. When they see the &quot;your language skills have improved &quot; stop coming, it is time for them to spamm you in that same language, keep going back and forth and soon you both will be excellent in the language. Once it was nessesary to zone between lessons, but I think they were gonna fix this.<br/>\n    Hope that Helps ya<br/>\n<br/>\n    Kueken Mith Marr<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: Mry &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mry@...\">mry@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Date: Sunday, June 13, 1999 2:47 PM<br/>\n    Subject: Re: [eq_wizards] Spells<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    I have just reached lvl 16 and now have the task of getting runes to make my spells. I gather I need to learn other languages to read the books, I sat talking to another player to learn gnomish and over an hour it increased about 7 times. Is there some special way of learning this better or is there a list that contains the rune combinations as finding someone to talk to for hours is very hard.<br/>\n     <br/>\n    Mryius</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
