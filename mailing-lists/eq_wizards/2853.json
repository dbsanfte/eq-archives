Let&#39;s say I did something stupid (this<br/>\n&gt;didn&#39;t happen) like not buy root at lvl4, and already filled all five slots<br/>\n&gt;in my spellbook... can I go out and buy root and scribe it over top of one<br/>\n&gt;of my lvl4 spells that I think sucks?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also I&#39;m nearing the specialization levels and have read some interesting<br/>\n&gt;posts on the subject of what to specialize in.  It comes down to either<br/>\n&gt;Alteration or Evocation and I&#39;d like to hear some thoughts about what to<br/>\n&gt;choose as my expertise.  I&#39;m leaning toward Evocation based on the sheer<br/>\n&gt;fact that in the long run maybe I&#39;ll save mana/time since I blast more than<br/>\n&gt;I root or whatever.  But it would be damn nice to have an extra powerful<br/>\n&gt;rooting ability or even get gate off while being melee&#39;d.  Who thinks they<br/>\n&gt;chose the right one?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Veron of Tunare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt;Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Silverion Dragonirder<br/>\n<br/>\nHigh elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\nFenin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\nmoderator mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
