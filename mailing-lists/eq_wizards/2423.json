Hopefully some of you may know the stories<br/>\n&gt; behind these places.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmm I don&#39;t know much about the sories behind them but some<br/>\nsparse info... Please someone tell us about the background of these<br/>\nplaces though!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - This zone has a golden tower out in the middle of nowhere.  You can go<br/>\n&gt; into it, but there&#39;s nothing there (at least nothing when I went into it).<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure if anything spawns here or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Dwarf skeletons spawn around and inside too I think.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - There&#39;s a place there called the Orc Totem, a large totem pole in a<br/>\n&gt; fairly small valley.  Orc Oracles and Ceturions spawn there regularly.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been told that this is where D&#39;Vinn trained the orcs in the arcane<br/>\n&gt; arts.  The hole in this story is D&#39;Vinn.  He&#39;s a rogue, not a mage - what<br/>\n&gt; would he know about trainning people in the arcane arts?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you mean ambassador Dvinn? The dark elf? In Crushbone.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - There is the ruins of a temple or something (a whole bunch of columns,<br/>\n&gt; standing and fallen) where skeletons spawn.  There&#39;s a merchant there that<br/>\n&gt; sells Druid spells.  What&#39;s the story behind the temple; when did it fall<br/>\n&gt; and who did it fall to?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmm... I wish I knew!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - There are two Orge NPC wandering around Butchers Block, Corflunk and<br/>\n&gt; Zachume(sp?).  The Ogre lands are in the southern part of Antione.  What<br/>\n&gt; are these two doing here in Butchersblock?  Zachume(sp?) seems to be a<br/>\n&gt; druid or something - a possible connection with the temple ruins mentioned<br/>\n&gt; above?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Only thing In know is that they are part of a quest. Perhaps that quest<br/>\ncan give more info? Anyone done it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - A friend of mine found a huge stone face carved into the wall of a<br/>\n&gt; shallow cave way out in the middle of nowhere.  She was alone and because<br/>\n&gt; it was so isolated and such a long walk, she didn&#39;t stick around to see if<br/>\n&gt; anything spawned there.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s just over a mountain at the skeleton ruins. A dwarf skeleton<br/>\nspawns behind it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo i don&#39;t know any background on these objects/places. Someone please<br/>\nenlighten us! Perhaps some quests give more info?<br/>\n<br/>\n//Shulinar, lvl 9 Wizard of the Fervir Guild (arch mage) on Rodcet Nife.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nDisclaimer: Any errors in spelling, tact, or fact are transmission errors.<br/>\n| Mattias Bergander aka Pulsar |<br/>\n| <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pulsar@...\">pulsar@...</a>           |<br/>\n| WWW: surf.to/pulsar          |</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
