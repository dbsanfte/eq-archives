Sounds freaking scary for now <br/>\nhehe.  I don&#39;t like the 75% odds...especially with my slow old legs.  <br/>\nLim&#39;Dul cannot run like he used to.  I think I&#39;ll be safe and take the long <br/>\nroute around by way of my own 2 feet heh.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- AE spells.  I&#39;ve tried playing around with them under the advice I heard <br/>\nhere.  Still not working that great for me...I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m just not <br/>\ntargetting the right MoB in a fight.  Very little damage quite a bit of time <br/>\nto cast.  I&#39;ll play with it a bit more.....<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Leatherskin.
