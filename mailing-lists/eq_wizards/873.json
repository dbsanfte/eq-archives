Well my friend is a shaman who just<br/>\nturned 14. Well he just brought<br/>\nhis new damage spell and he said it does 77 damage, to which i replied kewl<br/>\nmy next spell does that amount<br/>\ntoo. That was a mistake he started laughing and saying things like &quot;why<br/>\nwould anyone want to play the wizard<br/>\nwhen they can play the shaman&quot;.  &quot;the shaman can stand toe to toe like the<br/>\nwarrior and do the same damage<br/>\nas the wizard, Ha HA HA HA .....&quot; . Then he went on saying crap like now he<br/>\nknows the shaman is the best<br/>\nclass in the game. All he could talk about before was the sow spell, and now<br/>\nit is he does the same damage<br/>\nas the wizard.  My question is this, i thought i picked the wizard so i<br/>\nwould not have to hear stuff like this?<br/>\nI thought level 12 was when the wizard started to leave other mage class<br/>\nbehind.  Know i have to hear alot<br/>\naggraviating crap from this shaman, laughing at the wizard class. Dam that<br/>\nis going to suck.  Someone<br/>\nplease tell me there is hope out there as far as the damage spells go.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
