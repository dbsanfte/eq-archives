I was running with a monk that became<br/>\n&gt; pk (I&#39;ll use pk and nonpk because it&#39;s less confusing to me) and the<br/>\ncleric<br/>\n&gt; in the party wouldn&#39;t help him at all. He even said, don&#39;t heal me, don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; buff me or you&#39;ll become pk. Very cool of him.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, that was good of him.  I think there is a warning message if you try<br/>\nto buff, but still.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     As to the looting issue, that&#39;s absurd. (In your favor) NO ONE should<br/>\nbe<br/>\n&gt; able to loot your body unless they personally killed you. Another point<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; you, and that&#39;s something that I think they need to address. I didn&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; that just anyone could pick stuff off your body. As a matter of fact, I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; make looting a pk body that you didn&#39;t kill turn you pk. That&#39;d be more<br/>\n&gt; reasonable I think. Believe me, no one&#39;s picking on you, maybe taking the<br/>\n&gt; easy way out, but not singling out pk players.<br/>\n<br/>\nOops, since I play on zek, where everyone is PK I didn&#39;t clarify.  nPK<br/>\nplayers can&#39;t loot fallen pk.  But since on zek everyone is PK the fact that<br/>\nnpk can&#39;t loot you is irrelwevant.  there aren&#39;t any npk to loot or not loot<br/>\nyou.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As to coding the changes. It&#39;s more than likely that it&#39;s easier to make<br/>\n&gt; them not be able to cast anything on you instead of being selective. As a<br/>\n&gt; matter of fact I KNOW it&#39;d be easier that way. It&#39;s like having 1 switch<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; turn on all the lights in your house, or running around and turning some<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; and some off.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, easier to code in the first place.  But, what I am saying is that the<br/>\ncode for selectively choosing what spells work is ALREADY there.  You are<br/>\nnpk.  You cast heal on someone.  it works.  you cast ice strike on someone.<br/>\nit doesn&#39;t work.  See, the code is already in there, they just aren&#39;t<br/>\napplying the rules to PK for some reason.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All in all though, I think that for the moment, it&#39;d be better to just<br/>\nenjoy<br/>\n&gt; the game as is for the moment, and work towards what changes you&#39;d like.<br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s a fdback button there, use it and have all the pk players you know<br/>\n&gt; use it as well. Good to hear the comments though.<br/>\n<br/>\nYep, they are probably getting sick of feedback from me by now.  I am really<br/>\nenjoying the game, and I think the game is fundamentally great, but bugs<br/>\nthat have been known about for this long that have such a potentially HUGE<br/>\ngameplay effect should be gone by now.

Hold on there, Iggie didn&#39;t say YOU, he said that there are a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;lot<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of +pvp players that are jerks. There are also a ton of -pvp players<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; are jerks as well. I&#39;ll tell you about Elyas the loser Paladin on<br/>\nSolusek<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Ro<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sometime.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;He didn&#39;t say anyone was a jerk.  He said we weren&#39;t important enough to<br/>\n&gt; fix<br/>\n&gt; &gt;+PvP specific problems.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Enabling +pvp or -pvp is a choice you make, and because Verant has<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; decided to offer you this choice, it is also up to them to protect<br/>\n&gt; players<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that don&#39;t share a +pvp view. They&#39;ve given you &#39;free zones&#39; where<br/>\n&gt; &gt;even -pvp<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; players are fair game, they&#39;ve given you an entire +pvp server. I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;see<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; what more they can offer?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Fix the PvP specific bugs.  I don&#39;t care about PvP specific zones.  I<br/>\nplay<br/>\n&gt; &gt;my wizard on zek where this specific issue isn&#39;t a concern to me since<br/>\n&gt; there<br/>\n&gt; &gt;are no -PvP players to worry about.  I&#39;m just saying this continued<br/>\n&gt; attitude<br/>\n&gt; &gt;toward +PvP is totally unwarranted.  What did we do to everyone else?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Are thee bugs, yes that&#39;s true, but I think that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; fixing global bugs that affect everyone will be more of a priority than<br/>\n&gt; &gt;bugs<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that affect a single class.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The bug I am concerned with is a global bug.  It affects people of any<br/>\n&gt; class<br/>\n&gt; &gt;on all servers.  It just hurts +PvP a lot more.  But the bug is still<br/>\n&gt; there.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So you have restrictions that I do not have as<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a -pvp wizard. It was your choice, so live with it. Learn to get around<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and I&#39;m sure that you&#39;ll have a much better experience for it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Huh?  What are you talking about?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;     You also have to remember that it&#39;s THEIR world  you&#39;re in, so you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to conform to them, they don&#39;t have to conform to you, even though a<br/>\nlot<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; player suggestions have been implemented. I&#39;m still waiting for a patch<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; will save the choice of how I view servers. Why would anyone want to<br/>\nview<br/>\n&gt; &gt;by<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; number of players once you&#39;ve created and levelled your characters is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mystery to me. : )<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;No kidding.  That&#39;s kinda annoying.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;     Try and remember that there&#39;s nothing that they&#39;ve done is to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; intentionally harmful to the -pvp class, but given a choice the<br/>\nmajority<br/>\n&gt; &gt;has<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to rule, and that majority is -pvp. Their priorities concerning +pvp<br/>\nwill<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; always come first.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Um, you are wrong.  Their priority is -PvP.  This should be pretty<br/>\nobvious<br/>\n&gt; &gt;if you have played the game at all.  -PvP has no real problems (I play<br/>\n&gt; &gt;a -PvP ranger on the Rathe).  +PvP still has a couple HUGE, game balance<br/>\n&gt; &gt;destroying issues that would be pretty simple to fix.  From what I read<br/>\n&gt; &gt;about the testing on the test server, it looks like they may finally have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;addressed the issue as the looting for +PvP is supposed to have changed.<br/>\n&gt; To<br/>\n&gt; &gt;give you a brief rundown of the current problem, you are a lvl 35 (insert<br/>\n&gt; &gt;any class here) player.  You accidentally have autoattack on or are<br/>\nplaying<br/>\n&gt; &gt;song of discord or aoe a critter that is standing near a guard at one of<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;kelethin lifts.  The guard kills you.  ANY person who comes along can<br/>\nloot<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you.  Even lvl 1 newbies.  Goodbye black robe and no way to get it back<br/>\n&gt; from<br/>\n&gt; &gt;them (four level limit).  Obviously this screws up game balance a bit.<br/>\nAll<br/>\n&gt; &gt;they need to do to fix it is apply the same loot ruels they use for MOBs.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;If you didn&#39;t kill it, you don&#39;t get to loot it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;However, non combat spells you should be able to cast on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; others. Bind Affinity, O&#39;Keils radiation, Invisibility, great spells,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m behind you 110% in that you should be able to use them on others.<br/>\nI&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sure they&#39;ll change it in the future, but how long depends on how hard<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; &gt;is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to code.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I wouldn&#39;t think it would be that hard as most players can already cast<br/>\n&gt; them<br/>\n&gt; &gt;on others, just not +PvP for some reason.  +PvP spells would work exactly<br/>\n&gt; &gt;as -PvP spells on a -PvP person.  There is no difference whatsoever in<br/>\nhow<br/>\n&gt; &gt;they should behave.  if a -PvP can cast it on a -PvP, a +PvP should be<br/>\nable<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to.  The code is all there, and all works, except they aren&#39;t using it.<br/>\n&gt; The<br/>\n&gt; &gt;only sane explanation is they are punishing +PvP for something.  BTW, if<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;are +PvP you can forget about -PvP helping you ever.  They can&#39;t cast<br/>\n&gt; &gt;helpful spells on you without becoming +PvP themselves.  Of course, I<br/>\nplay<br/>\n&gt; &gt;on zek, where the only real concern is the looting issue I just<br/>\nmentioned.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Zalbar<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 14th Wizard<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; From: John Cuyle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johncuyle@...\">johncuyle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Date: 22 avril, 1999 12:08<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: [eq_wizards] Re: Digest Number 18<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;From: &quot;John Cuyle&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johncuyle@...\">johncuyle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;There you have it, even players say &quot;screw you, +PvP people.
