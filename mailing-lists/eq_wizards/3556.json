I just joined the group<br/>\n&gt; and thought I&#39;d say <br/>\n&gt; hi.  My main is a wizard (obviously), though he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; only mid-level.  I <br/>\n&gt; mostly play characters over on the E. Marr server.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a couple of questions though.  Is it normal<br/>\n&gt; for wizards to die <br/>\n&gt; about every five encounters?  I have a definite<br/>\n&gt; tendency to get <br/>\n&gt; killed.  Also, anything that cons over light blue is<br/>\n&gt; almost <br/>\n&gt; impossible for me to solo.  Is this normal, or do I<br/>\n&gt; need to rethink <br/>\n&gt; my strategies?
