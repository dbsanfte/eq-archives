Also Sand Giants, if there is a difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think around 29 o 30 you can start hurting them.  They will be red still.<br/>\nI am 35 now and have seen some blue ones.  Most are Yellow to me with an<br/>\noccassional white.  I&#39;m guessing they range from about 33 to 38 but I am not<br/>\nsure.  I think the hill giants and sand giants are about the same except for<br/>\nthier resistances.  I am pretty sure that hill giants tae more damage from<br/>\nheat spells than the do cold.  I am guesing that sand giants are opposite<br/>\nbut haven&#39;t tried it yet.  They are fun ti kill with a good group, and they<br/>\nhave really good loot.  Usually a FS weapon worht around 5pp and anywher<br/>\nfrom 10 gp(rare) to over 30 pp.(common)  After 3 or 4 hrs, I usually have<br/>\nover 100 pp and so many FS weapons, I cant move.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
