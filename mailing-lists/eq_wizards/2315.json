Hunt you till you cry, and then kill you, no matter<br/>\nwhat your friends do to try to save&#92;taunt&#92;interpose for you.  I have to<br/>\nstand so far back that I don&#39;t even get the combat messages or sounds, and<br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t even work all the time.  Yes I&#39;m kicking ass and taking<br/>\nnames... but at what cost...  (It was great when a dwarf was complaining<br/>\nabout me being in the group as a exp. stealer when I shocked of lighting<br/>\nonce too often and  the monster left the party 100 yards back in preference<br/>\nfor me. :)  shut him up quick *chuckle*)<br/>\n<br/>\nNext I have discovered the POWER of the druids...  What I&#39;m about to relate<br/>\nto you was fully observed and discussed with a druid in my clan...  She at<br/>\n14th level gets a spell called conflageration(sp)  it does 65 points of<br/>\ndamage for 35 mana. 1.86 dam per mana.  I do at level 13, 79 points of<br/>\ndamage for 60 mana. 1.32 dam per mana.  We casted the spells at close to the<br/>\nsame rate... we timed 5 of mine to 4 of hers.  How can we claim to be the<br/>\nmasters of anything after this little show of power? btw at the end of the<br/>\ntest she did 260 hps dam for 140 mana and I did 395 hps dam for 240 mana.<br/>\nFruther I would like you to realize that when I get to level 14 i&#39;ll do 1<br/>\nmore hps dam in a slightly shorter period of time.  Not bad but nothing like<br/>\ni would expect from the masters of damage that I expected and still do<br/>\nexpect the wizard to be.  (she pulled a monster off of me with her spells<br/>\nonce and another time she pulled the monster on herself after a set of<br/>\nspells [it saved vs 2 of mine I had cast doing only 36 and 39 respectivly])<br/>\n(these were wolly calfs, and orc Mounteneers/shamans)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNext, Wizards are AWSOME at learning skills.  We all choose some of the<br/>\nhighest int scores we can get so that we have the most mana, but this also<br/>\ngives us the fastest skill increase rates of anyone.  I get all my skills<br/>\nmaxed out after about 15 to 20 attempts of the skill (5 points) at a 142<br/>\nint.  Now this is great!  But what value does it hold for us?  So we max our<br/>\nskills before we get half a buble of exp into our next one?  This reminds me<br/>\nof the &#39;we do the most damage&#39; thing but if we try to &#39;do the most damage&#39;<br/>\nwe are monster enemy number 1!(well before the monster is dead I might add)<br/>\n<br/>\nAh yes the one good trend I&#39;m seeing, Level 12 brought new found respect.  I<br/>\ncan find a group fast now... very fast(some may be that I joined/started a<br/>\nGuild).  I think the fact that I stand a mile away and draw in the monster<br/>\nhas a demoralizing effect on our tanks and makes them understand that we are<br/>\nnow dealing more damage than they can.  At least it is a love hate<br/>\nrelationship, they hate us because they love what we can do.<br/>\n<br/>\noh well I&#39;ll report more after I hit 16th+ :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRutreeII<br/>\nCazic-Thul</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
