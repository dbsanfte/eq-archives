(I&#39;m going from <br/>\nmemory here since I&#39;m at work).  I purchased all of my necessary research <br/>\ntools over at the mage tower in Freeport..lower floor.  It looks like a <br/>\nlittle red book.<br/>\n<br/>\nI finally made a successful spell yesterday, projectile lightning.  So now <br/>\nI&#39;m 1 out of 4.  This is after chunking in maximum training points for my <br/>\nlevel.  I&#39;m still rated &quot;very bad&quot; for my research skill. :P<br/>\n<br/>\n--Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n21 HE Wiz Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
