I believe the level of this<br/>\ncap is 6 levels above the caster.  I think its great to stick together on a<br/>\npetition, and I feel that this is one issue that needs to be addressed.  Here are<br/>\nmy two prposed solutions.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Raise the cap to 9+ levels of the caster<br/>\n2) make the cap 6+ levels of the highest player in the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nMalkin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
