Unrest was a<br/>\nwaste because of the overcrowding of mega-level characters, and the really<br/>\nbig bad assed things that would come along, totally resist all my spells as<br/>\nmy comrades were running for the exit and I did the shadowstep/gate dance.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrushbone seems to be right up my alley. I&#39;m in Kaladim right now, how do I<br/>\nget there?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZalbar<br/>\n14th Wizard<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, if I was you, I know a great place to power level, but it&#39;s Kerra Isle<br/>\nbetween Queynos and Erudin. Just sit by the shipwreck and take on the zombie<br/>\nsailors. I rocketed through 11-13 with them. However, you&#39;ll need to flesh<br/>\nout your group some to do this, because the initial wave is 3. If you delay<br/>\nlooting corpses you can then take them on 1 at a time or 2 at a time. The<br/>\nplace also spawns 3 wisps, and because you can lap the island in under 2<br/>\nminutes, they&#39;re readily found. Good cash, and great xps at 10-11th level.<br/>\nAs well, not a lot of people go there. Well, that&#39;s my experience.<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jan Sterken &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsterken@...\">jsterken@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: 22 avril, 1999 16:39<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] LVL10<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Jan Sterken&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsterken@...\">jsterken@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I play a High Elf Wizard.
