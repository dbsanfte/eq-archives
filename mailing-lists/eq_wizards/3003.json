That&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;not a competition one &quot;wins&quot;. You do not get brownie points by being<br/>\n&gt;able to take a mob N levels above your normal and expected target, except<br/>\n&gt;if you are in a race to level. EQ is not a race. I laugh at people that<br/>\n&gt;strut and show off their rubicite and barbed leather whip at level 3, as<br/>\n&gt;if that was somehow an &quot;achivement&quot;. It may be, for you. Not for me,<br/>\n&gt;and there&#39;s no &quot;objective&quot; (within the game context) measure that says so.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There are three kind of imbalances that &quot;require&quot; correction:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;An imbalance that prevents you from adventuring and getting in a group<br/>\n&gt;(&quot;we can&#39;t solo&quot; is not an imbalance; EQ&#39;s target is groups, not solo)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;An imbalanbce that prevents you from leveling and getting in a rgoup<br/>\n&gt;with people you want to group with.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;An imbalance that make a class so unplayable or so easy that people<br/>\n&gt;will avoid that class or rush to that class.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The whole twinking issue does not really fall into these categories. It<br/>\n&gt;might, marginally, be relevant to 2; if you begin a twinked wizard in<br/>\n&gt;order to level with a twinked warrior friend, you&#39;d level slower...<br/>\n&gt;if you both solo of course.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; are realy dont help any discusion and your tone is realy arogant.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Again, I apologise, but after a while, one gets tired of the &quot;grass is<br/>\n&gt;greener on the other side&quot; recurring arguments. Here, and in other<br/>\n&gt;classes lists.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The twink problem is a non-problem. Or would you expect a warrior to<br/>\n&gt;require as few equipment, compared to a wizard of the same level, to<br/>\n&gt;achieve the same efficiency? After all, the warrior does not have to<br/>\n&gt;spend all that plat on our spells (and us wizards get off lightly in<br/>\n&gt;that domain, compared to some other casting classes). Where else do<br/>\n&gt;you expect him to spend plat.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The only difference is, we cannot twink a wizard with our previously<br/>\n&gt;known spells.
