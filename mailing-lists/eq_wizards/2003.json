Especially<br/>\nCasters.  I have Frost Shock as my second spell I use because I dont have to<br/>\nwait for it to recharge.  I do not understand why people are complaining<br/>\nabout the resisting factor because I only resist maybe and I say maybe 1 out<br/>\n10 mobs.  If I resist it once I use Frost 2 or 3 times then hit it again<br/>\nwith Force and Boom its dead.  As far as Enstill I have less resists to it<br/>\nthen I do to Root so I use it more than anything.  And as far as duration I<br/>\nhardly ever have a problem with that, I have on several occassions Enstilled<br/>\na mob, then ran out of mana and sat down to meditate for one last shot or<br/>\neven 2 shots and the mob is still sitting there looking stupid.  I have had<br/>\nnumerous occassion had someoen come by and ask if I needed help to kill the<br/>\nmob since I was sitting right in front of it and I state &quot;No, hes just being<br/>\na good boy and staying where he was told.  I&#39;ll deal with him in a bit.&quot;  I<br/>\nactually have that saying in one of my hotbox keys now ).<br/>\n<br/>\nShadair J&#39;Axx<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Tom Bratina &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gbratina@...\">gbratina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 27, 1999 6:09 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_wizards] Lets Agree to Disagree..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Tom Bratina&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gbratina@...\">gbratina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; yeah. how embarrassing is it to have to tell ur group that we cant fight<br/>\n&gt; reds because our spells wont work???  that should be top priority on<br/>\n&gt; anything we send to verant.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; side note: if anybody reading this has made it to lvl 24 and used frost<br/>\n&gt; shock, please let me (or us) know if the resists for this spell are just<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; bad as force shock and enstill.  I must say that force shock and enstill<br/>\nare<br/>\n&gt; the only two spells i use regularly on blues and greens that get resisted<br/>\n&gt; regularly (this is seperate from the resists we get on reds which is<br/>\nanother<br/>\n&gt; issue altogether).  so maybe it&#39;s not a resist issue, but more of a crappy<br/>\n&gt; spell issue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; a funny note: i was in guk with a lvl 22 shadowknight last week, and i was<br/>\n&gt; complaining about force shock getting resisted (yeah, he was about sick of<br/>\n&gt; my ranting but i had to rant to somebody).  well, we got tired of the<br/>\n&gt; froglock tad in the entrance (lvl 3ish i guess) that was healing the<br/>\n&gt; monsters we were pulling, so we decided to end his healing expedition.<br/>\n&gt; after we hit him once he started to run and the sk cast a spell on the<br/>\n&gt; tad....  low and behold, THE TAD RESISTED.  yes, a lvl 3ish tad resisted a<br/>\n&gt; lvl 22 sk spell.  hahaha. im sure u dont have to guess who was complaining<br/>\n&gt; about resists the rest of the evening (believe me, i didnt say a word<br/>\nafter<br/>\n&gt; that little incident)!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; maybe we dont have it so bad after all ????<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sinlaru Ce`alen<br/>\n&gt; Rallos Zek<br/>\n&gt;     -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;     From: Mike Hoida &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mhoida@...\">mhoida@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Date: Thursday, May 27, 1999 3:05 PM<br/>\n&gt;     Subject: Re: [eq_wizards] Lets Agree to Disagree..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     that sounds good,  but I think we need to bring up the resist spells<br/>\n&gt; bug,  in a small party to medium party, there is no problem,  but in a<br/>\nparty<br/>\n&gt; of 6, you take on high red mob&#39;s,  and all the other class can contribute<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; the party in some way even if there spells can not effect the mob,  but<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; wizard class is left standing there with nothing to help out the party.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Edywen<br/>\n&gt;     Xegony<br/>\n&gt;         ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;         From: Ken Morrison<br/>\n&gt;         To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;         Sent: Thursday, May 27, 1999 12:58 PM<br/>\n&gt;         Subject: [eq_wizards] Lets Agree to Disagree..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Okay, before the Verant text thing, I posted that we should and<br/>\ntry<br/>\n&gt; to get one (1) thing changed.  Then people posted they wanted a ton of<br/>\nstuff<br/>\n&gt; to change.  Then I posted a ton of stuff and now they are saying post only<br/>\n&gt; a couple of things....rrrr.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Actually, we sound just like a bunch of bickering Wizards, heh, I<br/>\n&gt; can just picture us all in a dimly lit lecturing hall, trying to figure<br/>\nout<br/>\n&gt; how to best approach the Master Wizard and tell him his spells suck, while<br/>\n&gt; trying to second guess which way he will turn us into ash after we do. =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Anyway, if we cant come together here, lets at least start sending<br/>\n&gt; Verant SOMETHING.  Seran is right, I just read on eq.stratics.com that<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; are working on Specialization and it should be implemented in a couple of<br/>\n&gt; weeks.  So no use bugging them for that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         If we are only going for a couple of things I would go for :<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Meditate Skill cap of 7 rather than 5 - reason:  Hey, come on,<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; took away 2 points from our combat abilities, at least they could give it<br/>\n&gt; back to us for mana, right?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Line of Sight Fade and Shadowstep spells with set minimum<br/>\n&gt; distances - reason: Well, I came up with it originally (ahem, blush) and<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; would serve a dual purpose of being a good escape spell and help with<br/>\nlower<br/>\n&gt; level travel, both of which are things we Wizards could desperately use.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Now, what do you all think...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Alhassim, 12th(yeah!)
