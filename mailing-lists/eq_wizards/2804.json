The Wisps are a gold mine (they<br/>\nhave a random amount of cash on them, up to 3g once, and carry<br/>\nlightstones ~1pp and greater lightstones ~4pp at times). But the Kerran<br/>\nwisps range from level 10 to 12, and can only be hit by magic weapons.<br/>\nGet a mage to summon you a dagger before hunting.<br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise, it IS a perfect spot. I spent 6 hours of playtime at level 13<br/>\nthere, and made it to level 14, with 45pp in bank. I know a friend who<br/>\nstayed<br/>\nthere for level 14, when about 1/3 of the wisps became green, and he left<br/>\nat level 15 with over 100pp in bank.<br/>\n<br/>\nUp to three players, you can set a good rotation on the main wisp spawn<br/>\npoint (cycle of 4 wisps). Don&#39;t camp the 2nd point, if you can find it<br/>\n(spawns 1 wisp during the same cycle). But it&#39;s a boring activity.<br/>\nOnce, I had the entire zone for me. I couldn&#39;t even kill wisps fast enough<br/>\nand I died once when I got three of them (deep blue &quot;risky&quot;) on me.<br/>\n<br/>\nBring a cleric and a good party with you and you can hunt the zombie sailors<br/>\n(weapons).<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that I doubt the Kerran will regard you amiably, however :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nGET WHAT YOU DESERVE!
