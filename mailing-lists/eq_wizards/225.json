Here&#39;s<br/>\na brief example.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was lvl 19, a group of us went after LockJaw, a NPC crocodile in<br/>\nOasis.  LockJaw is a 23rd or 24th lvl monster.  At lvl 19, he resisted ALL<br/>\nof my spells!!!  Out of a party of 5, 3 of us couldn&#39;t do any dmg with our<br/>\nspells, needless to say, when the fighters heard us all shout &quot;He&#39;s<br/>\nResisting&quot;  they were saying &quot;Oh crap!!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, while I don&#39;t see why your group couldn&#39;t be a great success, keep to<br/>\nthe monsters that are only a couple lvls higher than you.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalarin, High Elven Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Ken Lee &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kenlee@...\">kenlee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, April 19, 1999 2:19 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] 836pts of damage in under 10 secs from a 14th wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Ken Lee&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kenlee@...\">kenlee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     PCs can&#39;t interrupt monster spells. Well, not that I&#39;ve ever seen. If<br/>\n&gt; someone can refute this, then let me know. So I&#39;m not sure if your ROOT<br/>\n&gt; example is really a good one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, while on the subject of killing things, I thought of something that<br/>\nI&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; like to try.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d like to form a 6 player all wizard party. I&#39;m on the Solusek Ro<br/>\nserver,<br/>\n&gt; 14th Wizard, would like to have about the same level.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Verant, and everyone is always saying that you need to mix classes to<br/>\nlevel<br/>\n&gt; and go up the fastest. Here&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Form group.<br/>\n&gt; Everyone target same large honking creature.<br/>\n&gt; One person shouts &quot; NUKE! &quot;<br/>\n&gt; Everyone clicks on shock of lightning<br/>\n&gt; BLAM<br/>\n&gt; 456 pts of dmg.<br/>\n&gt; 1 Shot.<br/>\n&gt; 1 Kill<br/>\n&gt; Thank you for shopping at Wizzie mart.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Even if it&#39;s still alive and not running away, next volley should be for<br/>\nan<br/>\n&gt; additional 380pts<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (assuming that 1 person is attacked and spell is interrupted).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; End result after 2 rnds: 836 pts of damage in I figure about less than 10<br/>\n&gt; seconds. A Hill giant takes longer than that to kill me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;l stand in front of ANYTHING for 10 seconds. With bind abilities, the<br/>\n&gt; entire group is pretty safe for escaping, you don&#39;t have to go far if you<br/>\nDO<br/>\n&gt; die, which is highly unlikely.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How fast do you think this kind of group is gonna level taking out things<br/>\n&gt; like griffawns, griffons, etc...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Only problem I can see is some things have a big magic resistance. I was<br/>\n&gt; with a 15th barbarian in North Karanas, and we were feeling brawny. He<br/>\n&gt; wailed on a Scythe beetle and brought it back to me and another 13th<br/>\nwizard.<br/>\n&gt; My shock of lightning was only doing 30-35 pts of dmg. The 13th wizard did<br/>\n&gt; 0, nil, zip, zero pts. of dmg.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyone wanna try out my idea, and you&#39;re on Solusek Ro let me know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Zalbar<br/>\n&gt; 14th Wizard<br/>\n&gt; Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Crowder, David &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DCrowder@...\">DCrowder@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: 19 avril, 1999 13:41<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eq_wizards] Lets solve the root debate<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Crowder, David&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DCrowder@...\">DCrowder@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Here  lets solve the root debate:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Goto the cauldron (a zone off of BB mtns),  and poke an aqua goblin<br/>\nshaman,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;if you are under lvl 13  he will root you and bash you like crazy.
