Hell, their creatures <br/>\ncan even cast now!  Clerics can heal party members, as can Rangers, Druids, <br/>\nand Shamen. All we can do is cast O&#39;Keil&#39;s radiation on a tank for a paltry <br/>\n2 points per melee hit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">                &gt;You can cause damage to mobs that are not more than 5 levels <br/>\n </span></blockquote>higher than<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">                &gt;you, it&#39;s very simple.

In a well-balanced party of melee, healers and <br/>\ncasters, wizards are the least useful in this situation if they&#39;re a couple <br/>\nlevels lower than the main tank ppl. And against &quot;medium&quot; or &quot;low&quot; reds, <br/>\nyeah I love burning a bubble of mana on a creature and only do a 15% of the <br/>\ndamage it should, when it is not completely resisted. This means more <br/>\ndowntime for the wiz and embarassment because your spells suddenly suck. <br/>\nWorse-case, the mobs get irritated that you&#39;re even TRYING to shoot them, <br/>\nand you die very, very quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">                &gt;&gt; I&#39;ve watched every group I&#39;ve run with pass me up in <br/>\n </span></blockquote>level.

Appreciate your diplomacy. <br/>\nI&#39;ve followed the teachings of Zaeq, North Karana beetle-kiter <br/>\nextraordinare. What ends up happening is I run to the beetle, hit it, get it <br/>\ndown, then some damned animal jumps me and I have to zone.  There&#39;s no place <br/>\nelse I can solo in the queynos/karana area that&#39;s not overly camped. Even <br/>\nwisps give me little exp anymore, many con green at 15th.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">                &gt;Your anecdotal case is not viable as an argument as to the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wizard&#39;s<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">                &gt;capabilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve refuted every point but the last, so far.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">                &gt;&gt; Needless to say, I&#39;m very frustrated in playing this class <br/>\n </span></blockquote>right now.

No. Now that you mention it, they&#39;ve promised it since <br/>\nretail release, nothing has come of it so far.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">                &gt;--<br/>\n               &gt;Qenelin<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As an update: I finally got sick of my wizard after reaching 15th 3 times in <br/>\n6 hours of play, and having extraordinary bad luck at every turn. I&#39;ve <br/>\nexamined the amount of time I&#39;ve invested in playing, sometimes at the <br/>\nexpense of fresh air, exercise and a social life out &quot;in the world&quot;. It&#39;s a <br/>\nlot of time, 8 days total. While I&#39;ve made some friends in the game, and <br/>\nseen some interesting sights, I don&#39;t think a wizard suits my play style (my <br/>\n20th level name would have been &quot;The Suicidal&quot; as when in group I like to <br/>\nmelee a little). I have given all my worldly possessions to &quot;Clarkie&quot;, a 2nd <br/>\nlevel Erudite wiz at Queynos. Please don&#39;t harass him for his good fortune <br/>\nas my successor. I&#39;ll be unsubbing from this list after a couple of days. I <br/>\nwish everyone luck in their endeavors, and hope your petition to Verant is <br/>\nmet with success.<br/>\n<br/>\nSafe journey,<br/>\n<br/>\nVash, 15th level wizardess, Felwithe/Queynos, E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
