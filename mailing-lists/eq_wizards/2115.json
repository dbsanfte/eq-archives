It does<br/>\nNOT stun the opponent as most of the spell listing sites have indicated (and<br/>\nas some ppl have assumed here). It will knock the opponent back a step or<br/>\ntwo, but there is NO stun involved (yes, I was disappointed when I got force<br/>\nshock and found that there was no stun).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSPOILER-SPOILER-SPOILER<br/>\nThere is a lvl 20 spell that we get that does stun your opponent though. It<br/>\nis Tishan&#39;s Clash. It will stun your opponent for about 2 seconds (much like<br/>\na skel might stun you), and does approx. 30dmg.  The recover time for it is<br/>\nabout the same as force shock, so you cannot cast it several times in<br/>\nsuccession if you were hoping to keep the opponent stunned. The mana cost on<br/>\nit is very high though, so I don&#39;t really see a valid use for it (if the<br/>\nstun time were longer, it would be a nice spell, but 2 seconds just isn&#39;t<br/>\nlong enough).<br/>\n<br/>\nSinlaru Ce`alen<br/>\nRallos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
