I was 15th<br/>\nlevel and it conned blue to me.  I couldnt figure out why it regarded me<br/>\nindifferently then attack me with disease clouds.  I did nothing agressive<br/>\nto it...just walked by it.  Anyway, i never killed it but saw it at the zone<br/>\nentrance from karana.<br/>\n<br/>\nIll look again for him...this time I will have no mercy for him!<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Lim Dul [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sevendegrees@...\">sevendegrees@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, May 05, 1999 5:18 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] other goodies? **possible spoiler**<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Lim Dul&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sevendegrees@...\">sevendegrees@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen some high-leveled Wizards carry this item in their secondary....it<br/>\n<br/>\nlooks like a little voodoo doll.
