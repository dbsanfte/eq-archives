He wasnt able to get<br/>\n&gt; the name of this npc though. Does anyone know the name of this npc so<br/>\n&gt; I can steer clear of him. I need to go to Akanon to get my lightning<br/>\n&gt; spell soon.    Another question. Has anyone had sucsess in getting a<br/>\n&gt; black robe from neriak by having  friend get it and then giving<br/>\n&gt; consent to loot his corpse? This was discussed here a while ago and<br/>\n&gt; was wondering if it was indeed possible to do. If robes cannot be<br/>\n&gt; traded and/or sold (even ones from najena or the thatamurgist) this<br/>\n&gt; seems like a serious bug since these robes are valuable to us casters<br/>\n&gt; but not to others and they would likely want to sell them if<br/>\n&gt; they(non-casters) got those robes. Any thoughts? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
