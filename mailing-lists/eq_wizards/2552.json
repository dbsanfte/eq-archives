I go yto meet them and see them fighting a(n)  orc warrior.  It conned red to me in any case.  I watched as the fight procedded.  The group was s;owly hacking it down but it was deaking out some serious damge to them too.  i started putting O&#39;Keel&#39;s Radiation on the tanks, to help out a little.  i wasn&#39;t in the Groups so I didn&#39;t want to do any damage to the orc directly myself.  fianaly it broke and started to run off.  Being a nice guy, I tried to root it two times and was resisted both times.  Seeing that it had less than 1/3 health, I hit it with a Shock of Lightening. (I was lvl 15 then)  The spell normally does 81 points at my level.  I hit for 66 points and it died.  then to my utter shock, I see that I got the exp.  Well needless to say my new friends were not happy.  i finally got them to understand it was an accident, i never dreamed it would give me the kill for just one hit.   For the first time, in all the time I have been playing the game, I fully understand why our class can become so hated and mistrusted.   I don&#39;t understand how my one hit of only 66 points could give me the kill and the exp, and it just didn&#39;t seem right to me.  I will try to be much more carefull in the future.  It seems I get into more trouble than it&#39;s worth sometimes when I try to help others out.  Oh well, it&#39;s what makes me keep coming backl for more I guess.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
