So I don&#92;&#39;t see how the plan to take it from<br/>\n\r<br/>\na dark elf would work.   Just my two cents.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAlso as a newbie to the 8th level, should I get shock of ice or firebolt? I am \r<br/>\nam broke and saving to buy my first new spell. I actually have had luck with \r<br/>\nparties and explain my role so they understand. Buffing the warriors with \r<br/>\nOkeils, does make them apprieciative too.  Most like the fact that monsters get \r<br/>\nhurt when hitting them, fits right into the warrior ego/mentality of hurt, \r<br/>\ncrush, bash, cut. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHey, I love the one line remarks but could you maybe just trim all the quote \r<br/>\ncrap out except the last message you are one lining, I recently switched to the \r<br/>\ndigest version and 90% of that message is quoted spam and headers.  Oh well it \r<br/>\nis better than trying to read 110 messages, when only halfway through the first \r<br/>\nyou get 10 more. I really didn&#92;&#39;t care but took to long to read that way, easier<br/>\n\r<br/>\nin digest (after all I need to read these quick so I can play more EQ). I am on \r<br/>\n4 other EQ lists too :P still can&#92;&#39;t get enough. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAnyway I am off on another journey. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nZakrul The Traveler\r<br/>\nCompanion\r<br/>\nBristlebane <br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------<br/>\nThis mail sent through IMP: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://web.horde.org/imp/\">http://web.horde.org/imp/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
