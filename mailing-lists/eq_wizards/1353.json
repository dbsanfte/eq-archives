I group because I<br/>\nmust to get what I need to advance my skill. I will help people I meet along<br/>\nthe way, race is not an issue if it advances my knowledge. My goal as a<br/>\ncharacter is to learn all there is to learn, Knowledge is Power and Power is<br/>\nGood.<br/>\n<br/>\nAljernon, Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ziffnab MageStorm [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_ziffnab@...\">eq_ziffnab@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, May 14, 1999 11:26 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_wizards] Ice Comet<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Ziffnab MageStorm &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_ziffnab@...\">eq_ziffnab@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWizards, by trade alone, are a selfish group.  Now before you rant and<br/>\nflame me...hear me out.  I am a 19th wizard.  From our early lives we<br/>\nstudy magic, alone in arcane colleges.  We concentrate on being our<br/>\nbest, to better our mind and intelligence.  This means little time for<br/>\nsocialization (at most arcane arts schools).  So yes, we do not<br/>\nconcentrate on buffering other players, we concentrate on causing as<br/>\nmuch damage in as little time as possible.  This leaves only us to<br/>\nthink about in the way of shielding.<br/>\n<br/>\n(roleplay the thoughts folks...its easy...)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy school was a serious school and one which I enjoyed my time at,<br/>\nhowever I enjoyed flirting with the other students and frequently dated<br/>\nthe young lady clerics in the guild across the street and partaking in<br/>\ngood elven wines and ale.  I am much older now (145 years old) and<br/>\nstill am looking at by the high elven wizards as somewhat of an outcast<br/>\nby their standards...but they never question my power and skill.  Maybe<br/>\nthey are just jealous.  Good looks (yeah a little gray hair, but for<br/>\n145, close to middle age for me, that nnot bad), powerful magic...i do<br/>\nok.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I am sort of a Rogue Wizard.  I never liked their rules and<br/>\nstrict policy.  I decided to make my own policy and rules which led to<br/>\nmy dismissal from the school early in my education of arcane arts.  A<br/>\nwizard hermit in the area of felwithe approached me and offered to<br/>\ntrain me.  He said I reminded him of himself when he was young.  This<br/>\nold mage turned out to be my father whom I thought killed by Emperor<br/>\nCrush, long ago.  He trained me well and polished my skills and told me<br/>\nof my true lineage in the &quot;MageStorm&quot; family.<br/>\n<br/>\n* that brings us up to now.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Ziffnab Magestorm, Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Simon Hinshelwood &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:iktome@...\">iktome@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Simon Hinshelwood &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:iktome@...\">iktome@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dear Ken,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Firstly, I agree with the root duration indicator,<br/>\n&gt; that relly would save<br/>\n&gt; a lot of our fellow wizards life.
