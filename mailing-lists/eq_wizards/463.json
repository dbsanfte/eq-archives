Never solo anything higher than blue, or else","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1808226963\">Soloing is very hard at you lvl.  If you do, root right away, stand back and<br/>\nhope you have enough mana kill it.  Never solo anything higher than blue, or<br/>\nelse it will be instant death.  In a group, stand way back, as far as you<br/>\ncan and still be in range to cast spells, this limits the creatures desire<br/>\nto stop attacking the tanks and go after you.  Also, be patient, let the<br/>\ntanks do the work.  You have the potential to make battles go much much<br/>\nfaster by throwing everything you have at the creature, but in doing so you<br/>\ndo more dmg than the tanks and make the creature attack you.  When a fight<br/>\nstarts, stand back, let the tanks get some hits in, then throw a spell or<br/>\ntwo at the creature then wait so more. When the creature is close enough<br/>\nthat you can kill it with a spell, cast it, and kill it.  Doing this should<br/>\nkeep the creatures attention focussed on the tanks and not you.  But make<br/>\nsure you always watch the health meters of your tanks, if someone looks like<br/>\nthey may be in trouble let loose and nuke.  Also try and finish a battle<br/>\nbefore the tanks have lost too much health, otherwise you will have to wait<br/>\nan infuriatingly long time for them to regen hp&#39;s.  (This isn&#39;t as bad if<br/>\nthere is a cleric in the party)  That&#39;s basically all you can, get used to<br/>\nit.. when you hit 12th and your spells get more powerful the creatures will<br/>\nturn your way even quicker.  Btw: do you have a full set of armour yet?  If<br/>\nnot go out and buy whatever you don&#39;t have right now.  Even crappy cloth<br/>\narmour makes an amazing difference when it comes to keeping you alive.<br/>\nWell, that&#39;s all the advise I can offer, hope it helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nTandayen, Dark Elf Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jan Sterken &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsterken@...\">jsterken@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Thursday, April 22, 1999 4:36 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] LVL10<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Jan Sterken&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsterken@...\">jsterken@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I play a High Elf Wizard.
