At the levels you should have the Tarton Wheel Staff, you should rarely, if ever, go in melee. And if you do, that s because you have two or three tanks","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-897708720\">According to Alan Charity:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Yes a +10 INT staff is fine but its 10/100 so unless I get an enchanter to<br/>\n&gt; cast haste on me its not much use in combat. I currently have a Writhing<br/>\n&gt; Staff and would only use a Tarton Staff if I needed the extra Mana.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>At the levels you should have the Tarton Wheel Staff, you should rarely,<br/>\nif ever, go in melee. And if you do, that&#39;s because you have two or three<br/>\ntanks bashing a creature into pulp, and the damage from any staff a caster<br/>\nwield will be negligible.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreat the staff as a kind of book of silver runes. It&#39;s in your main hand,<br/>\nbut does not serve as a combat.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also the groups I&#39;ve been in lately in Cazic and Mistmoore do not require<br/>\n&gt; that I expend large amounts of mana. Most groups consisted of a Cleric,<br/>\n&gt; Enchanter, Shaman and 2 tanks. Also most if not all of my spells were<br/>\n&gt; resisted by the Red MOBs they were pulling. I spend most of my time casting<br/>\n&gt; some low damage spells that don&#39;t get resisted, try to get a root to hold<br/>\n&gt; and take a few whacks with my staff.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Then you are not employed efficiently. That&#39;s bad. I understand the lure of<br/>\npulling red mobs for quick burst of experience, but I still think that a<br/>\nsteady stream of blues/light yellows can bring in as much experience as the<br/>\nsingle red, followed by a longer pause, and is a lot safer.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you join people pulling reds, be sure you are at the top of the<br/>\nexperience range. But, if they are willing to have you along for the ride...<br/>\nwhy not :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The Enchanter we had in our group saved the lives of the party more times<br/>\n&gt; than I can remember. We&#39;d pull too many or get sideswiped by a train and<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Never underestimate an enchanter. I&#39;ve been grouping with an enchanter<br/>\nthat routinely &quot;play with the food&quot; (as he says), and the enchanter makes or<br/>\nbreak the group. One group I&#39;ve seen has a shaman, druid and enchanter (plus<br/>\nme as wizard). No tank. Why use tanks, where you root all mobs on the spot,<br/>\nthen play the DOT/DD song before they can break it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, we&#39;re not hunting deep reds. But the short duration of a root doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmatter then.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
