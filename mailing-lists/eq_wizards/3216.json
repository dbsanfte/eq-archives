Most people did not<br/>\nknow about cubert (neither did I) and the most common way to get them<br/>\nwas camp the gnoll high shamans in Lake Rathe. So, anyway, I never<br/>\ncamped mine. I bought mine for cheap somewhere in my teens (trade was<br/>\nchaotic and uneven back then. Ahh the good days) and I sold them for<br/>\n100pp one and for 175, I think, the other. People had no idea what they<br/>\nare worth and how to get them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nSergey</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
