But its not so bad as long as your groups are doing fine.<br/>\n&gt; Just join up and sit there to gain Xp and Loot. no danger since u don&#39;t hit the<br/>\n&gt; mob, so it won&#39;t come after u.  Just cast it once at start of fight to see if<br/>\n&gt; its resisted. and then start on the Radiation.  I gained a lot Xp and only died<br/>\n&gt; Once from a skeleton monk that killed someone else and then came after me from<br/>\n&gt; behind.   if they ask you why you aren&#39;t helping, just say ur resisted.  or just<br/>\n&gt; cast a few frost shocks to pretend ur helping out :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Then, in the middle of Unrest, you suddendly are ejected from the group.
