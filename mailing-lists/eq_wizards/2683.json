The faction system makes you explore different<br/>\nareas of the game to find ways to improve your faction.  If they just told<br/>\nyou how to improve or destroy your faction with any races then why have it.<br/>\nWhy would a DE be allowed to enter or even buy from venders of Good diety?<br/>\nThe faction system allows for a person to create their own destiny by<br/>\nchoosing which faction they wish to increase and hunting that method out.<br/>\n<br/>\n    In Guk there are two factions of Frogloks, Good and Undead (Ghoul).  At<br/>\nthe begining if you do not harm any Good frogloks and head into Guk and get<br/>\nattacked by a Ghoul froglok, you can run to a good froglok and he will<br/>\nprotect you just like a guard would in your city.  This of course depends on<br/>\nyour starting faction with them.  Without a faction system then you will get<br/>\nattack by everyone of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cps worth.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShadair J&#39;Axx<br/>\n32 Wizard<br/>\nThe Chosen Ones<br/>\nKarana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: Tom Bratina<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, July 07, 1999 12:21 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [eq_wizards] What is the best way to raise faction level with<br/>\nthe Merchants of Felwithe?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  well, i don&#39;t have an answer for u, but i think Verant royally screwed up<br/>\nwith the PC faction system they implemented.  anyway, i say if Verant is<br/>\ngoing to continue with this patsy faction crap, they need to at least post<br/>\nhow u can alter ur faction in a positive manner.  or just totally remove the<br/>\nstupid friggin PC faction system.<br/>\n<br/>\n  just my rant.<br/>\n<br/>\n  sinlaru ce`alen<br/>\n  rallos zek<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: Mike Browne &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mbrowne@...\">mbrowne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Date: Wednesday, July 07, 1999 10:48 AM<br/>\n    Subject: [eq_wizards] What is the best way to raise faction level with<br/>\nthe Merchants of Felwithe?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Hello, fellow Wizards!<br/>\n<br/>\n    Several weeks ago I participated in a guild war and slew a High Elf not<br/>\nknowing that there would be a faction hit as a result. Well, I can no longer<br/>\n purchase or sell items in Felwithe. I&#39;ve tried everything that I know of to<br/>\nimprove my faction standing with the Merchants there, but to no avail. My<br/>\nfaction standing with the guards is &quot;amiable&quot; -- It is with the &quot;Merchants&quot;<br/>\nthat I need a faction adjustment. Does anyone have any ideas? Suggestions?<br/>\nPersonal experience? Would appreciate any and all advice.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Wizzy Lightseeker<br/>\n    L25 Gnome Wizard<br/>\n    Solusek Ro </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
