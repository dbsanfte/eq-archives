I see a few uses for this spell but I am<br/>\ndissapointed.  I would rather have the druid version of ensnare for a single<br/>\nmob.<br/>\n<br/>\nYonder:  This is a BUG!  I talked to a GM about it after I had purchased,<br/>\nscribed, memmed and tested it.  In it&#39;s current form, it is basically Shadow<br/>\nStep for 15 mana.  Yonder is supposed to be a fear spell.  In beta, wizards<br/>\nhad the ability to cast this spell but it has since been removed from our<br/>\nspell list.  The GM told me that 4 spells had been affected and that they<br/>\nhoped to fix the problem without a patch.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really didn&#39;t notice any significant changes in casting time although I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t put this through and scientific tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, I&#39;m disappointed with the &quot;improvements&quot; made to our class, but<br/>\nthen again I was never really unhappy with our class either.<br/>\n<br/>\nEuros Arcane<br/>\nRallos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
