Several weeks ago I participated in a guild war and<br/>\n&gt;      slew a High Elf not knowing that there would be a faction<br/>\n&gt;      hit as a result. Well, I can no longer purchase or sell<br/>\n&gt;      items in Felwithe. I&#39;ve tried everything that I know of to<br/>\n&gt;      improve my faction standing with the Merchants there, but to<br/>\n&gt;      no avail. My faction standing with the guards is &quot;amiable&quot;<br/>\n&gt;      -- It is with the &quot;Merchants&quot; that I need a faction<br/>\n&gt;      adjustment. Does anyone have any ideas? Suggestions?<br/>\n&gt;      Personal experience? Would appreciate any and all<br/>\n&gt;      advice.
