I&#39;ve fought many places with many<br/>\n </span></blockquote>different people and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;here is some of what works and doesn&#39;t work...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As for solo battle tactics the only thing I can say it NOT to be touched by<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the enemy. As<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;soon as they get up to you, it is very difficult to unload your mana on it.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I tend to get<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;as far as I can from the baddie and then cast lighting bolt as my first DD<br/>\n </span></blockquote>spell.  I&#39;ve noticed<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;that a lot of the time Force Shock is reisisted (grumble grumble).  Then it<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is a toss up to enstill<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;them or &quot;nuke&quot; them again. Either way seems to work well and hopefully they<br/>\n </span></blockquote>are dead.  If they<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;do manage to get up to me. I use shock of lightning, even if the baddie<br/>\n </span></blockquote>hits me I usually regain<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;consentration ( If the baddie cons as a blue. Whites and higher hit hard<br/>\n </span></blockquote>enough that you rarely<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;regain consentration).  Also if you are looking for killer exp for soloing<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve found that it the best<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;exp movement on my bar is found in the elements. (Think it over. :-) )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Grouping can be hard for a wizard. There are not many tells, &quot;Looking for a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>wizard for group!&quot;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;ve spent 20 min at a time in Cazic &#39;Thule asking if any group needs a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>wizard. Just about any<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;other class that asks gets a group.  But once in a group things can go<br/>\n </span></blockquote>well.  The main thing I have<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;noticed is when your party pulls something I can cast a DD 83 - 125 damage<br/>\n </span></blockquote>spell and the mob will<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;NOT turn and come to me.  It is always the first thing I do. I&#39;ll usually<br/>\n </span></blockquote>then sit and med the mana back from<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;that blast. As long as you hit the mob from time to time you will be fine.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But if you unload your mana like<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;a crazy manic your party will not beable to get the mob off you even with<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the most furious taunting skills.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;In a place like Cazic &#39;Thule I tend to use my level 12 and 16 spells<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(Execpt for Enstill) to do the damage.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The lizards just seem to resist the higher level spells at the moment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well hope you found this helpful in this sea of crazy info.<br/>\n&gt;Take Care. If you ever want to share some languages look me up on the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mithaniel Marr Server.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Venlaan<br/>\n&gt;21st DE Wizzy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;P.S.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Can anyone verify what I saw in Kedge Keep. I went in there just to go<br/>\n </span></blockquote>there and scope it out. I saw<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;no lvl 31st Sword Fish guarding entrance and inside (though I dared not to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>venture far) I saw no life<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;of any sort.
