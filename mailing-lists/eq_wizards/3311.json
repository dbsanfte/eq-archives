But I have<br/>\na few questions since I have spent no time in Guk in 32 levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nGUK<br/>\n1. I need to know the easiest or quickest path to the hand room?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Is the room on the Live or Dead side?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Will I encounter any Undead frogs along the way?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEVERFROST<br/>\nI know that the rod is surrounded by 3 IBS and that an NPC is in the area. I<br/>\ncan get by the IBS with Invis to Undead but the NPC could be a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Is this NPC within range of the rod?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI will not have a group with me and am only going to attempt this when the<br/>\nHand room is being camped. I may however try a suicide run depending on how<br/>\nbrave I feel.<br/>\n<br/>\nAljernon<br/>\n32nd Level Wizard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
