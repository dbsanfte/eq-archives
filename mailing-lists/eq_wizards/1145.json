I<br/>\nhave found that the old adage about a little honey...  I rarely use<br/>\nO&#39;Kiels Radiation now, but keep it memorized.  I see fighters, I cast it<br/>\non them, and make sure they see me doing it.  I root their kills when<br/>\nthey try to run.  And I get a LOT less complaints about kill-stealing,<br/>\ncause the INSTANT anyone says it &quot;to the room&quot; about how wizards steal<br/>\nkills, I jump on them, and get everyone else to back me that I&#39;ve been a<br/>\ndecent sort.  You will always get the random jerks, but you cant help<br/>\nthat.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly - if you are dying, you would expect a fighter to help a bit. <br/>\nSomeone diseased? Of COURSE the cleric will cure it.  So I figure there<br/>\nis usually dang little us wizards have that can help other players, we<br/>\nshould use all we can.  Make us just a BIT less hated.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI just played today, and it took about a 1/2 hr, but a guy who started<br/>\nranting, by the end was bowing and thanking me cause he realized that<br/>\neven if not grouped, wizards can be a boon to an area.  (saved his life<br/>\na few times, and rooted a few of his runaways, etc)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The only problem with the Root and Shoot strategy is in places like<br/>\n&gt;Crushbone or other open areas as soon as you root something a fighter &gt;or other class will charge the monster and start fighting it. This is &gt;usually not a problem because the damage our spells deliver can easily &gt;outmatch a fighter of similar level.  However the fighter will swear &gt;you stole his kill and you&#39;ll get a 20 min rant about how wizards are &gt;just a bunch of kill stealers.  It use to bother me at first but now a &gt;say what the hell I&#39;m a Wizard.<br/>\n&gt;Aljernon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Micon<br/>\nLevel 16 (just - wohoo!!)<br/>\nKarana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
