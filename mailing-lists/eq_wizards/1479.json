It may seem almost obvious to some but I want to make sure that<br/>\n&gt; everyone knows.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Distance Distance Distance!  If you are in an area in which you have good<br/>\n&gt; sight distance, get to the maximum range that you can cast your spell<br/>\nfrom.<br/>\n&gt; Cast your most powerful spell and then WHILE you are recovering BACK UP<br/>\neven<br/>\n&gt; more and then cast again when recovered.  Using this strategy I can hit<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; 2 shocks of lightning (at level 13, so I am sure it works at level 12<br/>\nalso)<br/>\n&gt; for a total of 158 damage (if they both hit for full damage) BEFORE the<br/>\n&gt; enemy gets to me!  Against blues and sometimes evens, this will be enough<br/>\n&gt; damage so that I can now switch to shock of ice (which casts fast enough<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; use between them hitting me) and finish them off in 2 or 3 castings.  If<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t want the monster in your face, cast root instead of the 2nd DD<br/>\nspell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another strategy that someone posted (should have been obvious but I didnt<br/>\n&gt; think of it) uses the fact that your bolt spells dont actually hit until<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; bolt reaches them (using the distance tactic).  Cast your most powerful<br/>\nbolt<br/>\n&gt; at maximum distance (I haven&#39;t done this but it should work) and while it<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; still on the way you can recover enough to root the enemy, then blast<br/>\naway.<br/>\n&gt; I would change this tact for slightly easier enemies and instead of<br/>\nrooting,<br/>\n&gt; cast your best shock spell and then you might even be able to cast again<br/>\n&gt; before the monster gets to you.  I haven&#39;t played with this bolt tactic<br/>\nyet<br/>\n&gt; so it is all theory.  I will try tonight and let you all know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Solric of the 4th circle<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
