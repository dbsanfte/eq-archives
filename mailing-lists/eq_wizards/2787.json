We were in the Gorge of King Xorbb,<br/>\nand I<br/>\nhad cast it on our puller as he worked his way through the gorge.  He<br/>\nwould<br/>\nclimb up and down on the ridges looking for the minos, and when he<br/>\nclimbed<br/>\nabove me a certain distance, the same thing would happen--the screen<br/>\nwould<br/>\nfreeze.  It looked to me as though he was just sitting there resting,<br/>\nbut<br/>\nhis view was so skewed I asked him what was going on.  As soon as he<br/>\nreturned to my elevation, the sight resumed as normal.  This needs to be<br/>\nsubmitted to Verant.  Perhaps they will fix it as they are going to fix<br/>\nEye<br/>\nof Zomm.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Dominic Franchetti &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DFranchetti@...\">DFranchetti@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, July 21, 1999 9:41 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Bind Sight<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Dominic Franchetti &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DFranchetti@...\">DFranchetti@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I like the Bind Sight spell for the most part but it does have a<br/>\nserious<br/>\n&gt; flaw. Whenever the PC that you are bound to changes their level in<br/>\n&gt; respect to yours it stops working. When I say level I mean physical<br/>\n&gt; orientation in the vertical aspect. The best example I could give is<br/>\n&gt; Unrest. (A great place for higher teens and low 20&#39;s players.) I cast<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; upon our puller so that he can tag and run back without worrying about<br/>\n&gt; communicating back to the group. I see what they pull and tell<br/>\neveryone<br/>\n&gt; to get ready or that the puller is running to zone. It is also really<br/>\n&gt; helpful if the puller gets rooted or stunned. I can go inside with the<br/>\n&gt; rest of the party and help the puller since I know where they are<br/>\nwithin<br/>\n&gt; the house. (I know the house pretty well since I pull with my wizard<br/>\n&gt; when I am paired up with just my cleric friend.) If the puller I have<br/>\n&gt; Bind Sight upon goes upstairs or downstairs the view on my screen<br/>\n&gt; freezes like the character is stuck. This does not only happen within<br/>\n&gt; Unrest. I was in Guk last night and it happened when a cleric I had<br/>\nBind<br/>\n&gt; Sight upon went downstairs to resurrect  a friend of mine. I was going<br/>\n&gt; to tell him directions through the use of Bind Sight but as soon as he<br/>\n&gt; went down the first ramp the Bind Sight broke.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am wondering if anyone else has had problems with this spell?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yinin of Mithanial Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Congratulations SAYNO2DRUGS.
