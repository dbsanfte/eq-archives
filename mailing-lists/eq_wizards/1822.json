From there I went to the Oasis and fought<br/>\n&gt;Caimans, crocks, and Deep Water crocks and Caimans.  Know your limits<br/>\n&gt;people, our class was not meant to jump into a fight and melee the monster,<br/>\n&gt;we were meant to stand back and blast them out of existence.  If you have<br/>\n&gt;not seen on any of the messages before our melee skills are only (lvl +1) *<br/>\n&gt;3 which is quite low for any class.  Maybe this should be a hint to you as<br/>\n&gt;not to try and jump into a fight.  If you are in a group that is fighting<br/>\n&gt;RED mobs and your spells are being resisted then I say you shouldn&#39;t be in<br/>\n&gt;that group to begin with.  Those mobs are 5+ levels above you and your<br/>\n&gt;skills as a WIZARD can not help.  Go back to that spot after a few more<br/>\n&gt;levels and try again, don&#39;t whine that you couldn&#39;t do anything to help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have my share of deaths, and until I found Lake Rathe at Level 19 I was<br/>\n&gt;getting waxed by Sand Giants in Oasis of Marr because people were training<br/>\n&gt;them left and right down the beach for fun.  At Level 24 I am still<br/>\n </span></blockquote>solo-ing<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;most the time I am on in South Karana fighting Centaur Archers or Avaik<br/>\n&gt;Harriers.

Sure I would love to be able to jump in there and melee it.  And<br/>\n&gt;for those times I have to I use O&#39;Kiels Radiation which gives me a little<br/>\n&gt;extra punch to the mob.  I rarely fight White or Yellow mobs unless I am<br/>\n&gt;grouped.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Whining that Veriant did us wrong or that we are weak is not the correct<br/>\n&gt;thing to do.
