That is what attracted me to this <br/>\ngame.  I&#39;m tired of playing Might and Magic and other such RPG&#39;s.  What your <br/>\nsaying is everyone is whinning because they feel useless in a group.  Well <br/>\ngrouping is the whole point to this game.  Second I wanna kill red mobs, it&#39;s <br/>\nmuch more satisfying killing something such higher level than your group.  <br/>\nNow no one wants a wizard because they know you&#39;re useless when it comes to <br/>\nmobs 5 or 6 levels ahead of you.  Your point about coming back later when <br/>\nyour higher level is just stupid.  If all other classes can group and kill a <br/>\nred mob why can&#39;t you?  The wizard is left in the cold.  I don&#39;t think either <br/>\nthat anyone wants to jump right in and melee, I sure as hell don&#39;t.  But i <br/>\nwant to be effective in a group with my spells, that&#39;s all I want.  Sorry if <br/>\nI sound like an ass but it pisses me off when people are so satisfied with <br/>\nour class when you see all the other classes get improvements.  I would love <br/>\nto start a petition to make our class better if everyone is for it!<br/>\n<br/>\nParthon lvl 12 Erudite</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
