On that note, for some of the younger wizards,<br/>\nyou&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; find a percieved hatred of our class in certain areas...notoriously<br/>\nbecause<br/>\n&gt; of our abilities to strike from afar, and more likely because you are<br/>\n&gt; playing with others who are ignorant of class balance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Places that are sometimes hostile to Wizards include BlackBurrow around<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; Queynos area, and Crushbone over near Felwithe.  I would say those in BB<br/>\n&gt; were more hostile to our class...more sensitive to issues about steal<br/>\nkills<br/>\n&gt; and such.  Of course, there ARE those wizards I have seen that have used<br/>\n&gt; their powers to exploit others and place shame on our class.  I&#39;d like to<br/>\n&gt; name names...but.......nah.  :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Once I hit 16...it was amazing how many groups start looking favorable to<br/>\n&gt; our class.  Start looking in areas such as Highhold Pass and Unrest...<br/>\n&gt; people are always ready to allow a Wizard in the group.  So don&#39;t dispair<br/>\n&gt; folks...the wait isn&#39;t THAT long. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n&gt; 18 Wizard Veeshan<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
