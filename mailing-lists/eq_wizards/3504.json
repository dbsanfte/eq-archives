Thanks for any hints.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kronan, Level 47 wiz on Innoruuk<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This quest can be easily completed anywhere from level 16 on up.  But I<br/>\nwould personally wait till about 29th.  Reasons are as follows.<br/>\nUntill you reach the 30.  Mana plus items are much more valuable to a<br/>\ncaster than int items.   At level 25 each extra int point gives you 5 mana.<br/>\nOk sure the staff gives 10 int plus other stuff, but it sucks for a weapon.<br/>\n Prior to the 30, your combat still sucks, but your offense and defense<br/>\nskills probably haven&#39;t caped yet.  Its important to get in melee and get<br/>\nbeat on a bit so you have that Defense skill caped asap.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn to the quest.<br/>\nInvis will get you through 90% of this quest.  You may need someone to cast<br/>\nenduring breath on you for some locations.  The rod in neriak is not one<br/>\nsuch place.  Just using invis will work here.<br/>\nThe only rod that requires more than invis is the rod from Lower Guk hand<br/>\nroom.  Personally I am on a quite crouded server, if you are as well,<br/>\nsimply go to lower guk on a weekend night when the zone is packed.  Have<br/>\nsomeone invis you to undead at the zone and then make your way to the hand<br/>\nroom where the rod is located.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts an easy quest overall, just time consuming.<br/>\nOnce I hit 49th (5.5 more bubbles, woo hoo) I&#39;ll probably end up either<br/>\nbuying the IC spell from another player. (Someone already tried to sell it<br/>\nto me for 500plat.) That or I will hit the planes, which are where your<br/>\nmost likely to find the rune of the astral.  Ive found frost runes on high<br/>\nlevel mobs in the non planar areas of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack, Knight Defender of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
