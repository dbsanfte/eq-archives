I cannot seem to locate them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk that is my cynical reply :).  I can actually say that I found a use for<br/>\nthese (other can increasing your divination skill for when you get<br/>\ninvis--hehe).  I have at times used these spells to get a closer loot at<br/>\nbandit camps and such to better see how many enemies are present (and who<br/>\nhas weapons?), but in general these spells are not worth keeping memorized.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish that these spells were more a little more useful, but the amount of<br/>\nmagnification that you get from glimpse and gaze (its the same spell only<br/>\ngaze lasts longer and you can cast it on others) is just not very useful.<br/>\nIf they perhaps doubled the magnification that you had with it, it could be<br/>\nuseful (scanning the horizon for hill giants maybe?).<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, I would really like to see some more vision spells with<br/>\nmore uses.  Perhaps a night vision spell that gives us better low light<br/>\nvision (perhaps similar to ultravision that the dark elves get).  Heat sight<br/>\nis nice but only useful for humans and erudites.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone got some ideas for cool and useful vision based spells?  Perhaps make<br/>\nit so that if a monster attacks your eye of zomm, it at least won&#39;t then<br/>\ncome after you?  I mean come on that really makes no sense.  You are a<br/>\nmonster and see this little eye moving around.  You decide to whack it cause<br/>\nit&#39;s annoying you, and somehow you immediately know that the little elf 2<br/>\nmiles away casted it?  Things like this make spells like eye of zomm<br/>\ncompletely useless.  Anyway..  I don&#39;t really know what my point is, maybe<br/>\nthat we need to get rid of useless spells or have them improved.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Solric<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________<br/>\nMichael D.
