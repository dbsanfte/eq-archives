Soloing being much slower.  I have played around 9 or <br/>\n10 days real time on my main character and am now level 16.  I could have <br/>\nbeen much higher by now had I grouped a lot more than what I have.  I have <br/>\nwasted time just puttering along myself.  But my main focus isn&#39;t on <br/>\nleveling...although when I get close I sure like to be bumped to get new <br/>\nspells.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 04:15 PM 6/7/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Phil Showalter&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:phil@...\">phil@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: James Dwyer [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdwar@...\">jdwar@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Monday, June 07, 1999 11:13 AM<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eq_wizards] which spellcasting class to be?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: James Dwyer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdwar@...\">jdwar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;To his defense, I am level 20 now and also disillusioned with the wizard<br/>\n&gt; &gt;class.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(snip)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Of course hindsight is 20/20 but I&#39;ve invested over 6 realtime<br/>\n&gt; &gt;days into my wizard and am too stubborn to give up on him. The spells of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the wizard are very limited. Sure we can do the most damage in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;shortest amount of time, but it&#39;s not THAT much more. But other than<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that, we can teleport like the druid, and that&#39;s all!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This is incredible to me..... I just turned lvl 13 and my played time is 9<br/>\n&gt;days and 12 hours.
