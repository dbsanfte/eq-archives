Group - Cast invisibility on everyone in your group with the exception of you and 1 other who","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1390039004\">Couple of ways to gate into Cazic both with a group and solo....<br/>\n<br/>\nGroup - Cast invisibility on everyone in your group with the exception of<br/>\nyou and 1 other who can invis(Enchanter, Magician, Shaman, so on). Have the<br/>\nother person target you and begin casting invis. After he starts his cast,<br/>\nyou start your portal. He will invis you and have plenty of time to invis<br/>\nhimself before your portal goes off(and you only become visible at the start<br/>\nof the cast, not at the end so you are safe). This works because of how long<br/>\nthe portals take to cast.<br/>\n<br/>\nSolo or Group(if no other invis casters) - Levitate yourself! This will put<br/>\nyou far enough away from the mobs at the hallways near the teleporter that<br/>\nthey will only attack you if they are wandering inside the room(which has<br/>\nnever happened to me and I gate in there all the time). This can also be<br/>\napplied to groups without another invis caster, simply invis everyone and<br/>\nlevitate yourself. When you arrive in Cazic invis yourself immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\nI too was intimidated by the Cazic gate because I had heard horror stories<br/>\nabout the place but after a few successful trips in I built my confidence up<br/>\nand now use that as my gate if I am going to the Rathe Mountains or Guk or<br/>\nanyplace that my other gates won&#39;t get me closer too.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nYours,<br/>\n<br/>\n~Aereuss Ravins of Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
