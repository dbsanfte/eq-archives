I&#39;ll be hitting Aviak central tonight, and<br/>\nwill post my results tomorrow on a whole night of using it. Anyone got any<br/>\nreally good spell combos they use? My preferred burn is the following right<br/>\nnow:<br/>\n<br/>\nForce Shock<br/>\nLightning Bolt<br/>\nRoot<br/>\nFlame Shock<br/>\n<br/>\nAround 400 pts of dmg. Haven&#39;t seen any blue that took that damage and lived<br/>\naside from Named beasts.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore Force Shock I had to have a tank or I&#39;d be running half the time from<br/>\nblues.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, with my enchanter friend we pack a MEAN punch, she&#39;ll lower magic<br/>\nresistance I bomb, she whirls I step back and burn. Easy way to take reds<br/>\nand yellows. Make friends with enchanters. you&#39;ll never regret it.<br/>\n<br/>\nZalbar The Mad<br/>\n20th Wizard<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
