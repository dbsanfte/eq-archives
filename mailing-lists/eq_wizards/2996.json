That&#39;s<br/>\nnot a competition one &quot;wins&quot;. You do not get brownie points by being<br/>\nable to take a mob N levels above your normal and expected target, except<br/>\nif you are in a race to level. EQ is not a race. I laugh at people that<br/>\nstrut and show off their rubicite and barbed leather whip at level 3, as<br/>\nif that was somehow an &quot;achivement&quot;. It may be, for you. Not for me,<br/>\nand there&#39;s no &quot;objective&quot; (within the game context) measure that says so.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are three kind of imbalances that &quot;require&quot; correction:<br/>\n<br/>\nAn imbalance that prevents you from adventuring and getting in a group<br/>\n(&quot;we can&#39;t solo&quot; is not an imbalance; EQ&#39;s target is groups, not solo)<br/>\n<br/>\nAn imbalanbce that prevents you from leveling and getting in a rgoup<br/>\nwith people you want to group with.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn imbalance that make a class so unplayable or so easy that people<br/>\nwill avoid that class or rush to that class.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole twinking issue does not really fall into these categories. It<br/>\nmight, marginally, be relevant to 2; if you begin a twinked wizard in<br/>\norder to level with a twinked warrior friend, you&#39;d level slower...<br/>\nif you both solo of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; are realy dont help any discusion and your tone is realy arogant.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, I apologise, but after a while, one gets tired of the &quot;grass is<br/>\ngreener on the other side&quot; recurring arguments. Here, and in other<br/>\nclasses lists.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe twink problem is a non-problem. Or would you expect a warrior to<br/>\nrequire as few equipment, compared to a wizard of the same level, to<br/>\nachieve the same efficiency? After all, the warrior does not have to<br/>\nspend all that plat on our spells (and us wizards get off lightly in<br/>\nthat domain, compared to some other casting classes). Where else do<br/>\nyou expect him to spend plat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only difference is, we cannot twink a wizard with our previously<br/>\nknown spells.
