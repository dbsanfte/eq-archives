I <br/>\nknow that there is definitely a tie-in with Dvinn over in Crushbone; <br/>\nsomething akin to how Dvinn is twisting some evil plot with Emporer Crush <br/>\nabout something. (sorry, I forget)  Anyway, there&#39;s a paladin&#39;s quest over <br/>\nin Felwithe in which you are supposed to help foil this evil plot by <br/>\nstopping Dvinn&#39;s orc messenger/runner in Butcher before he reaches his <br/>\ndestination.  The plot unravels itself between this quest and the one on CB <br/>\nfor the screaming mace.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Corflunk and Zarchoomi there&#39;s a dwarf quest over in Kaladim in which <br/>\nyou are to collect their heads.  I haven&#39;t completed this one yet so I have <br/>\na stinky head in my bank account.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry I don&#39;t know more...<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;There&#39;s a place there called the Orc Totem, a large totem pole in a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>fairly small valley.
