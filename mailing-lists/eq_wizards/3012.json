Once the first<br/>\n&gt;&gt; stein was obtained, hundreds followed on all servers.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; One can increase the difficulty to get an item by:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;         - raising the level needed to get it (which puts all rare items at <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;                 level 50, everything before is chaff)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;         - raising the difficulty of the location (which, once a group gets <br/>\n&gt;down<br/>\n&gt;&gt;                 the unvarying routine down pat, stops being true)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;         - raising the difficulty of finding the item (which is the case with<br/>\n&gt;&gt;                 mega-rare spawns. How many players do you know with a <br/>\n&gt;Scarab Ring?)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There is one other solution that to me is a lot more in keeping with the<br/>\n&gt;AD&D style that I think people are used to - randomization.  You are<br/>\n&gt;right tho that virtually all quests are breaks down to kill X and give<br/>\n&gt;its head/heart/tongue/whatever to NPC Y.  But randomizing would make<br/>\n&gt;them more quest-like.  Easier to explain in an example:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Everyone knows who to talk to to start the glowing stein.  Instead of<br/>\n&gt;his fixed dialog though, imagine if he says I need a rare and exotic<br/>\n&gt;drink. You say &quot;I would like to help you&quot;.  He says &quot;Here is a recipe<br/>\n&gt;book.  Find the ingredients listed here and return them in the book to<br/>\n&gt;me.&quot;  Each item would have one more set of fields that should be<br/>\n&gt;randomly generated every time you get the quest given to you.  Maybe<br/>\n&gt;make it from a more appropriate list, you might not need a gargoyle eye<br/>\n&gt;for a level 10 quest, but you get the idea.  Then you keep this book<br/>\n&gt;with you, refer back every few play sessions, seeing what you need. <br/>\n&gt;Maybe you need to figure out where to get an item even! (ack- a real<br/>\n&gt;quest!)  THEN - continue this.  You return the book.  You get the item<br/>\n&gt;&quot;The Glowing Stein&quot;.  Except that its is +5 to +10 int, and +5 to +10<br/>\n&gt;dex - maybe you get lucky and get the ultra rare +10 +10 stein.  Voila -<br/>\n&gt;you have a dynamic quest that no web page is going to spoil, and<br/>\n&gt;everyone is NOT alike!  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Lastly, to address the twinking problem:  Maybe the stein instead of<br/>\n&gt;giving +10 int would give (+2 times level/10).  Therefore, your level 50<br/>\n&gt;wizard has a +10 int stein, but his twinked level 2 wizard has the same<br/>\n&gt;stein at +0 int!  Easily explained that with wisdom of levels you gain<br/>\n&gt;the ability to use a sword better (damage =level, or something similar),<br/>\n&gt;gain more power from the gem, or whatever.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just my few coppers worth.  Unfortuntaly, it is probably too late for<br/>\n&gt;this version, but that would all make nice additions to the expansion!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Micon Bittermage<br/>\n&gt;Karana<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist now has T-SHIRTS! <br/>\n&gt;For details and to order, go to: <br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Silverion Dragonirder<br/>\n<br/>\nHigh elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\nFenin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\nmoderator mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
