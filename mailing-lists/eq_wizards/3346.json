Is there a trick to getting the guards to take the<br/>\nheat, or are they supposed to do it automatically?  I was under the<br/>\nimpression that they were supposed to help automatically.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\nOlatan<br/>\n<br/>\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n+ Olatan Ossur   |                        +<br/>\n+  2nd Wizard    | Hopelessly Lost in Tox +<br/>\n+  Solusek Ro    |                        +<br/>\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
