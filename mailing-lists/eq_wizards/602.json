I&#39;ve noticed that when I got my divination<br/>\nskill up higher, that I fizzled far fewer times with bind affinity.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bought the cheapest spell I could find to raise Divination, and that<br/>\nturned out to be sence magic.  At only 5 mana per cast, I can cast A LOT of<br/>\nthem, and the spell only cost 1 gold.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly, since fade and shadowstep both use the same skill as root,<br/>\n(abjuration?) at each level, I cast a ton of fades to increase that skill<br/>\nand make sure its at its maximum.<br/>\n<br/>\nFlik</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
