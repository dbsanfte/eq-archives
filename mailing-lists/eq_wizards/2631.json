","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1047677528\">Hi all,<br/>\n I am level 24 so i now just pass the terrible 16-24 level (yeah at level 23<br/>\ni was only using dd of level 16 sigh :( ).So i can deal 175 hp per cast...<br/>\nWow... It really sucks.... I get others char on the server nearly same<br/>\nlevel, and let  me tell you friends, that the wizzard is the weakest class<br/>\nof all Norrath. All classes get many lines of spell.. We don&#39;t...<br/>\nWe have :<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Dd spel : our only power.<br/>\n2. Ae spel : useless.. Never seen someone use it<br/>\n3. Shield : same as all caster classes<br/>\n4. Gate and evacuate : same as druid.. (evacuate work beters then gate ok ok<br/>\nyou get a point:) )<br/>\n5. glimpse line : mouhhhaaa too funny :)<br/>\n7. root : yeah as shaman and druid.... And i have been told that the root<br/>\nlevel 39 immobilise doesn t work well...<br/>\n<br/>\nand it s all... Nothing more.. So we get dd spel it s ALL.. That&#39;s so<br/>\nboring... At level 24, a necro can :<br/>\n<br/>\n1. summon a strong pet<br/>\n2. Cast dot for 500 dommage for two bubble of mana...<br/>\n3. Suck life of the mob...<br/>\n4. Cast a dd of 145 dommage......<br/>\n5. get a very good ac with spirit armor and invulnerability !!<br/>\n6. Heal other<br/>\n7. Cast fear who is LESS resisted then root and stay for a minimum of time<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be realist, we are a magician or necro without pet and shield.. Many tell<br/>\nus : oh you can cast spel very fast !!! Yes and ??? It&#39;s the worste thing to<br/>\ncast spel very fast.. Everyone know that in a group you must cast spel<br/>\nveryyyy slowy or the mob will became crazy at you.<br/>\nIt helps in solo ? Heu every other caster get a pet, so casting time is not<br/>\nimportant...<br/>\n<br/>\nI don t think a petition will change anything. We are just a undepowered<br/>\nclass forever. I will continue to play with my wizzard for fun cause i like<br/>\nrpg with him but that s all i know he will never been a powerful char. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 2 cents<br/>\n<br/>\nyakos on karana<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. oh and yes for the funny guys who say : we are the only one who can<br/>\nsolo a hills giant and so.. Guys a hills giant is green at level 40-42...<br/>\nAnd for now, no one know about meteor shower (yes at level 50 you will use a<br/>\ndd level 44, and yes the same as the druid use at level 49 :( )</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
