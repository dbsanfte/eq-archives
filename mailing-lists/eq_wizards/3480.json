I like dungeons just as much as outdoors...if you <br/>\nknow the right spots, dungeons can actually be safer than outdoors once you <br/>\ncontrol which mobs aggro on you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried experimenting with killing WC guards last night... they conned blue <br/>\nto me at 34, but I still had difficulty soloing them.  My friend convinced <br/>\nme that it&#39;s excellent xp.  Anyway, the standard tactic of root, run, and <br/>\nnuke was not working very well for me.  A lot of resists and a bunch of <br/>\nhalf-fizzled nukes.  :P  I&#39;m not a very good solo wizzie, I don&#39;t know how <br/>\nyou solo guys do it. :)  I don&#39;t trust root at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
