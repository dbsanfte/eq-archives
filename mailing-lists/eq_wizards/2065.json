I can&#39;t bring myself to<br/>\nGate-out on my Tanks - even in the most hopeless of situations, so we all<br/>\ndie together.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I play my shadow knight and my group is deep in befallen on the 3rd <br/>\nfloor and all the sudden I get hit by 6 greater skeletons, 3 necro thero, 2 <br/>\nice bones, 3 ghouls etc etc, I see that as the party leader this train is <br/>\ngoing to run over our asses.  So I yell RUN and stand my ground to the death. <br/>\n If my wizards did not take the time to gate out I would be pissed.  I am <br/>\nwilling to die so that you might escape to have everyone die is a waste.  The <br/>\nrule of thumb should be based on your group.  If you are all friends and work <br/>\nwell together then you should know when to gate and when not to.  If you gate <br/>\nand your leader hasn&#39;t given the run command then your are a coward.  Every <br/>\nparty needs a leader, usually a paladin or tank is best for this position.  <br/>\nSince they know how much they can take.  As long as magic users keep everyone <br/>\ninformed on mana with &quot;LOM or OOM OOM&quot; then the group should work out fine.  <br/>\nSo basically I think you should Gate only when you get the command in battle, <br/>\nor your leader is dead and the rest are running.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
