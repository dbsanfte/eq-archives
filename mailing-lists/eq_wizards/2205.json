Otherwise, <br/>\nwhat&#39;s to stop us from grouping with 40+ levelers and going after Giants and <br/>\nDragons! :)  Yeah, damn exciting...but pointless. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy understanding is that the farther up in levels we go...the wider range we <br/>\ncan group up with people.  It may not be out of the question for a level 40 <br/>\nPC to group with a 30 PC probably.  At 18 now, I&#39;ve noticed it&#39;s still a <br/>\npretty even challenge for everybody even 5 levels above me.  xp gains is <br/>\nstill fairly even although the high-level player in the group would probably <br/>\nforfeit a few xp by killing things that might be conning green to him/her.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt lower teens, I&#39;ve noticed that it was usually better to stick between 3 <br/>\nlevels.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my observation, not a science. :)<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Message: 4<br/>\n </span></blockquote>   Date: Wed, 2 Jun 1999 18:19:45 -0400<br/>\n   From: &quot;shypht&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:evanschu@...\">evanschu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Subject: All players and the 6 lvl resist / cant hit melee thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;To me, it seams like alot of people assume that though all lvls of the game <br/>\n&gt;we<br/>\n&gt;group with people that are generally the same level as eachother. But, this <br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt;fale. I have grouped with people upto 7 - 8 lvls above me, for fun, and for <br/>\n&gt;some<br/>\n&gt;exp since I can still usualy get a worth while ammount of exp while grouped <br/>\n&gt;with<br/>\n&gt;them. And this is where the &quot;resistance&quot; complaint comes in.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
