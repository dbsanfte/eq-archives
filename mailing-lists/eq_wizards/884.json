In other words pretend it&#39;s your life.  You ARE this wizard and in real<br/>\nlife you wouldn&#39;t be saying OH Hold Up &lt;insert name here&gt; I only have 10 mana left.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou just wouldn&#39;t say that you dont have a clue how much mana you have you&#39;d just<br/>\nsay &quot;wait a second I am feeling exhausted I need to regen some mana&quot;<br/>\nBut I do believe it&#39;s unfair that they get to see their HP I personally think they<br/>\nshould take hp numbers out also.  Because this game is not meant to be numerical<br/>\nthus the reason why they didnt include Mana # stam # exp # or skills #<br/>\nyou just wouldnt know that you could only run 15 more feet youd know your tired and<br/>\nhave jkust a lil bit left in ya or how much exp you needed to become better youd<br/>\nlearn from doing it not saying oh i need to change the oil in my car 3 more times<br/>\nto be a MASTER oil changer<br/>\nI hope this has enlightened you Please respond back. I love to hear others<br/>\nopinions.<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nLord Thorn SoulFire<br/>\nWizard extraordinaire<br/>\nThe Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
