There are somethings that are not so obvious, like the language skill thing... Maybe it was intended to be this way ie(in the real world people get better at languages by talking to eachother... _and_ by researching with teachers...) but if a GM says that it is exploiting... what ever it is... you can be kicked permenantly from eq for it... instantly. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut as far as most things go... I would let roleplaying be my guide (as this is the _point_ of the game) if you can excape griffons by sitting (but only in a certian spot) this is probably a bug... and you can&#39;t &quot;use&quot; bugs like tools... ie(don&#39;t attack griffons and be in invulnerable spot...) this is cheating... because if you ever saw a griffon in real life... it would be the _last time_ you ever saw one _even_ if you were standing in the &quot;safe spot&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(ok that was long, drawn out, and over complex, but hey.. that&#39;s the way the cookie crumbles)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGeorge Holt<br/>\nThe Wizard Adia, of Tal`kor<br/>\nFennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\nPS. an exploit is not something that is &quot;morally wrong.&quot; It is the &quot;use&quot; of a bug in everquest to your advantage.<br/>\n    Who cares if it&#39;s considered an exploit or not. My rule of thimb is: &quot;If it works for you and the game allows it, then do it!&quot;  If it&#39;s considered an exploit then don&#39;t tell anyone.  Basically an &quot;Exploit&quot; is anything that is considered morally wrong.  Thievery is morally wrong but the game allows it.  Just don&#39;t brag about your &quot;exploits&quot; and its&#39; ok.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
