I have about 50 practice points saved and have only, thus far, used one practice on Research. I have not, as yet, purchased the Lexicon which, I understand, I need to further my Research studies. I&#39;ve started to learn several languages but am a novice in this regard. That&#39;s about as far as I am with Research. What exactly is the best way to approach Research? How do you raise your Research skill? Reading books? Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nWizzy<br/>\nGnome Wizard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
