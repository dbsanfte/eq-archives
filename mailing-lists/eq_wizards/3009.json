Instead of<br/>\n&gt; his fixed dialog though, imagine if he says I need a rare and exotic<br/>\n&gt; drink. You say &quot;I would like to help you&quot;.  He says &quot;Here is a recipe<br/>\n&gt; book.  Find the ingredients listed here and return them in the book to<br/>\n&gt; me.&quot;  Each item would have one more set of fields that should be<br/>\n&gt; randomly generated every time you get the quest given to you.  Maybe<br/>\n&gt; make it from a more appropriate list, you might not need a gargoyle eye<br/>\n&gt; for a level 10 quest, but you get the idea.  Then you keep this book<br/>\n&gt; with you, refer back every few play sessions, seeing what you need.<br/>\n&gt; Maybe you need to figure out where to get an item even! (ack- a real<br/>\n&gt; quest!)  THEN - continue this.  You return the book.  You get the item<br/>\n&gt; &quot;The Glowing Stein&quot;.  Except that its is +5 to +10 int, and +5 to +10<br/>\n&gt; dex - maybe you get lucky and get the ultra rare +10 +10 stein.  Voila -<br/>\n&gt; you have a dynamic quest that no web page is going to spoil, and<br/>\n&gt; everyone is NOT alike!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lastly, to address the twinking problem:  Maybe the stein instead of<br/>\n&gt; giving +10 int would give (+2 times level/10).  Therefore, your level 50<br/>\n&gt; wizard has a +10 int stein, but his twinked level 2 wizard has the same<br/>\n&gt; stein at +0 int!  Easily explained that with wisdom of levels you gain<br/>\n&gt; the ability to use a sword better (damage =level, or something similar),<br/>\n&gt; gain more power from the gem, or whatever.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just my few coppers worth.  Unfortuntaly, it is probably too late for<br/>\n&gt; this version, but that would all make nice additions to the expansion!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Micon Bittermage<br/>\n&gt; Karana<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This wizard would just like to throw in his two coppers and say that I think<br/>\nMicon&#39;s ideas are terrific!  Kudos to you.  I can only hope Verant decides<br/>\nto implement them.  One wonders why they didn&#39;t think of these earlier.  I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t think they would have any objection to dynamic quests, or to<br/>\npowering items by level.  After all, mana already works that way, so in that<br/>\nsense of course, all casters are powered according to level.<br/>\n<br/>\nJW</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
