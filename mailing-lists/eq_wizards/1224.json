(102 DD at lvl 16 and 117 bolt damage at 16)<br/>\n- Ice Comet!  (1100pts damage in one cast...can you say, &quot;Solo the hill/sand<br/>\ngiant?&quot;<br/>\n- Mass Transportation spells (to alternate planes and evacuation spells for<br/>\nentire group to gate to safety)<br/>\n<br/>\n* I rarely hold up my group by meditating.  I normaly cast one spell on the<br/>\nMOB and then melee with it and my party members.  If I noticed our health<br/>\ndropping significantly I will cast again and kill he beast.  You are not a<br/>\none man killing machine, you are part of a team.  The tanks can take down<br/>\nmost creatures easily, you are their insurance policy (nuclear policy).<br/>\nCast once per fight as a rule...Root the beast if it is hitting someone<br/>\nreally hard allowing them to get out of harms way and nuke it!  Be mana<br/>\nsmart.  The clerics will never use their mana to heal if you always<br/>\nobliterate the MOB and waste all your mana...sure the battle takes all of 1<br/>\nminute, but you are resting for 5 minutes.  I will sit and med during a<br/>\nbattle after I cast to ensure I am FM for next round (always watch your<br/>\nteammates health bars...if it gets rough..nuke it!)<br/>\n<br/>\nhave fun! and be mana smart<br/>\n<br/>\n- Ziffnab of Xegony, 19th Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n------<br/>\nPlease help me to explain why a wizards are not a worst mage class?<br/>\n<br/>\nSilverion<br/>\nHigh elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\nmoderator<br/>\n<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nONElist:  where the world talks!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nJoin a new list today.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
