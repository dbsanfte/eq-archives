Of course he will be more<br/>\nsuccessfull.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as an example, I, at level 26 have +36 INT, +60 mana, +40 HP,<br/>\nsomething like +40-50 AC, +11 STR, and some more little boosts I can&#39;t<br/>\nremember right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nSergey<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\nKPS, PUNK (Paramilitary Undercover Nuclear Kamikaze)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
