Bolts do have their <br/>\nplace, and I regret waiting so long to buy some good ones, but they can miss <br/>\nor be blocked and in my opinion that is just too risky.  When you first get <br/>\nthe level new spells will use too much of your mana for you to want to risk <br/>\nany failures.

Was planning on Fire Bolt, but would Shock of<br/>\n&gt;Ice be better?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
