It HAS to be in a bag. (holder, backpack, etc.)  Have the other person put it into a container, and then commit suicide.  When he consents you, you can pick the bag up, with the robe in it.  You cant pick the robe up individually, you can only take the bag. but if the robe is in the bag, you get it.  I should have mentioned that in my original message.  Sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep the questions coming...  I&#39;ve got another 35 minutes to kill before I get to go home and play.  hehe<br/>\n<br/>\nDrev<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tWindows/BrownG/bryson on behalf of Valacian[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:abryson@...\">abryson@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tThursday, April 22, 1999 2:16 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRE: [eq_wizards] Re: Different color ROBES, and how to get them....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Aye, I ran into the same problem, Tandayen.

Thats how.  If you die..  and you consent someone else to<br/>\n&gt; \tretrieve your belongings.. they can take your robe.  Then, they cant give it<br/>\n&gt; \tback to you.<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt;EXAMPLE:  You want that black robe from Neriak..   problem is..  you&#39;re a<br/>\n&gt; \tHigh Elf.  You travel into Neriak..  just near the zone..  do a /who all and<br/>\n&gt; \tfind a wizard in there...  start telling people to help you out.   Heres the<br/>\n&gt; \tdeal...  your &quot;friend&quot; the dark elf has to go buy it.  Whether you give him<br/>\n&gt; \tmoney or whatever is inconsequential.  He gets the robe, and goes to meet<br/>\n&gt; \tyou.  He has to die.  After he dies, he /consent s you to retrieve things<br/>\n&gt; \toff of his corpse.  You take the robe.   Now you&#39;ve got it.   If you try to<br/>\n&gt; \tgive it back to him, you&#39;ll get the error message &quot;This item cannot be<br/>\n&gt; \tdropped, traded, or sold.&quot;  but its yours now.<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt;Hope that helps.<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt;Let me know if there are any questions.<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt;Drev<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt;Shop.theglobe.com * One-Stop Shopping * Free Shipping in U.S.!<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt;Live Personal Shopper * Satisfaction Guaranteed * No Hassle Returns!<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt;Accessories, Apparel, Jewelry, Kids, Sporting Goods, Apparel, More!!<br/>\n&gt; \t&gt;          <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/ad/shoptheglobe0\">http://www.onelist.com/ad/shoptheglobe0</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; \tLooking to expand your world?<br/>\n&gt; \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; \tONElist has over 115,000 e-mail communities from which to chose!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
