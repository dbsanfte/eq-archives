You are very much","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1589443582\">My friend, I invite you to bring a 22nd lvl Necro out to the Cauldron, take<br/>\non a yellow Tidal Lord and then tell me he doesn&#39;t have to med.  You are<br/>\nvery much mistaken if you think he doesn&#39;t and I almost guarantee he will<br/>\nlose his pet in the process.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe enchanter&#39;s have some nice buffs, this is true, but against mutiple<br/>\nenemies, I will take a Cleric and a Wizard every time.  Our AE spells are<br/>\nunmatched by any and the Enchanter can&#39;t touch a Cleric when it comes to<br/>\nbuff spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I disagree, I have never had to sit longer than a mage or necro of<br/>\nthe same lvl in our group.  Never.  Its all on how you play your character.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce again, a Mage can take out 2-3 blues just like us, but will lose his<br/>\npet and will be out of mana.  Guaranteed.  I know, I&#39;ve played a Mage up to<br/>\nlvl 17.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my thoughts on this.  Again, eveyone is entitled to their own opinions<br/>\nand I&#39;m not putting you down for stating yours, but in my belief,  you are<br/>\nmistaken.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalarin Kal&#39;Amon, High Elven Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Wizard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wizard@...\">wizard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, May 14, 1999 4:55 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_wizards] Ice Comet<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Wizard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wizard@...\">wizard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At 06.10 14/05/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Ken Morris&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kmorris2@...\">kmorris2@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;It appears that yes we wizards<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to a increasing damage amount per circle of spells (near double each<br/>\ntime),<br/>\n&gt; &gt;but what troubles me is that the monsters get factorially more hit<br/>\npoints.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t quite understand your point here. Are you saying that we should<br/>\nbe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;able to take out creatures in one or two shots??? That&#39;s crazy, it would<br/>\n&gt; &gt;totally unbalance the game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I agree on this<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Of course the creatures are going to get more<br/>\n&gt; &gt;HP the higher lvl you go. We still do more dmg than any other class in<br/>\nany<br/>\n&gt; &gt;given round. I can now cast a spell that does 175 dmg. I can cast this<br/>\n&gt; &gt;spell 6 times and enstill 1 time. I&#39;m currently taking out yellow Tidal<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Lords solo in the Cauldron and in a group,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nice thing ..... a necromancer can do it also and will not have to sit and<br/>\n&gt; meditate after this why?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I have reduced the amount of dmg<br/>\n&gt; &gt;our tanks normally take because the creatures die much faster.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Enchanter is much better on this if you fight multiple enemies his buffs<br/>\nare<br/>\n&gt; valid all time you will spend your mana very fast and he will have a pet<br/>\nafter<br/>\n&gt; a fight.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;But, as it has been<br/>\n&gt; &gt;pointed out, the wizard is constantly on his ass meditating.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Of course he is, that&#39;s part of being a wizard, or any other magic-using<br/>\n&gt; &gt;class. Sitting on your ass meditating is not any different for a mage or<br/>\n&gt; &gt;enchanter than it is a wizard, so once again I miss your point here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It is much different a magician or necro or enchanter will have to sit<br/>\nmuch<br/>\n&gt; much less then you, ask somone who played at last two classes to over lv<br/>\n20.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;1. Speed up casting time for Wizards. This would allow us to cast<br/>\n&gt; &gt;in-between attacks with our newest spells.(the only class that would be<br/>\nable<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to do so).&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;First off, our casting time IS faster than the other magic-using classes.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Secondly, what you purpose about casting in between attacks would<br/>\nseriously<br/>\n&gt; &gt;hinder our class. As it is now, if we are in a group and attack too<br/>\noften,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the creature turns to us and starts ripping us a new one. Not a good<br/>\nthing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;That&#39;s why you spread your attacks out, never blasting them one right<br/>\nafter<br/>\n&gt; &gt;another.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No need for faster casting time but...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that extra little kick, although there is nothing &#39;little&#39; about being<br/>\nable<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to deliver 175 dmg in one shot. A warrior of the same lvl with a 2-h<br/>\nsword<br/>\n&gt; &gt;can still only do 40 dmg in one round. I CAN solo 2-3 blues before I&#39;m<br/>\nout<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of mana. I&#39;ve been hunting Bosuns and Shamans, both of which are blue to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;me, in the Cauldron and can usually take 2-3 of them before I have to<br/>\nmed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hmm what do you think how many blue can solo a expert magician at lv 22<br/>\n&gt; without<br/>\n&gt; need to med and he can survive 3 blues in same time if he sacrifices a pet<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; sometimes also win. (not to mention some other magic users)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My comment wich i post under other tread i repeat it so to try to explain<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; better and not to multyoly treads on same subject.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In my first post i don&#39;t explained it good so i try to explain it better.<br/>\n&gt; I like to play a wizard as i play wizards in all games for more than 12<br/>\n&gt; years now, but if we talk about balancing all magic users to same lv then<br/>\ni<br/>\n&gt; see some problems with a wizard class, i wish to see your comments on this<br/>\n&gt; and other ideas to make a game more playable without throwing a balance<br/>\nout<br/>\n&gt; or tring to make a overpowerfull class.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; First positive things<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - wizards are great for plane(after 34+ lv), group travel (druid is best<br/>\n&gt; in individual and nearly as good in group)<br/>\n&gt; - wizards are best in DD damage spells (but not in damage to mana ratio<br/>\nDOT)<br/>\n&gt; - wizards spells are less resisted and it damage at last for one part<br/>\n&gt; moust other class spells are resisted full<br/>\n&gt; - wizard is fastest to deal a massive damage in shortest time (but a<br/>\nprice?)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Negativ things<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Wizards have lowest defence, hit points and ac of all classes (lowest<br/>\n&gt; combat survivel)<br/>\n&gt; - wizard spells do massive damage but also use masive mana but when wizard<br/>\n&gt; uses it mana it is useless. Fighting is not a wizard strong side, wizard<br/>\n&gt; dont have pets, dont have buffs, dont heal, they dont run well.<br/>\n&gt; - Wizards risks very very much in combat agains only 2 blues<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; First i don&#39;t wish to say that a wizard is not good or playable class it<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; nice but it is also a class with most downtime of all clases so as a<br/>\nresult<br/>\n&gt; a 2 equaly expert people playing sametime will never get equal play time,<br/>\n&gt; wizard will most time be in his book. Why this hmm lets see<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All other Magic users have better mana usage then wizard, why pet is a<br/>\nbest<br/>\n&gt; mana use it damages, it defend, it tount and it never expires until it<br/>\ndies<br/>\n&gt; ( i personaly dont like this pets i wish to have a cat or dog od mouse :-)<br/>\n&gt; not for combat but as familiar ) . Buffs as result do more damage and DOT<br/>\n&gt; spells are much more mana efficent then our DD spells.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So what can be done to make a wizard a time efficent to play as other<br/>\n&gt; classes are. I suggest a faster mana recovering ratio not too much but a<br/>\n&gt; 1.3 or 1.2 faster times can help and its easy to implement one number<br/>\n&gt; change in formula and go go go.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here i dont put in effect of specialization as for now it is not in game (<br/>\n&gt; long beta ) and i dont know if in later levels exist any only wizard mana<br/>\n&gt; regeneration booster but i heared of &quot;mana stone&quot; but noone knows what it<br/>\n&gt; is and when you find it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks all for reading and as i live in italy my english is not maxed yet,<br/>\n&gt; but i please you to join a discussion and to not take to hard my spelling<br/>\n&gt; mistakes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Silverion<br/>\n&gt; High elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; moderator<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
