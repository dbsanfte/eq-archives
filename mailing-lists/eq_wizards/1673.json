How ever easy or hard it is on her, has<br/>\nno effect on you, so why don&#39;t you just mind your own business and stop<br/>\nbeing so uptight.

You&#39;re just upset<br/>\nthat she gets an advantage you didn&#39;t, right? Well, life is tough like<br/>\nthat. Whether she gets an advantage or not, is none of your business<br/>\nbecause it doesn&#39;t really affect you. And remember, she had to work her<br/>\nway to level 22 before that as well, so she is only giving her other<br/>\nChar something she rightfully earned.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust concentrate on your own character and stop being a jerk about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nQenelin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
