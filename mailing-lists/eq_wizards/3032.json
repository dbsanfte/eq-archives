You will know you are far enough<br/>\nbecuse you will have a hard time seeing your target.  Once rooted, move back<br/>\na lil farther and start nuking away.  Our casting range is nearly twice<br/>\ntheirs so if root/enstil holds, you wont even get a scratch.  This works for<br/>\nlevles 24 and up.  If root fails, remeber the way to zone and dont get lost<br/>\nhehehe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
