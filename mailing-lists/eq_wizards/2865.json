I group with a 28th level<br/>\nEnchanter and a 28th level Magician (and some tanks of course).  The<br/>\nEnchanter has an area affect stun spell, so once she casts that, the<br/>\nMagician and I open up on the AE spells.  Lather.  Rinse.  Repeat.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWorks great!  Even if all the Mobs turn and attack just the Magician<br/>\nor myself, they are very quickly stunned again with the AE stun spell.<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                                Soren<br/>\n                                                                29th Level<br/>\nWizard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJoe Wallace wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Joe Wallace&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joew88@...\">joew88@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve started playing with the lvl 16 and lvl 24 AE damage spells lately.<br/>\n&gt; They have some surprisingly good uses.  The lvl 29 Cast force is an<br/>\n&gt; excellent spell in just the right circumstances.
