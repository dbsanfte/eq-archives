I&#39;ve been playing both a Shaman & Druid to <br/>\nget a feel for it, but nothing compares to a Wizard.  I&#39;m thinking of <br/>\ndropping my Druid character because she just plain sucks. Druids are good <br/>\nsolo and group characters up to about 20level, then that&#39;s it.  All my high <br/>\n45+ level friends tell me they never invite Druids in their parties <br/>\nanymore...but Wizards are ALWAYS welcome.<br/>\nAt high levels, a Druid will not have good enough armor to tank...so they <br/>\nessentially become weak Wizards.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy that time, a Wizard of equal level will have strong shields and DD <br/>\nspells, AND all the teleport spells of a Druid.  So what about a Druid&#39;s DOT<br/>\n<br/>\nspells, you can&#39;t kite Lady Voxx.  :)  (or can you? hehe)<br/>\nNor will a Druid&#39;s heal spells be worthy of a Cleric.  So why have them?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe grass always looks greener somewhere else, but trust me....other <br/>\ncharacters are envious of a Wizard&#39;s spells as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe *maybe* need to be tweaked here and there...but stop comparing us to <br/>\nother characters.  It will get us nowhere.  We have a few 50Level Wizards on<br/>\n<br/>\nour server that have demonstrated the effectiveness of our spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO,<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure you know how weak we are.... You tell about dd ? ok. Do you<br/>\nknow that your best spel at level 50 only does 625 dommage ???? And that the<br/>\nbest dd spel for DRUID is 615 (and they buy it IN A FUCKING SHOP)????<br/>\nMagician get a BOLT who deal 900 dommage at level 49 (AND THEY BUY IT TOO IN<br/>\nA FUCKING SHOP!)... ok it s a bolt so dificult to cast by WTF we must have<br/>\nthe best dd spel no ????? With nearly the same mana/ratio.... Don t speak<br/>\nabout ice comet, you never never will have it (unless you have 40 friend<br/>\nlevel 50 and who are ready to spare it with you...)... And oh yes : you best<br/>\ndd spel is fire based so you can NOT hit fire giant (nothing in solusek b in<br/>\nfact)and nagafen (who is one of the mob carrying the rune). So you use you<br/>\nlevel 39 sple at level 50.. that s pretty cool no ?  At level 34 you have a<br/>\ndd of 315 .. cool the magician have a bolt who deal 345 at 34 ...... So i am<br/>\nsure you realise how weak we are right now :). People ask us to group ? Yes<br/>\ncause they THINK we are the best dd caster... And it s not true at level 23<br/>\nyou use a stupid level 16 spel. From 24 to 29 we are the best dd caster yep.<br/>\nBut from 34 to the end, no way we are nothing. I have one friend who is<br/>\nlevel 50 dark elfe on karana (menahemen a french speaking guy coming from<br/>\nsuisse). He just stop playing at level 50 not because he don t like his<br/>\nwizzard cause he was really bored about what verant does to us (i mean we<br/>\nare undepowere dlike hell so we don t hit the major mob of the game as<br/>\nnagafen and lady vox :( ). Some of you may (again) tell me : ohh stop<br/>\nspaming, just play another classe if you don t like this one, we are fine<br/>\nwith it... Ok wait till high level and we will see.. So np continue play but<br/>\nnever never hope to be (not the strongest) a regular class... Just hope to<br/>\nbecome the weakest class in the game but some like it ! (as i do :) )<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nyakos <br/>\nlevel 26 wizzard karana<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. a druid is 15 times more useful then me in a group.... People just don<br/>\nt know we are so weak....</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
