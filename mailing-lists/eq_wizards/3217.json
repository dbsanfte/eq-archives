Keeping in mind that both<br/>\n&gt; wizards and enchanters are limited by the 6 Level cap rule, so we are<br/>\n&gt; talking low red, high yellows here, I would rather place my bets with a<br/>\n&gt; wizard than an enchanter.

Everyone attacks one, enchanter charms<br/>\none, use it to dispatch same or a third one.
