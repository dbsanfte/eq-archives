I haven&#39;t found many runes either.  I<br/>\n&gt;found one WAY back at the beginning and hadn&#39;t a clue one what it was<br/>\n&gt;for.  Of course after I accidentally sold it in a pack to a vendor I found<br/>\n&gt;out ... oh well...it was one I wish I had now.  Isn&#39;t that the way it<br/>\n&gt;always runs?<br/>\n&gt;         What I do to acquire runes is this, when grouped with people first<br/>\n&gt;thing, I state I would appreciate if runes are found people let me have the<br/>\n&gt;opportunity to purchase them or they share and I will likewise share any<br/>\n&gt;items I get for loot that they want.  I can&#39;t use the big bronze swords and<br/>\n&gt;other warrior/larger class type items..so we do a straight across trade or<br/>\n&gt;I pay a plat or something for the rune, so they get something and feel good<br/>\n&gt;about it too.  It is far less than I would pay at a vendor and its<br/>\n&gt;generally more than they would get were they to sell to a vendor.  It works<br/>\n&gt;out well...everyone ends up happy in the end, and most times we get good<br/>\n&gt;exp too :)<br/>\n&gt;         I do have one question...this may seem obvious for some, but where<br/>\n&gt;do I find the tome to combine the spell components?   I hail from Neriak<br/>\n&gt;and I have probably just missed it.  I would appreciate if anyone knows<br/>\n&gt;where to find this item, please post for the dork here so I can start my<br/>\n&gt;spell creation...hopefully...all the comments about the slow skill raising<br/>\n&gt;that goes on makes me leery but I have to try it anyway :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At 10:09 AM 6/22/99 -0600, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From: &quot;Jason Smith&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jj@...\">jj@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I have only found about 2 runes, I am level 23...  so you aren&#39;t unlucky,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;just aren&#39;t many out there...
