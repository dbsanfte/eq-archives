The NPC doesnt<br/>\nalways spawn and when she does, she doesn&#39;t always have the boots.  In my<br/>\nopinion, it would be better for us all if this wasn&#39;t the case.  Not<br/>\neveryone has 18 to 20 hours to spend online in one room hoping to get the<br/>\nitem they want.  This is of course complicated by things like going linkdead<br/>\nand possibly loosing your place in line.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
