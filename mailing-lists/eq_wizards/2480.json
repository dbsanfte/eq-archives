The only one I haven&#39;t found are the<br/>\nextra planar spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have to disagree with you. So far, research is mostly a way of avoiding<br/>\nthe necessity to buy your spells. In other words, a way of role-playing a<br/>\ntiny smidgeon more (&quot;The wizard Ultannis had to spend long time to find out<br/>\nhow to cast force&quot;). Not good, of course, since only you knows that you<br/>\nreally did find the spell on your own, when you could simply buy it at the<br/>\nstore next door.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are very very few spells that cannot be found somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Wizard (A) May have a fast casting inferno shock that is less manna<br/>\n&gt; efficent, but he can pop them off faster then wizard (B), whos inferno shock<br/>\n&gt; does more damage but takes alot longer to cast.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Now *THAT* would be nice. But I suspect it would require a very very large<br/>\nreworking of the core system (read &quot;too much code change&quot;) to make it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I can see it being a part of the EQ expansion. So far, the only thing<br/>\nyou really need to get the expansion for is a few more areas to explore,<br/>\nwhich is nice, but may not tempt everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, with this, you suddendly have things to strive for *and* incentive to<br/>\npurcahse the expansion. What more could Verant dream of? :) <br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
