Something<br/>\nlike 10.79 mana per int per level.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother interesting discovery I made is in the int modifiers.  For example,<br/>\nif I put in 130 int, I of course get 1400 mana, but if I put in 130 int and<br/>\na 10 point modifier, I end up with 1500 mana, which is exactly 10 points of<br/>\nmana for each point of int modification.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the big points that are to made here are:<br/>\n<br/>\n*  Int modifiers help you get mana per level, so gather anything that is<br/>\n+int that you can get your hands on.<br/>\n<br/>\n*  There really isn&#39;t to much difference between having 130 int and having<br/>\n110 int.  So all you humans out there should do just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n*  The benefits to having a much higher int aren&#39;t apparent until very high<br/>\nlevels, and even then its not that much.  Comparing 1400 mana to 1200 mana<br/>\nI imagine just means the difference between casting a single spell.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRotgut</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
