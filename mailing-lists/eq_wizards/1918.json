No, that is not the way logic and argument works.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you (or anyone else) claim that all characters on Norrath at the same<br/>\nlevel should be equal, please prove it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise, there is no indication that it should be so.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nSergey<br/>\n--------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I was trying to say was that it&#39;s a judgment call.  The original<br/>\nspeaker said that all characters at the same level should have the same<br/>\nchance of competing.  You said that life is not like that.  My response was<br/>\nthat EQ doesn&#39;t have to be like life.  That is perfectly logical.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink your analogy denies the validity of the speaker&#39;s claim.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are trying to say that such a claim needs proof.  I say, no it doesn&#39;t.<br/>\nI can just as well say that you need to prove that character&#39;s at the same<br/>\nlevel SHOULDN&#39;T have the same chance of competing.  And if you can&#39;t, then<br/>\nthere is no indication that it should be so.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t a question of proof.  This is a judgment call.  To me, this means<br/>\nthat there is no basis for judgment without the designers&#39; input.  If THEY<br/>\nwanted the characters to have the same chance of competing, then so be it.<br/>\nIf they didn&#39;t, so be it.  There is no proof here one way or the other.<br/>\nOnly opinion.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
