He wasnt able to get the name<br/>\nof this npc though. Does anyone know the name of this npc so I can steer<br/>\nclear of him. I need to go to Akanon to get my lightning spell soon.<br/>\nAnother question. Has anyone had sucsess in getting a black robe from neriak<br/>\nby having  friend get it and then giving consent to loot his corpse? This<br/>\nwas discussed here a while ago and was wondering if it was indeed possible<br/>\nto do. If robes cannot be traded and/or sold (even ones from najena or the<br/>\nthatamurgist) this seems like a serious bug since these robes are valuable<br/>\nto us casters but not to others and they would likely want to sell them if<br/>\nthey(non-casters) got those robes. Any thoughts?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
