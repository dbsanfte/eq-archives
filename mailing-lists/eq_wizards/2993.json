Soon there will be AC to play and more games will come iï¿½m sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Verant has a particular blindness. They want an epic style of game, and<br/>\nare balanced between &quot;we have 3000 regular players per server, and cannot<br/>\nmake a unique hero for each&quot; on one side, and &quot;but we really want a sense<br/>\nof achievment&quot; on the other hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey DO want to keep some items rare. Their solution is: make these items<br/>\nappear rarely in the game. Of course, the better items, the rarer... which<br/>\nmeans that they&#39;re most highly sought.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe good solution is: the better item, the harder to get. But Drelzna isn&#39;t<br/>\n*hard* to get at. You know where to go, you know what to do, and there&#39;s<br/>\nnot much risk once you are at the right level, nor variation to this routine.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only solution is, of course, to make the item really more difficult.<br/>\nForget quests: quests aren&#39;t intrinsically more difficult than slaying mob X;<br/>\nonce a quest is &quot;solved&quot;, in 1 week, everyone knows how to do it. Witness the<br/>\nGlowing Stein debacle - the hard part was solving the quest. Once the first<br/>\nstein was obtained, hundreds followed on all servers.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne can increase the difficulty to get an item by:<br/>\n\t- raising the level needed to get it (which puts all rare items at the<br/>\n\t\tlevel 50, everything before is chaff)<br/>\n\t- raising the difficulty of the location (which, once a group gets down<br/>\n\t\tthe unvarying routine down pat, stops being true)<br/>\n\t- raising the difficulty of finding the item (which is the case with<br/>\n\t\tmega-rare spawns. How many players do you know with a Scarab Ring?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We are paying customers and not many ppl have 10 hours sessions to waste on camping for an item they should be able to get right away if they are apropiate level and group.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Apparently Verant did not think that JBoot were an item &quot;appropriate&quot; for level 30<br/>\nplayers, but more of an oddity. Problem is, it is so useful in many circumstances<br/>\nthat it is considered appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\nMankind has never been happy complying with &quot;decrees from above&quot; in its history :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
