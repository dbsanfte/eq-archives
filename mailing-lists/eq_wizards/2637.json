Our secret<br/>\n&gt; weapon is our level 12 DD spell shock of lightning.  It is hardly ever<br/>\n&gt; resisted, casts extremely fast AND interrupts casting.  You can chain cast<br/>\n&gt; this sucker so much faster than other casting classes it&#39;s sick.  Unless<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; buddies went to their lower level spells, I would interrupt them every<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n&gt; Hoping you others out there will share your tips as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Euros Arcane<br/>\n&gt; Rallos Zek<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
