I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2105048170\">At that level your best bet for fast advancing is one other person. The two<br/>\nof you together can take yellow mobs, have no problems and still gain<br/>\nquickly. I hunted with an equal level magician(my best friend in RL) from<br/>\nabout 6th-12th. From there we hooked up with some other friends and now I<br/>\nhave a full group that I hunt with constantly(we are all 16th now). I know<br/>\nthat you can group with 5 or 6 others and hunt but until you make 10th and<br/>\nhigher you really don&#39;t need the full group, just get one other person that<br/>\nunderstands your style and the two of you will do fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as what to fight well you have a couple of options if you want to<br/>\nstay on Faydwer. With a group you can enter Crushbone and take the<br/>\ncenturions there, just beware of Crush&#39;s train and move if you hear anyone<br/>\nshouting about it. Solo, or with the one other person, you can stick to the<br/>\nOrc Camp and kill the cents and oracles that spawn there(some will still be<br/>\nwhite and yellow to you). Lesser Faydark is an option if you don&#39;t mind<br/>\nkilling pixies, the tower there is usually empty of other players and you<br/>\ncan still gain from the pranksters. If none of those options are appealing<br/>\nthen there is always Butcherblock. Head over there with your group and take<br/>\nDwarf Skel&#39;s(only spawn at night), Giant Bat&#39;s, Roaming Goblins and Spiders.<br/>\nIf you prefer to camp then there are numerous goblin camps dotting the<br/>\nlandscape although beware of the goblin wizards and shamans as they are<br/>\nprobably too tough for you at 7th.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nYours,<br/>\n<br/>\n~Aereuss Ravins of Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
