Of course due to the raw power of the class, as well as the <br/>\nversatility of teleportation, Wizards are my first choice.  I realize that <br/>\npeople have most likely time and again requested spell lists, but here I am, <br/>\nbrand spanking new to the list.  I was wondering if perhaps some nice soul <br/>\nout there might be able to send me a complete list.  I&#39;ve checked EQLizer, <br/>\nEQVault, and EQstratics and none of them have every spell, thanks in advance <br/>\neveryone.<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a 14th level wizard on E&#39;Ci. David, if I may be honest here, I would <br/>\nlike to suggest that if you want to have fun playing a spellcaster, pick <br/>\nabout anything other than Wizard. Enchanters get pets and can make magical <br/>\nitems. If I were to start over and pick a pure mage class, that would be the <br/>\none I&#39;d go with.<br/>\n<br/>\n*ducks flameage*<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;rant mode&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me explain - Verant hasn&#39;t implemented specialization skills or the <br/>\nalternate planes, we have almost nothing for armor or hitpoints, our melee <br/>\nskills are pathetic and our powers don&#39;t become greater than other classes <br/>\nuntil 40-somethingth level. Plus, the single greatest way of leveling up - <br/>\nkilling har red mobs - is unavailable to us, because our spells are often <br/>\nresisted completely by these creatures. So, instead of grouping with <br/>\npowerful warriors to beat up on mobs that will actually give EVERYONE in the <br/>\ngroup decent experience, we&#39;re relegated to trying to solo weak blues or <br/>\nfight white and yellow creatures in a group for pitiful experience because <br/>\nWE CAN&#39;T TOUCH HARD MOBS LIKE EVERY OTHER CLASS CAN!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve watched every group I&#39;ve run with pass me up in level. I&#39;ve watched <br/>\ncharacters started while I was at level 12 PASS ME at level 13. It&#39;s not as <br/>\nthough I never play, it&#39;s just that I CANNOT GAIN MORE THAN HALF A BUBBLE <br/>\nEXP PER HOUR, on average. That&#39;s powergaming, soloing in the Karanas vs. <br/>\nblue beetles and the occasional white/yellow.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeedless to say, I&#39;m very frustrated in playing this class right now. The <br/>\nonly reason I remain a Wizard is stubbornness. Everyone says it gets better <br/>\nat higher levels, but the fact of the matter is that we&#39;ll always be a <br/>\nsecond-rate class unless Verant fixes specialization, plane travel and <br/>\nspell-resistances of higher-level mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;/rant mode&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nVash, 14th Level Wizardess, Felwithe/North Karana, E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
