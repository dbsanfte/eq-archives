Find Lydl Mastat outside of Freeport and get the locked book from<br/>\n&gt; him.<br/>\n&gt; I have tried to find him out both gates, in North Ro, and in East<br/>\n&gt; Commanlands<br/>\n&gt; and can&#39;t find him.  Where is he?  Does he only appear at certain<br/>\n&gt; times?  I<br/>\n&gt; have looked MANY times and can&#39;t find him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2.  Get the locked strongbox back.  I have found that the box is on an<br/>\n&gt; island<br/>\n&gt; which is straight out from the docks.  Is it possible to swim there or<br/>\n&gt; do I need<br/>\n&gt; a boat?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Soren<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Are you hogging all the fun?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Friends tell friends about ONElist!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
