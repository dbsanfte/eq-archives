But from what I<br/>\nunderstand the runes that we need for our lvl 49 direct damage spell that is<br/>\nthe holy grail for wizards can only be found off of a lvl 53 dragon that<br/>\nwould take a few teams to get to and take out. This would make our spell<br/>\nvery very hard to come by, and would make it a very rare spell to have since<br/>\nit would take some effort to get it. So this leads me to the fact that we<br/>\nwould be using our lvl 44 DD spell ALOT untill we were lucky enough to get<br/>\nthe runes that we would need.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, this brings up another thing - the Druids lvl 49 DD spell is EXACTLY<br/>\nthe same as the Wizards lvl 44 DD spell, and he does not need to research<br/>\nit. So he can simply walk off to a vendor and buy it. No biggie, but the<br/>\nthing that bothers me is<br/>\n<br/>\n- there is a high chance the lvl 49 wizard will be using his lvl 44 spell.<br/>\nSo therefore doing the same damage as a lvl 49 druid.<br/>\n<br/>\n.. So why bother being a wizard if at lvl 49 there is a high chance of doing<br/>\nthe same dmg as a druid?<br/>\n<br/>\nAhwell.. that is just a bit of a bitch from me. If it is true that the runes<br/>\ncan only be found off of the ice dragon, I would be very upset, I dont want<br/>\nto be a lvl 49 wizard that is just a druid w/o the toys because I can not<br/>\nget a party together ( a few parites ) to slay the dragon. Also, chances are<br/>\nthere would be more then 1 wizard in the group, so we would need to share<br/>\nthe runes, and decides who would get it via lotto. .. which again would<br/>\nlower my chances of getting that spell... just seams somewhat unfair to me.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
