One","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1704912908\">This could be very well the most important information you will ever<br/>\nhere, it will also bring back to man soloing, which for me has relented<br/>\nwonderful exp.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne miseable day in unrest upon reaching 21rst lvl, i grouped with a<br/>\nparty reletive to my lvl and we decided to fight red things, which<br/>\nmeans i would probably be useless in casting, but we were brave and<br/>\ntried anyways. I ended up being resisted 100% of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many of you really hate that you cant help your friends when this<br/>\nhappens.... Worry no longer, after a long and miserable complaint to<br/>\nthe gms, i was finally reviled why to why this was happeneing... You<br/>\nsee, at higher lvls ,Gm said your spells are extremly valuable to a<br/>\nparty because they way lay final blow to creature.. this means wait<br/>\ntill the thing is hurt in a tanking party... but he said for soloing<br/>\nyou will have no other choice but to enlist the aid of a enchanter... I<br/>\nresponded, you need a enchanter to kill blues?, he said not so much for<br/>\nblues(although i beg to differ) but he said in the big bright yellow<br/>\nthat at lower lvls we loved to kill for exp in two man teams. I<br/>\nresponded to this , &quot;But why a enchanter?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWEll folks one simply anwser, which being in mage class, i was extremly<br/>\nembarressed i had not though of it. A enchanter, you see, posses not<br/>\nstr but, magical influence, ie, they can cast weaken magic reistance<br/>\nspells on creatures......Are you getting the picture.. so i was<br/>\nextremely intrested in putting this to work. So i quickly( not really)<br/>\nlooked up the aid of a 21rst lvl enchanter.. however i could not find<br/>\none... If any of you have a chance to confirm or deny this method,<br/>\nplease repost this message as i will do so also.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Enchanter cast weaken resistance, or whatever spell they may have to<br/>\ndo this, Wizards then go to work casting root, blast happy with no<br/>\nresistance, or at least i hope a much higher success rate.<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy hunting, Elmara of Povar<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
