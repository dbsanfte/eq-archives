When I began the quest, it was shortly after the patch put the quest<br/>\n&gt; in place, and the rod in Everfrost was the first one I got.  I just got a<br/>\n&gt; druid to cast enduring breath on me, and then I went invis and had<br/>\n&gt; absolutely no trouble finding the rod.  I saw the NPC, and my invis did wear<br/>\n&gt; off,  but not while I was around him.  The majority of the tunnels down<br/>\n&gt; there were totally empty, so I had no trouble refreshing  my invis.  The rod<br/>\n&gt; itself was inside a smaller room with a ramp leading in, and was indeed<br/>\n&gt; surrounded by 3 ice bone skeletons, all of which conned green to me at level<br/>\n&gt; 29 when I went to get the rod.  They see through invis, of course, and<br/>\n&gt; attacked the minute I took the rod.  Nevertheless, they were insignificant<br/>\n&gt; enough that I had absolutely no trouble gating even with them attempting to<br/>\n&gt; hit me.  I figured that this rod was one of the easiest to obtain.  But<br/>\n&gt; again, this was right after the quest was put in.  They may have made it<br/>\n&gt; more difficult since.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Jason Smith &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jj@...\">jj@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, October 29, 1999 9:31 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [eq_wizards] Staff of the Wheel<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Jason Smith&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jj@...\">jj@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It would be a suicide run, I was down there with a group of 45ish players<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when I got my rod.

But I<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a few questions since I have spent no time in Guk in 32 levels.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; GUK<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1. I need to know the easiest or quickest path to the hand room?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2. Is the room on the Live or Dead side?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 3. Will I encounter any Undead frogs along the way?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; EVERFROST<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I know that the rod is surrounded by 3 IBS and that an NPC is in the area.<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can get by the IBS with Invis to Undead but the NPC could be a problem.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 1.
