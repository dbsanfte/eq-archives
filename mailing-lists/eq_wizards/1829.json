It also has a chance of leaving<br/>\n&gt;people<br/>\n&gt;behind (about a 1% chance).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ME:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Mass gates: Many wizards are very diasapointed with the locations of the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;gates,i know i am. Why have 2 gates in the karanas 2 min from each<br/>\n&gt;&gt;other?? why are all 3 other gates ro,neriak,and common so close to each<br/>\n&gt;&gt;other while a vast expense of land is unreachable?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; GZ:       Teleportation cheapens the game - it makes it easy to get<br/>\n&gt;around<br/>\n&gt;(look at UO).  We wanted to keep our world big.  That is why so few<br/>\n&gt;classes<br/>\n&gt;get teleportation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(note: Druid locations are far superior to ours and much better located,<br/>\n&gt;guess that is to compensate for the lack of the dimensional planes.also<br/>\n&gt;and i am not sure if this is true but i hear druid mass gates sometimes<br/>\n&gt;drop party in a random loc)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ME:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Now understand we love mass gating, it is a lot of fun to have special<br/>\n&gt;&gt;abilities that not many others enjoy, but there are large portion of the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;norath world that far far from our gates,i wish our gates were more<br/>\n&gt;&gt;strategically placed. Also i surelly hope you will not forget to include<br/>\n&gt;&gt;a gate to all future continents.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; GZ:       Future continents will have gates for sure.  :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ME:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;3/Eye of Zomm: this is the most fun in my inventory i get a kick out of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;using it everytime,but for the life of me i do not understand why it is<br/>\n&gt;&gt;of such short duration.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; GZ:       It has a short duration to prevent players from mapping<br/>\n&gt;dungeons<br/>\n&gt;with no risk.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(note: i am wondering if he realizes it only last like 15 seconds)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ME:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;4/bind sight: another great fun spell, its only problem is imo way way<br/>\n&gt;&gt;too short range on pcs, i think it must be bugged that is the only<br/>\n&gt;&gt;explaination i can come up with. if i binded sight on a player and the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;player walks away just a short distance all i can see is a static<br/>\n&gt;&gt;display.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; GZ:       Hmm - i will check that out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ME:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;5/Root: wile enchanter whirl seem to have been fixed in such a way as<br/>\n&gt;&gt;not to break while the mob is taking -bash-damage, i could also point<br/>\n&gt;&gt;out that root certainly seem to behave the way whirl used to prior to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;patch.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From my own experience root seem to last a lot longer if the mob is not<br/>\n&gt;&gt;taking damage but would tend to break after nuking. If in fact this is<br/>\n&gt;&gt;true,then doesnt root also need to be fixed in the same way that whirl<br/>\n&gt;&gt;was? As far as i can see both spells have the same purpose more or less.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;GZ:        Root has a % chance of breaking when the creature takes<br/>\n&gt;damage - the<br/>\n&gt;same as we changed whirl to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;6/Finally my rant would be that wizards arent set that far apart in<br/>\n&gt;&gt;damage dealing nor in damage/mana efficiency then any of the other<br/>\n&gt;&gt;casters save maybe shamans (i am only 34th though i havent seen yet what<br/>\n&gt;&gt;is to come). Yet these other classes can do magical damage and much much<br/>\n&gt;&gt;more. I must say at this point, only mass gating make me continue to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;want to be a wizard.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;GZ:       Try another class for a bit and see the difference in the<br/>\n&gt;amount of<br/>\n&gt;time that it takes you to deal out similar damage.  :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                             Geoffrey C.<br/>\n&gt;Zatkin<br/>\n&gt;                            Arch-Magi of Norrath<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(Note: well GZ seem to think that because we cast the nukes slightly<br/>\n&gt;faster that puts us way ahead of the pack, well he is entitled to his<br/>\n&gt;opinion of course,mine is that the fact that i can cast spells 1 sec<br/>\n&gt;faster than everyone else is totally worthless.The only advantage that i<br/>\n&gt;can see is for soloing and i quit doing that long time ago.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;He also seem to think that wizard having -almost- same damage/mana<br/>\n&gt;efficiency as magiciant is quiet ok as long as our damage is dealt<br/>\n&gt;slightly faster. This really bugs me. i see no purpose whatsoever in<br/>\n&gt;myself doing a mob 1000 damage in 4 shots vs a magiciant doing it in<br/>\n&gt;5.With both of us having used the same mana spent. That is suppose to be<br/>\n&gt;a big asset??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyways, glad i took the whine of my chest, now at least i know he is<br/>\n&gt;aware of some of our grivences.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Saltin of Solusek<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  where the world talks!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Join a new list today.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
