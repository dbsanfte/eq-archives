If he yells it out in all caps..  everyone runs.  No questions asked.  Other than that... my group never runs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso...  about tanks...   I tell my tanks, that if they think they&#39;re gonna die...  before the battle is done..  then run.  I tell them, just start running, and tell me youre running.  That way I can prepare my gate.  I have a much easier time running, than our tanks do.  So..  I give them the freedom to choose whether to stay or die.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout journeying back home with the fighters...    If you think there is a possibility that they&#39;ll encounter trouble..   then ask em if they need your help on the way back.  Most tanks are pretty confident.  ..cause at full health.. if they know they dont have a wizard, and are going to take a beating.. they can usually zone safe enough.  Thats why I usually leave them.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust MHO.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrev</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
