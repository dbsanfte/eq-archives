IMHO _ALL_ spells beyond level 12 should be <br/>\n&gt;research only. Of course they should make it a bit more easy to get the <br/>\n&gt;runes then. They are loaded WAY to seldom, but I hear that they are going to <br/>\n&gt;fix that :).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;*SPOILER starts here*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;All wizard spells up to and including level 20 can be found somewhere in <br/>\n&gt;erudin. If you cant find it in the wizard guild or the palace or the library <br/>\n&gt;try looking in the temples around the palace and other places inside the <br/>\n&gt;erudin city.<br/>\n&gt;I have also seen ALL our DD spells up to and including level 44 in Erudin <br/>\n&gt;and most of our AE spells up to and including level 49 (some in between <br/>\n&gt;where missing i think ... i just briefly looked at them since i couldnt <br/>\n&gt;afford them anyway ... but the level 49 AE spell was there).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;*SPOILER end*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well i hope this helps people who want to be helped and that Verant soon <br/>\n&gt;will remove these spells and make them research only (if they load more <br/>\n&gt;runes).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Rotas Koth, Innoruuk.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
