Magicians and encanters and<br/>\nNecros all have there place...... wizards have mana...THATS IT ... WHEN<br/>\nTHE HELL WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SOLOED a white or black .... IM sorry to<br/>\nsay that if you are fighting a squirrel with this class youd be lucky<br/>\nif half your magik wasnt resisted.. some of it did 3 points of<br/>\ndamage... and 34rth this is really retarded.. and then by that times<br/>\nthe creature breaks your usless root spell because none of your other<br/>\nso called better spells all suck as far as paralyzing your openent... <br/>\n<br/>\nWE ARE PURE CASTERS... please give us double the mana or something.. I<br/>\ndont even think this would make us more powerful... but it migfht give<br/>\nus the ability to kill something our lvl....<br/>\n<br/>\nin the mean time, i have chosen to play a cleric on Vallon Zek... A<br/>\nvery rewarding class to those of you who are sick of wizards... YOu can<br/>\nheal .. you are loved. you can melee... and strangly enough at 30 i can<br/>\nkill two blues and still have enough mana to heal me to full after<br/>\nwords ...go figure eq_clerics@onelist here i come<br/>\n--- Wizard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wizard@...\">wizard@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Wizard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wizard@...\">wizard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dear eq friends!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When i started a game it was very vell balanced and<br/>\n&gt; i can say there were<br/>\n&gt; many people trying all classes and it was funny, but<br/>\n&gt; as game advance new<br/>\n&gt; specialized tactics come out and in many times<br/>\n&gt; Verant is a last one to see<br/>\n&gt; exploit and not a first one as it have to be. Now i<br/>\n&gt; have seen that at 5<br/>\n&gt; newer servers first to reach a higest lv are druids<br/>\n&gt; !! at valos zek pvp<br/>\n&gt; server it is a same reason is of course kiting and<br/>\n&gt; dot spells wich they<br/>\n&gt; have. This is something wrong !<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Second thing i noted was farming of glowing stain<br/>\n&gt; wich we have seen in last<br/>\n&gt; 2 weeks from nowere to see there are now nearly<br/>\n&gt; every higer lv caster have<br/>\n&gt; one! It is funny for my glowing black stone wich was<br/>\n&gt; a hard to get item is<br/>\n&gt; now nearly underpowered item :) This was stoped<br/>\n&gt; unfortunatly to late and<br/>\n&gt; now we wich dont get a stain will never get it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now i start to see one other problem.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Powerfull items are comming from higer lv players<br/>\n&gt; wich give or sell or<br/>\n&gt; twinkle lower lv when they get mre powerful items.<br/>\n&gt; This items make item<br/>\n&gt; dipendent mele class out of any balance on lower<br/>\n&gt; lvs!!  Spell casters are<br/>\n&gt; particulary sensibile to this as they are not item<br/>\n&gt; dependent for their<br/>\n&gt; power but it dependens on spells, mana to damage<br/>\n&gt; ratio, mana to healing ..<br/>\n&gt; protection ratio wich is all hardcoded to level. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So what hapends .. to make example i spend some time<br/>\n&gt; building a wizard and<br/>\n&gt; a warrior to 6 lv and i twinked them with items to<br/>\n&gt; make a probe.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Warrior with nearly full large bronze and fine stell<br/>\n&gt; sword .. Wizard with<br/>\n&gt; full woven, rts skull, +10 mana earings ect..<br/>\n&gt; Normaly warrior dies on 3<br/>\n&gt; high blues 100% on this lv .... wizard dont have<br/>\n&gt; mana to kill 2 high blue .. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My warrior take against 8 !!! BLUES and survived<br/>\n&gt; .... so he realy have been<br/>\n&gt; affecter imensly... Wizard tryed against same 2<br/>\n&gt; blues and he died in same<br/>\n&gt; mode as before.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Counting im only a 27 lv so i can twinkle my guys<br/>\n&gt; only a little :)) one 50<br/>\n&gt; lv guy can make this diference much much higer.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Same effect i have seen in mistmore .. grouping with<br/>\n&gt; many people i have<br/>\n&gt; seen what diference can make overpowered items...<br/>\n&gt; warrior hitting for 70 a<br/>\n&gt; hit it is 140 - 160 counting a bash ... without mana<br/>\n&gt; use a turn!!  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wizard at 27 lv can do only 178 damage and he will<br/>\n&gt; be out Of mana in 6 - 7<br/>\n&gt; hits a warrior can go without end and with god items<br/>\n&gt; he will alos need less<br/>\n&gt; cleric healing!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wisdom classes normaly are more item dipendent so<br/>\n&gt; they are affected a bit<br/>\n&gt; less then INT based so called pure caster. This<br/>\n&gt; effect is mostly visible on<br/>\n&gt; my old server fenin ro where are many high lv people<br/>\n&gt; producting one sea of<br/>\n&gt; overpowered items !<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I dont know what effect this items have on higer lv<br/>\n&gt; casters but as i heared<br/>\n&gt; some opinions...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; a. new items for mele class help them strike faster<br/>\n&gt; and for more damage<br/>\n&gt; (stronger weapons) take less damage and recover hits<br/>\n&gt; faster (rubicite<br/>\n&gt; breastplate with rubicite effect !) !! Items for<br/>\n&gt; mana users only gives more<br/>\n&gt; mana... wich in end mean more meditation and looking<br/>\n&gt; in stupid book (verant<br/>\n&gt; guys will you finaly do something here), casters<br/>\n&gt; dont get faster mana<br/>\n&gt; regenaration items, less resists items, more damage<br/>\n&gt; for their spells items<br/>\n&gt; !!!! <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I see this as a very big problem wich will get worse<br/>\n&gt; as time pass if<br/>\n&gt; something is not done. What are yours opinion on<br/>\n&gt; this are there any<br/>\n&gt; possible solution wich you see for this?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Silverion Dragonirder<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; High elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\n&gt; Fenin Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; moderator mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;          Earn Cash and Prizes for you Opinions!<br/>\n&gt; How would you like to have a voice in the<br/>\n&gt; marketplace and be<br/>\n&gt; rewarded for it?
