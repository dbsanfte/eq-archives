He&#39;s really not that hard to find.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople seem to think Water Crystal staff should sell for so much , even though<br/>\nthe stats are not so good.  He just want to sell for a lot cuz they are greedy<br/>\nand not many ppl know where Webclaw Spawns.<br/>\n<br/>\nbtw, Webclaw is a named Goblin, i can&#39;t remember his last name.<br/>\n<br/>\nhave fun ! and get ur guild to help !</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
