One or two is enough.  At first you wont<br/>\nsee much healing done per bandage but as your skill<br/>\nincrease, you will heal more damage and use fewer<br/>\nbandages.  I&#39;m not sure where the amount healed per<br/>\nbandage tops out, I have heard 25 poits per bandage<br/>\nbut I dont know that for sure.  They are kind of<br/>\nexpensive to buy at ove 5 sp each and I generally buy<br/>\nthem 30 at a time.  If you are poor, try to find a<br/>\ncleric or mage and get them to summon some for you.  I<br/>\ngo around healing eveyone that will let me.  It&#39;s a<br/>\ngood way to make friends and to increase my skill.<br/>\nIt&#39;s at 44 now and has a long way to go to max<br/>\nout..I&#39;m almost lvl 14 now.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
