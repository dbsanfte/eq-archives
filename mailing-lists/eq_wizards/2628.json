All other<br/>\nhave get significant buffs and yet they were much easier to play then wizard!<br/>\nWizard is hard to play but i like it very much but verant don&#39;t have very<br/>\nwell defined a ruole of wizard, they tok from wizard too much to create<br/>\nother classes, and leaved it without much spell combination possibilitys<br/>\nyou have  to get your best DD spells, some low spell to give final strikes,<br/>\nyour best root, skin, and every now and then change one slot to cast buffs.<br/>\n- Enchanter with buffs, debuffs, int bosting, mana bosting, luul, pets is<br/>\nrealy great to make diferent aproachs they are also only enchant metal caster. <br/>\n- Magician have nearly our fire power it is lillte bit slower but have a<br/>\npet summon food, water, bags no weight, damage shields, ect. <br/>\n- Necro rules in his solo play but is a litlle bit hampered with starting<br/>\nfactions. <br/>\n- Wizard is master dimensional traveler, Direct damage dealer (fastest of<br/>\nthem all and do bigest visible hits, wich is most dangerus thing in game as<br/>\nmonsters get pissed fast and go on you!), wizard is also one of best<br/>\nrooters. But wizard deal best with one blu 2 gets you run for your life,<br/>\nwhite will vaste all your mana if and it is realy if you can win and yellow<br/>\nnever dream about it. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut to say wizard class at later lv are very nice with teleports you realy<br/>\ncan go to sell from middle of dungeon travel fast, this is one nice<br/>\nadvantage. You deal much damage and any god group know to aprecite this,<br/>\ngod group you know very fast if you miss a hit they will leve all and try<br/>\nto get a MOB from you. If they leave you to deal with it alone more then<br/>\nonce my advise is to get out of group fast.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 03.20 27/06/99 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: MAD Iguana &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wargod@...\">wargod@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I know that the purpose of the wizard class is to do heavy damage quickly.<br/>\n&gt;A friend of mine was telling me that mages do almost the same damage plus<br/>\n&gt;they have a pet to fight for them.  He does close dmg to me now at lvl 20.<br/>\n&gt;He says at lvl 49 mages do lava bolt which does 950 whereas ice comet does<br/>\n&gt;1100.  That is almost the same damage as the wizard.  So it seems to me<br/>\n&gt;that there isn&#39;t much of a use to be a wizard if you can be a mage and do<br/>\n&gt;almost the same amount of direct damage plus you have a pet.  So anyone<br/>\n&gt;tell me something good about the wiz class to make it worth playing them to<br/>\n&gt;high levels?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Silverion Dragonirder<br/>\n<br/>\nHigh elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\nFenin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\nmoderator mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
