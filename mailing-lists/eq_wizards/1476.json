I think it would be an interesting project to figure these out.<br/>\nThe way I see it we would need to compile the following information.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Spell cast<br/>\n2) Your Level / Channeling Skill Level<br/>\n3) Actual Time to cast (From button push until the casting bar finishes)<br/>\n4) Time for partial recovery (From button push until the next spell can be<br/>\ncast)<br/>\n5) Time for complete recovery (From button push until the spell can be recast)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you are interested, breakout that old shock -o- frost and stopwatch and<br/>\nhelp me with this endeavor.  Any questions, comments, additions or deletions<br/>\nplease feel free to respond.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nMalkin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
