On a rare occasion, they do drop upwards of 40pp, but the <br/>\ntime that it takes to kill them and the high risk of death barely makes it <br/>\nworthwhile.  If you just wanna show off to the lower levels in Oasis, try <br/>\ngoing back once you&#39;re 39 (or better yet once you have Ice Comet), you&#39;ll <br/>\nhave a much better chance and you&#39;ll need all that extra mana.  Don&#39;t use <br/>\nroot while you are fighting, use Bonds of Force instead.  Also, keep a zone <br/>\nline close cuz you might need it.  =)<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nErdrick, TheRegulators<br/>\n&lt;www.theregulators.org&gt;<br/>\nRallos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
