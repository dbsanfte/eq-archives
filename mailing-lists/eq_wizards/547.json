Mostly success stories. However, I<br/>\n&gt;have had less success counting on this tactic than I expected.  I usually<br/>\n&gt;Shadowstep a mere 10yds or so away which isn&#39;t enough distance to even run,<br/>\n&gt;much less Gate.  (when I Shadowstep just for fun/testing, it works great!)<br/>\n&gt;Am I the only one having little success with this tactic because the<br/>\n&gt;distance often isn&#39;t great enough?  Is it dependent on having &#39;open space&#39;?<br/>\n&gt;(in other words, in a dungeon will this work very well or will you &#39;hit&#39; a<br/>\n&gt;wall and stop)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Draco, 14th lvl Wizard<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;You can now easily share photos and documents with your fellow list members<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Check out our homepage for details on how to use our new shared files<br/>\n </span></blockquote>feature!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
