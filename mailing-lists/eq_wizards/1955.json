","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-712524719\">OK, a couple of thoughts...I like the idea of cutting back on the number of<br/>\nrequests...it sounds like we are just whining when we send a huge list of<br/>\ndemands!<br/>\nSome things I think we should cut from the letter:<br/>\nSpeciallization - Verant is already working on this, and the problem is<br/>\ncertainly not class specific!  Don&#39;t bug them when they are already working<br/>\non it!<br/>\n<br/>\nHaste Spell (for fast travel) - Don&#39;t push this one...druids and Shamans<br/>\nhave Spirit of Wolf and I don&#39;t really think this is appropriate for<br/>\nWizards...maybe the Line of Sight Shadow Step idae would be better...<br/>\n<br/>\nMax Meditation Skill - Don&#39;t bother, we already have a way to decrease our<br/>\ndowntime with meditation...anybody ever played a warrior?  lol 20-30 MINUTES<br/>\nof healing at high levels!<br/>\n<br/>\nChat server access while medding - I don&#39;t think this will ever<br/>\nhappen...Verant has gone out of their way to make it nearly impossible to<br/>\nrun multiple programs with EQ (which is GREAT for keeping the hack programs<br/>\nat bay!)...allowing for the code to attach to a different server is probably<br/>\njust not going to happen...tough to code, and opens the door to hackers.<br/>\n<br/>\nOfficial Feedback on Planned Changes - that&#39;s what the test server is all<br/>\nabout...and I, personally would rather if Verant&#39;s people were working on<br/>\ntweaking the code rather than posting messages on the Web about what the<br/>\nWOULD be working on if they weren&#39;t writing HTML updates on things they were<br/>\nchanging...<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep the letter SHORT and to the POINT.<br/>\nDon&#39;t include complaints about other classes...everybody thins THEIR class<br/>\nis underpowered (trust me, I&#39;ve heard from just about<br/>\neveryvody...well...maybe not the Necros, but we KNOW how THEY are!<br/>\n<br/>\nSeran, Up and Coming Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Tyson Schoepflin [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:schoty@...\">schoty@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 27, 1999 12:55 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_wizards] The worth of a Wizard (long)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Tyson Schoepflin&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:schoty@...\">schoty@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe changes look for the most part very good.
