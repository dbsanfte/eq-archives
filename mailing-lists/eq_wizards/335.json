Best instance is when you have a lead tank.  Odds<br/>\n&gt; are he will take most of the hits, and prolly from two monsters.  He<br/>\n&gt; will get hit about 10 times from one monster before its dead, and<br/>\n&gt; another 20 or so from the second (each doing a measly 2 damage you<br/>\n&gt; say!!).  That is about 30*2=60 points of damage, all for 15 mana -<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s a HUGE mana/damage ratio there (4.0).  Even with just one<br/>\n&gt; monster, 10 hits is 20 dam - that&#39;s 1.33 ratio - better than any other<br/>\n&gt; spell you have up to at least 20th if not higher.  Oh- it&#39;s also great<br/>\n&gt; practice for your abjuration - a skill that is otherwise lagging<br/>\n&gt; horribly cause you don&#39;t need to refresh your shielding that frequently.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lastly - I tend to agree with the person who said this list has a lot of<br/>\n&gt; spam, but the problem is it is all basically topic appropriate.  I<br/>\n&gt; personally would like to see a more focused list, maybe two lists here,<br/>\n&gt; but that isn&#39;t gonna happen.  I already switched to digest when I got<br/>\n&gt; hit with the initial 200+ mail, but still!  Any idea from anyone how we<br/>\n&gt; can make this more manageable?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Micon / Karana<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Did you know that we add over 1,000 new e-mail communities every day?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Explore a new hobby, discover a new friend, laugh at a new joke!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your free, private email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.excite.com/\">http://mail.excite.com/</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
