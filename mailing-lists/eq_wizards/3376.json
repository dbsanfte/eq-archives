It would be best if you can get<br/>\na group all above 40 and clear the place as you go.  A cleric is probably a<br/>\ngood thing to have here as the damage can pile up quick.

A<br/>\nbetter item for us is the runed cowel from Lower Guk 2ac 5wis 9int.  It<br/>\nhappens to be the rare drop, but personally its an easier area to get to.<br/>\nJust a much longer camp.
