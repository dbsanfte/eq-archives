The cape is ok, but only for its AC factor, or<br/>\nif you intend to duel casters.<br/>\n<br/>\nItems of importance for us:<br/>\n\t+X vs something (for anyone in fact)<br/>\n\t+X INT<br/>\n\t+X MANA<br/>\n\t+X AGI (for anyone in fact)<br/>\n\t\t(agility is the skill to avoid being hit)<br/>\n<br/>\neventually +X STR, if you want to carry more loot. But I know I&#39;d trade<br/>\ninstantaneously the Cutthroat ring (+ to DEX) for any MANA +X ring, even<br/>\na lowly +5 mana. Agility is good to have, because it means you might be<br/>\nable to Shadow Step/Gate when mobs have decided to hold their nightly<br/>\nmeeting around your cooling body, and insist to complete your preparation.<br/>\n<br/>\n(alas those enchanter types make +5 mana rings that cost way more than the<br/>\n cutthroat ring. Insane: DEX increase should be so much more valuable than<br/>\n straight mana increases)<br/>\n<br/>\n+ to CHA is a little useful to get those extra silver when selling.<br/>\n+ to WIS is rumored to be useful to get better chances of success in skills<br/>\n\tuse (???)<br/>\n+ to DEX and STA is useless, it helps in melee combat and nowhere else.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
