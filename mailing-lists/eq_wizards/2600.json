Maybe I just haven&#39;t hit the jackpot <br/>\nyet, but I would buy them in the city until you find that little gold mine <br/>\nyourself.  Lava is a good place but at your level you will probably con a <br/>\nlot of the creatures green there.  The lava crawlers and lava basilisks <br/>\nwill be an exception but bas hit you with a spell that turns you to rock <br/>\nand stuns you for a few moments while they pound you hard and crawlers cast <br/>\nas well.  You need someone else to team with on those as they also tend to <br/>\nresist root very well.  You could try to kill the NPC Erudite Hykallen and <br/>\nher pet out in the zone at the gobbie camp, but she is a nec, I believe, <br/>\nand she casts some whopper spells on you and doesn&#39;t seem to have down time <br/>\nto recover like we do.  Najena would be a good place for you.  Get invis <br/>\nspell for sure when you get your level and all the others you can get <br/>\nwithout research and make your way in and fight fight fight :)...lots of <br/>\ngoodies inside.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 10:39 AM 6/29/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Robert Jones &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rjones@...\">rjones@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Could someone give me information on good places to hunt at lvl 16.
