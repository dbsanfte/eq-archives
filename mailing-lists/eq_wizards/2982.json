Stay away from the griffon type stuff.<br/>\nThey may not have alot of HPs but they hit REALLY hard.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;20 - 23 \tLake rathe Aviac guards (near zone to Arena), soulsek A entrance<br/>\n&gt;tunel(careful of lava), Tentacle terors in najena (root, enstill one and<br/>\n&gt;run to zone where you can fight other in peace)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>20 - mid 30s For soloing the Bird cage in South Karana is pretty good but<br/>\nits relatively camped at all hours.  Just be kind to others and if your<br/>\npatient you will find stuff to fight.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;23 - 28\tMistmore lake and canyon area(pull with eye, root one if 2 commes<br/>\n&gt;and fight near zone), soulsek a safe room near zone to Nefagens lair(<br/>\n&gt;enstill one, root and kill other in safe room then zone a sec to kobolds<br/>\n&gt;lair if you dont have enough mana to kill other one, careful if greater<br/>\n&gt;kobold is not camped zone back and meditate invisible) this two places are<br/>\n&gt;dangerus in any case as you can pull caster wich have low hip points but<br/>\n&gt;cast force shock wich is realy dangerus (i have mag resistance 65 and i<br/>\n&gt;resist one of 8 times :( only)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This was my bit of advices for lower lv any other from 27 to 50 is<br/>\n&gt;apreciated :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Personally I don&#39;t like to solo.  Its god awful boring.  They exp may be<br/>\naver so slightly better but those long sessions of medding make it very<br/>\ndull when working alone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;P.S. i tryed to go to najena but im still to low to solo there in i tryed<br/>\n&gt;BC room ... died, named necros are to high other dont give me exp anymore,<br/>\n&gt;ogre captain is lv 27 white to me and it finish very bad... sow runned to<br/>\n&gt;zone with 5 hp :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well I hate to say it but you missed out on the fun in Najean.  I started<br/>\nin Najena at around level 16 and went there off and on till about level 24.<br/>\n Sure the Oger captain and the 3 major NPCs are still good to kill for me<br/>\nbut najena is definately what I would call a good group dungeon.  There<br/>\naren&#39;t nearely as many trains as some of the other dungeons (guk for<br/>\ninstance), but its not a place I would recomend for soloing unless you like<br/>\nto zone in and out alot.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I have never tried it solo I believe I could (at 34th) kill<br/>\ncyclopses in the Rathe Mts.  And I have herd that at about 36th a friend of<br/>\nmine said he soloed a Hill Giant.  But you better prey your root holds<br/>\nbecause darn they hit hard.  Hill Giants and Griffons are blue into the<br/>\nupper 40s. (so I hear)<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain I would just like to mention.  IMO we (wizards) are NOT a solo class.<br/>\n Sure we can solo a bit, assuming our root holds up, but we work great in<br/>\ngroups.  Once you crack level 29 you become so much more useful to a group.<br/>\n I can sum up this new advantage in four words.     &quot;Evac to North Karana&quot;<br/>\nI can&#39;t tell you how many times I have saved my group by keeping this spell<br/>\nhandy.  I usually wait for the call from the lead group healer.  If he is<br/>\nOOM and we still have lost to fight.  its Evac time.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack, Knight Defender of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
