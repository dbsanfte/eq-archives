I like the idea of having the monster slowly start to get his speed back..   ..and the transition from stopped to full speed would take much longer as you increased in levels, and as you upgraded that line of spells..

Hey Verant,� heres any easy fix for you.� Make Fade go in the direction we are facing a minimum distance...make it a quick escape spell.� Put the onus on the Wizard to face himself in his chosen escape routes direction.� Things start to go bad, Fade and run like hell.� Done. Wouldnt really need Shadowstep then would we??? Frees up another spell...hmmm.<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; I read somewhere a Verant programmer said he only had so much room in a database for spells...thats kind of sad really...maybe that is why there are some missing animations and shared animations.<br/>\n&gt; Personally, I would rather have to research and or quest for ALL OF OUR SPELLS,� IF and only IF we could design them the way we wanted...� so that my Fade was different than someone elses... but I know that is a pipe dream so dont flame me for it okay?<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; Sorry about the long post, happens when you are a fast typer...<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
