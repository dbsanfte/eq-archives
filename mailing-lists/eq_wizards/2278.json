That&#39;s probably why <br/>\nyou can never find a group.  Maybe because you are so socially retarded that <br/>\nyou don&#39;t know how to communicate with people in groups.  I rarely have <br/>\nproblems finding a group, and if i spend 30 mins or more and can&#39;t find a <br/>\ngroup, i&#39;m going to log and do something in RL for a change.<br/>\n&quot;IT IS BECAUSE WE CANNOT FIND GROUPS&quot; wah, wah, poor baby.  Suck it up, <br/>\nyou&#39;re a loser and nobody wants to group with you.  Continue to KS. What do <br/>\ni care? i&#39;m beyond those lvls where it happens.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;      You guys don&#39;t seem to understand why some of us (such as myself) <br/>\n&gt;kill<br/>\n&gt;steal all the time.  IT IS BECAUSE WE CANNOT FIND GROUPS !!!  simple as <br/>\n&gt;that.<br/>\n&gt;no groups, KS !  thats it.  I don&#39;t feel like sitting on my ass for 30 - 40 <br/>\n&gt;min<br/>\n&gt;waiting for ppl to group, while shouting all the time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1) people hate us for shouting so much<br/>\n&gt;2) people don&#39;t message us even if they need group member (weird)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      You ppl who are against kill stealers by shouting their names out so <br/>\n&gt;no one<br/>\n&gt;will group them are so god damn stupid, all you have to do is group with <br/>\n&gt;them<br/>\n&gt;and BINGO !! no more kill stealing.   If i am getting good xp , why kill <br/>\n&gt;steal<br/>\n&gt;??  there is no point for me to risk my life trying to get xp from some <br/>\n&gt;monster<br/>\n&gt;6 others are beating up on.  I rarely die in a group since I stand so far <br/>\n&gt;back,<br/>\n&gt;but while kill stealing if i beat them up too much, the mob might run to me <br/>\n&gt;with<br/>\n&gt;no one else helping.   If you really want to stop kill stealing, then just <br/>\n&gt;group<br/>\n&gt;with those people so you guys can take on higher mobs together.   I would<br/>\n&gt;happily stop KS anytime during the day to Group with ppl passing by.  I <br/>\n&gt;only KS<br/>\n&gt;while waiting for groups and i do shout for groups while i KS as well.<br/>\n&gt;People are stupid and don&#39;t know how to stop a problem,  oh well... what <br/>\n&gt;can you<br/>\n&gt;do ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Join a new list today! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
