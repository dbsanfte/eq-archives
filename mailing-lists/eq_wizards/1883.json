When I joined all I heard <br/>\nwas bitching &quot;We suck, fix us&quot; so verant did. I got rid of my enchanter, he <br/>\nwas boring.<br/>\n<br/>\nI made a magician, joined the magician list. All I heard was &quot;We suck, make <br/>\nus better&quot;. So verant did. I dropped the magician, also boring.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile I had my wizard, just joined this list... All I hear is &quot;We suck, <br/>\nde-nerf us&quot;. So, you think it&#39;ll happen 3 times in a row? My guess would be <br/>\nyes. So let&#39;s forego the silly chit chat and organize a protest like the <br/>\nenchanter did... Except not OFFLINE (oy, dumb idea), perhaps all the wizards <br/>\ngo to a few different zones. Like, South qeynos, west freeport, greater <br/>\nfaydark.<br/>\n<br/>\nCore the 10th lvl Wizard (!)<br/>\n<br/>\nPS= Waiting to play a necro and join their list, hearing the same crap.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW my enchanter made it to lvl 9<br/>\nMagician to lvl 7<br/>\nRanger to lvl 15<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: James Dwyer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdwar@...\">jdwar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I just reached lvl 20, got all my spells, and I guess am a little<br/>\n&gt;dissapointed. I do enjoy blasting for 170 points of damage, but it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;almost as if Verant has made these new spells EASIER to resist. For<br/>\n&gt;instance, I fight Orcs in oasis. Low blue orcs and they are resisting my<br/>\n&gt;new shock spell. They NEVER resist my 16th level lightning bolt. You<br/>\n&gt;would think that a higher level spell would be as or harder to resist.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Another example is enstill. This ONLY works on greens. There is no blue,<br/>\n&gt;white, yellow, red that I have found that is successfully enstilled. In<br/>\n&gt;fact, when I fight the 20th level orcs that con black to me, they always<br/>\n&gt;resist. Yet root works on them about 25% of the time. I was hoping that<br/>\n&gt;when I got enstill it would be easier to solo because it is more<br/>\n&gt;powerful, alas it isn&#39;t so.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I haven&#39;t tried my new gate spells due to the fact that I would have a<br/>\n&gt;long run back to Neriak after trying them. The sight spell is fairly<br/>\n&gt;useless, and I don&#39;t know what to fight to make use of the elemental<br/>\n&gt;shield ( which would only help me anyway and not a group ).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am heading to Lake Rathe now and hopefully my spells work better<br/>\n&gt;there. If not, mayhaps we should petition to get this change. I mean<br/>\n&gt;come on, I am about as useful as a 16th level wizard against red if<br/>\n&gt;BLUES resist my new 20th level spells. While monsters are getting<br/>\n&gt;progressively better I seem to be getting progressively incapable to<br/>\n&gt;handle them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On the feedback thing, the magicians and enchanters have shown that it<br/>\n&gt;is possible to get Verants attention and get them to change things. If<br/>\n&gt;what I&#39;m doing is whining then so be it, I am merely pointing out what I<br/>\n&gt;noticed upon reaching 20, and it doesn&#39;t seem good.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Croesus Illuminatus (Xegony)<br/>\n&gt;*Tanks stab em, Wizards slab em*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  bringing the world together.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Join a new list today!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
