All the other spellcasting classes have pets (including<br/>\nhybrids with their charms). Instead of getting a pet, since we are so<br/>\nmana dependent ( and the other classes have pets which do WAY more for<br/>\nthe mana then we can do with DD over time) we get a familiar.<br/>\n<br/>\nA familiar is similar to a pet ( a MOB that would follow us ) but it<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be for battle. It would act as a mana battery increasing our<br/>\ntotal mana. It would cast a lot more mana to cast than it gives us. If<br/>\nit dies, we lose the amount of mana that it gives us and maybe damage us<br/>\na bit. It will not attack or defend. It will attract the frenzy of<br/>\nintelligent MOBs but it will also turn invisible with us.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt could be a small cat, dog, skunk, whatever (random?) and we would get<br/>\nmaybe 3 or 4 throughout our ranks that have increasing amount of mana.<br/>\nThis would offset a lot of our complaints on being a unique class, being<br/>\nable to compete, etc. Plus it would be fun! Wizards throughout lore have<br/>\nused familiars to aid them in their studies. Since we rely ENTIRELY on<br/>\nour mana to survive (unlike others who have permanent pet to aid) this<br/>\nwould help us get that extra root off and run, or that last blast to get<br/>\nthe 2nd blue.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think? I know it&#39;s unlikely it will happen, but it sure<br/>\nsounds like a good idea :) And it would make us unique and it would<br/>\nenhance our artillerly challenged butts :P<br/>\n<br/>\nCroesus Illuminatus (Xegony)<br/>\n*Go for the eyes Boo!
