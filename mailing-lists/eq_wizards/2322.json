Hunt you till you cry, and then kill you, no <br/>\n&gt;matter<br/>\n&gt;what your friends do to try to save&#92;taunt&#92;interpose for you.  I have to<br/>\n&gt;stand so far back that I don&#39;t even get the combat messages or sounds, and<br/>\n&gt;that doesn&#39;t even work all the time.  Yes I&#39;m kicking ass and taking<br/>\n&gt;names... but at what cost...  (It was great when a dwarf was complaining<br/>\n&gt;about me being in the group as a exp. stealer when I shocked of lighting<br/>\n&gt;once too often and  the monster left the party 100 yards back in preference<br/>\n&gt;for me. :)  shut him up quick *chuckle*)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Next I have discovered the POWER of the druids...  What I&#39;m about to relate<br/>\n&gt;to you was fully observed and discussed with a druid in my clan...  She at<br/>\n&gt;14th level gets a spell called conflageration(sp)  it does 65 points of<br/>\n&gt;damage for 35 mana. 1.86 dam per mana.  I do at level 13, 79 points of<br/>\n&gt;damage for 60 mana. 1.32 dam per mana.  We casted the spells at close to <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;same rate... we timed 5 of mine to 4 of hers.  How can we claim to be the<br/>\n&gt;masters of anything after this little show of power? btw at the end of the<br/>\n&gt;test she did 260 hps dam for 140 mana and I did 395 hps dam for 240 mana.<br/>\n&gt;Fruther I would like you to realize that when I get to level 14 i&#39;ll do 1<br/>\n&gt;more hps dam in a slightly shorter period of time.  Not bad but nothing <br/>\n&gt;like<br/>\n&gt;i would expect from the masters of damage that I expected and still do<br/>\n&gt;expect the wizard to be.  (she pulled a monster off of me with her spells<br/>\n&gt;once and another time she pulled the monster on herself after a set of<br/>\n&gt;spells [it saved vs 2 of mine I had cast doing only 36 and 39 respectivly])<br/>\n&gt;(these were wolly calfs, and orc Mounteneers/shamans)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Next, Wizards are AWSOME at learning skills.  We all choose some of the<br/>\n&gt;highest int scores we can get so that we have the most mana, but this also<br/>\n&gt;gives us the fastest skill increase rates of anyone.  I get all my skills<br/>\n&gt;maxed out after about 15 to 20 attempts of the skill (5 points) at a 142<br/>\n&gt;int.  Now this is great!  But what value does it hold for us?  So we max <br/>\n&gt;our<br/>\n&gt;skills before we get half a buble of exp into our next one?  This reminds <br/>\n&gt;me<br/>\n&gt;of the &#39;we do the most damage&#39; thing but if we try to &#39;do the most damage&#39;<br/>\n&gt;we are monster enemy number 1!(well before the monster is dead I might add)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ah yes the one good trend I&#39;m seeing, Level 12 brought new found respect.  <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;can find a group fast now... very fast(some may be that I joined/started a<br/>\n&gt;Guild).  I think the fact that I stand a mile away and draw in the monster<br/>\n&gt;has a demoralizing effect on our tanks and makes them understand that we <br/>\n&gt;are<br/>\n&gt;now dealing more damage than they can.  At least it is a love hate<br/>\n&gt;relationship, they hate us because they love what we can do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;oh well I&#39;ll report more after I hit 16th+ :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;RutreeII<br/>\n&gt;Cazic-Thul<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
