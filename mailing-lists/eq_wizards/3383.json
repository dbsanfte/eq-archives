The next time I was there, I stood under it, and<br/>\nstill, no effect.  I never take damage from it.

I was also invisable at the time.<br/>\n&gt; Well I got stuck in the window.  Suddenly I popped out and fell backwards<br/>\n&gt; into the lava pool.  At the time I had major shield, Leather Skin and<br/>\n&gt; Elemntal Protextion on me.  At first I nearly paniced but then I started<br/>\n&gt; banging my 6 key. It was my hot key for gate.  The whole time I was<br/>\nthinking<br/>\n&gt; that this was the end, and I&#39;d never get my corps back. After two tries, I<br/>\n&gt; got a gate off.  When I materialized at m bind point, I had 22 hp left.<br/>\n&gt; From what I hear, I can  consider myself extreamly lucky to have lived.  I<br/>\n&gt; think I would have been a lot luckier if I had not fell in at all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
