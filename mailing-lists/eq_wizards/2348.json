I found that<br/>\n&gt;leveling<br/>\n&gt;&gt; was very slow indeed and it was getting really boring camping with my<br/>\n&gt;groups<br/>\n&gt;&gt; till the sun comes up.   However, i was on a few days ago in the morning<br/>\n&gt;and my<br/>\n&gt;&gt; regular group wasn&#39;t on.  I shouted for about 30 min and no one wanted to<br/>\n&gt;join<br/>\n&gt;&gt; up with me for bandit hunting.  Out of boredom, i went down to the bandit<br/>\n&gt;camps<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to see if i can find a group there(West karanas on top of Hill).  I found<br/>\n&gt;this<br/>\n&gt;&gt; group of 6 there camping the bandits so i just sat around shouting for<br/>\n&gt;groups<br/>\n&gt;&gt; once again. But while those guys were fighting the bandits, i thought,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>hey<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;might<br/>\n&gt;&gt; as well try to see if i can kill one solo, if i can&#39;t, then they will<br/>\n&gt;probably<br/>\n&gt;&gt; help me anyways.  I attacked one bandit and killedh im in 3 shots with<br/>\n&gt;Shock of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Lightning.  and WOW ! so much XP !!!   so i just kept going.  I got<br/>\n </span></blockquote>around<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;10-15<br/>\n&gt;&gt; pp in 30 min and gained 1 bubble of xp. normall i gain 1 bubble in 6-8<br/>\n&gt;hours of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; playing.   FINALLY ! i found how to have fun with my wizard and not be<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;lamer<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that spent all his time trying to group and get shitty XP cuz of the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>split<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; between members !!   who cares if they think i am a kill stealer, its not<br/>\n&gt;like<br/>\n&gt;&gt; they can do anything about it HAHAHA.  too bad for them that they wont<br/>\n&gt;group<br/>\n&gt;&gt; with me.  I also found some wizards are really stupid, the group  of 6 i<br/>\n&gt;was<br/>\n&gt;&gt; stealing from had a lvl 14 wizard and a lvl 11 wizard. and none of them<br/>\n&gt;could<br/>\n&gt;&gt; stop me from stealing. its odd but true... ppl just don&#39;t think.. oh<br/>\n&gt;well.. i<br/>\n&gt;&gt; hope you all try to just have fun and not give a shit what other ppl<br/>\n </span></blockquote>think<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; once.   then you might find why Varent say we are a balanced race, i<br/>\n&gt;personally<br/>\n&gt;&gt; think we were made to give grief to others heehhe.. j/k   I personally<br/>\n&gt;think we<br/>\n&gt;&gt; should be changed to Erudite Magical Theives hehe..<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Looking for a new hobby?
