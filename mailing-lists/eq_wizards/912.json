I plan on traveling to<br/>\n&gt;Euridan and hanging out with the NPC&#39;s there in the wizards guild.  I plan<br/>\n&gt;on sitting down next to some of them.  Should this improve my skill?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I noticed I have Elder Elvish as a skill now (maybe because I used to hang<br/>\n&gt;out in my hometown of Felwithe allot and just picked it up)  I do not want<br/>\n&gt;to spend another training point in Old Euridan or any language for that<br/>\n&gt;fact.  I also do not want to have someone SPAM to me anymore unless I pay<br/>\n&gt;them to SPAM me ...and me alone (not fair to others in my group).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Ziffnab of Xegony<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;17th Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Visit our homepage and share with us your experiences at ONElist of the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Week!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
