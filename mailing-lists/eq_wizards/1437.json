Early levels are lower of 20 from 20 to 40 are mid levels and from<br/>\n40 to<br/>\n50 are high levels. And a diference of any class with diferent stiles of play<br/>\ngive you very god replayability only what i must admit is that for changing<br/>\nclass when you have played it 1 year is realy hard to start over for another 1<br/>\nyear or more only to see what you have alredy seen in new role.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS. wizard have negative hit on xp not so big as multi class but not much<br/>\nlower<br/>\nif a multi have a 25 % wizard is i think something like 10 - 15%. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; I have never played a Necro (not in my roleplaying style), but from what<br/>\n&gt; people say, they are fairly well rounded and in game terms they provide a<br/>\n&gt; nice roleplaying oppurtunity and fill a void for &quot;evil misunderstood&quot; type<br/>\n&gt; class, like the shadowknight.<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; Of course the Magic-User Class would have to have some spells removed, but a<br/>\n&gt; lot of the spells are also common.<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; Just some wishful thinking guys and girls, dont take it to seriously or to<br/>\n&gt; heart...it will never happen anyways! ;-)<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; Alhassim, 7th (8th after today, yay!)
