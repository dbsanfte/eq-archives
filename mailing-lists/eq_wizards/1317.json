Damn I wish I could remember the<br/>\narticle&#92;&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; location on this.  A reporter went to lunch with Smedley and the head<br/>\nprogrammer<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; for the mage classes.  he asked asked them this question and they<br/>\nconfirmed that<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; it was not true, 100% false.  The head caster programmer said that his GM<br/>\n&gt; Character had a Staff of Discord, which is the same staff that the Priest<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; Discord is holding.  Now they didn&#92;&#39;t say this was unattainable for us,<br/>\nnor that<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; killing the Priest of Discord would render it to us.  So may be that their<br/>\nis a<br/>\n&gt; quest to get this staff or something, but there is no way to combine the<br/>\ntwo.<br/>\n&gt; They said you have to decide do you want the 2h staff and its magic or the<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; skull with a dagger/fang or whatever.  So Brad you are correct :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Zakrul The Traveler<br/>\n&gt; Companion<br/>\n&gt; Wizard<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message: 16<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Any of you Wizards out there know what skull, you need to combine with a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ruined Totem Staff...and what NPC combines them for you?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Auraelle<br/>\n&gt; &gt; E&#92;&#39;ci Server<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message: 19<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Unless someone can come right out and give exact NPC names and info<br/>\n&gt; &gt; right now, assume that combining the rts and the skull is just a rumor.<br/>\nAs<br/>\n&gt; &gt; far as I know, the staff that Priests of Discord carry are actually<br/>\n&gt; &gt; _different_ weapons and not a combo of these two items. No one to my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; knowledge has actually been able to combine the two though many like to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; claim that it is possible.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Isand<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message: 23<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Date: Thu, 13 May 1999 18:20:42 -0400<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    From: &#92;&quot;Brad Fetkovich&#92;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetko1@...\">fetko1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Staff Question<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; where did this rumor even get started?  the skull goes in a melee slot,<br/>\nwho<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thought up putting it on a staff?  the priest of discords staff is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; different, it&#92;&#39;s a staff of discord if i&#92;&#39;m not mistaken<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; This mail sent through IMP: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://web.horde.org/imp/\">http://web.horde.org/imp/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where the world talks!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
