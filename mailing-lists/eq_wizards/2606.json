I tried using Tishan&#39;s Clash as recommended by some of <br/>\nthe posts here and I must say that it DOES work pretty well in a group <br/>\nsituation.  It&#39;s a nice spell to start a fight off with as it&#39;s small enough <br/>\ndamage as not to attract attention from the MoB, yet it gives enough stun <br/>\ntime for the tanks to do their work.  I&#39;ve noticed that it&#39;s pretty safe <br/>\ncasting my big spell right after recovery from casting TC....I have yet to <br/>\ntest all the situations.  I&#39;ve alternated TC & nuke spells on the MoBs to <br/>\ngood results.<br/>\n<br/>\nNice to know this Wizard list is actually providing good information again!  <br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 14<br/>\n   Date: Tue, 29 Jun 1999 09:03:12 +0200<br/>\n   From: Wizard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wizard@...\">wizard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Tishan&#39;s Clash - BONE CRUSHING tactic<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Great post i used it tactics when camping a bone crusher in najena he deal<br/>\n&gt;a fair amount of damage and first two pops he nearly get us killed.
