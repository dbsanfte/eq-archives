You all ran 20 min to your fav kill spot.<br/>\n&gt; Played for<br/>\n&gt; hours of fun.  Night is over.  Do you gate home, leaving<br/>\n&gt; your tanks to<br/>\n&gt; run thru what might end up being hostile areas (but usually<br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t), or<br/>\n&gt; do you run with them?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Depends on the time constraints I have.  Usually I will make an effort<br/>\nand escort people to a safe zone.  It&#39;s only fair - they&#39;ve been<br/>\ntanking for me for a long time, usually.  I believe in helping out<br/>\npeople when they need it, and if someone is new to a zone, I will<br/>\nguide and escort.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2nd is harder.  Basically, do you die with your party, or<br/>\n&gt; abandon them<br/>\n&gt; when there is trouble?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, depends on the situation.  If it&#39;s clear everyone is going to<br/>\nbe wiped out whether I stay or not, I usually hit my /loc hotkey to<br/>\nget the location of the (future) corpses, and Gate to safety.  If<br/>\nthere is any hope of saving some of them, I&#39;ll stick around and battle<br/>\nit out.  But there&#39;s no point in sacrificing yourself for the sake of<br/>\nvaliance.  You&#39;ll be of much more use if you can escort your friends<br/>\nto their corpses.  But again, if I can make the difference between<br/>\nlife or death in that battle, I stick around.  I personally don&#39;t care<br/>\nso much if I die, it&#39;s part of the game.  I haven&#39;t died very often.<br/>\nBut the feeling you get when you&#39;ve saved your party in a tight spot<br/>\nis worth the risk.<br/>\n<br/>\nAznyin<br/>\nLevel 12 Erudite Wizard<br/>\nCurrent Residence: Rivervale [Solusek Ro]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
