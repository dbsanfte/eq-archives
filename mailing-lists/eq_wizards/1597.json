Some ppl don&#39;t agree. Very well, as Valacian<br/>\nsuggested,<br/>\n&gt; lets get by this and focus on what we CAN do.  Lets unlock the mysteries<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; the wizard class as it stands now, not what it could be or what it should<br/>\n&gt; be.  That&#39;s what the /feedback feature is for in the game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If we wish to continue to argue the different aspects of the wizard class,<br/>\n&gt; then maybe we should make a new email list for that specific focus.  Don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; get me wrong, I like a good debate as much as the next person, but I think<br/>\n&gt; Valacian is right, we have the potential of scaring ppl away, of doing the<br/>\n&gt; opposite of what this list was created for.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks Valacian for the reality check.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Talarin Kal&#39;Amon, High Elven Wizard<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Valacian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:abryson@...\">abryson@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;EQ Wizards&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, May 19, 1999 6:21 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eq_wizards] Spells, This Forum,Etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Valacian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:abryson@...\">abryson@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I can feel the wrath now...  but I am ready for the comments.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If I may comment - I don&#39;t believe that us discussing what &#39;would be<br/>\nnice&#39;<br/>\n&gt; for Wizard spells really helps us be Wizards.  I really believe that if we<br/>\n&gt; continue to complain or comment on the apparent lack of spells/problems<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; spells that we have, we are not going to achieve what I believe this<br/>\nmailing<br/>\n&gt; list was setup for.  This list is to share information between all Wizards<br/>\n&gt; within Norrath !  We are going to lose potential and current subscribers<br/>\n(me<br/>\n&gt; and I&#39;m sure others), thus losing valuable shared information because of<br/>\nour<br/>\n&gt; ranting and raving about our class.  Remember, Verant is probably not<br/>\n&gt; reading this forum..<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My suggestion:  Let&#39;s talk about ideas and share information that will<br/>\n&gt; help each other play the class that we chose to play.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So far, the most useful thing I have read (besides Spoiler information)<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; the &#39;bug&#39; that allows our Eye of Zoom to unlock doors.
