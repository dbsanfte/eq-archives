Verant has specifically designed the <br/>\ngame with a group in mind, yet we are arguing the value of a wizard <br/>\naccording to his solo ability.  I find that odd.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I can say is, give me a tank, then a target, then the location you want <br/>\nme to dispose of the remains.  If you worry about a creature beating on you, <br/>\nbring a wizard along.  It won&#39;t hit you for long.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a wizard.  I kill things.  I do it well.<br/>\n<br/>\nCalyn of Bristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;So, the max damage that you can do will be 1050dmg assuming no fizzles, <br/>\n&gt;interupts, and no resistance..Im not sure what a warriors HP is like at <br/>\n&gt;that level, as I have never played one myself (anybody help here?) but I <br/>\n&gt;could see you being In a lot of trouble when dueling one..if you get a root <br/>\n&gt;of and manage to take him down from afar with remaining mana all well and <br/>\n&gt;good but wizards are a very feeble class one on one when it comes to <br/>\n&gt;fighting face to face, you end up exhausting your mana trying to get a <br/>\n&gt;quick root in and then backing off to cast dmg spells again..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
