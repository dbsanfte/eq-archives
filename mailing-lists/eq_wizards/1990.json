From what I have seen poison comes in<br/>\nthree levels, and if a cleric uses his lowest level curing spell, he may have<br/>\nto cast it several times before the poison is removed.  Here is my suggestion.<br/>\nGo to the Steamfont Mts and have Meldreth charm your buddy again.  Then cast<br/>\ncancel magic 4 or 5 times and see if it removes the effect.  Well okay your<br/>\nbuddy probably won&#39;t go for it, but give it a shot the next time its necessary<br/>\n<br/>\nTill Tomorrow<br/>\nMalkin<br/>\n<br/>\nJames Guintu wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;James Guintu&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:james@...\">james@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I also am not too sure what the function of Cancel Magic is... I believe it<br/>\n&gt; can undo roots but that seems to be about it....<br/>\n&gt; Yesterday a druid friend and I were grouped fighting evil eyes.  He was<br/>\n&gt; charmed and I finished the eye.  Even after the eye died, my friend was<br/>\n&gt; still charmed and continued to attack me.  I then rooted him(we play on<br/>\n&gt; Rallos Zek), he clicked all of his buffs off(which can still be done when<br/>\n&gt; you are charmed), then cast cancel magic on him.  It said that he felt a bit<br/>\n&gt; dispelled yet it did not cancel the charm.  Does cancel magic only give you<br/>\n&gt; a chance to cancel the charm?  I thought that canceling charm would have<br/>\n&gt; been one of the main purposes of this spell.  Also we tested cancel magic by<br/>\n&gt; him casting stinging swarm(DOT) on me and me canceling.  It seems to work<br/>\n&gt; sometimes, but not always... it may have something to do with being grouped<br/>\n&gt; or not...  Does anyone have any data on how this spell works and when it<br/>\n&gt; will work?  Also should cancel magic work against Necro DOT&#39;s?<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
