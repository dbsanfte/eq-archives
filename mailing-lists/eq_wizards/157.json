I&#39;d like<br/>\n&gt;to add the questions though that are the other casting classes DD<br/>\n&gt;spells as mana efficient as the Wizard? I always seem to be able to<br/>\n&gt;cast many more spells than they can...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Here&#39;s Anj&#39;s take on the Wiz hope it helps some of you:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;The Wizard class in EQ is a hard sell to anyone until<br/>\n&gt;&gt;they get around level 25 or so. Then you start to really<br/>\n&gt;&gt;become one of the finest classes to play in EQ. As you<br/>\n&gt;&gt;level and progress towards that level, you will begin to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;get a sense of what is possible.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;First, your abjuration, evocation, etc. skills are second to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;no other class, including Magicians. Your channeling will<br/>\n&gt;&gt;progress to the point where you cast nearly instantly. The<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Magician will NEVER get that fast.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Also, you will use less mana per dmg point than a Magician<br/>\n&gt;&gt;or any other magic user, and hit with casts for more dmg points<br/>\n&gt;&gt;as well.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;In the mid- to high twenties you will start to get good, for a pure<br/>\n&gt;&gt;caster, armor and melee weapons, though melee is only a hobby<br/>\n&gt;&gt;to your profession of nuclear destruction. You will constantly<br/>\n&gt;&gt;irritate the walkers, as you will come to call them, by instantly<br/>\n&gt;&gt;flicking invisible, or across the field in a Shadow Step random<br/>\n&gt;&gt;port that takes 1 second to cast, or to any of the world&#39;s major<br/>\n&gt;&gt;zones with but a cast.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Sure, you won&#39;t be able to summon food or drink, but I bet the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;group&#39;s Cleric will give you all you want, since you will be the one<br/>\n&gt;&gt;protecting her on the back row while she concentrates on the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;tide of battle and the front row&#39;s health. In fact, you won&#39;t be a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;good Wizard if you participate in most battles. Your job will be to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;conserve precious mana for the important casts. The Griffin is<br/>\n&gt;&gt;about dead but flying out of reach back to 3 other Griffins to get<br/>\n&gt;&gt;help. CRAAAACCCCKKKKKKK BOOOOOOOMMMMMMM goes<br/>\n&gt;&gt;the Wizard and the Griff drops without getting away. The Warriors<br/>\n&gt;&gt;are really glad you&#39;d saved your mana for that big cast.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;What I&#39;m saying is the Wiz becomes the nobility of the spell casters.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;You are an Erudite Wizard, the most awesome of the Wizards. You<br/>\n&gt;&gt;probably have, what, 140 intelligence? Mana in the 400 range ? One<br/>\n&gt;&gt;day you will cast Force Bolts over and over in rapid fire and use almost<br/>\n&gt;&gt;no mana ! Let that goal motivate you !<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;You will be able to group teleport, a complement to the Cleric&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;&gt;high level group invulnerability when it becomes necessary to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;remove the entire group from a disaster in the making. Assume<br/>\n&gt;&gt;the red dragon is pulverizing your 6 members and you know<br/>\n&gt;&gt;you will all die. The Cleric steps back, shouts &quot;QUIT FIGHTING&quot;,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;casts her group divine aura spell, and now the dragon can&#39;t hurt<br/>\n&gt;&gt;anyone anymore for 30 seconds. The Wiz jumps up, and starts<br/>\n&gt;&gt;a group teleport spell to, say, Greater Faydark Gate. When the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;gate holds, the invulnerable spell fades, but you are gone from<br/>\n&gt;&gt;the dragon&#39;s grasp anyway. See the potential ?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Nothing packs the punch of a high level Wizard. The ONLY solo<br/>\n&gt;&gt;kill of a Giant with witnesses and screenshots was a Wizard as<br/>\n&gt;&gt;far as I know.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Anjelika<br/>\n&gt;Jerod K Weimer, MCP<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bakersfield.kern.com/diableri/\">http://bakersfield.kern.com/diableri/</a><br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:diableri@...\">diableri@...</a><br/>\n&gt;ICQ#739428<br/>\n&gt;MCP ID 1136478<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Tired of empty chat rooms and out of date bulletin boards?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;ONElist: Making the Internet Intimate </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
