The final decision is up to<br/>\nVerant on whether or not it is an exploit or not.  My opinion on the matter<br/>\nis that it is NOT like the many exploits that I have seen in the game, and<br/>\nthat I would NOT recommend using this spot, because if it is an exploit, you<br/>\ncan get banned for it (although Verant will warn you first, or so i&#39;m told).<br/>\nI have seen Verant warn ppl about several exploits (and ban ppl for using<br/>\nthem), but have never seen them warn anybody about &quot;the hill&quot; in South Ro.<br/>\nBut on the other hand, every time I killed Ortallius, my health, as well as<br/>\nmy partners, was well below half (usually when using an exploit in the game,<br/>\nyour health is not even touched as the monster CANNOT hit you while you are<br/>\ncasting).<br/>\n<br/>\nOrtallius is a lvl 23-26 orc that gives absolutley no loot except for a few<br/>\ncoins.  He spawns very quickly (about once every 10 minutes).<br/>\n<br/>\nSinlaru Ce`alen<br/>\nRallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Rivi�re St�phane &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Stephane.Riviere@...\">Stephane.Riviere@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, June 02, 1999 4:50 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Exploit ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Rivi=E8re_St=E9phane?= &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Stephane.Riviere@...\">Stephane.Riviere@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi,<br/>\n&gt;for me what you just explain is a big bug.. If you can go in a safe zone<br/>\n&gt;WITHOUT zoning then it s because there is some kind of bug... Cause the<br/>\n&gt;developpers have done all they can to avoid that : monster can hit you from<br/>\n&gt;behind walls right ? Developpers have done this to avoid a &quot;safe zone&quot; in<br/>\n&gt;dungeon..... So sorry to say you that, but you use an exploit :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Oh and yes who is ortallius ? and what is the loot ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;on a other hand, for playing now my wizzard at a mid level (i am currenttly<br/>\n&gt;21) and some other chars to low twenty (shaman)  , i must agree that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>wizzard<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;are a weak classe..

So they are still in the game, and you can still get banned for using<br/>\n&gt;them....  Believe me, i reported the one in Lavastorm the third day it was<br/>\n&gt;released (along with tons of other ppl), yet they still have not fixed it<br/>\n&gt;(all that happens is a GM comes around once a day or so and warns everybody<br/>\n&gt;not to use it).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But, i may be incorrect about &quot;the hill&quot; in South Ro.  the area in South Ro<br/>\n&gt;that was originally mentioned may NOT be an exploit.  I spent some time<br/>\n </span></blockquote>this<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;morning killing Ortallius using &quot;the hill&quot; and it didn&#39;t seem like the<br/>\n&gt;&quot;real&quot; exploits i&#39;ve seen in places like Lavastorm.  Ortallius could still<br/>\n&gt;hit me, but if i ran up far enough on the hill, he could no longer hit me.<br/>\n&gt;But he didn&#39;t just stand there and let me pound on him from a distance<br/>\n&gt;either. As soon as I got to the area where he could no longer follow, he<br/>\n&gt;would turn and run, not giving me enough time to cast on him from the safe<br/>\n&gt;area.  So I would have to run back down the hill until he came after me<br/>\n&gt;again, giving me just enough time to cast on him (but he would still tag me<br/>\n&gt;as i finished my casting).  I guess it works just like a zone, without<br/>\n&gt;actually having to zone.  I used it this morning, and was able to kill<br/>\n&gt;Ortallius about 6 or 7 times this morning with a partner, but we probably<br/>\n&gt;would NOT have been able to kill him without the help of the hill (at least<br/>\n&gt;not without dieing once or twice, as he conned red a few times).  So, to<br/>\n&gt;each his own, but I think I&#39;ll stay away from it just to be on the safe<br/>\n&gt;side.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But I did see some bright spots, as he didn&#39;t resist a single flame shock<br/>\n&gt;(he was 2 or 3 lvls higher then me).  He did resist enstill every time, and<br/>\n&gt;force shock about 75% of the time except when my enchanter friend cast<br/>\n&gt;tashan...  And then my force shock went through for full dmg every time<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(has<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;anyone ever noticed that when force shock is not resisted, it goes for full<br/>\n&gt;dmg every time???).
