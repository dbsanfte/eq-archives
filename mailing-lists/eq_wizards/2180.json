And use /feedback while medding<br/>\nin-game.<br/>\n <br/>\n-Solric<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: shypht [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:evanschu@...\">evanschu@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 02, 1999 5:20 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] All players and the 6 lvl resist / cant hit melee<br/>\nthing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, it seams like alot of people assume that though all lvls of the game<br/>\nwe group with people that are generally the same level as eachother. But,<br/>\nthis is fale. I have grouped with people upto 7 - 8 lvls above me, for fun,<br/>\nand for some exp since I can still usualy get a worth while ammount of exp<br/>\nwhile grouped with them. And this is where the &quot;resistance&quot; complaint comes<br/>\nin.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a wizard is the lower lvl in the group, and the higher lvls want to go<br/>\nafter something that is even - yellow to them, it could quite possibly be<br/>\n8-9+ lvls above the magic casters, and that is when this problem comes up,<br/>\nand it is not just wizards, but all of the other class&#39;s, they cant hit it<br/>\nmelee, or their spells wont even put a dent in it.<br/>\n <br/>\nPeople think that when we complain about resistance, we are complaning that<br/>\na group of similar lvls wont be able to kill something 6 lvls above them,<br/>\nthat is false. If I am with a group of lvl 20-22s, and go after something<br/>\nthat is lvl 26 or 27. I would expect to have our ass&#39;s handed to us. But, if<br/>\nI am with a group of a few lvl 29s, and a few mid-30s (lvl 35-36), and the<br/>\nhigh lvls want to go after a yellow or an even in the group, everyone should<br/>\nbe able to help in some way, but with how things work (espically magic<br/>\nresistance) that is not the case. You would think that if the group had<br/>\n <br/>\n- a lvl 29 wizard<br/>\n- a lvl 30 cleric<br/>\n- a lvl 33 cleric<br/>\n- a lvl 30 ranger<br/>\n- a lvl 35 warrior<br/>\n- a lvl 31 druid<br/>\n <br/>\nThat they should be able to take on a monster and all put towards the battle<br/>\nand win if the monster is lvl 36-37. Which in fact they can, the bitch is -<br/>\nThe wizard would be useless in that fight because the monster is to high<br/>\nabove them That is when this thing becomes a problem. If verant allows the<br/>\nexp-gap to widen so much at the higher lvls, they should make sure that<br/>\nEVERYONE in the group can contribute to a &quot;high lvl fight&quot; some how. Right<br/>\nnow people 8 lvls below me can group with me, but if that lvl 21 wizard cant<br/>\nhelp at all in my group ( I am lvl 29 ), for the things that I am fighting,<br/>\nwhy would I want them?<br/>\n <br/>\n... This is why verant needs to take a look and tweak magic resistance in<br/>\nsome way.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
