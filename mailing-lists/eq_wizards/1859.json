Three main reasons:<br/>\n1) A LOT of people turn off shouts and OOCs altogether<br/>\n2) A LOT of people just ignore them or don&#39;t take the time to consider them<br/>\nseriously.<br/>\n3) You can target individuals who match your level and a complimentary<br/>\nskillset.  They are much more likely to read a Tell and take the time to<br/>\nconsider your request more seriously...  I exclusively use Tells now and<br/>\nhave acceptable success rate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think HOW you ask is very important.  Being friendly with at least a<br/>\n&quot;Hail &lt;PC Name&gt;!&quot;  and other friendly roleplaying-like comments is much more<br/>\nlikely to get you a group than &quot;Need a wizard?&quot;, &quot;Wanna group?&quot;, and other<br/>\ncurt requests.<br/>\n<br/>\nON LARGE GROUPS AND EXP<br/>\nI disagree with those who say you MUST go after whites and up with a 5-6<br/>\nmember group...  The best three hour exp gains I ever achieved were only<br/>\nfighting blues.  If blues are abundant in your hunting grounds, you can keep<br/>\nthem coming (Ranger or two) with ZERO downtime for the group.  Constant<br/>\npulls of even blues will net you incredible exp gains, have done it several<br/>\ntimes in outdoor zones in the Karanas with large groups and a Ranger.  I<br/>\nalways shake my head at people in game who say &quot;we like small groups, better<br/>\nexp&quot; in such areas.  (abundant prey is key here obviously)<br/>\n<br/>\nI love to both group and solo, I think you should experience the best of<br/>\nboth styles, give it a try.<br/>\nGive me a tell if you want to group sometime ))<br/>\n<br/>\nDraco - Wizard 20 - Veeshan <br/>\n<br/>\n -----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: \tCalyn Dawnwatcher [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wizcalyn@...\">wizcalyn@...</a>] <br/>\nSent:\tWednesday, May 26, 1999 10:42 AM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\tRe: [eq_wizards] Wizards (Useless?)<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Calyn Dawnwatcher&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wizcalyn@...\">wizcalyn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI find this almost unbelievable.  Not only do I not have problems grouping, <br/>\nbut when I join a party it usually move up to higher level creatures.  We <br/>\nare not useless or unappreciated on the Bristlebane server at least.  <br/>\nPerhaps you live in a heathen land (grin).<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, I never shout for grouping.  I do a /who 14 (one level below me)<br/>\n<br/>\nand ask individually.  I have never needed to ask more than 3 people before <br/>\ngrouping.<br/>\n<br/>\nCalyn Dawnwatcher<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;As far as I can tell the wizard is pretty much useless and I have put him <br/>\n&gt;on the side because I can&#39;t solo (tried<br/>\n&gt;many a time) and I can&#39;t find a party that wants me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
