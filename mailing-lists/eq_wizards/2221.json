On that note, for some of the younger wizards, you&#39;ll <br/>\nfind a percieved hatred of our class in certain areas...notoriously because <br/>\nof our abilities to strike from afar, and more likely because you are <br/>\nplaying with others who are ignorant of class balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaces that are sometimes hostile to Wizards include BlackBurrow around the <br/>\nQueynos area, and Crushbone over near Felwithe.  I would say those in BB <br/>\nwere more hostile to our class...more sensitive to issues about steal kills <br/>\nand such.  Of course, there ARE those wizards I have seen that have used <br/>\ntheir powers to exploit others and place shame on our class.  I&#39;d like to <br/>\nname names...but.......nah.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I hit 16...it was amazing how many groups start looking favorable to <br/>\nour class.  Start looking in areas such as Highhold Pass and Unrest... <br/>\npeople are always ready to allow a Wizard in the group.  So don&#39;t dispair <br/>\nfolks...the wait isn&#39;t THAT long. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n18 Wizard Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I think Verant tend to ignore any whine &quot;we are underpowered&quot;.
