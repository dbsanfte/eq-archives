Unfortunately<br/>\nas I had never used a staff before my skill was at &quot;awful&quot; level. No matter<br/>\nhow much I use it I can not seem to get my 2H blunt skill up. And I am<br/>\nfighting blues or higher with it. I poured a bunch of practice points into<br/>\n2H blunt, so now it is at &quot;very bad&quot; level, and I do more damage with it,<br/>\nbut still have never gotten a message saying my skill has gone up. I did<br/>\nget a message about my offense skill going up, but that&#39;s it. Is there some<br/>\ntrick to this?<br/>\n<br/>\nGreg (Kronan)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
