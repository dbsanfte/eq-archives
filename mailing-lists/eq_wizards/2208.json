Never really bugged me because I&#39;ve assumed<br/>\n&gt; you have to see your target to direct an attack against it.  Your experience<br/>\n&gt; in the mino caves might be unique to that area I think only because of the<br/>\n&gt; way they had set up the walls there? (ie the way the minos can strike<br/>\n&gt; through the walls might have something to do with why you can hit them<br/>\n&gt; through the walls there too).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Best to fight away from corners I guess.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -- Lim&#39;Dul </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
