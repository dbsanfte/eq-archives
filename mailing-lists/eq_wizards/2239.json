Bingo, I&#39;m now the proud owner<br/>\nof the Fire Spiral of Al&#39;Kabor spell. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also had Energy Storm fail last night, didn&#39;t<br/>\ncombine properly. I used the last of the runes needed,<br/>\nor I would have tried switching Velious into that mix<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuil, wizard from Bertoxxulous<br/>\n---End Snip---<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still willing to send the spell list to anyone who wishes it, just<br/>\nsend me an E-Mail to the above address.  I&#39;m currently working on<br/>\nputting it in other formats like PDF. (I HATE Frame Maker).  I&#39;ve gotten<br/>\nvery little in the way of updates, and would appreciate any help you<br/>\ncould provide.  So if you are waiting for friends, take a moment to<br/>\nvisit the wizard merchants and jot down the available spells, or time<br/>\nthe casting time of a few and post the info.  Thanx.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Petition has not made much headway, I&#39;ve sent it to EQ-Vault, and<br/>\nStratistics, but they have not posted it in the news section.  Keep at<br/>\nthem and please send them a copy if you are serious about it.  No<br/>\nfeedback from Verant either.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nMalkin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
