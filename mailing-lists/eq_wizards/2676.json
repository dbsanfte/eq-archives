I must say it was faster getting up <br/>\nlevels than I had with a Wizard.  To me, a Druid is more like a weaker <br/>\nWizard but with stonger melee.  Everything on the magic side was a bit <br/>\nslower...you gain spells every 5 levels and you don&#39;t get meditate till 8. <br/>\n:P   I must say it WAS fun playing a class that could do a little of <br/>\neverything...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;ll still take a Wizard anyday. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
