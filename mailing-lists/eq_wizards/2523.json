That&#39;s why I am limited to <br/>\nwearing cloth types.. I do have a goss robe myself and was just speaking to <br/>\nother items than robes there.  I have a damask item, woven items and a <br/>\nnetted piece too.  That is why I mentioned them, but I couldn&#39;t recall <br/>\nwhere they were picked up other than the damask wrist piece because I just <br/>\ngot that in Najena a couple days ago.  I&#39;m too lazy and not scrolling back <br/>\nthrough all these emails to see what the other person was or if they <br/>\nmentioned it, because I&#39;m going back to sleep!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 11:39 AM 6/25/99 +0200, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Vincent Archer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Vincent.Archer@...\">Vincent.Archer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;According to Cristie:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You can get some woven armor or damask... we pretty much have to stick to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cloth types but they are much better for certain.

Frogloks have netted armor, which is exactly the same as<br/>\n&gt;cloth, but as light or lighter as small sizes - thus you can scrap 1 or<br/>\n&gt;2 units of weight. Probably not worth the bother. It wasn&#39;t for me: I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;high elf, and thus able to wear small size.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;After this, you must relocate to Freeport. Woven armor is gotten out of<br/>\n&gt;Frogloks too, but you must go down to the Innothule Swamp and their home<br/>\n&gt;of Upper Guk for this. Woven is about equivalent to patchwork, and can<br/>\n&gt;be worn by all races & classes, and is light.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Damask is from Najena mostly, equivalent to leather, and limited to casters.<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s a tad too high level for you now, I think.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Then you have Gossamer, which is high level stuff :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;Vincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Tel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n&gt;         01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Books, music, videos, gifts, e-cards, auctions-find them at AMAZON.COM.<br/>\n&gt;Browse Earth&#39;s Biggest Selection!
