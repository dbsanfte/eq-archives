If things<br/>\ncontinue as they are, eventually it won&#39;t only be money that&#39;s<br/>\nworthless, it&#39;ll also be the items themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nSay, for example, that everyone on the server has 5 or 6 Rubi<br/>\nbreastplates.  You decide to twink up, say, a new rogue (I&#39;m on a limb<br/>\nhere, because I don&#39;t know much about armor...assume, for the sake of<br/>\nthe discussion, that your rogue can&#39;t wear Rubicite).  At this point,<br/>\nit&#39;s easier to gate your level 50 wizard over to Greater Faydark and<br/>\ntrade his Rubi breastplate for a Dragoon Dirk than it would be to<br/>\nbother getting the item yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, no, this situation will not correct itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend who just hit lvl 31. Money is now meaningless to him. <br/>\nAnything good, he has to camp for. He can make money faster, easier,<br/>\nand having more fun than he can get the item.  And he has all the money<br/>\nhe will need until level 50 for spells, and he has all the equipment he<br/>\ncan ever buy. So, sure, someone could offer him 10,000,000 plat for an<br/>\nitem...but why? There&#39;s nothing available to him which is worth that<br/>\nmuch.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoney is only viable when people believe it has value. No one past the<br/>\nnewbie levels believes in the value of plat. Therefore, plat&#39;s<br/>\nmeaningless.  It&#39;s a lot less trouble to trade, say, a Mistmoore Battle<br/>\nDrum for a Sacrificial Dagger, than it is to try to keep track of, say,<br/>\n36 billion plat.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhew, sorry that was so long!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Joe Wallace &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joew88@...\">joew88@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Joe Wallace&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joew88@...\">joew88@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Perhaps money is worthless at higher levels, but<br/>\n&gt; will that last forever?<br/>\n&gt; When the game went live back in March, money was<br/>\n&gt; worthless to buy the best<br/>\n&gt; items, too, because no one had many good items.  If<br/>\n&gt; you sold your rare item,<br/>\n&gt; even for a lot of money, you couldn&#39;t buy anything<br/>\n&gt; with the money, since<br/>\n&gt; good items were too rare.   The higher levels who<br/>\n&gt; trade only for other items<br/>\n&gt; with other high levels are doing so because those<br/>\n&gt; items are rare.  As time<br/>\n&gt; goes on, there will be more and more high level<br/>\n&gt; players, and those &quot;rare&quot;<br/>\n&gt; items will become not so rare.  Then people will<br/>\n&gt; sell them, if only to lower<br/>\n&gt; level people who have accumulated money.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
