I spent 1 point in Old Erudin and 1 in Gnoll<br/>\n&gt; (the only two<br/>\n&gt; new languages I have available at the moment).

I do the same thing.  Humans have such a snobby<br/>\nattitude towards Erudites (where it should be the other way round, of<br/>\ncourse).  Also, they tend to overcharge tremendously.  My Level 12<br/>\nspells are 1p 3g cheaper in Erudin!  So I decided to leave the crappy<br/>\nWizard Guilds of other towns alone.  I&#39;m travelling to Erud for<br/>\ntraining and purchases from now on!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Anyway, I DO have those languages available in my languages<br/>\n&gt; window, so I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t think it&#39;s a matter of skill.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>About the language thing: you&#39;re right, but if you only have a few<br/>\npoints in the language, I don&#39;t think people will be able to<br/>\nunderstand you.  I think it&#39;s the EQ equivalent of speaking broken<br/>\nEnglish - the chance of being misunderstood is bigger if your language<br/>\nskill is very low.  Just a conjecture , of course.<br/>\nMy friends have started practicing languages during my increasingly<br/>\nlonger meditations.  Just start chattering away in your race language,<br/>\nand in a few minutes you will see some gain.<br/>\n<br/>\nAznyin<br/>\nLevel 12 Erudite Wizard<br/>\nCurrent Residence: Rivervale [Solusek Ro]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
