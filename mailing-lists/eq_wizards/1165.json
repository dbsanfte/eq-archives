If you give each slave a copper they tell you which key they need to<br/>\nbe set free. As of yet none of the slaves have asked for key&#39;s 22 - 24.<br/>\nCould there be a hidden area in CB possibly? <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any help on this.<br/>\n<br/>\nMirrin of Rodcet Nife</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
