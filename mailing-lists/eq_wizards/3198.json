Fighting a steady<br/>\n&gt; stream of blues, a group that includes a cleric will<br/>\n&gt; almost have no use for<br/>\n&gt; us until the puller yells,  &quot;Oh Shit, I pulled<br/>\n&gt; something big guys, get<br/>\n&gt; ready&quot;  That is when we shine.

That&#39;s the situation where an Enchanter<br/>\nreally shines.  Wizards can help, but not as well. <br/>\nOur best bet in that situation is Evac.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hehe, wrote my comment before reading your next<br/>\n&gt; comment,  I guess we agree<br/>\n&gt; :)  One more point is that many classes get a<br/>\n&gt; version of root.  If you are<br/>\n&gt; going to burn the mob into oblivion make sure they<br/>\n&gt; know to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re grouped with a Druid or Ranger, just forget<br/>\nRoot. Have them use Snare.  It&#39;s resisted much less,<br/>\nand works a lot better.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnstill is good for crowd control, but, again,<br/>\nEnchanters are much better at this than we.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least, it did up until a couple of months ago.  I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t grouped with either of those classes in a<br/>\nreally long while.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
