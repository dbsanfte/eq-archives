It doesn&#39;t seem to matter what is hitting me when I<br/>\nrecover.  I&#39;ve recovered while being hit by deep reds and Decaying skels.  I<br/>\ntend to recover most while being hit by blues, but I have attacked/been<br/>\nattacked by blues more than anything else.  Anyway, I pulled this from the<br/>\nmanual.<br/>\n<br/>\nDexterity:<br/>\nThis is your hand/eye coordination and is used in combat accuracy and spell<br/>\ncasting capability.  This is<br/>\nused in calculating your missile combat skills and aids in determining if<br/>\nyou<br/>\nare interrupted when you are<br/>\nhit while casting a spell.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWisdom:<br/>\nThis is willpower and faith and is used to determine the casting abilities<br/>\nof<br/>\nShaman, Druids, Rangers,<br/>\nClerics, and Paladins.  It is also involved in resisting magical spells that<br/>\neffect the mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nMalkin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nWith more than 18 million e-mails exchanged daily...<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n...ONElist is THE place where the world talks!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
