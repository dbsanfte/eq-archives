It looked no different from the cracked great staff <br/>\nor fine steel great staff I was using.  The one I&#39;m looking for has <br/>\nthe crooked knot on top?  Anybody know what that staff is?<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t get me wrong, the runed totem staff is great and I think I got a <br/>\nfairly good deal.  But I&#39;ve been jealously looking at other cool mages <br/>\nwith this big staff in their hands.  I&#39;ve got a list of creatures I&#39;d <br/>\nlove to give a good WHACK on the backside to with this staff. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nGood day,<br/>\n-- LimDul<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
