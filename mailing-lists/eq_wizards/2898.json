David&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mcgraw.Thomas@...\">Mcgraw.Thomas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The quest starts in Ogguk. It isn&#39;t difficult for a wizard to get all of<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; components BUT you have to have a 20+ level enchanter in order to complete<br/>\n&gt; the quest. Also you can not receive the quest(unless you are a darkie, in<br/>\n&gt; which case you can&#39;t get the next step in Freeport) because the ogres will<br/>\n&gt; kill you on sight. Basically the quest goes like this...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You talk to a bartender in Ogguk and he says he is missing his recipe<br/>\n&gt; book(or some such nonsense) and that he gave it to a bartender in<br/>\nFreeport.<br/>\n&gt; You go to Freeport and talk to the bartender on the docks and he says he<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; trying to make some wonderful drink and that if you get him the items he<br/>\n&gt; will give you the book back. He wants 4 things. A kiola nut from OOT,<br/>\nJumJum<br/>\n&gt; Juice from Rivervale, Fish Scales from Qeynos, and 1 thing from Erudin<br/>\nwhich<br/>\n&gt; I forget right now. Anyway after you collect all of these things you<br/>\nreturn<br/>\n&gt; them to him and IF your faction is high enough you get the NO DROP<br/>\n&gt; compendium(this is why you have to have an enchanter because you have to<br/>\n&gt; have good standing with both Freeport and Ogguk). After you get the book<br/>\n&gt; return in to the ogre and you will get the coveted glowing stein. This is<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; rather crude over view of the quest but it really is pointless unless you<br/>\n&gt; know a trustworthy enchanter. Even if you offer 100 platinum to a stranger<br/>\n&gt; you could get ripped because the stein is currently going for around 750<br/>\n&gt; platinum(I am SOOO glad I know a friendly enchanter). Now if you are<br/>\nfriends<br/>\n&gt; with an enchanter this a good way to make money because, as a wizard, you<br/>\n&gt; can collect the items and the enchanter can finish the quest. All told<br/>\nabout<br/>\n&gt; 3 hours work for 750 plat, not too bad.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hope this helps.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yours,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~Aereuss Ravins of Tarew Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
