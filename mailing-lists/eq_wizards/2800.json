They sell for<br/>\nnearly 2 and a half silver, and newbie often kill them for the xp and leave<br/>\nthe bodies lying around.  If you go to North Ro zone, near Freeport, and<br/>\njust stay in the newbie area near the inn (do not go in the desert) you will<br/>\nfind an absolute abundance of fire beetles and skeletons.  A lot of times<br/>\none beetle will give you two eyes, and the bone chips from the skeletons<br/>\nbring in another 2 silver.  And sometimes the skeletons have weapons,<br/>\nincluding the cracked staff, which you can sell for 1 platinum.  2 silver<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t really sound like a lot, but there are SO many beetles there that<br/>\nyou can easily rake in some coin there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other big cash source is willowisps, but you will be hard-pressed to<br/>\nkill them with your spells at level 8.  But their loot is usually gold, plus<br/>\na lightstone that you can sell for platinum to players.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other place you can try, although you should probably wait until level<br/>\n10 or so, and bring a partner, is in the ocean of tears.  Take the ship out<br/>\nfrom Freeport.  Before you go, get someone to bind you right outside the<br/>\nbank.  Then take the ship out toward Faywder.  Right before it zones into<br/>\nButcherblock, it passes between some small island-rocks with aqua goblins.<br/>\nHop off the ship and swim to the rocks.  You and your partner can take on<br/>\nthe goblins.  Their spawn points are clear, they spawn quickly, and each one<br/>\nwill give you a bow and some arrows.  Each bow sells for about 2 and a half<br/>\ngold, and the arrows are 7cp each, I think.  Bring some backpacks, and kill<br/>\ngobs until the packs are full.  You will be encumbered, but it won&#39;t matter<br/>\nbecause you can gate back to the bank in Freeport.  You&#39;ll pull in about 5<br/>\nplat per trip that way, and level from the gobs pretty well, too.  Just<br/>\ndon&#39;t attack the sirens on the rocks.  They will leave you alone if you<br/>\ndon&#39;t attack them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn case your friends can&#39;t gate, they can wait in the water and, when they<br/>\nsee the ship approach, swim up to it and let it run into them.  They will<br/>\npop up right on the deck and can sail back along with the ship.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy final suggestion is to get a good group together and hunt in Blackburrow<br/>\nor Paw.  The gnolls have enough cash to keep everyone happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood hunting!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Philippe Fuentes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pfuentes@...\">pfuentes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, July 26, 1999 10:23 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Good loot<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Philippe Fuentes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pfuentes@...\">pfuentes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have a little problem,  hop you could help me out,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m and Erudit ,  I reached lvl 8 yesterday and I can&#39;t buy any spell lvl<br/>\n3<br/>\n&gt; cause I miss money.
