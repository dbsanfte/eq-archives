Well my friend is a shaman who<br/>\n </span></blockquote>just<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;turned 14. Well he just brought<br/>\n&gt;his new damage spell and he said it does 77 damage, to which i replied kewl<br/>\n&gt;my next spell does that amount<br/>\n&gt;too. That was a mistake he started laughing and saying things like &quot;why<br/>\n&gt;would anyone want to play the wizard<br/>\n&gt;when they can play the shaman&quot;.  &quot;the shaman can stand toe to toe like the<br/>\n&gt;warrior and do the same damage<br/>\n&gt;as the wizard, Ha HA HA HA .....&quot; . Then he went on saying crap like now he<br/>\n&gt;knows the shaman is the best<br/>\n&gt;class in the game. All he could talk about before was the sow spell, and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>now<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;it is he does the same damage<br/>\n&gt;as the wizard.  My question is this, i thought i picked the wizard so i<br/>\n&gt;would not have to hear stuff like this?<br/>\n&gt;I thought level 12 was when the wizard started to leave other mage class<br/>\n&gt;behind.  Know i have to hear alot<br/>\n&gt;aggraviating crap from this shaman, laughing at the wizard class. Dam that<br/>\n&gt;is going to suck.  Someone<br/>\n&gt;please tell me there is hope out there as far as the damage spells go.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Looking for a new hobby?
