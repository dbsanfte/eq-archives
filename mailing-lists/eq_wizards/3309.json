Should I borrow a friends wisdom items?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Should I dump more training points into research (is this the right<br/>\n&gt; &gt; skill)?  Any help would be appreciated.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m currently a 40th level human wizard.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, I got my staff yesterday (at level 29, maybe the youngest ever :)<br/>\n&gt; ) and I had no problems combining. I also had no problems combining the<br/>\n&gt; Jeweled Skull back when I did. I am fairly certain that for quests, it<br/>\n&gt; will always work. Have you ever heard of someone failing to combine a<br/>\n&gt; quest item?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Sergey<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; P.S.
