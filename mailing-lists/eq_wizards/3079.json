But to me, I just can&#39;t see<br/>\n&gt; how being lucky enough to find a rare drop makes you someone.  I was lucky<br/>\n&gt; enough to get a double-bladed bone axe from a wandering npc, an item a lot<br/>\n&gt; of people have never heard of, but it just doesn&#39;t seem so cool.  I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know.  I guess with everyone looking like clones, people are desperate to<br/>\n&gt; look different or be different in some way.  I remember once just walking<br/>\n&gt; around wearing nothing, just to be different, since my character in his<br/>\n&gt; &quot;gear&quot; looks like everyone else.

Some level 5 cleric, maybe?<br/>\n<br/>\nThen they inspect him, and find Dragoon Dirk, Skull of Jhen-Thra, loads of<br/>\nint/mana jewelry.
