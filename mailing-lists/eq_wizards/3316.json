But I have<br/>\n&gt; a few questions since I have spent no time in Guk in 32 levels.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; GUK<br/>\n&gt; 1. I need to know the easiest or quickest path to the hand room?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Zone in at the dead side and yell for someone to guide you. The hand&#39;s<br/>\nspawns are well timed so  if it&#39;s camped, you&#39;re ok. You also will need<br/>\ninvis vs. undead and the bedroom to be camped (vampiric bats see through<br/>\nboth invis). BTW, the hand is not undead so she will see through invis<br/>\nundead. And you CAN&#39;T stack both. So if the hand spawns and you&#39;re<br/>\nthere, don&#39;t even think about anything, you&#39;re dead 100%. Just try to<br/>\ngrab the rod before you die so you&#39;ll drag your corpse with the rod.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2. Is the room on the Live or Dead side?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3. Will I encounter any Undead frogs along the way?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hehehe. Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; EVERFROST<br/>\n&gt; I know that the rod is surrounded by 3 IBS and that an NPC is in the area. I<br/>\n&gt; can get by the IBS with Invis to Undead but the NPC could be a problem.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This was really easy. Nothing there can see through invis except the<br/>\nIBS&#39; who are all too green to attack anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 1. Is this NPC within range of the rod?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I will not have a group with me and am only going to attempt this when the<br/>\n&gt; Hand room is being camped. I may however try a suicide run depending on how<br/>\n&gt; brave I feel.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Any suicide run through Guk will only end in death. There is 0 chance of<br/>\nyou just running through since the place has a lot of spellcasters, and<br/>\nmany are on your way to the hand room. Most of them are inside.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nSergey<br/>\n<br/>\nWorker bees can leave<br/>\nEven drones can fly away<br/>\nThe queen is their slave</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
