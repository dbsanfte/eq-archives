Seems my faction with him is not<br/>\nhigh enough.  Unfortuntaly, his race is other than you would expect for<br/>\nhis location, so I&#39;m not even sure what faction I need to raise.  Before<br/>\nI go killing hundreds of newbie creatures, could anyone out there let me<br/>\nknow what I should work on (faction-wise) to make him at least speak to<br/>\nme?  Thanks in advance.<br/>\nMicon Bittermage<br/>\nKarana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
