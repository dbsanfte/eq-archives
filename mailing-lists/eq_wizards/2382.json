Where&#39;s the challenge to using an exploit?<br/>\nAre we racing to get to 50level?  It&#39;s already been done almost a month <br/>\nago...no point to that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre we trying to get unique items?  I think everything cool has already been <br/>\nfound save for a handful of new ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you&#39;re not racing to get any bragging rights...just enjoy the game the <br/>\nway it was intended to be played.  To each his own...but I get no bigger <br/>\nthrill than working with friends to get cool items and achieving each level <br/>\none step at a time...who cares how long it takes?  We all KNOW we&#39;ll all get <br/>\nto 50Level one day with all the trimmings...so why rush?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this isn&#39;t going to sway those of you intent on using exploits to get <br/>\nyour way.  Do what you must.  Just please keep quiet about it then ok?  or <br/>\neven do us a favor and post headers with *exploits*<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n20 Wiz Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I just wanted to clarify that I have never used an exploit in my EQ life<br/>\n&gt;and I am not planning to do so in the future.
