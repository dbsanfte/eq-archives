Wizard&#39;s DD spells are the best at any given level.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Plus, the single greatest way of leveling up -<br/>\n&gt; killing har red mobs - is unavailable to us, because our spells are often<br/>\n&gt; resisted completely by these creatures. So, instead of grouping with<br/>\n&gt; powerful warriors to beat up on mobs that will actually give EVERYONE in the<br/>\n&gt; group decent experience, we&#39;re relegated to trying to solo weak blues or<br/>\n&gt; fight white and yellow creatures in a group for pitiful experience because<br/>\n&gt; WE CAN&#39;T TOUCH HARD MOBS LIKE EVERY OTHER CLASS CAN!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Totally FALSE! All spells are resisted when they are cast on creatures<br/>\nthat are more than 5 levels higher than you. Enchanter&#39;s and Magician&#39;s<br/>\ntoo. And cleric&#39;s and shaman&#39;s too. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can cause damage to mobs that are not more than 5 levels higher than<br/>\nyou, it&#39;s very simple. As far as colors - 4 levels above your should be<br/>\nred. So you CAN fight Reds. And don&#39;t forget that the melee classes will<br/>\nmiss so much and be hit so hard that it is not very profitable for them<br/>\nto go against high reds as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve watched every group I&#39;ve run with pass me up in level. I&#39;ve watched<br/>\n&gt; characters started while I was at level 12 PASS ME at level 13. It&#39;s not as<br/>\n&gt; though I never play, it&#39;s just that I CANNOT GAIN MORE THAN HALF A BUBBLE<br/>\n&gt; EXP PER HOUR, on average. That&#39;s powergaming, soloing in the Karanas vs.<br/>\n&gt; blue beetles and the occasional white/yellow.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No offense, but maybe you&#39;re just not that good. Yes, there is the<br/>\nchance that you make wrong choices or get stuck in bad groups. As I<br/>\nsaid, a bubble an hour is possible. And the Karanas are a really bad<br/>\nplace for a level 12-16 alone. Especially wizard.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour anecdotal case is not viable as an argument as to the Wizard&#39;s<br/>\ncapabilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Needless to say, I&#39;m very frustrated in playing this class right now. The<br/>\n&gt; only reason I remain a Wizard is stubbornness. Everyone says it gets better<br/>\n&gt; at higher levels, but the fact of the matter is that we&#39;ll always be a<br/>\n&gt; second-rate class unless Verant fixes specialization, plane travel and<br/>\n&gt; spell-resistances of higher-level mobs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You have doubts that specialization and the planes will be fixed?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nQenelin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
