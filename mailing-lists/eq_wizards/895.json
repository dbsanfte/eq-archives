You cannot store robes in the<br/>\nbank, and the combined<br/>\nweight will add up on you. Since Wizards are not very strong to begin with,<br/>\nyou have the strength<br/>\nto carry the loot you find.  It can be done, but be aware of the problems<br/>\nassociated.  (In case<br/>\nyou were wondering, you can&#39;t put Robes in the bank, even in a container).<br/>\n<br/>\nSkylee - High Elven Wizard - 5th Rank - Mithaniel Marr<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: It is my Humble opinion that Rank (When dealing with a spell caster)<br/>\nrefers to thier Rank of Spell<br/>\nnot thier level.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso from What I have seen so far... Green, Blue, Yellow, Red, Gold,<br/>\nBlack(Grey), Violet.
