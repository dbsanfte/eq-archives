How can<br/>\nthey be sure that all wizzard really think that ? (and not only yourself..).<br/>\nWhat about the idea that each who agree with you send it to verant ?<br/>\n<br/>\nyakos<br/>\n wizzard of karana<br/>\n<br/>\nyou can add me to the list...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Start Letter-----<br/>\n<br/>\nDear EverQuest Staff,<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are a large group of wizards who have come together through a mailing<br/>\nlist. Through much discussion and debate, we have agreed to send you<br/>\nthis feedback concerning improvements to the wizard. We would like to<br/>\nthank you in advance for your careful consideration of these<br/>\nmodifications.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Spells are 100% resisted by mobs 6+ levels above the caster. In large<br/>\ngroups hunting big prey this level cap turns a wizard from the main<br/>\ndealer of damage to a useless member in the group. Our suggestion is<br/>\nthat either the cap be raised to 6+ levels of the highest member in the<br/>\ngroup, or the cap be raised to 8+ levels higher than the caster.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Spells that both stun and damage targets are often resisted by mobs<br/>\nthat /con green and blue. If this is the result of the stun effect, we<br/>\nwould like one spell without this effect at the same level.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Many spell suggestions have crossed this list. Here is one that we<br/>\nall feel would be a great addition.<br/>\n<br/>\nTap Affinity - Teleport targeted group member to their own bind spot<br/>\n<br/>\n4) O&#39;Kiels Radiation seems that it would be the beginning of a great<br/>\nline of spells. Why should it end there? Cold and Magic based<br/>\nbuffs/shields would be a very welcome addition.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Wizards seem to be very neglected when it comes to carrying or<br/>\nwearing items that enhance our appearance. Also, many completely<br/>\ndifferent spells have the same visual effects.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe would like to thank you again for your time. Any type of feedback<br/>\nwould be greatly appriciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Wizards of Norrath<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
