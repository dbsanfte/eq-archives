If they<br/>\n&gt; continue to exploit the bug, then they will be punished.  Its painfully obvious why<br/>\n&gt; they don&#39;t list bugs.  They don&#39;t want to be forced into policing them 24/7.  If you<br/>\n&gt; stumble onto something that is a blatent bug, report it so that it gets fixed, and<br/>\n&gt; move on.  If you find something that could go either way, enjoy it until a GM/Guide<br/>\n&gt; tells you to stop.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thing is, they released buggy software.

As a<br/>\nconsumer, I shouldn&#39;t even have to think about these things. What happens is that the<br/>\ngame designers are aware as to how much the gaming public is involved in the process of<br/>\nmaking designing games, so the EXPLOIT us.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you ever seen a TV released that only shows prime number channels, with a promise<br/>\nto come fix it some time? Ever seen a stove that only heats to 50 degrees with a promise<br/>\nto come fix it some time? Ever see a car that only turns left with a promise to come fix<br/>\nit some time? No. This happens only in computer software, especially high profile games.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nSergey<br/>\n--<br/>\nKPS PUNK (Paramilitary Undercover Nuclear Kamikaze)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
