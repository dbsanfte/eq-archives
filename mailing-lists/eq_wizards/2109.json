Geoffrey has a lotta time on his hands and way back on may<br/>\n6th he said he was already working on the new spells for the expansion. not<br/>\nto mention completely overhauling the enchanter spells and *gasp* some of<br/>\nthe wizard spells! so just hang in there. don&#39;t petition because it&#39;s<br/>\npointless. wait a while and if nothing good comes around. THEN petition. if<br/>\nthey see a petition, turn it down, then see the same one in a couple<br/>\nmonths, they&#39;re not going to take it seriously! so just wait.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may be pointless, it may do no good whatsoever but it does serve a<br/>\npurpose.  Even if everything we suggest gets shot down, it still lets them<br/>\nknow that we are not satisfied with the thing the way they are.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know the guys are working hard to get the expansion pack out the door but<br/>\nwith all the patches and fixes coming out for the other magic-using classes<br/>\nit does seems like the Wizard-class is getting ignored.  And we don&#39;t like<br/>\nthat.  So we protest and petition.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat else can we do?  If you&#39;ve got some advise on what I can do to help<br/>\nwith the improvement of my character class, I will gladly listen and<br/>\nparticipate.  But if the best you&#39;ve got is, &quot;Sit back and wait.<br/>\nQuietly.&quot;, I can&#39;t do do that.  It might be sound advise, but I like to<br/>\nthink this group might in some way influence changes to our class.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of which, does anyone know how many people are members of this<br/>\ngroup?  I don&#39;t, and I&#39;m curious.  If we were to all agree on something<br/>\n(okay, granted - that&#39;s a BIG &quot;if&quot; =), would we be a loud enough voice to<br/>\naffect a major change to be put in place?  <br/>\n<br/>\n-Pennaggolan, 3rd Circle Wizard of Felwithe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
