I don&#39;t care about the color (although<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;I prefer the red ones from Erudin).  I just need robes that will fit<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;an Erudite.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Aznyin<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Level 12 Erudite Wizard<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Current Residence: Rivervale [Solusek Ro]<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Yes you can get robes in Freeport.  They sell two types one is Jr.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Apprentice Robes and the other are Sr. Apprentice robes.  I think the Sr<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ones cost just under 5 plat but have an AC of 6 and also give some mana.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Not much but something is better than nothing.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; The kicker of it is that I am a GNOME.  I have been to every city.  Even<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the Troll and oger city with other characters.  There re NO Gnome sized<br/>\n&gt;&gt; robes.  Not even in Ak&#39;Akanon.  I lost my guild robe when I was first<br/>\n&gt;&gt; starting out.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Granted my Cloth Tunic has a better AC but I still would like to have a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; robe, even if its just for show.  Has anyone found a Gnome Sized Robe.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Actually I think they sell one for Magicians Only in Freeport that a Gnome<br/>\n&gt;&gt; could wear, but that kind a leaves my Wizard out of the picture......<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Lomack<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Curse those Racist apparel makers :)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
