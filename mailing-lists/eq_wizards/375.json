Would work with any news brower, which most people<br/>\nhave included in their mail program nowdays.  I like this idea better than<br/>\nemail or web boards.  You would just set up my server as another news server<br/>\non your client, and as I&#39;m not using it for anything else right now, this<br/>\nwould be the only newsgroup on it.
