LOL I have<br/>\n&gt; about 100 plat in the bank which is probably as high as my bank<br/>\n&gt; &gt;account ever is.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What level are you Iggie?  If money is a concern, you can make pretty good <br/>\n&gt; loot money over in Cazic.  You can get up to about 1-3pp off of the lizzies <br/>\n&gt; there and they even drop fine steel weapons.  If you&#39;re too lazy to stand <br/>\n&gt; around auctioning FS weapons, they can usually be redeemed to NPC merchants <br/>\n&gt; for around 2-3pp as well.  It&#39;s not uncommon before for me to get upwards of <br/>\n&gt; 100pp a night there.  Of course, the best situation is to group yourself <br/>\n&gt; with a couple of folks playing their tweaked secondaries...they usually <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t care about loot and you can wrack up the dough. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not too rich myself, but I can usually do enough each night to cover the <br/>\n&gt; costs of all the reagents and spells I use. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *IF* rumours are true about the Oracle Robe becoming *no rent*, it would be <br/>\n&gt; a good idea to buy a pre-patched Robe now before the market picks it up in <br/>\n&gt; price.  Otherwise, don&#39;t worry about it...there are better robes than the <br/>\n&gt; Oracle Robe now to look forward to.  I know a 50 Wizzie who volunteered to <br/>\n&gt; wear only the FBR through level 50 only because he liked the color <br/>\n&gt; better....he kicked arse anyway. =)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n&gt; 38 HE Wiz Veeshan<br/>\n&gt; &lt;The Magistry&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ______________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; GET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
