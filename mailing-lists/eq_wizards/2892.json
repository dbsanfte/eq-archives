One of","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-71170573\">The main question is how and when to use AE spells. This is great spells if<br/>\nyou are with a party wich know how to get monsters from you if you cast it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of tactics wich i think that can be usefus is if you are in group with<br/>\na 3 or more fighters wich engage a monsters on 1 on 1 basis so when you<br/>\ncast a AE spell it will do low damage to all 3 mobs wich have already build<br/>\nsome hate to fighters. AE spels are not efficent if you hit less then 3<br/>\nmobs as mana to damage ratio is much worse then our DD spels. The main<br/>\nproblem is if your group is attacked by more mobs then you have fighters to<br/>\nintercept with, as any mob wich was not been hit at last some times will<br/>\nimediatly turn on you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are in group wich is attacked by one big guy and some green ones<br/>\ncome along, you can cast a AE spell on your puller and then wait a second<br/>\nthat your group take off all guys wich come to attack you.. ps advice dont<br/>\ntry this if your group is not a well known people in casual groups people<br/>\ntend to continue hacking on their  target and they see that you are near<br/>\ndead when its too late and your leather skeen is alredy gone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 18.34 16/08/99 +0200, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Zinken&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zinken@...\">zinken@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi evryone<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Is there any AE spells that a lv 22 wizzie can use at all ? i mean when i <br/>\n&gt;cast on the mob a few times they will come after me, so i thought that if <br/>\n&gt;there was a good AE spell that i can cast on the tanks and do about the same <br/>\n&gt;danage but not take the blame for the damage ?. that would be werry neat!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;/Askur Wizzie of Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist announces &quot;FRIENDS & FAMILY!&quot;<br/>\n&gt;For details, including our weekly drawing, go to<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/onereachsplash3.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Silverion Dragonirder<br/>\n<br/>\nHigh elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\nFenin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\nmoderator mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
