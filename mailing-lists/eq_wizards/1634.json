I would like to try some 1H weapons to free a hand for useful<br/>\n&gt; items in the future so I went to the newbie area and started wacking<br/>\n&gt; /con green critters.  I found I could hit several run to a un<br/>\n&gt; populated area and then stand and punch one creature until it ran<br/>\n&gt; away. Then started working another until it ran away eventually<br/>\n&gt; comming back to the original one.  I did this with one group of 3<br/>\n&gt; crits for over an hour and got absolutely 0 increase in bare hand<br/>\n&gt; skill (still at 10 or 11)!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What is going on am I to start on /con blue creatures at level 9.  If<br/>\n&gt; so and had I known (ie if the manual had any value at all) I would<br/>\n&gt; have been training 1H skills much early when the creatures could not<br/>\n&gt; kill me in 2 or 3 blows!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Can anyone confirm this and/or give suggestions on how at this point<br/>\n&gt; (9th) I can improve my 1H fighting skills?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes,to improve on melee skills (pierce, 1&2h Blunt, and h2h) you must hit a<br/>\ncreature that will give you experience.  The best way to improve a<br/>\nneglected skill is in a group scenereo.  While the tank is whacking the<br/>\nmob, you stand behind it and attack it to improve your skill.  You will not<br/>\nsee an increase for a very long time, but they will come sooner or later.<br/>\nAt your level beware of mobs that have a natural hatred for casters.<br/>\nSometimes, no matter how much damage the tank has done, the critter will<br/>\nturn on you if you get close enough.  If this happens just back off.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMalkin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
