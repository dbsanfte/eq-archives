So I don&#92;&#39;t see how the plan to take it from<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; a dark elf would work.   Just my two cents.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also as a newbie to the 8th level, should I get shock of ice or firebolt? I am <br/>\n&gt; am broke and saving to buy my first new spell. I actually have had luck with <br/>\n&gt; parties and explain my role so they understand. Buffing the warriors with <br/>\n&gt; Okeils, does make them apprieciative too.  Most like the fact that monsters get <br/>\n&gt; hurt when hitting them, fits right into the warrior ego/mentality of hurt, <br/>\n&gt; crush, bash, cut. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hey, I love the one line remarks but could you maybe just trim all the quote <br/>\n&gt; crap out except the last message you are one lining, I recently switched to the <br/>\n&gt; digest version and 90% of that message is quoted spam and headers.  Oh well it <br/>\n&gt; is better than trying to read 110 messages, when only halfway through the first <br/>\n&gt; you get 10 more. I really didn&#92;&#39;t care but took to long to read that way, easier<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; in digest (after all I need to read these quick so I can play more EQ). I am on <br/>\n&gt; 4 other EQ lists too :P still can&#92;&#39;t get enough. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway I am off on another journey. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Zakrul The Traveler<br/>\n&gt; Companion<br/>\n&gt; Bristlebane <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; This mail sent through IMP: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://web.horde.org/imp/\">http://web.horde.org/imp/</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Have you visited the new ONElist home page lately?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ONElist: The Leading e-mail list and community service on the Internet!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
