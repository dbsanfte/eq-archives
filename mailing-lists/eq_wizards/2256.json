The spells of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the wizard are very limited. Sure we can do the most damage in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;shortest amount of time, but it&#39;s not THAT much more. But other than<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that, we can teleport like the druid, and that&#39;s all!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is incredible to me..... I just turned lvl 13 and my played time is 9<br/>\n&gt; days and 12 hours.
