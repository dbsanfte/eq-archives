I&#39;m not arguing with you the right to exploit a bug or not.<br/>\nAll I&#39;m saying is that most bugs are easily recognizable as bugs.<br/>\nTherefore when you use them to gain advantage, you are exploiting them.<br/>\nExploits and bugs are similar. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow if you go exploiting bugs, that&#39;s your prerogative. I for one will<br/>\nreport any that I find. They are not punishing you until they ban you<br/>\nfrom the game. Obviously they haven&#39;t yet, so don&#39;t complain to me. Go<br/>\nexploit away! Have a ball!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow about wizards...<br/>\n<br/>\nCroesus Illuminatus (Xegony)<br/>\n<br/>\nSergey Bukhman wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Sergey Bukhman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sergeyb@...\">sergeyb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; James Dwyer wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: James Dwyer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdwar@...\">jdwar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hm. Methinks you can &quot;Exploit a bug&quot; and call it cheating :P<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But usually when you take advantage of a good situation, that situation<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was not intended by the designers. Actually talking about really good<br/>\n&gt; &gt; situation, like where you find bronze stuff on decaying skel or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; somesuch. And I&#39;d call that cheating and exploiting.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hm, guess I don&#39;t really differentiate. Give an example where exploiting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is not cheating...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, tough! They (Verant) made the game, and now they are trying to punish US<br/>\n&gt; for playing it the way it is! They designed it and they have the bugs in. So let<br/>\n&gt; them fix the bugs and not tell us &quot;no you can&#39;t do this&quot;. That&#39;s stupid. They<br/>\n&gt; created the game and I&#39;m playing it the way it is.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; furthermore, nowhere on their site do they have a list of exploits that should be<br/>\n&gt; avoided. They do not give us a list when we log in to the game. Yet, we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; supposed to just know them? How stupid is that?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; THEY made the design error / bug, and now they expect us not to &quot;exploit&quot; it<br/>\n&gt; without even letting us know what&#39;s an exploit and what&#39;s not! They are punishing<br/>\n&gt; us for their laziness / un attentiveness!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Sergey<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; KPS PUNK (Paramilitary Undercover Nuclear Kamikaze)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking for a new hobby?
