If you have or know where I <br/>\ncan get a CGI/HTML script that will allow others to add their comments to <br/>\nthis web page please let me know. What I am looking for is a CGI data base <br/>\nthat allows external entries to be added then automatically updates a FAQ <br/>\nsheet. The automatic part is a must cause I like to play EQ too much to get <br/>\nstuck updating a web page. I can screen the page and omit others. I would <br/>\nreally like a CIG data base that would allow me to have a login and password<br/>\n<br/>\nsecurity that way those pesky fighters could not steal information. Also I <br/>\nwould be able to track who said what about quests or items to glean more <br/>\ninfo from then if needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElkantar Keeper of the Tome of Magi Lore<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
