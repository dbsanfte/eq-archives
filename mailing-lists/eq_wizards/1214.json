Of","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-50180613\">According to Lim Dul:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you can afford it, go for a runed totem staff.  About the same damage and <br/>\n&gt; delay, but it includes a small mana bonus and it&#39;s magical so you can hit <br/>\n&gt; ghouls.  Going rate is about 20pp.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Given the bonus of runed totem staff (mana +5? come on), if you find a<br/>\nWell-balanced Great Staff (which is also magical), you&#39;ll be probably happier.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, those 5 mana *could* means the difference between ignominous death<br/>\nand Gating to safety... :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut do not invest too heavily in two-handed weapons. There appear to be goodies<br/>\nthat are a must in your off-hand.  My best bet would be the Fanged Skull Stiletto<br/>\n(damage ratio: 0.5!!!, double of runed staff), one of the favorite Rogue<br/>\nweapons... that we happen to be able to wield :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that one is a lot further down the road :(<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
