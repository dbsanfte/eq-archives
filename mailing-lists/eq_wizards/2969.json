What if each NPC that dropped a Rare<br/>\nitem drop it more frequantly but in the same token also would not spawn if the<br/>\ngroup that killed that last spawn was ina  general vincinity.  Maybe even the<br/>\nsame zone depending on its location.  Which would cause the group to have to<br/>\nleave after it killed the spawn and another group could take their place till<br/>\nnext spawn and so forth.

I can understand why Verrant made<br/>\n&gt; things hard to get and rare... but the current method tends to encourage a<br/>\n&gt; lot of the parts of the game that is NOT fun.  (ie camping, hording for<br/>\n&gt; guildmembers, etc.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t offer a solution...would it be a better game if Verrant made it so<br/>\n&gt; every NPC *guaranteed* that you&#39;ll get the item you wanted?  Or if they made<br/>\n&gt; things spawn faster so everyone has a chance to kill it?
