So if higest lv cast root all other<br/>\nlower lv can concentrate on firing spells, as soon as monster moves again<br/>\nyou must cast root again by your highest caracter and he have a ruole to<br/>\nkill a beast with last shot. It is important that a rooter is free of<br/>\nmonsters as life of others depend on his ability to root.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll for now next tactic soon <br/>\n<br/>\nSilverion<br/>\nHigh elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\nFenin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\nmoderator mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
