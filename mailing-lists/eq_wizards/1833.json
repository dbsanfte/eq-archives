I<br/>\n&gt;am a level 21 Erudite wiz(Euros) playing on Rallos Zek.  From what I gather,<br/>\n&gt;the level 24 wizard DD spell Frost Shock does around 200 dmg for 110 mana.<br/>\n&gt;If this is the case, it sounds to me like this is the level where we<br/>\n&gt;wizard&#39;s start to mature.  That damage/mana ratio is very, very good.<br/>\n&gt;Nearly as good as DOT&#39;s.  Can any higher level Wizzies out there confirm<br/>\n&gt;this?  Also the 20th level spell Force Shock does great damage yet is<br/>\n&gt;resisted too often by &quot;dangerous&quot; blues and higher mobs to be my exclusive<br/>\n&gt;high damage spell.  Does this trend of high resistance continue as we get to<br/>\n&gt;higher levels?  Or is Force Shock some kind of special case?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Euros<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;What do lizards and rock music have in common?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;They both have communities at ONElist.
