I remember<br/>\n&gt;asking a gm about it, and he that&#39;s what he told me.  Additionally, only my<br/>\n&gt;primary specialization, evocation, has ever risen above 50.  All the others<br/>\n&gt;got to 50 and stopped dead.  I had practiced evocation, actually, up to 50<br/>\n&gt;and wondered why it wouldn&#39;t go higher.  That&#39;s when the gm told me that<br/>\n&gt;there needed to be 1 point in all of them to get them started before one<br/>\n&gt;would rise above 50.  I don&#39;t remember if he said that was a bug or<br/>\n&gt;intentional.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Zinken&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zinken@...\">zinken@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yes but i think it�s 2 skills that can be taken above the 50 mark. and <br/>\n&gt;as<br/>\n&gt;you said it�s much easier just to put the points in at the guild then <br/>\n&gt;trying<br/>\n&gt;with research runes. and above lv 30 the money aint a problem, you make<br/>\n&gt;atlest 100 plat when hunting HG�s or something like that for an hour or 2.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The quest for research runes and the books you need for it starts at <br/>\n&gt;gypsy<br/>\n&gt;camp in North Karana.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Askur Wizard of Veeshan<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
