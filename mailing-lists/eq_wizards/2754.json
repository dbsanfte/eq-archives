It is also a dangerus task if you miss and<br/>\nburn one second before time, you die. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur role as a major damage dealer is rapidly changing with last patchs<br/>\nwhere other Damage Over Time DOT spells have halved time and  doubled<br/>\ndamage done in unit of time. This spells are much more mana efficents then<br/>\nour DD.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy opinion on wizard class many of you have already read but to make it<br/>\nshort i like it and i play it but it needs many improvments to regain a<br/>\nplayebility wich have other classes it WAS one of balanced classes but is<br/>\nnow worst of all int casting classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n- It is starting INTELIGENCE casting class and it remain mostly unchanged<br/>\nin patches and main problem is monotony of play, look at group health bar,<br/>\nroot, burn, meditate, meditate and again meditate. <br/>\n<br/>\n- We are only casting class wich is useles once we used all mana all other<br/>\nclasses have long lasting buffs, pets, items. and all this work when a<br/>\ncaster is Out Of Mana OOM.<br/>\n<br/>\n- We are most feared and potencialy unbalancing group as we can deal damage<br/>\nfaster than any other class so we are from Verant side looked as a thing to<br/>\nleave in pace. They think that it is beter to leave us underpowered then to<br/>\nhave wizards rampaging around. <br/>\n<br/>\n- Many low lv players (what is majority now) have seen a wizard steal a<br/>\nkill, or gate around and think we are too powerfull, they dont know or<br/>\nunderstand a weaknas of wizards. This also have e great side that many wish<br/>\nto have a powerfull wizard in group eheheheheh only becouse they dont know<br/>\na truth.<br/>\n<br/>\n- wizard is simple to play burn, med, root for solo and not too much<br/>\ndiferent in group play so many people who find a two of 3 possible tactics<br/>\nthink that wizard is a great class until they get a new spells. or some<br/>\nbelive in a wizard is weak at start and at end ... (sucks more then rest)<br/>\n<br/>\n- and we are great for group fighting a group of blue MOBs (dont even thing<br/>\nto fight a red at higer levels  but  at high levels we are underpowered so<br/>\nthat we dont unbalance a game,  fast created patchs that dont work well<br/>\nlike ice comet spell, or hiden spells what you can hear that somone think<br/>\nthay exist.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn last patches there is a 2 important things as i see one is a root spell<br/>\nchange i dont understand whet they say about it but as wizards are main<br/>\nrooters in game this affect us more than any other class and there is also<br/>\nnew 39 lv spell wich i think is ultravision but im not shure for now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. in nearly all major games table or computer a high elfs are kings of<br/>\nmagic waht a hell verant wish to introduce a erudites they are god only as<br/>\na necro race! hmmmm i have one idea :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 14.54 15/07/99 +0200, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: RIVIERE STEPHANE &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Stephane.Riviere@...\">Stephane.Riviere@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;i just read the new patch message.. Damn.... From the<br/>\n&gt;begining, nothing as been change for the wizzards... They just change <br/>\n&gt; &gt;during<br/>\n&gt;the patch , the casting time . I have tested BEFORE and after : no &gt;change<br/>\n&gt;(that a clock can see, so it s surely a change of let s say 0,001 &gt;second or<br/>\n&gt;something like that.In other words : nothing.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;All patch just power up the race... Now the druid dot spel are fast like<br/>\n&gt;&gt;hell, necro same. And us ?? From the beginning, we have major bug who are<br/>\n&gt;&gt;not resolved and they do nothing for us...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hey hey, don&#39;t worry about it.  I&#39;ve been playing both a Shaman & Druid to <br/>\n&gt;get a feel for it, but nothing compares to a Wizard.  I&#39;m thinking of <br/>\n&gt;dropping my Druid character because she just plain sucks. Druids are good <br/>\n&gt;solo and group characters up to about 20level, then that&#39;s it.  All my high <br/>\n&gt;45+ level friends tell me they never invite Druids in their parties <br/>\n&gt;anymore...but Wizards are ALWAYS welcome.<br/>\n&gt;At high levels, a Druid will not have good enough armor to tank...so they <br/>\n&gt;essentially become weak Wizards.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;By that time, a Wizard of equal level will have strong shields and DD <br/>\n&gt;spells, AND all the teleport spells of a Druid.  So what about a Druid&#39;s DOT<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;spells, you can&#39;t kite Lady Voxx.  :)  (or can you? hehe)<br/>\n&gt;Nor will a Druid&#39;s heal spells be worthy of a Cleric.  So why have them?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The grass always looks greener somewhere else, but trust me....other <br/>\n&gt;characters are envious of a Wizard&#39;s spells as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We *maybe* need to be tweaked here and there...but stop comparing us to <br/>\n&gt;other characters.  It will get us nowhere.  We have a few 50Level Wizards on<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;our server that have demonstrated the effectiveness of our spells.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;IMHO,<br/>\n&gt;-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n&gt;Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am not sure you know how weak we are.... You tell about dd ? ok. Do you<br/>\n&gt;know that your best spel at level 50 only does 625 dommage ???? And that the<br/>\n&gt;best dd spel for DRUID is 615 (and they buy it IN A FUCKING SHOP)????<br/>\n&gt;Magician get a BOLT who deal 900 dommage at level 49 (AND THEY BUY IT TOO IN<br/>\n&gt;A FUCKING SHOP!)... ok it s a bolt so dificult to cast by WTF we must have<br/>\n&gt;the best dd spel no ????? With nearly the same mana/ratio.... Don t speak<br/>\n&gt;about ice comet, you never never will have it (unless you have 40 friend<br/>\n&gt;level 50 and who are ready to spare it with you...)... And oh yes : you best<br/>\n&gt;dd spel is fire based so you can NOT hit fire giant (nothing in solusek b in<br/>\n&gt;fact)and nagafen (who is one of the mob carrying the rune). So you use you<br/>\n&gt;level 39 sple at level 50.. that s pretty cool no ?  At level 34 you have a<br/>\n&gt;dd of 315 .. cool the magician have a bolt who deal 345 at 34 ...... So i am<br/>\n&gt;sure you realise how weak we are right now :). People ask us to group ? Yes<br/>\n&gt;cause they THINK we are the best dd caster... And it s not true at level 23<br/>\n&gt;you use a stupid level 16 spel. From 24 to 29 we are the best dd caster yep.<br/>\n&gt;But from 34 to the end, no way we are nothing. I have one friend who is<br/>\n&gt;level 50 dark elfe on karana (menahemen a french speaking guy coming from<br/>\n&gt;suisse). He just stop playing at level 50 not because he don t like his<br/>\n&gt;wizzard cause he was really bored about what verant does to us (i mean we<br/>\n&gt;are undepowere dlike hell so we don t hit the major mob of the game as<br/>\n&gt;nagafen and lady vox :( ). Some of you may (again) tell me : ohh stop<br/>\n&gt;spaming, just play another classe if you don t like this one, we are fine<br/>\n&gt;with it... Ok wait till high level and we will see.. So np continue play but<br/>\n&gt;never never hope to be (not the strongest) a regular class... Just hope to<br/>\n&gt;become the weakest class in the game but some like it ! (as i do :) )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;yakos <br/>\n&gt;level 26 wizzard karana<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;p.s. a druid is 15 times more useful then me in a group.... People just don<br/>\n&gt;t know we are so weak.... <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist now has T-SHIRTS!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Check out homepage for details.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Silverion Dragonirder<br/>\n<br/>\nHigh elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\nFenin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\nmoderator mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
