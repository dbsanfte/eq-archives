I started rooting and<br/>\nnuking at 4 and I haven&#39;t stopped since.  Even if it kept the mob off of me 1/4<br/>\nof the fight, it was still meant the difference of life or death to me.  By<br/>\nlevel 10ish (I think, its been a while since then) I was rooting Grizzleys in<br/>\nthe Karanas, and often finishing them off before root would break.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
