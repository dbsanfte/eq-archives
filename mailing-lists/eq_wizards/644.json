I am lvl 16 and got mauled by 6 undead sailors and<br/>\ncould not get enough time to figure out I couldn&#39;t cast on the boat, not<br/>\neven shadow step/gate to save myself.  I then ran off the boat with 1 bar<br/>\nhealth remaining and was killed while trying to cast my spells.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome would say this is part of the game...I disagree.  I cannot cast my<br/>\nspells (what wizards do best) on a docked boat to defend myself, yet others<br/>\nmay attack me.  Not fair, I say.  Maybe Verant should allow us to cast<br/>\nspells once the boats dock for loading and unloading?  That would be fair.<br/>\nI agree with their logic on not casting while boat is in motion (you can get<br/>\nfolks attacking NPC&#39;s from the boat and causing innocents to get killed).<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking for inputs as I am petitioning this.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Ziff</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
