I have <br/>\nno complants about how a spell works or how much damage it does or how <br/>\nunfair something is. I enjoy the game and have found that most every <br/>\ncharacter type has it&#39;s own flaws. A particular spell may not work as you <br/>\nlike it to but remember that if we got everything we wanted we would only <br/>\nwant more and bigger.<br/>\nAs for those of you who KS it is your choise and you&#39;ll regret it latter. <br/>\nI&#39;ve met many KS&#39;s and while at lower lv&#39;s it is good and everything latter <br/>\non when you need a little help or want to group your life will be miserable. <br/>\nI know so because I&#39;ve made KS&#39;s lives miserable by refusing to work with <br/>\nthem and the shouting so that all know what he is like. While there is a few <br/>\nthat will group with them on the whole I&#39;ve seen very few people who do <br/>\ngroup with him. Usually he is alone and miserable. That my bit and so so<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
