There is a sure-fire method that NEVER (at least<br/>\nfor me it hasn&#39;t, and I&#39;ve been using it for the last 10 levels) fails that<br/>\na friend of mine discovered.  Takes a little while to get used to it (muscle<br/>\nmemory, and all that) AND you don&#39;t have to move a step.  Not moving around<br/>\ncomes in handy when your fighting next to lava and/or near a place where<br/>\nmoving a little bit forward could aggro more mobs.  What&#39;s the secret you<br/>\nask?  DUCK!!!!  Works every time without fail.  Seems &quot;You must be standing<br/>\nto cast a spell&quot;.  Try it, it works.  Yes, yes, I know, I rule.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaureen LightningStorm, 31 Wiz<br/>\nLaszarus, 35 Ench<br/>\nPovar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
