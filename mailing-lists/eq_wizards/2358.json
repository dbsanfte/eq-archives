I have yet to meet a developer that &quot;allows<br/>\nthemselves the luxury<br/>\nof imperfection&quot;. I&quot;m not a heavy coder myself but have worked with many<br/>\ncoders in my time and <br/>\ni can comfortably say 95% of the coders i&#39;ve seen take so much pride in<br/>\ntheir code it&#39;s almost <br/>\nsickening. It&#39;s not the coders fault for buggy products, this goes back to<br/>\nmy earlier statement, <br/>\nWE the consumers DEMAND faster and better and Marketing departments in<br/>\nSoftware companies<br/>\nfeed off this frenzy and drive engineering depts. to develop these products<br/>\nthat WE DEMAND<br/>\nin insane time schedules. Engineers are just the poor slobs that get stuck<br/>\nwith these schedules that<br/>\nare absolutely un-fulfillable , driven by Marketing who is driven by US. <br/>\nIn software it&#39;s all about supply and demand and &quot;First to Market&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Same with M$ - they have no real competition so they allow themselves to <br/>\n&gt;release<br/>\n&gt;crap like Windows<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>yes and no .. there is plenty of competition, especially more so today than<br/>\never in the OS dept.<br/>\nyou say crap like Windows and everyone hates MS, but we all still run<br/>\nWindows (ok not all but <br/>\nmost PC users do). We ALLOW MS to stay in business and do this to us. Right<br/>\nor wrong that&#39;s a <br/>\nfact. We can run all different flavors of Linux, Solaris x86, SOC, BE OS,<br/>\nMac OS, Unixes, there are<br/>\noptions out there. <br/>\n<br/>\nanyhow .. i can go on for days, i&#39;m not saying you&#39;re right or wrong i&#39;m<br/>\njust offering a different point<br/>\nof view that is very easy to overlook in the heat of anger or dissapointment. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 04:12 PM 6/14/99 -0300, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Sergey Bukhman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sergeyb@...\">sergeyb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Saleen wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; There is no such thing as bug free software.
