It&#39;s supposingly found in Guk <br/>\nsomewhere.  My friend told me the name although I&#39;ve forgotten <br/>\nalready...I&#39;ll let you guys know when I ask again.  Says it&#39;s a real rare <br/>\nspawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want the black robes myself.  But from reading previous posts...it sounds <br/>\nlike it&#39;s a pretty challenging struggle to get it.  Better yet to just <br/>\npurchase it off of people who are starting to sell it.  I&#39;ve seen 150pp <br/>\ndeals so far.  But it IS more fun to go get it yourself. :)  Think it&#39;s off <br/>\nof Najena (?).<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Message: 2<br/>\n </span></blockquote>   Date: Wed, 2 Jun 1999 15:17:12 -0500<br/>\n   From: &quot;Marziani, Michael D.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Marziani@...\">Michael.Marziani@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Subject: Re: bath robes<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Aye I have seen the rod you speak of.
