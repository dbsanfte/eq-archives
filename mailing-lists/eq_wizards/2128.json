Again, this is not SoloQUEST (although its not really Quest<br/>\nanything yet with alot of quests broken).<br/>\n<br/>\nTanks have same trouble with even fights sometimes...I play a tank and<br/>\na wizard.   The tank is easy at low levels, but I remember taking on 3<br/>\nblack wolves and two orc pawns all at once with my wizard...he killed<br/>\nthma all and begged for more.  <br/>\n<br/>\n--- Gooey Smalls &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smullins@...\">smullins@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Gooey Smalls&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smullins@...\">smullins@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I gave up my wizard quite some time ago, they really<br/>\n&gt; are quite weak, only<br/>\n&gt; good for two things, grouping and stealing kills. <br/>\n&gt; What do other spell<br/>\n&gt; casting classes have that we lack?  Pets of course. <br/>\n&gt; The steel skin, leather<br/>\n&gt; skin line of spells should be altered in such a way<br/>\n&gt; that wizards from low<br/>\n&gt; lvl&#39;s (perhaps 8) can summon a sort of wall.  This<br/>\n&gt; wall would be sort of<br/>\n&gt; like a pet (graphically how it would show does&#39;nt<br/>\n&gt; concern me) but without<br/>\n&gt; offensive capabilities, it would simply soak damage<br/>\n&gt; and allow a wizard to<br/>\n&gt; not be interrupted.  For example, wizard A wants to<br/>\n&gt; solo an even fight orc,<br/>\n&gt; so he summons his wall of whatever, that soaks 50<br/>\n&gt; damage without the wizard<br/>\n&gt; actually being hit, the wizard can skip the risky<br/>\n&gt; root opening shot and get<br/>\n&gt; right to damage.  This would put wizards on an even<br/>\n&gt; playing field with other<br/>\n&gt; magic classes, they NEVER root for their opening<br/>\n&gt; shot, that&#39;s what their<br/>\n&gt; pets are for, we should&#39;nt have to rely on root<br/>\n&gt; either, we need something<br/>\n&gt; more definite like this wall idea.  It&#39;s the only<br/>\n&gt; thing that would get me to<br/>\n&gt; play the wizard class again.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ONElist:  where real people with real interests get<br/>\n&gt; connected.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
