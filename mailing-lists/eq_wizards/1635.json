Until then you must melee.  So my <br/>\nquestion stands what weapon is best?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; oh and about the making money issue: sometimes your lucky. I was at <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the dervish camp in Northern Ro on Fennin Ro and for some reason for <br/>\nabout 6 turns every derv that was on my turn had a BRONZE weapon! i <br/>\ngot 3 bronze rapiers! (3pp per rapier) i made 30pp in two hours !<br/>\n<br/>\nI am truely happy for you.  However, I went to NRO (with my bard I <br/>\nwill take Guile soon) and was squished twice fortunately exp loss is <br/>\ninversely proportional to the creature level that kills you so other <br/>\nthan leaving an ugly mark there was no big problem with it.  On the <br/>\nissue of luck, I have received 2 bronze weapons in all my time in NRO <br/>\nand 1 or 2 gems.  How much time have I spent there you ask?  I have 5 <br/>\nthats FIVE backpacks in the bank filled with derv rings that I cannot <br/>\npay people to take FROM me!  So please don&#39;t tell me about LUCKY ways <br/>\nto make money.  I need real advice on tried and true ways to earn <br/>\nmoney to equip my character.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====================================================================<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Richard A.
