I was with a<br/>\nlevel 29 cleric recently, and he has a spell (wrath) which was doing 198<br/>\ndamage to my 178. Granted, I am level 27, but was still kind of shocked. It<br/>\nwas only a two level difference, and he had a better DD spell, and could<br/>\nmelee too. And buff. And heal. I know at 29 I will get Inferno Shock, but<br/>\nthis just makes my think that we should be doing more damage, or have faster<br/>\nmana regen, or SOMETHING. Just another example of how Verant has made the<br/>\nwizard class suck.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreg (Kronan on Innoruuk)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
