Erud is very beautiful! I port to Felwithe to do my selling now, but my faction with merchants there is apprehensive. Ive only found 1 thing that will help that faction, releasing elf prisoners in Crushbone. <br/>\n<br/>\nAre there any other ways to get faction with Felwithe merchants, Erudin merchants or as last resort, Kelethin?<br/>\n<br/>\nShannyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Vincent Archer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Vincent.Archer@...\">Vincent.Archer@...</a>&gt; 11/30/99 09:21AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: Vincent Archer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Vincent.Archer@...\">Vincent.Archer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to PHAEDRA WHITLOCK:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Im here.
