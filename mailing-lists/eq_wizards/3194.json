I hear 100 is THE magic number... Found that out at level 2. :( Wisdom 75 Agi 90 dex 80 (base stats). Two +2 dex Dervish rings and a +5 hp ring.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to begin as a human, as we planned to group, me and some friends, and they all wanted to be humans (monks and warriors...) Turned out we rarely see each other due to RL time scheduling problems, and now Im 12th and theyre around 6th so... Thats why I was human, not elven (my fave race).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, sometimes I cast, it makes the whooshing You-Are-Casting sound, the time bar runs out, and nothing happens. No message on the screen that it was resisted, that any damage was taken, nor fizzled, nor monster-already-dead-pick-new-target. It used mana... so what happened to my spell?<br/>\n<br/>\nShannyn<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Hangar/9592/bio/Shannyn/Shannyn1.htm\">http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Hangar/9592/bio/Shannyn/Shannyn1.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marvin@...\">marvin@...</a>&gt; 09/27/99 10:20AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marvin@...\">marvin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 27 Sep 1999, PHAEDRA WHITLOCK wrote:<br/>\n&gt; How do you get Root to work?

So much better than Fade and Shadowstep!<br/>\n&gt; Saved my life yesterday in the dervish camp.<br/>\n<br/>\nat your level shadowstep and then gate is a great escape method...i&#39;ve<br/>\nfound that when you hit the really high teens though that everythign moves<br/>\nreally fast and shadow step doesn&#39;t help as much anymore...of course by<br/>\nthen the mana you spend for root is trivial, so root and gate become a<br/>\ndecently effective strat...<br/>\n<br/>\nStannis Starslyder<br/>\nWizard of the Moon<br/>\nInnoruuk </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
