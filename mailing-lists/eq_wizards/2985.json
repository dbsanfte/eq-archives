Who&#39;s NOT going to camp for things like <br/>\nJBoots?  :)  &quot;Tension&quot; is a good word to describe the amount of shouting <br/>\nI&#39;ve heard in areas where people camp for 8-hour long stretches.  heh<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the other ideas I&#39;ve heard are pretty good... level or class <br/>\nrestrictions.  I don&#39;t necessarily agree that it&#39;s a good idea to make <br/>\nthings rare just for the sake of merchantability (is that a word? heh, you <br/>\nknow what I mean I hope).  I think that only encourages the camping behavior <br/>\nthat we&#39;re trying to address.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if Verant is even considering these issues..anybody know?  I hate <br/>\nto be resigned to say that &quot;this stuff happens all the time in MUDs and you <br/>\ncan&#39;t do anything about it&quot;....there HAS to be a way!  :)<br/>\nI&#39;m just too clueless to think of a way right now....<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;I mean evryone want those good items and nothing is gona stop them, so <br/>\n&gt;sooner or<br/>\n&gt;later ppl will have em. So Veerrant cant keep those items away from ppl <br/>\n&gt;couse<br/>\n&gt;they want it, they are just making more tension in game with making things <br/>\n&gt;lore<br/>\n&gt;item and no drop. Couse then we will see those lv 45-50 ppl coming to <br/>\n&gt;Najena to<br/>\n&gt;get Jboots if they havent before or lost them. B </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
