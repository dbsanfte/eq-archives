But I dont need to take and extra 6 <br/>\nmonths to make moderately high level because I have to compete with cheating twinks.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they did not compete with me for creatures at my level I would not give a rats ass.  But they <br/>\ndo compete for creatures at my level and make it more difficult for me and you to level.  If you <br/>\nenjoy running around and killing snakes and bats and rats for a real time year of your life <br/>\nthats great but dont screw me with your liberal ill thought ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If they transfered items from their high lv caracters or if guild give it<br/>\n&gt; to them its ok for me i go around killing my bats and snakes and they do it<br/>\n&gt; in same way without skills they must work much things a same way as you do<br/>\n&gt; a little bit easier but they alredy worked for it.<br/>\n&gt; I played a long time a everquest creating some middle lv caracter and i<br/>\n&gt; know  how dificult it is to start it all over if you have find that your<br/>\n&gt; caracter is not what you wish and you decite to start new class.<br/>\n&gt; Im shure that a people wich complain are ones wich have enugh money and<br/>\n&gt; free time to play as long as they wish, ohers wich cannot support to pay a<br/>\n&gt; 10 $ a month and 1 $ a hour (as connection rates to internet go in europe)<br/>\n&gt; i aprove fully to transfer their items to new started caracter. If this is<br/>\n&gt; possible to do in game then its ok to do if you wish to pay 100 $ a month<br/>\n&gt; so that you can have a payed gm controling every transaction in game then<br/>\n&gt; its ok for you send email to Sony saying that you are ready to pay 100 $ a<br/>\n&gt; month to play a game where every move will be GM controled so wou can be<br/>\n&gt; shure that every caracter is not twinked ;-), They willl accept this idea<br/>\n&gt; gladly as soon they start reciving your bucks.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; About guild camping im strongly against it i support idea that if person<br/>\n&gt; wich killes a monster is more then 5 lv higher then loot will be only<br/>\n&gt; normal one and for special items only a 1/3 of normal chance or not at all<br/>\n&gt; so higer lv players wishing one item must buy it from a low lv players. it<br/>\n&gt; will be a nice push to player interaction.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Silverion<br/>\n&gt; High elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\n&gt; Fenin Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
