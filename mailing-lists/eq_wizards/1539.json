The <br/>\nwizard class is not designed to solo.  I agree with that design <br/>\ndecision by the way.  After all we are physical weaklings wondering <br/>\nthe landscape in a night robe with a stick.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo survive eventually you will have to learn to hit without being hit. <br/>\n However, up through 12th I find you will have to fight (melee) to <br/>\nconserve mana.  This is the case even if you are grouped in some cases <br/>\nespecially when your grouped as I will describe below.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere lies the conundrum.  Up through 12th your offensive spells are <br/>\nweak or use nearly all your mana.  Your melee talent will not be much <br/>\nconfort to tank types that will have to endure severe beatings as a <br/>\nresult of your inability to wade into the fight thus reducing your <br/>\ndesirability as a team member. Your desirability as a team member is <br/>\nfurther impared by the fact that if you do open up and burn critters <br/>\nto the ground you&#39;ll use much of your mana forcing the rest of the <br/>\nparty to wait for you to regenerate it reduciong the rate that <br/>\neveryone in the group levels or aquires bootie (the real reason most <br/>\nare there in the first place).  The game should actually be called <br/>\nGREEDquest or everGREED.  Anyway I digress.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short verant has designed a class that must group to survive but <br/>\nuntil higher levels you will find it difficult (at least I have on <br/>\nMithaniel Marr) to find a reliable groups to band with you as there <br/>\nare much better choices than wizards available to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo your back to soloing.  This means competing with the guilds and <br/>\ntanks types for the occasional straggling blue critter. You will have <br/>\nno choice but to burn baby burn.  Using up hordes of mana and having <br/>\nto rest or run most of the time.  This means the going will be very <br/>\nslow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a bard that went from 1 to 14 in one quarter of the time my <br/>\nwizard has taking to go from 1 to 9!  My bard has 90pp in the bank <br/>\nfull banded, 54 skill in blacksmithing, magic shield and magic weapon. <br/>\n And yes he freaking fought for every single piece of it.  This is not <br/>\nto say I am fond of the Bard type.  I really prefer my wizard.  But I <br/>\ncan fight and kill more effectively as a bard then a wizard through <br/>\nthe first 20 levels at least. I find it much easier to find groups to <br/>\nband with my bard.  As a low level wizard (lvl 9 just recently) I feel <br/>\nlike the fat kid at the baseball field.  You know the one.  Last to <br/>\nget picked and usually plays the catcher.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not found a solution to the problem short of finding a regular <br/>\nplayer or players to band with or joining a guild.  As a wizard if you <br/>\nare not connected (in the click) on your server plan on taking forever <br/>\nto lvl.  I have seen other wizards go from 3 lvls below me to 6 lvls <br/>\nabove me.  How?  Band baby band!  They have found a way to band on a <br/>\nregular basis.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOr they are cheating twinks that use their tank types or friends to <br/>\ngive them weapons, armour, magic items and cash to be more effective <br/>\nat soloing thru the early levels.  I have seen one level 7 wizard in <br/>\nfull netted with a glowing crook and what I am sure are 2 +15 mana <br/>\nbracers and 2 +5 mana rings.  Come on!  At 9th I can&#39;t even afford all <br/>\nthe useful spells through 8th level and am stuck worth a junky worn GS <br/>\nbut this yahoo is walking around in 200 to 250pp worth of stuff and <br/>\nhe&#39;s earned every piece.  SURE! <br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you want to advance in levels quickly as a Wizard band, twink or <br/>\nplan on watching other people make 4 lvls to your 1 and live with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Hello all, I`ve just started a new wizard, after decided that my old <br/>\n&gt; character wasnt fulfilling enough for me...I am a DarkElf on the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>E`Ci server, <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; at level 3 right now....any advice for me through the ranks?
