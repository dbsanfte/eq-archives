With a Pugius right now at lvl 13, and the<br/>\nskull, life is much <br/>\n\t\teasier.  Plus 20 mana is better than the runed staff can<br/>\nprovide, and the <br/>\n\t\tPugius attacks much, much quicker.  I am still looking for a<br/>\nfanged skull <br/>\n\t\tstilleto (anyone know where to get them), but once I have<br/>\nfound one, life <br/>\n\t\twill be much easier.<br/>\n\t\tZaeq, Wizard of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
