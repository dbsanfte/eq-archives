At the time I was only level 7.  So I am still hanging<br/>\nonto it, since my enchanter is still only level 2. :)  Yeah some day.....<br/>\nLevel 50 wiz, level 50 necro, level 50 enchanter, level 50 magician.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk ok so I play on playing EQ for the rest of my life.  Or at least untill<br/>\nsomething better comes along.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is that they are out there.  I had a friend find a rune on a<br/>\ncrocidile in oasis and one on a Orc in high hold.  So as far as I can tell<br/>\nthey are probably rare finds on the low level creatures.  As we get to<br/>\nhigher level sutff  they are probably more common.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Message: 2<br/>\n&gt;   Date: Fri, 30 Apr 1999 03:08:35 -0400<br/>\n&gt;   From: &quot;Brad Fetkovich&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetko1@...\">fetko1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Rune of Banding<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve killed many warriors there and haven&#39;t gotten any runes.. i&#39;m lvl 16<br/>\n&gt;and they&#39;re much lower, do you know if creatures have to be of a close lvl<br/>\n&gt;to give runes or doesn&#39;t it matter?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SPRUSBRUCE@...\">SPRUSBRUCE@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Thursday, April 29, 1999 10:45 PM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eq_wizards] Re: Rune of Banding<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SPRUSBRUCE@...\">SPRUSBRUCE@...</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ITs in the warrior camp im not sure of the exact loc but ive gotten 3<br/>\n&gt;there,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; their by the dwarven bandit camp about the dwarvenb outpost right before<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; crossroads turn right coming from kaladim and you can find them<br/>\n&gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
