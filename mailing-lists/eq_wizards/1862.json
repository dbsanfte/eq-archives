Groups fight series of monsters.<br/>\nWizards go in great in 2 or 3 member group as monster hit a fighter, healer<br/>\nbuffer spend mana on healing fighter and buffs or pet help and we spend mana on<br/>\nnuking and rooting, but this is possible IF a group fight yellows or whites.<br/>\nAfter a fight all spend same time meddling to get mana back and fighter hits<br/>\nback ? <br/>\nBut when we are in group of 5 - 6 members things go in other direction you<br/>\ncannot nuke as your spells are resisted from red guys or if you nuke you spend<br/>\ntoo much mana and group must wait on you to get it back much more time then<br/>\nthey need to wait to other group member to be ready for fight !! this is why I<br/>\nproposed to get for wizards grater mana recovery rate -- monk have on his<br/>\nprimary skill dual wielding /(lv + 1) * 7 skill limit why we cant have it on<br/>\nmeditation or specialization skill ? Other mana users have pets and buffs and<br/>\nother advantages you don�t get them. You recognize here that specialization<br/>\nskill is NOT IN GAME YET !! it is clear signal that game is not finished yet<br/>\nand we will pass another wave of balancing and rebalancing after this new<br/>\nskills come in.<br/>\n<br/>\nWizard is easy to confound with other classes as once when you see a mighty<br/>\ndamage spells you are hypnotized with this but is it all? how much time you<br/>\nspend to be ready again can you fight a series of light skirmishes and then go<br/>\nin big fight?<br/>\n<br/>\nNearly all in this world can be made better and in one group where all other<br/>\nMagic using classes get upgrades because they send feedback to verant, I will<br/>\ncontinue to send my ideas how I look at a game and how a class which I prefer<br/>\ncan be made better, please argument why we don�t need any changes why we must<br/>\nstay stick with first idea which we see its like go in first zone and stay<br/>\nthere all life never exploring new depths which are around us !<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 09.50 26/05/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;McGraw, T.

(by 3 people over shout no less)  If that is the opinion of the<br/>\n&gt;majority of the populace in a game that is suppose to be group only, then I<br/>\n&gt;say we need something to make us more valuable...&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am not sure who was laughing or for what reason but rest assured that<br/>\n&gt;wizards have no problems finding a group. I can&#39;t count the times that my<br/>\n&gt;group(I have a few people I constantly group with) will not pull critters<br/>\n&gt;while I am AFK, they recognize that I do most of the damage in a big fight<br/>\n&gt;and they have died without my help many times. I think the problem is that<br/>\n&gt;at your level people tend to think that any of the other spell casters are<br/>\n&gt;just as good as you(or better because they can buff) but what they don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;understand is that you are the supreme damage dealer. You can and will make<br/>\n&gt;the difference in a lot of fights. You need to find people who understand<br/>\n&gt;what a wizard is meant to do and those that appreciate what you bring to a<br/>\n&gt;group. Keep looking because those people are out there and they become much<br/>\n&gt;more prevalent at levels 16 and up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yours,<br/>\n&gt;~Aereuss Ravins of Tarew Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Looking for a new hobby?
