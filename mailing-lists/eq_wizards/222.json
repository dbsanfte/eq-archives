Also, if you find yourself in a group where a melee-damager<br/>\ntype guy has the 2HB skill but no magic weapon, it can be handy to toss it<br/>\nover to them if you trust that they will indeed return it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Larimus La&#39;shain&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:larimus@...\">larimus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;After many levels of wishing I finally got my Runed Totem Staff for<br/>\n&gt;the bargan basement price of 13 pp (though I&#39;m quite broke now).<br/>\n&gt;However it isn&#39;t as effective as I thought. Anything that is tough<br/>\n&gt;enough to need a good damage weapon I generally can&#39;t hit ( I believe<br/>\n&gt;my 2h blunt is maxed ) and anything that isn&#39;t that tough I can nuke<br/>\n&gt;in no time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So my question is should I sell it for 20 pp and buy more of my ranks<br/>\n&gt;spells ( i&#39;m level 12 and only have Shock of Lightning and bind<br/>\n&gt;affinity ) If so which spells should I buy? Or should I stick with<br/>\n&gt;the staff. Just want some friendly advice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;TIA<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
