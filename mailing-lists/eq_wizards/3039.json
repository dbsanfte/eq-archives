Try playing one.  Once you get past the<br/>\n&gt; 20s your pretty much a<br/>\n&gt; mana only person.  Sure you can take a few extra<br/>\n&gt; hits (like 2 or 3) and<br/>\n&gt; maybe you can do a bit more damage in melee but its<br/>\n&gt; not that much.  Not to<br/>\n&gt; bash on Druids as I said earlier I like that class<br/>\n&gt; but when stuff his<br/>\n&gt; hitting for 50 to 70 damage with multiple attacks<br/>\n&gt; Druid&#39;s don&#39;t last too long.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just a note: A good friend with whom I work plays a druid.

For reds<br/>\nup to the Resist cap, he just kites them.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue, he&#39;s nowhere near as good a tank as, say, an equivelant level<br/>\nranger.
