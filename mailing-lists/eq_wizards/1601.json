I am now aware the gms/guides consider it exploitation and they will chew you for it.  I am told the doors are considered part of a safe zone, although I don&#39;t see how the side of the mountain qualifies, I was made aware of that as well.  Just news for us magic users since we are the &quot;worse exploiters&quot; in their eyes.<br/>\nThere are people who do this, but for those of us who don&#39;t do things purposely and try to play fair, I thought this was a good informative post.  Ya never know what they are going to change next.<br/>\nThis needs to be made public because they aren&#39;t going to for fear of exploitation.. at the same time though, people who have been playing since the start and are not aware of this limitation/rule are going to be accused of exploiting a safe zone, so I feel that the only way around that is for people to share this information so the average honest player does not get in trouble for doing the same stuff they have always done in the game.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
