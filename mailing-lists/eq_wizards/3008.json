Witness the<br/>\n&gt; Glowing Stein debacle - the hard part was solving the quest. Once the first<br/>\n&gt; stein was obtained, hundreds followed on all servers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One can increase the difficulty to get an item by:<br/>\n&gt;         - raising the level needed to get it (which puts all rare items at the<br/>\n&gt;                 level 50, everything before is chaff)<br/>\n&gt;         - raising the difficulty of the location (which, once a group gets down<br/>\n&gt;                 the unvarying routine down pat, stops being true)<br/>\n&gt;         - raising the difficulty of finding the item (which is the case with<br/>\n&gt;                 mega-rare spawns. How many players do you know with a Scarab Ring?)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is one other solution that to me is a lot more in keeping with the<br/>\nAD&D style that I think people are used to - randomization.  You are<br/>\nright tho that virtually all quests are breaks down to kill X and give<br/>\nits head/heart/tongue/whatever to NPC Y.  But randomizing would make<br/>\nthem more quest-like.  Easier to explain in an example:<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone knows who to talk to to start the glowing stein.  Instead of<br/>\nhis fixed dialog though, imagine if he says I need a rare and exotic<br/>\ndrink. You say &quot;I would like to help you&quot;.  He says &quot;Here is a recipe<br/>\nbook.  Find the ingredients listed here and return them in the book to<br/>\nme.&quot;  Each item would have one more set of fields that should be<br/>\nrandomly generated every time you get the quest given to you.  Maybe<br/>\nmake it from a more appropriate list, you might not need a gargoyle eye<br/>\nfor a level 10 quest, but you get the idea.  Then you keep this book<br/>\nwith you, refer back every few play sessions, seeing what you need. <br/>\nMaybe you need to figure out where to get an item even! (ack- a real<br/>\nquest!)  THEN - continue this.  You return the book.  You get the item<br/>\n&quot;The Glowing Stein&quot;.  Except that its is +5 to +10 int, and +5 to +10<br/>\ndex - maybe you get lucky and get the ultra rare +10 +10 stein.  Voila -<br/>\nyou have a dynamic quest that no web page is going to spoil, and<br/>\neveryone is NOT alike!  <br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, to address the twinking problem:  Maybe the stein instead of<br/>\ngiving +10 int would give (+2 times level/10).  Therefore, your level 50<br/>\nwizard has a +10 int stein, but his twinked level 2 wizard has the same<br/>\nstein at +0 int!  Easily explained that with wisdom of levels you gain<br/>\nthe ability to use a sword better (damage =level, or something similar),<br/>\ngain more power from the gem, or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my few coppers worth.  Unfortuntaly, it is probably too late for<br/>\nthis version, but that would all make nice additions to the expansion!<br/>\n<br/>\nMicon Bittermage<br/>\nKarana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
