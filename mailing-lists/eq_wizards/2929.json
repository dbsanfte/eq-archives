I apologize to the submitter for taking","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-188479729\">A viewer sent me this reply he received from GZ concerning the balance issues<br/>\nwith the classes, Wizards in particular. I apologize to the submitter for<br/>\ntaking so long to post this, but I wished to get GZ&#39;s permission to do so. So,<br/>\nhere it is in all its glory.... please take all discussion to the Rant message<br/>\nboard. Thanks!<br/>\nGeoffrey Z<br/>\n: &quot;I honestly feel that most spell casting classes are pretty well balanced.<br/>\nWizards complain a lot that they don&#39;t have the versatility at higher levels -<br/>\nbut I also get an equal number of e-mails from Druids, saying that they wish<br/>\nthat they were more specialized. They feel that people would rather have a<br/>\nWizard then them - since a Wiz can do more damage, and a Cleric is better at<br/>\nhealing. At this point, I feel that most magic classes are very well balanced -<br/>\nwe won&#39;t be changing much in the future with what spells / the power of spells<br/>\nthat the casting classes get. Most people won&#39;t be happy with this - they feel<br/>\nthat their particular class is underpowered. But for every class we tweak,<br/>\nother classes feel that they are now worse (we up the Wizard damage, give them<br/>\nnew spells, then Druids feel that they are no longer needed. We let Wizards<br/>\nhave DoTs, and then Necros and Shamans say they aren&#39;t needed, etc.). We are in<br/>\na pretty good balance state right now... Geoffrey C. Zatkin&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n* my comment *<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that it is imposible to belive he compares us a hardest class to play<br/>\nat low lv, at middle lv and only at high lv we get a normal play what other<br/>\nclasses have from start with a druids wich realy have a easiest life at start<br/>\nof all clases, normal middle lv wich they can KITE all time, and normal at<br/>\nhiger lv.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2 message is from a EQcasters<br/>\n<br/>\nï¿½       I also put this to him about Wizards: Wizards don&#39;t really seem to be<br/>\nthe ultimate damage dealers they should be. They just chew through the mana too<br/>\nfast for the damage they do. The other classes can do the equivalent damage<br/>\nwith maybe a few hundred more mana spent all up. A lot of wizards feel that at<br/>\nhigh levels they don&#39;t have the pure blasting power they imagined a level 50<br/>\nshould have. <br/>\n<br/>\nHis response: Wizards are the ultimate damage dealers for damage done in a<br/>\nshort<br/>\nperiod of time. In this area, they have no rivals - hands down. Ice Comet cast<br/>\ntwice does more damage in 13 seconds that most other casters can do in twice<br/>\nthe amount of time. Is this useful in all situations? No. Does this mean that<br/>\nthe Wizard class is uniquely qualified to save the party when the situation<br/>\ngets bad? Yes<br/>\n <br/>\n* belish comment * <br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind this comment on wizards is focusing on Level 49 and 50 Wizards.<br/>\nThe fact that Ice Comet is unbeatable is all good and well, but with Plane of<br/>\nFear now almost impossible I don&#39;t know how sustainable it is, since getting<br/>\nthe spell is now a major hurdle<br/>\n<br/>\n*my coment* <br/>\n<br/>\nYes only if i dont miss lord nagafen is a 63 lv guy so if 50 lv * 1.2 is 60<br/>\nwizard cant scrach him as it will resist all he is over a balance resistance<br/>\ntable . Chasic thule is now over this lv also eheheh so my friends what we can<br/>\ndo? <br/>\n<br/>\nPETITION ALL<br/>\n<br/>\n1. lower resistance or 2 different DD spels for lv so we have ammo for our<br/>\nspells if a mob resist one we can have other to use. ( it can be done easily in<br/>\nplace of one of two lines of AE spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. on partial resists used only partial mana !!<br/>\n<br/>\n3. We cant have more mana as there is danger that we will Kill steall more then<br/>\ngive us a faster mana regeneration !! If monks have his primary skills 7 * lv<br/>\ncap we can have same for meditation !! Warrior is our exact oposit and they<br/>\nhave big hit points now they have also criticals and we need to get lower<br/>\nresistence and also faster mana regeneration to compensate what we are without<br/>\npets, buffs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all coment welcome<br/>\n<br/>\nSilverion Dragonirder<br/>\n<br/>\nHigh elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\nFenin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\nmoderator mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
