I am having an enjoyable time <br/>\ngrouping with one other player, usually L10 Ranger or L10 Rogue.  <br/>\nKill something big, sit down and chat awhile.  I recommend the undead <br/>\npawns on the chessboard, but be careful of overcrowding.  Last night <br/>\nsome monk tried to claim all the kills by hitting them once then <br/>\nyelling kill stealer when we tried to get one out of five.  I once <br/>\nagain proved that it is a waste of time to try to take a kill from a <br/>\nwizard.  (smiles proudly)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, its a matter of taste, but I like to hit a big thing and then <br/>\nrest.  Killing a lot of weaker stuff for exp is tough with all the <br/>\ncampers out there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLet the tank do most of the damage, and then if he gets to hurting, <br/>\njust phaser the MOB to the ground.  Lots of fun!  Then recharge at <br/>\nyour leisure.  A little thought and that gate spell will be <br/>\nunnecessary.  Find a regular partner who thinks like you do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis level I have gotten noticeable exp with almost every kill, so I <br/>\nmust be doing something right.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee you on Bristlebane!<br/>\n<br/>\nCalyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Hi,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I play a High Elf Wizard.
