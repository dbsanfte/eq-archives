You should be able to cast spells on a docked boat.  Maybe they dont want the extra animation lagging the boat ride up?  *shrugs*  But, yeah, I think we should at least be able to cast Gate while on a docked boat...<br/>\n<br/>\nDrev<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tSpehar, David J[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:David.Spehar@...\">David.Spehar@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tTuesday, April 27, 1999 8:01 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[eq_wizards] Unfair?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Spehar, David J&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:David.Spehar@...\">David.Spehar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please give your thoughts on this:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Traveling from Queynos to Euridan the boat stops at the Cat island.<br/>\n&gt; Frequently adventures bring trains of undead to the boat and we wizards get<br/>\n&gt; stuck on the stopped boat stunned and unable to cast our offensive spells to<br/>\n&gt; clear up the situation.  I am lvl 16 and got mauled by 6 undead sailors and<br/>\n&gt; could not get enough time to figure out I couldn&#39;t cast on the boat, not<br/>\n&gt; even shadow step/gate to save myself.  I then ran off the boat with 1 bar<br/>\n&gt; health remaining and was killed while trying to cast my spells.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some would say this is part of the game...I disagree.  I cannot cast my<br/>\n&gt; spells (what wizards do best) on a docked boat to defend myself, yet others<br/>\n&gt; may attack me.  Not fair, I say.  Maybe Verant should allow us to cast<br/>\n&gt; spells once the boats dock for loading and unloading?  That would be fair.<br/>\n&gt; I agree with their logic on not casting while boat is in motion (you can get<br/>\n&gt; folks attacking NPC&#39;s from the boat and causing innocents to get killed).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Looking for inputs as I am petitioning this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - Ziff<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Did you know that knowledge is power?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new ONElist e-mail community and strengthen your mind!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
