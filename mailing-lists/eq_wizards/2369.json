A fellow wizard <br/>\nand I, him being level 22 and I 20 at the time, decided that we really didn&#39;t <br/>\nhave anything to lose so lets have fun.  Griffawns can be fought solo at <br/>\nlevel 16, if your root sticks, so we decided to try out the Griffennes which <br/>\nconned red to both of us.  The best way to take one on we found out was to <br/>\nstand at opposite sides of the bird, and have one damage it, and another <br/>\nenstill it, and then damage it.  When the enstill wore off, and the stupid <br/>\nthing charged me, I ran in a circle around my friend, far enough out so it <br/>\nwould not attack either of us it enstilled again.  Once its rooted/enstilled, <br/>\nyou can repeat the process!  Damn fine loot, good exercise from the running, <br/>\nand nobody gets slain.  (No guarantees on this one, but neither of us ever <br/>\ntook more than 70 damage without SOW on us)  Go out, and kill some <br/>\ngriffennes, get some runes, and make the other classes jealous of the might <br/>\nof a wizard or two. )<br/>\nZaeq Alefiend, Eci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
