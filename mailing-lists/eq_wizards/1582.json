I have one.  I have no idea what you could auction it for because<br/>\nI don&#39;t plan to give it up anytime soon.. or at least til I get a Flowing<br/>\nblack robe :)... I would guess, however, you could probably ask 8p-10p+ and<br/>\nget it.  I don&#39;t recall what the jr. and sr. app robes went for in the<br/>\nguild.. that might be a good reference point though.  I&#39;m sure there will be<br/>\na difference of opinion on this, but thats my take at least :).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Donald Taber &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dtaber@...\">dtaber@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: EverQuest Mailing List &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Thursday, May 20, 1999 11:52 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Armor Question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Donald Taber &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dtaber@...\">dtaber@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am a 14th Level Wizard and am wondering what robes and armor I should<br/>\n&gt;be searching for.  I have heard that Gossimer Robes are some of the best<br/>\n&gt;robes, is this true?  If so, any idea on how much they fetch at an<br/>\n&gt;auction?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;For other armor pieces, I have heard woven is good.  What about Mesh?<br/>\n&gt;Can Wizards use Mesh or is Woven armor the armor of choice?  Again, any<br/>\n&gt;ideas for prices on woven and/or mesh?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Soren<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Looking to expand your world?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;ONElist has nearly 150,000 e-mail communities from which to chose! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
