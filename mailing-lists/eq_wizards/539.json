In the bertoxulous server the highest lvl charcter i believe is lvl 20,<br/>\na significant amount of ppl are camping in Black Burrow waiting in the giant<br/>\nsnake room for giant snakes to spawn, i generally belive that as the most<br/>\npowerful race/class combination (wizard/erudite) i have the right to take<br/>\nwhatever i want.  Beyond this i follow the warlord as my deity.  As you well<br/>\nknow, noone likes a kill &quot;stealer&quot;, i have around 30 ppl on my ignore list<br/>\nwho just can&#39;t deal with the fact that wizards are their superiors.  To shut<br/>\nthese ppl up once and for all,i turned PK.  Now not only do i take whatever<br/>\nmonster i want, but i take out any othe PK that i want as well. In the event<br/>\nthat i am challenged to a duel (this happens quite often) i simply inform<br/>\nthem that if they turn red we can do it right, otherwise they should just<br/>\nsit there and cry.  PKing has it&#39;s advantages, the loot is great and it<br/>\nreally adds an extra sense of danger to the game, you can be in your newbie<br/>\narea heading to your favorite hunting spot, you can still be attacked right<br/>\nthere and killed by another PK.  Keeps you on your toes and i rather like it<br/>\n:)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
