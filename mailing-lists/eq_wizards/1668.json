Play the game yourself and <br/>\ndo your thing. It&#39;s kind of painfull to get a 30 day suspension. If you <br/>\nreally want to do harm to someone look for the people exploiting bugs and <br/>\nstuff like that not some tiny little thing like tweaking their characters <br/>\nand you never know she might have had something happen to her like for <br/>\nexample a friend of mine refused to pay a toll in freeport and the guard <br/>\nattacked him so he killed the guard now he can&#39;t walk into freeport because <br/>\nthe guards kill him so he made a new character and transfered all his stuff <br/>\nto his new character. Find things out or just mind your own buisness before <br/>\nmessing up a persons gaming. Her tweaking isn&#39;t doing you any damage so just <br/>\nleave it alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean no disrespect by it but it just bothersme to see people who have a <br/>\nfit out of nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Neil Lambert&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smartass@...\">smartass@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eq_wizards] Horrifying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>\n&gt;Date: Sun, 23 May 1999 21:05:47 -0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;i saw her again today<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;lol she tried to lie her way out of it (like this is even remotely <br/>\n&gt;believable) she says she just knows how to play well! lol... i wish i <br/>\n&gt;remembered her name!

In a way I dont care if people do <br/>\n&gt;this, I have seen lvl 15 in oracle robes which are found of of lvl 40ish <br/>\n&gt;mobs I think. But, what I dont like is how guilds &quot;take over&quot; an item spawn <br/>\n&gt;site to supply all of their lower lvls with items takeing away the chacne <br/>\n&gt;that others have to get the items.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
