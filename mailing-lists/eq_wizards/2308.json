You just need to actually hold the item in your <br/>\nhand (cursor).  You have to actually take it out of your inventory and then <br/>\nclick done at the bottom so you go back to the spells you have memorized, <br/>\nthen click the spell and it will tell you about what you are holding.  It <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t really do a whole heck of a lot though.  Its one of those spells I <br/>\nhope they do something for to make it worthwhile.  I find its just a <br/>\nnovelty pretty much...at least I haven&#39;t found any real use for it yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 03:46 AM 6/11/99 +0100, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: TaffyPaulB &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:TaffyPaulB@...\">TaffyPaulB@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hail fellow wizards of Norrath,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Could some wise wizard please pass along some of their unbound knowledge &<br/>\n&gt;explain just how you use the Identify spell?
