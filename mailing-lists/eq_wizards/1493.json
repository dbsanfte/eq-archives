I have not personally experienced <br/>\nthat happening (because I use it very rarely if at all), but I have heard <br/>\nof others who have used it in the dungeons only to pull a bunch of nasties <br/>\nout on themselves, and everyone else, in the process.  It is kind of a <br/>\nnovelty spell, if you ask me, with no real use at this point.  If they made <br/>\nthe eye an entity that monsters would not train on it would be worthwhile, <br/>\notherwise I would just wait.

My guess is that you will find it in the<br/>\n&gt;Guild of mages OR in the Temple of Life.
