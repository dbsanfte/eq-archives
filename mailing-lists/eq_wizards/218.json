He is an half elf, so i agree they have more agility then us. But i<br/>\n&gt; already make some test and it seems that +8 in agility only give 1 in ac<br/>\n(i<br/>\n&gt; tried with two rings +4 agility). Our dex are the same and for the armor<br/>\nhe<br/>\n&gt; only get 5 ac more then me. My current armor class (without any spel) is<br/>\n&gt; 177. Not bad, not good i agree :). So i come to the fact : what is the<br/>\n&gt; maximum defense skill for a wizzard ??? Can you gain offense (and defense)<br/>\n&gt; skill vs green creatures ? I know of a rules telling that a wizzard can<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; 3+ (level *3) in his attack skill (piercing for example) but i know that i<br/>\n&gt; am at 48 at defense so this rule dones&#39;t seem to apply for offense and<br/>\n&gt; defense (only for piercing blunt ect). So someone can tell me more about<br/>\n&gt; this rule or about ac in general (for wizzard?). And last question any<br/>\ngood<br/>\n&gt; idea where i can find good armor for a wizzard ? (actually the best armor<br/>\ni<br/>\n&gt; get is bear boot 5ac).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you all<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; yakos<br/>\n&gt; level 12 wizzad<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Riviere St�phane - Siemens Business Services<br/>\n&gt; B-5020 Namur (Belgium) - Rue de N�verl�e, 11<br/>\n&gt; Tel.: +32-81-554-334 Fax: +32 (0)81 568 193<br/>\n&gt; Microsoft System Engineer<br/>\n&gt; Email: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stephane.riviere@...\">stephane.riviere@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Tired of empty chat rooms and out of date bulletin boards?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ONElist: Making the Internet Intimate<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
