As well as Enc. Mages, Necs, and Druids(I&#39;m<br/>\nsure any spell casting class can).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy should those of us who don&#39;t abuse the class suffer because of the<br/>\nidiots? The only time I have ever killed someone elses crit without asking<br/>\nis if they dropped to 2 bubbles or less and the Crit was still above half.<br/>\nEverytime I was thanked because they would rather me get the Exp for the<br/>\nkill than them lose 1/4 a bubble of exp and have to retrieve their stuff....<br/>\nMatter of fact the only place I&#39;ve seen as a KS problem is in dungeons.<br/>\n<br/>\n                    !!!!!NEWSFLASH!!!!<br/>\nAnatomy of a KS-<br/>\nIn BB When a tank comes down to the bridge with a few gnolls in tow for his<br/>\nparty to beat on Mr. KS Spellcaster will target what? That&#39;s right the<br/>\nbiggest toughest thing in the group: Usually the Gnoll Elite or the<br/>\nCommander. When I see something like this I just turn auto attack off and<br/>\nlet the Elite or whatever go play with the caster. I guarantee a few deaths<br/>\nlike this and attitudes will change.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is it that hard? This was not meant to be a mindless game. It was meant<br/>\nto be thought about. Does anyone think anymore???<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with the Hill Giant assessment: Once we&#39;re OOM we&#39;re toast by even<br/>\nthe smallest crit.<br/>\n<br/>\nReducing the effectiveness of the Wizard class at higher levels will more<br/>\nthan upset me... I&#39;ll be changing classes. I suppose no one complains about<br/>\nthe fact that Druids once they reach Level 14 can solo MOB&#39;s that con Red<br/>\nand are 3-5 levels above them? I look at the high level players in game and<br/>\nDruids are right up there in the 40&#39;s and I&#39;ve rarely seen a Wiz over 35.<br/>\nDon&#39;t punish the whole class for a few of the Asses out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis better just be a rumor or all the hardwork I&#39;ve done so far is for<br/>\nnot.....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCinius<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your free, private email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.excite.com/\">http://mail.excite.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
