Was wondering about others <br/>\n&gt;experience with researching Ice Comet in terms of failing to make spell. I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt;not planning on trying anyway until level 50, almost level 49 now. Has <br/>\n&gt;anyone failed to make the scroll or know of anyone who has failed? Would <br/>\n&gt;hate to  have to collect all those rods again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, anyone know of any good places for experience at levels 48-50 other <br/>\n&gt;than sol b or lower guk? Those places are way too camped. I go to Kedge when <br/>\n&gt;I can, but need a group for that. Verant waited far too long to make more <br/>\n&gt;higher level places to hunt. I do not like guard hunting because I hate to <br/>\n&gt;be KOS in places I may want to visit later. Any ideas appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kronan, level 48 wiz on Innoruuk<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ive herd some stories of people failing on the actual research part of the<br/>\nquest multiple times.  Ive seen auctions from people now for IC scrolls<br/>\n(premade) in a few zones, even have gotten a tell or two from people trying<br/>\nto sell IC spells to wizards.  Kinda weird I got my first tell asking if I<br/>\nwanted to buy an IC scroll not 5 min after I hit 46.<br/>\nPersonally I&#39;ll probably go the route of buying the spell from someone<br/>\nelse.  I am not that crazy about doing the quest again to get the staff.<br/>\nIve herd that its Unwise to attempt to research level 49 spells unless you<br/>\nhave about 140 in research skill.  Im at about 130 now, and assuming I can<br/>\nfind Astral Runes I&#39;ll train the extra points and just do the work myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n5.5 bubbles to 49<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack, Knight Defender of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
