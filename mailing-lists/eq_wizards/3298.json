I camped the other<br/>\nday with two of my level 40+ friends (warrior and a cleric) and we killed<br/>\nshadowed men nonstop (as fast as was possible.  We were constantly waiting<br/>\nfor them to respawn, and they respawn in about 5 min or so) for about 3<br/>\nhours strait and I saw several shadowed patches, eye, fist, mask, book,<br/>\nshining stone, and numberless weapons, but no ball.  Is it possible to get<br/>\nit or is it super rare??<br/>\n<br/>\n-Shadowwalker</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
