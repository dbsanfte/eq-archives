BUT...  it IS a good example to a certain extent.  The topic wasn&#39;t that you cant interrupt monster spells..  it was about the root effect being cancelled if you were hit in melee.  It WAS a good example.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway thats just MHO.  =)<br/>\n<br/>\nDrev<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.  Nice idea with the 6 wizards...  we&#39;ve tried it with 3...  didn&#39;t work too well.  But you&#39;re probably right.  We should try it with 6. heh<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tKen Lee[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kenlee@...\">kenlee@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tMonday, April 19, 1999 11:19 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[eq_wizards] 836pts of damage in under 10 secs from a 14th wizard<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Ken Lee&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kenlee@...\">kenlee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     PCs can&#39;t interrupt monster spells. Well, not that I&#39;ve ever seen. If<br/>\n&gt; someone can refute this, then let me know. So I&#39;m not sure if your ROOT<br/>\n&gt; example is really a good one.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now, while on the subject of killing things, I thought of something that I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; like to try.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d like to form a 6 player all wizard party. I&#39;m on the Solusek Ro server,<br/>\n&gt; 14th Wizard, would like to have about the same level.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Verant, and everyone is always saying that you need to mix classes to level<br/>\n&gt; and go up the fastest. Here&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Form group.<br/>\n&gt; Everyone target same large honking creature.<br/>\n&gt; One person shouts &quot; NUKE! &quot;<br/>\n&gt; Everyone clicks on shock of lightning<br/>\n&gt; BLAM<br/>\n&gt; 456 pts of dmg.<br/>\n&gt; 1 Shot.<br/>\n&gt; 1 Kill<br/>\n&gt; Thank you for shopping at Wizzie mart.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Even if it&#39;s still alive and not running away, next volley should be for an<br/>\n&gt; additional 380pts<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (assuming that 1 person is attacked and spell is interrupted).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; End result after 2 rnds: 836 pts of damage in I figure about less than 10<br/>\n&gt; seconds. A Hill giant takes longer than that to kill me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;l stand in front of ANYTHING for 10 seconds. With bind abilities, the<br/>\n&gt; entire group is pretty safe for escaping, you don&#39;t have to go far if you DO<br/>\n&gt; die, which is highly unlikely.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How fast do you think this kind of group is gonna level taking out things<br/>\n&gt; like griffawns, griffons, etc...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Only problem I can see is some things have a big magic resistance. I was<br/>\n&gt; with a 15th barbarian in North Karanas, and we were feeling brawny. He<br/>\n&gt; wailed on a Scythe beetle and brought it back to me and another 13th wizard.<br/>\n&gt; My shock of lightning was only doing 30-35 pts of dmg. The 13th wizard did<br/>\n&gt; 0, nil, zip, zero pts. of dmg.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyone wanna try out my idea, and you&#39;re on Solusek Ro let me know.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Zalbar<br/>\n&gt; 14th Wizard<br/>\n&gt; Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Crowder, David &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DCrowder@...\">DCrowder@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: 19 avril, 1999 13:41<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eq_wizards] Lets solve the root debate<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Crowder, David&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DCrowder@...\">DCrowder@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Here  lets solve the root debate:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Goto the cauldron (a zone off of BB mtns),  and poke an aqua goblin shaman,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;if you are under lvl 13  he will root you and bash you like crazy.  You<br/>\n&gt; WILL<br/>\n&gt; &gt;stay rooted while taking that beating  but you CAN shadow step while rooted<br/>\n&gt; &gt;(I hope they never fix that :-)). Same thing for a ghoul, I learned that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;lesson multiple times in the befallen .<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;PS  Speaking of the befallen (unrest-like dungeon in the west commons)  be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;careful just running through doors on lvl 2, there are pits that drop you<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;lvl 3.  Lvl 3 is A LOT harder than lvl 2 !<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Did you know that ONElist hosts some of the largest lists on the Internet?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Our scaleable system is the most reliable free e-mail service on the<br/>\n&gt; Internet!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking for the perfect gift for a friend?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Tell them about ONElist&#39;s 115,000 free e-mail communities!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
