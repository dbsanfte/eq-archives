GM made a visit to her this past weekend,<br/>\nand promptly told her that it WAS an exploit, and that her account would be<br/>\nterminated if caught near the exploit area again fighting another monster.<br/>\nhe also told her that this warning was not only for that specific exploit,<br/>\nbut if he caught her char doing anything similiar to that in any other zone,<br/>\nthat her account would be terminated (so basically, the warning was not<br/>\nspecific to the exploit, but, rather specific to ANY exploit).  One chance<br/>\nand then ur outa here!  but to each his/her own :)<br/>\n<br/>\njust a heads up that Verant is actively aware of many exploits, and if you<br/>\nget caught, you can be banned.<br/>\n<br/>\nSinlaru Ce`alen<br/>\nRallos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
