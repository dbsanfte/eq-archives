All he can do is +2 rings currently, and Im not sure if its worth the money, or if I should wait, hoarde, and buy something REALLY good, rather than babystep upgrade. Theres a 57plat ring at the mages building in Freeport that Id like, and Im only 5 gold away from buying it, buuut I have to keep in mind buying my level 16 spells too.<br/>\n<br/>\nNormally I dont merchant, I scrounge beetle eyes noone wants and I do things the Do-Unto-Others system, so I do favors and hope others are nice in return. Ive gotten a nearly complete suit of silk, the rings I mentioned, the amulet, and a blackened wand (15 magic resistance)  and given out gifts of pelts and various items I came across. But you dont get a lot of cash this way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWavering on if I should turn into a miser or deal with breaking even. :D Some people charge for Binds, some dont, and I can bind now. :z<br/>\n<br/>\nAt what level do you tend to start going to pick up nice magic user items? Most quests that grant such things seem geared for lvl 30 and up.<br/>\n<br/>\nShannyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marvin@...\">marvin@...</a>&gt; 09/27/99 10:53AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marvin@...\">marvin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 27 Sep 1999, PHAEDRA WHITLOCK wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Human wiz, Int 95.
