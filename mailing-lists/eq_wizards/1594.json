Tox Forest (across bridge) hunting Kobolds and Skellies.  If you find a<br/>\nRanger to help, you can actually level fast, otherwise you&#39;ll be camping at<br/>\nthe Kobold camps and fighting for kills, or wandering and hoping to find<br/>\nsomething.  Unless they changed the spawn rates since I was there several<br/>\nweeks ago, this can be slow compared to other newbie areas.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Kerra Isle.  Level 6 is (IMO) about the time you can start venturing here<br/>\nbut need a good group to do well.  Usually there is a lack of tanks in this<br/>\narea of the world which makes this place more difficult than it should be.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. N. Qeynos then Qeynos Hills  -  I stayed on Odus for a long time before I<br/>\nventured across the ocean to Antonica.  When I finally did, my jaw DROPPED<br/>\nat the site of N. Qeynos newbie area.  There were kills as far as you could<br/>\nsee since it is flat and practically treeless.  I was so amazed at how much<br/>\neasier it would have been to level here never having to &#39;search&#39; for kills<br/>\nlike Tox Forest.  Even with the increased population, the ratio of animals<br/>\nwas still MUCH higher than Tox. <br/>\n<br/>\n4. Erud&#39;s Crossing  -  Once you get over 10, you can start to consider<br/>\nstopping at the Isle in Erud&#39;s Crossing and hunt Wisps and Spiders.  This<br/>\nisland can be a little dangerous but you can make a TON of money here<br/>\ngetting Greater Lightstones.  This place is definitely Wisp Heaven!!  I made<br/>\na ton of money here in my low teens and have been way ahead of the money<br/>\ngame ever since.  I recommend grouping here like most places.  Spiders have<br/>\nnasty poison so beware picking fights.  I can give more strategies on this<br/>\nplace but I&#39;ll shut up now ))<br/>\n<br/>\nDraco - Wizard 20 - Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n -----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: \tBryan Hinkel [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bjhinkel@...\">bjhinkel@...</a>] <br/>\nSubject:\tRe: [eq_wizards] Off Topic!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSerious Question?
