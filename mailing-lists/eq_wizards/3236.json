However,<br/>\nregarding the short holding time, I&#39;ve never timed it but Bonds of Force<br/>\nalways has a very short duration (like 10 seconds).  Enough time for you to<br/>\ncast once, and cast Bonds again safely.  Be very careful with the spell,<br/>\nespecially while (say) hill giant hunting.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Brian</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
