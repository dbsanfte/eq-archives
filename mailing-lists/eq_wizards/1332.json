Are you saying that we should<br/>\n </span></blockquote>be<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; able to take out creatures in one or two shots???  That&#39;s crazy, it would<br/>\n&gt; totally unbalance the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not if the game made us use our mana almost completely in those shots...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;But, as it has been<br/>\n&gt; pointed out, the wizard is constantly on his ass meditating.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Of course he is, that&#39;s part of being a wizard, or any other magic-using<br/>\n&gt; class.   Sitting on your ass meditating is not any different for a mage or<br/>\n&gt; enchanter than it is a wizard, so once again I miss your point here.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I was just pointing out that we do spend inordanate amounts of time meding<br/>\nwhen we are with equal level casters (go play with a level 8 mage when your<br/>\nlevel 8)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;1.

You disproved your own statement within your own<br/>\nstatement.  This would give us the ability to make that call ourselves.<br/>\n(adding more strategy to the game for Wizards)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;2.

So I thought the<br/>\nsuggestion to be timely.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;3.

I was talking a SMALL chance of<br/>\nstun tacked on to our usual damage (like what force stun was suppose to do).<br/>\nI know well about Tishna&#39;s Clash....(for the 2 seconds that it works) btw,<br/>\ndoes it work every time? *thinks he knows this answer*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Once again, you totally lost me on this thread.

None of your replys<br/>\nactually swayed me in my view point and only one had a solution (go find<br/>\nBosuns and Shamans)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Part of the reason is because you are<br/>\n&gt; still pretty low lvl.

I was just pointing out what I thought were critical issues(and still<br/>\nbelieve so)(I shouldn&#39;t have to go find Bosuns and Shamans in part Y of the<br/>\nworld.
