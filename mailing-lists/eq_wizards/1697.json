Well, life is tough like<br/>\n&gt; that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Damn right I am upset.  I play a limited amount of time and I have to compete with everyone else <br/>\nin the game.  At similar levels we should have the same ability to compete.  But with her <br/>\ntwinking I am at the disadvantage.  While she coasts yet another character to the upper levels <br/>\nAT MY EXPENSE!!  Yes I am upset and yes she should be told to play fair like the rest of us are <br/>\nforced too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Well, life is tough like<br/>\n&gt; that. Whether she gets an advantage or not, is none of your business<br/>\n&gt; because it doesn&#39;t really affect you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It does affect me.  It makes that many fewer creatures at my level available for me to kill in <br/>\nan HONORABLE way.  This makes my job (an already difficult one) even more difficult and that is <br/>\nwhy twinking is the WORST POSSIBLE OFFENSE.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And remember, she had to work her<br/>\n&gt; way to level 22 before that as well, so she is only giving her other<br/>\n&gt; Char something she rightfully earned.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And just WHAT is your point?  Because she has one character at a high level and can play in <br/>\nareas that I cannot she has somehow earned the right to retard my low level characters <br/>\ndevelopment (see above) making it even more difficult for me to get to my &quot;rightfully earned&quot; <br/>\n22nd level.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are obviously a fool and most likely a twinker. I can only hope you are not on my server.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; The only bother, is pure green jealousy, isn&#39;t it?
