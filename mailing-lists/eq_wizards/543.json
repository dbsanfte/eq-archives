You can only go as far as you can see in a flat line.  In<br/>\notherwords, if you are in a dungeon, or in a valley, you will no no further<br/>\nthan you can see, or somewhere else in the bottom of the valley.  If you are<br/>\nstanding on a hill peak though, or on a high flat spot in the middle of the<br/>\ndesert where you can see for a long distance, you will go MUCH further.<br/>\nTake this into account when fighting something and you need to make a get<br/>\naway.  The more of an open area you are in, or on higher ground, you will go<br/>\na much further distance, on average.<br/>\nThe problem is S.Step (and Fade for that matter) will not move you through<br/>\nwalls, of even move you to a higher elevation.  When you fade, you will get<br/>\nmoved to another spot of either the same elevation, or lower elevation, but<br/>\nnever higher.  This should help in having better success.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Shadowwalker of Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
