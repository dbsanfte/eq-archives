The key to finding a group is politeness.  I use / 12 or / 13 to see all the players that are leve l12 or 13 in the zone then i send them a /tell  asking if I can group.  The dastes way to be avoided and shunned in this game is to be rude, obnoxious or a pain in the ass.    Shouting all the time or kill stealing will get you no where in the game socially a this is a very social game.  I have accidentlly stolen kills in the past and have always appo;ogized for it and have given any loot to the person that was fighting the monster first.  Now I generally try to stay away from real crowded areas ulesss I want to meditate.   Another thing I like to do is help peole in trouble . If I pop up over a dune and see someone fighting I quicky check their health versus the monsters.  if it looks like they are loosing I will help them as much as I can without doing too much damage to it unlees they ask me to or try to run.  I also try to carry lots of badages o me so I can heal them up a bit.  I find the bind wound skill very handy and it has saved me and others countless times.  It also saves your healers a lot of mana if everyone is at 50% health before the healer finsihes the job.  Well these are my thoughts, i may bot be the most pwerful wizard in Norrath, but I am wel thought of and I can live withthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nDupont Human Wizard of Freeport<br/>\nEspiriit de Corps Order of the Head<br/>\nCazic Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
