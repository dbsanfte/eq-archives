I think its listed as the library of<br/>\nmagencia or something like that.<br/>\nYou get there by entering the city and follow the tunnels to the waterfall.<br/>\nTake a Right.  Walk through more tunnels until you see the main shopping<br/>\ndistrict (4 merchants under tents) follow the righthand wall until it opens up<br/>\ninto a chasm.  Walk through  the chasm.  On the right side of the chasm starts<br/>\na long upward ramp.  WALK up the ramp and on top lies the Library which houses<br/>\nthe wizard, enchanter, necro guilds.  In the center of the library is a common<br/>\narea with two merchants. One sells low level common spells the other sells high<br/>\nlevel common spells. Off the center are three rooms, one for each class.  Two<br/>\nmerchants and a guild master in each room.  Wizard guildmaster is the start of<br/>\nthe telescope lens quest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps<br/>\n<br/>\nMalkin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
