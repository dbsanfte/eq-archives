I<br/>\ndumped as many points as I could into &quot;Specialization:Evocation&quot;, but have<br/>\nabsolutely no clue as to how it&#39;s supposed to work.  What does it do?  Does<br/>\nit improve with use?  What exactly needs to be used to improve it?  etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note, when I got to lvl 16, I dumped a point into Research.  Then<br/>\nat lvl 20 I dumped a bunch more points into research.  I just tried<br/>\nresearching a lvl 16 spell (pillar of fire, I believe) at lvl 20, and failed<br/>\nmiserably.  How exactly do you practice this skill without needing a MASSIVE<br/>\ncollection of Runes?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\nOlatan Ossur  20th Wizard on Solusek Ro<br/>\n++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n+ Olatan Ossur   +<br/>\n+  20th Wizard   +<br/>\n+  Solusek Ro    +<br/>\n++++++++++++++++++</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
