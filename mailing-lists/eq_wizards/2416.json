Anyways, our group was sitting<br/>\n&gt;around and fighting Specters in the Ferrott, then I guess a solo necro was<br/>\n&gt;getting bored or kiting or something and started to spook undead or just<br/>\n&gt;something. But for some reason one specter after another came flowing out<br/>\n </span></blockquote>of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;the cave. At the end of the fight we killed about 5 of them in a row. Was<br/>\n&gt;rather fun.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Another fun fight, is when I was in a tae tower group. We had a zealot,<br/>\n&gt;fanatic, protector and a judicator or something and a few other things. I<br/>\n&gt;went all out on the judi since it can heal the others and it&#39;s self. The<br/>\n&gt;clerics and warriors bashs&#39;s / stuns interupted it perfectly and I nuked<br/>\n </span></blockquote>it,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I sat down and med.

Me and my friends<br/>\n&gt;were exploring the keep of Permafrost, a lvl 50 druid asked us if we had<br/>\n&gt;ever killed the king, it has some good things and we are about the right<br/>\n </span></blockquote>lvl<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;to do it. We say &#39;no, where does he spawn?&#39; and he showed us the room that<br/>\n&gt;the king spawned in. So we got ready and proceded to clear out the room<br/>\n&gt;leading upto the king. This fight went quite well and the wizards were<br/>\n&gt;needed to out damage the healing of the mobs,. So we sat down and rested.<br/>\n&gt;Then for some reason our bard and 1 wizard had to go afk for like 15 or 20<br/>\n&gt;mins. So we sat there, waiting, and waiting, and waiting. It got rather<br/>\n&gt;dull, but then they finnaly came back. Problem tho - the whole area has<br/>\n&gt;respawned. So we carfully plan our next attack. The warrior plunks off an<br/>\n&gt;arrow at a mob standing on a ledge. It runs down and around the back of the<br/>\n&gt;room picking up ALOT of mobs on the way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So we start to fight, it was quite the fight. I was blasting out spells so<br/>\n&gt;was the other wizard, using AE spells, the cleric doing 100% healing on the<br/>\n&gt;tanks, the paladin healing and tanking, had to use LOH one. The bard<br/>\n </span></blockquote>lulling<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and charming as much as he can. We finnaly realize that we are being over<br/>\n&gt;whelemd. We couldnt take out the healing mobs fast enough to keep going. We<br/>\n&gt;had a few dead but low on mana for the others and the tanks were getting<br/>\n&gt;weak. So the tanks yell &quot;evac evac evac&quot;, but ack! both wizards are low on<br/>\n&gt;mana. I tell the other wizard to sit and med, I toss off a few more spells<br/>\n&gt;then start to beat them with my staff. ( these mobs were casting AE wind<br/>\n&gt;spells that shifted us around which added to the confusion). Anyways, the<br/>\n&gt;wizard finnaly has enough mana for evac and she starts to yell &quot;stand<br/>\n </span></blockquote>close&quot;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;over and over. I dart towards her, I enter her gate just seconds before it<br/>\n&gt;kicks in. We all land in north kanara with everyone at about half health<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;saying congrats to everyone. We did not win the fight but it was the most<br/>\n&gt;fun any of us had had in a long time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well thats all I got for for now.
