Normally you can gain<br/>\nweapon skill by simply using a weapon (under certain conditions).  The<br/>\nproper conditions are:<br/>\n1) You are fighting a creature which is &quot;BLUE&quot; or tougher.<br/>\n2) You using a weapon wich is not already maxed in skill.<br/>\n***3) You are fighting a monster that is comparable lvl to your weapon<br/>\nskill.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe throwing skill can be improved by fighting any monster, any lvl no<br/>\nmatter what your lvl diference is.  Basicly it is not concidered a weapon<br/>\nskill.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** THIS IS DEBATEABLE--skills seam to improve much quicker when you work on<br/>\nthem every lvl, but I have had skills improve fighting &quot;GREEN&quot; monsters.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael C.
