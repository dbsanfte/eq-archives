They hit hard and<br/>\nfast and it can be tough to get off a good spell while they are doing this. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are in a group with a cleric(really just you and a cleric would be<br/>\nperfect) have the cleric cast spook the dead on it. When it succeeds the<br/>\ncrow will turn and run and you can blast it to hell.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are looking for solo critters near the Miller farm and the crows seem<br/>\nto be a bit tough then I suggest killing grizzlies. They are easy to solo<br/>\nand are worth decent exp as well they run when low on health which is always<br/>\na bonus when soloing.<br/>\n<br/>\nYours,<br/>\n<br/>\n~Aereuss Ravins of Tarew Marr and one time resident of the Miller farm.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
