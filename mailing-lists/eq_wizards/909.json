I am a high elf wizard who worships Tunare.  The merchant hates <br/>\nme, will not sell to me, but will not attack me either.  This was before I <br/>\nstarted hunting in Steamfont, so my faction was not improved the first time <br/>\nI entered.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is something we are missing in this puzzle.<br/>\n<br/>\nCalyn of Bristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The merchant is a clockwork merchant--it doesn&#39;t have a personal name.  It <br/>\n&gt;stands just inside the zone entrance of Ak&#39;Anon, usually very near, if not <br/>\n&gt;right on top of, a clockwork jeweler.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So, the upshot is, if you chose Tunare as deity, you will be attacked the <br/>\n&gt;instant you enter Ak&#39;Anon.  You can try running away into the city, but I <br/>\n&gt;have never witnessed anyone successful at that.  Also, I have once observed<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;this merchant running into a wall farther into the city, but that was only <br/>\n&gt;one time.  Every other time I have been into Ak&#39;Anon, it has been right <br/>\n&gt;there at the entrance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
