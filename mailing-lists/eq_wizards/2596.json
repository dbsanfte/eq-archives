I try very hard to avoid kill stealing at all costs.  Still, it happens<br/>\nsometimes and people accept my apology for the most part, and I usually give<br/>\nthem a stack of beer and/or homemade food as a token of goodwill.  By sticking<br/>\nto this behavior I not only have no real troubles finding groups anymore, but<br/>\nI&#39;m even getting /tells now to join parties before I have chance to ask.  At<br/>\nfirst I thought it was my superior group tatics, but its probably the beer :).<br/>\nAnyway please don&#39;t stereotype us as a group of killstealers because the<br/>\nmajority of us are not.  Besides, we all know you Druids are nothing but a bunch<br/>\nof powergamers :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nMalkin<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Partymind@...\">Partymind@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Partymind@...\">Partymind@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; well i was playing my druid today, he&#39;s level 11,  and i was fighting a<br/>\n&gt; snake.  out of nowhere a wiz comes along and ks&#39;ed the giant snake.  it<br/>\n&gt; really pissed me off.  his excuse was, i just want exp!!!  i couldn&#39;t believe<br/>\n&gt; it.  now i see why people get so pissed off at us wizards.  i guess i got<br/>\n&gt; satisfaction wathcing him and his partner die.  it was great.  now my druid<br/>\n&gt; has hatred towards wizards and looks down upon them.  i like to roleplay.<br/>\n&gt; now i see why wizards are hated and it&#39;s so hard to find a group.  just<br/>\n&gt; wanted to let you know my experience from the outside.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Parthon lvl 14 wiz<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
