I plan on traveling to<br/>\nEuridan and hanging out with the NPC&#39;s there in the wizards guild.  I plan<br/>\non sitting down next to some of them.  Should this improve my skill?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI noticed I have Elder Elvish as a skill now (maybe because I used to hang<br/>\nout in my hometown of Felwithe allot and just picked it up)  I do not want<br/>\nto spend another training point in Old Euridan or any language for that<br/>\nfact.  I also do not want to have someone SPAM to me anymore unless I pay<br/>\nthem to SPAM me ...and me alone (not fair to others in my group).<br/>\n<br/>\n- Ziffnab of Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n17th Wizard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
