Your stats also are<br/>\nroll played.  I.E. my 15th level Wizzie has 118 Intel and 55 strength..but<br/>\nhas 90 CHARISMA and 90 STAMINA.  His wisdom is now 99 with help of an item.<br/>\nAnyway, point here is that your wiz will be just fine.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMana is to a wizard as Hitpoints are to a fighter class.  Some fighters have<br/>\n500pts at level 17, some get the 500pts at 18.  Doesnt really matter.  You<br/>\nwill enjoy your wizard and learn the positive and negative effects of your<br/>\nchoices.<br/>\n<br/>\nMine is that I have about 480 mana at level 15 but I cannot carry more than<br/>\n55 in loot.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ken Lee [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kenlee@...\">kenlee@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, April 19, 1999 5:15 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Re: Effect of Intelligence<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Ken Lee&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kenlee@...\">kenlee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI only have 100 Int, figured that was enough, but as a human I&#39;ve got some<br/>\nother better stats. I don&#39;t see any REAL detriment till perhaps later on.<br/>\nLater on we&#39;ll have less mana, so perhaps 1 less damage spell goes off. So<br/>\nfar I haven&#39;t really noticed a big deal. However, let me point out that what<br/>\nyou&#39;re doing is playing the numbers. It&#39;s like having a D&D character with<br/>\n18/00 str. Sure, it&#39;s nice, but if we all played them then it&#39;d get stale<br/>\nfast.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s just my opinion, and that&#39;s why I stopped putting points into my int<br/>\nat 100/<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZalbar<br/>\n14th Wizard<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShare the wealth!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\nTell a friend about ONElist&#39;s 115,000 free e-mail communities!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
