What do other spell<br/>\ncasting classes have that we lack?  Pets of course.  The steel skin, leather<br/>\nskin line of spells should be altered in such a way that wizards from low<br/>\nlvl&#39;s (perhaps 8) can summon a sort of wall.  This wall would be sort of<br/>\nlike a pet (graphically how it would show does&#39;nt concern me) but without<br/>\noffensive capabilities, it would simply soak damage and allow a wizard to<br/>\nnot be interrupted.  For example, wizard A wants to solo an even fight orc,<br/>\nso he summons his wall of whatever, that soaks 50 damage without the wizard<br/>\nactually being hit, the wizard can skip the risky root opening shot and get<br/>\nright to damage.  This would put wizards on an even playing field with other<br/>\nmagic classes, they NEVER root for their opening shot, that&#39;s what their<br/>\npets are for, we should&#39;nt have to rely on root either, we need something<br/>\nmore definite like this wall idea.  It&#39;s the only thing that would get me to<br/>\nplay the wizard class again.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
