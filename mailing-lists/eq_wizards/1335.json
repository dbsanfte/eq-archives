Since the<br/>\nmajority of Verant designers are old-time MUD / D&D players, my guess would be<br/>\nthat when you cast root the creature gets a savings throw.  If the mob makes<br/>\nthe throw the spell is resisted and if not he&#39;s rooted.  Every round after<br/>\nthat, the creature gets another throw until he&#39;s dead or free to move.  My<br/>\nguess is that Enstill just has a higher savings throw than root.  My only proof<br/>\nof the &quot;savings throw&quot; idea is that I&#39;ve had root resisted by /con greens, I&#39;ve<br/>\nsuccessfully rooted reds, and one time I managed to root a yellow long enough<br/>\nto unload my mana on him, run to the guard,  and meditate for one or two<br/>\nbubbles before the guard killed him.  That root lasted a good minute or two.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil Lambert wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Neil Lambert&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smartass@...\">smartass@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; enstill just last longer than root<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Simon Hinshelwood &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:iktome@...\">iktome@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Thursday, May 13, 1999 4:46 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eq_wizards] Root vs Enstill<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Simon Hinshelwood &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:iktome@...\">iktome@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Dear Cristie<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Therefore Root and Enstill are the same spell?

You get this at level 4.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Enstill means a stronger version of Root, it looks like.  Same<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; definition.  You get this one at level 20.  I would venture to guess the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; NPC&#39;s can still resist it if they are able to.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; You can always try to cast when you are getting bashed...sometimes you<br/>\n&gt; can<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; pop your spells off and other times you are interrupted and lose<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; concentration and sometimes you get bashed and regain concentration and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; continue casting.  Try to shoot your spells off while the NPC isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; smacking you.. a lot of it is in your timing, unless you have a bunch of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; monsters on you.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
