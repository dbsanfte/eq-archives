I have subscribed to this list for about 2 months now... and I think it&#39;s about time someone said something.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am tired of wizards using this list for griping about class problems. I know that it is not uncommon. The eq_bards list does it as well... But isn&#39;t it time that we said... ok enough... I&#39;m tired of emails that just flame verant. It&#39;s getting to the point where even the emails that try to be constructive still irritate me... <br/>\nThis list should be used for constructive purposes... such as helping newbies... verification of quests... or maybe even for grouping together to play online.. or for online roleplaying events... This was not meant as a &quot;lets flame verant&quot; forum. Once this may have been appropriate to talk about here... but it is becoming a constant bother to those who subscribed to this list for game information.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it comes down to it ... I think it would be apropriate to start a new onelist. Maybe you could call it EQ_petitions but this list is getting to bogged down.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to reply and voice your opinion.... extra points for agreeing with me.... =)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGeorge Holt<br/>\nA Wizard of Tal`Kor<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
