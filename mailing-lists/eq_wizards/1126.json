First i am a fan of quest :). But in freeport, the arcan scientist don t<br/>\n&gt;want to give me any quest :(. I know that i must raise my faction if i want<br/>\n&gt;to make quests for them but how ???? Killing deathfist centurion and so<br/>\n&gt;raise faction with commond resident. Are the scientist residents ? If i can<br/>\n&gt;not do any quest for them then how to raise my faction with them ? What the<br/>\n&gt;monsters who raise faction with scientist ? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
