Remember, not all people have been on this<br/>\nlist since day 1.  Even those who have, however, do not always follow every<br/>\nthread from the beginning.  It&#39;s a real help to have *at least* the previous<br/>\nmessage quoted (or at least those parts to which the writer is responding<br/>\nto).<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with trimming them, however.  It&#39;s pretty pointless when a person&#39;s<br/>\nresponse is only a 1-liner, and they insist on quoting the ENTIRE message...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy vote, however, is to keep the one-liners coming.  Sometimes there is some<br/>\nuseful information in them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t even begun playing the game yet (don&#39;t have a decent enough system<br/>\nto install it on).  However, if it wasn&#39;t for all of the messages on this<br/>\nlist, I probably would have decided against playing a wizard.  Now, I can<br/>\ntell you exactly what race/class combo I&#39;m going to play when I get my new<br/>\nsystem :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll you have to do, folks, is filter your e-mail.  Of course your going to<br/>\nget pi$$ed if your inbox keeps filling up.  Solution:  Don&#39;t let your inbox<br/>\nfill up!  Have your client filter the message to a new folder (real mystery,<br/>\nI know).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Iggie/Alyssandra/Jane Pierson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ldyiggie@...\">ldyiggie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I, too, like reading the responses.  What would help tho is if<br/>\n&gt; those who reply<br/>\n&gt; would (as I have done here) retitle the subject line to reflect<br/>\n&gt; what you&#39;re talking<br/>\n&gt; about AND delete everything but your reply... in other words DO<br/>\n&gt; NOT include<br/>\n&gt; original text in the reply.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Iggie<br/>\n&gt; Level 8 wizard, Cazic-Thule </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
