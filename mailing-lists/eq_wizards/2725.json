I&#39;ve been playing both a Shaman & Druid to <br/>\nget a feel for it, but nothing compares to a Wizard.  I&#39;m thinking of <br/>\ndropping my Druid character because she just plain sucks. Druids are good <br/>\nsolo and group characters up to about 20level, then that&#39;s it.  All my high <br/>\n45+ level friends tell me they never invite Druids in their parties <br/>\nanymore...but Wizards are ALWAYS welcome.<br/>\nAt high levels, a Druid will not have good enough armor to tank...so they <br/>\nessentially become weak Wizards.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy that time, a Wizard of equal level will have strong shields and DD <br/>\nspells, AND all the teleport spells of a Druid.  So what about a Druid&#39;s DOT <br/>\nspells, you can&#39;t kite Lady Voxx.  :)  (or can you? hehe)<br/>\nNor will a Druid&#39;s heal spells be worthy of a Cleric.  So why have them?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe grass always looks greener somewhere else, but trust me....other <br/>\ncharacters are envious of a Wizard&#39;s spells as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe *maybe* need to be tweaked here and there...but stop comparing us to <br/>\nother characters.  It will get us nowhere.  We have a few 50Level Wizards on <br/>\nour server that have demonstrated the effectiveness of our spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO,<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
