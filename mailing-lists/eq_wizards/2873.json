Befallen,<br/>\nwhere you can get some nice items (including, if I remember right, the<br/>\ndamask robe), is hotly contested between the dark elves and the halfling<br/>\ndruids, but the Dark rule the Commonlands, Ro, cutting off Freeport from<br/>\nany possibility of levelling (there are always a dozen or more DE or<br/>\ntrolls on &quot;frontier duty&quot;). But Dark Elfs more consistently CONTROL the<br/>\narea with Najena (hey, who&#39;s gonna have the boots?) and its gossimer,<br/>\nLavastorm (good area), and Solusek (where you can level up to 50).<br/>\n<br/>\nWizards are very appreciated in race wars as they can root. Unlike mobs,<br/>\nan opponent will size forces very quickly, and can run to the zone if<br/>\noutmatched.
