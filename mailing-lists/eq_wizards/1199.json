I can&#39;t imagine very many reasons why a sane human (or <br/>\ndemi-human) would spend years developing a skill and then give it away for <br/>\nfree.  Outside of a valid roleplaying reason I would find that poor gaming.<br/>\n<br/>\nCalyn was raised to be heavy artillery in the orc wars.  He really dislikes <br/>\nthe merchant life and so does not set prices.  He accepts what others gives <br/>\nhim, but he would be insulted if he was given nothing.  He would take that <br/>\nas meaning his value is nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only time he bound someone for nothing was when the character was on his <br/>\nway back from a sea voyage to get his corpse.  The poor fellow had nothing, <br/>\nso he was bound for free.  The character did actually come back and pay him <br/>\na few gold, though.  Kind of restores my faith in people when things like <br/>\nthat happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCalyn of Bristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I don&#39;t know why but it has never made sense to me to charge for services<br/>\n&gt;such as binding, invis, and language training.  Perhaps it is just the<br/>\n&gt;personality of my character that he enjoys helping others and gets full<br/>\n&gt;satisfaction out of the good deed itself, not needing any sort of physical<br/>\n&gt;compensation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
