Erud&#39;s Crossing  -  Once you get over 10, you can start to consider<br/>\n&gt; stopping at the Isle in Erud&#39;s Crossing and hunt Wisps and Spiders.  This<br/>\n&gt; island can be a little dangerous but you can make a TON of money here<br/>\n&gt; getting Greater Lightstones.  This place is definitely Wisp Heaven!!
