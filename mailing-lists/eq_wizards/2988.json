Of course but overall your armor and items will determine <br/>\nif u stay alive in a fight as it affects your stats much more than EQ&#39;s stat <br/>\nmodifying equipment a +3 to 90 isnt a big dip compared to a +3 to stats that <br/>\nnormally get maxed at 25 and start at 14.  but in a mud there is also the <br/>\never popular donation pit were anyone in the game can chose to just type &quot; <br/>\ndonate (name of item)&quot; and then it sits in a pile were anyone can take it. <br/>\nthis would be almosst imposible for verant to think about implementing due to <br/>\nthe fact that it goes against the boreing camping sessions.  personally the <br/>\nitems should be always spawned on npcs  not for the reason that i want items <br/>\nbut for the fact that it would stop some abuse of zone camping items, allow <br/>\nalot of players to get item and enjoy the game more with out sitting ina room <br/>\nstairng at a wall.<br/>\n<br/>\nPentar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
