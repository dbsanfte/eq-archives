It&#39;s precisely our <br/>\nability at quick mass-damage that has made me attractive to groups  wishing <br/>\nto *keep* our kills away from scavenger kill stealers.<br/>\nSave your mana, use it wisely to aid your group by softening kills or my <br/>\nfinishing a running creature...and when somebody is stealing the kill....zap <br/>\nzap zap = your xp.  It&#39;s just a different playing style.  Probably not for <br/>\neverybody.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a few 20+/30+ lvl tanks who tell me Wizards are always more then <br/>\nwelcome in their groups later in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n15lvl Wiz Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 25<br/>\n   Date: Thu, 13 May 1999 17:22:14 -0500<br/>\n   From: &quot;Marziani, Michael D.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Marziani@...\">Michael.Marziani@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Ice Comet<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, I was not advocating kill stealing, I was just stating the facts.<br/>\nAnd the fact (that I have always hated) is that many wizards start serious<br/>\npower tripping at level 12 when they get that lightning spell.  These<br/>\nwizards do give us a very bad name.  I would really like to see some more<br/>\nutility spells for wizards, a more extensive line of magical force stunning<br/>\nspells would be in line with the wizard theme and would make us more useful<br/>\nto groups.  Perhaps we could bestow magic resistance on other classes?  Or<br/>\ngive us more utilities for interrupting other magic using classes to make<br/>\nwizards more effective against npc mage types.  All these things would<br/>\nincrease our usefulness to a group.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Solric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
