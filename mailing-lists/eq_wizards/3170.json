I was with a<br/>\n&gt; level 29 cleric recently, and he has a spell (wrath) which was doing 198<br/>\n&gt; damage to my 178. Granted, I am level 27, but was still kind of shocked.<br/>\nIt<br/>\n&gt; was only a two level difference, and he had a better DD spell, and could<br/>\n&gt; melee too. And buff. And heal. I know at 29 I will get Inferno Shock, but<br/>\n&gt; this just makes my think that we should be doing more damage, or have<br/>\nfaster<br/>\n&gt; mana regen, or SOMETHING. Just another example of how Verant has made the<br/>\n&gt; wizard class suck.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Greg (Kronan on Innoruuk)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
