I<br/>\nwill accept donations if they wish to give them, but I never require a<br/>\npayment.  However, languages are a whole new ballgame.  It takes a lot of<br/>\ntime and effort to learn these languages, especially Dragon and Combine.  I<br/>\nsee nothing wrong with expecting some compensation for your time and effort<br/>\nin teaching someone a language.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that not eveyone feels the same way I do.  I have no problem<br/>\nwith that and I wish them well.  But to me, it makes no sense NOT to charge<br/>\nsomeone for something that has taken a lot of time and effort to achieve.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalarin Kal&#39;Amon, High Elven Wizard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
