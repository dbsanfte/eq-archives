As a wizard, mana management is the<br/>\nmost important skill you&#39;ll ever learn.  Its the kind of thing that<br/>\ncan&#39;t be quantified by stats or skill levels.  The added advantage of<br/>\nusing Mana wisely, is that when your party really needs the help(like<br/>\nsay a creature attacks the party while they rest), you&#39;ll be there to<br/>\npull their fat out of the fryer.  Trust me, if you learn this skill,<br/>\npeople will remember and they will be clamoring to get you into their<br/>\nparty.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nGennin, E&#39;ci server<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;McCartney, Michael R&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;McCartney, Michael R&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.McCartney2@...\">Michael.McCartney2@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hang back, watch everyones health.  Once the enemy has some noticeable damage..  I hit him once twice with shock.  Then hang back again.  If I&#39;m FM I hit him twice with shock again.  If we&#39;re in a relatively safe place, I&#39;ll actually sit and start medding.  I try not to let my mana go below 60%.  So I never burn on a creature that we&#39;re obviously going to kill anyway.  Unless:  Someone is about to die, the creature can only be hit by magical weapons or spells, or the creature resists my root spell and is running away.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hope that helps.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Drev<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From:         Paul McClung[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:p.e.mcclung@...\">p.e.mcclung@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Reply To:     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent:         Tuesday, April 20, 1999 11:54 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject:      [eq_wizards] Mana management?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Paul McClung &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:p.e.mcclung@...\">p.e.mcclung@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In groups, whats a typical strategy for managing mana?  At 12th level, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guesstimate I have about 360-370 mana, almost enough for 6 lightning shock<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spells, but I don&#39;t want to waste it all on just one kill, and yet I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; feel very comforatable sitting around doing nothing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - Flik<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Looking for a new hobby?
