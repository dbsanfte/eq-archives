Najela or something of that nature.<br/>\n&gt;But alas all my journeys has turned up is one damask wristband which i<br/>\n&gt;found to be very familair to that of Legionarrie bracers. AC 3 in all.<br/>\n&gt;but no magical prorties this only leads me to belive that armro for a<br/>\n&gt;wizard does not get strong enough entill a Enchanter helps out a little<br/>\n&gt;i guess.. Which also makes him a excellent person two pair with a<br/>\n&gt;wizard.. but Hope this helps at the least most somewhat useful to ya..<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ll try to add more later.<br/>\n&gt;Elmara- povar<br/>\n&gt;--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jrc76@...\">jrc76@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jrc76@...\">jrc76@...</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I am currently a level 10 High Elf Wizard, and I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; have a Sr. Apprentice robe along with a full set of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; cloth armor.
