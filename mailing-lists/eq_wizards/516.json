Most UO PKers didn&#39;t even kill you in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;character, it was like<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;HE<br/>\n&gt; &gt;*&*$^&$  YOU ARE DEAD F*&%ER YOU SUCK blah blah blah&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I agree with you like the other guy said there may be<br/>\n&gt; a large portion who are good but I can see all kinds<br/>\n&gt; of problems if +PVP spells can effect -PVP. As far as<br/>\n&gt; the bind goes you have to be in the Binders party to<br/>\n&gt; be bound to that city so we have that in our favor.<br/>\n&gt; Maybe they could implement something to where +PVP<br/>\n&gt; spells can effect -PVP if they are in the same party?<br/>\n&gt; But random casting I think is a bad idea. I quit UO<br/>\n&gt; because of the Pkers I don&#39;t want the same thing to<br/>\n&gt; happen to EQ. EQ is not Quake if you want random<br/>\n&gt; killing for no other reason than to rack up a body<br/>\n&gt; count and to talk trash while you do it get out of EQ.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Azzameen High Elf Wizard<br/>\n&gt; Lost Order of Akalabeth<br/>\n&gt; Veeshan Server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ===<br/>\n&gt; +-----------------------------------+<br/>\n&gt; | Shane Bennett                     |<br/>\n&gt; | Consultant - Microsoft Team       |<br/>\n&gt; | Global Professional Services      |<br/>\n&gt; | Computer Associates International |<br/>\n&gt; | <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cai.com\">http://www.cai.com</a>                |<br/>\n&gt; +-----------------------------------+<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Start a new hobby.
