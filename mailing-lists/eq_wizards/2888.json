Basically the non cracked version of what you<br/>\nalready have.  I don&#39;t recall ever getting one in the form of loot from a<br/>\nmob, so you may have to buy one if you want this.<br/>\nOnce you get into the upper 20s you can get some of the Magical staves.<br/>\nUnless you can afford to buy them off others.<br/>\n<br/>\nS<br/>\nP<br/>\nO<br/>\nI<br/>\nL<br/>\nE<br/>\nR<br/>\n<br/>\nI<br/>\nN<br/>\nF<br/>\nO<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Beholder, aka gorge of king xorbb.  There is an evil eye that spawns<br/>\nvery rarely.  His name is .....  King Xorbb.  He almost alway has the Slime<br/>\nCrystal Staff on him.  He was blue to me at 26th  I resisted all of his<br/>\ncharms  and 2 of his 3 force shocks but between the pet and the chasm mino<br/>\nthat he appeared to call over, I had to zone with him at 1/3 health<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Lake of Rathe there is a froglok named Webclaw, if you camp at the base<br/>\nof the flame he walks by there as he makes his rounds of the zone.  He<br/>\ncarries the water crystal staff.  He was red to me at level 26 but I<br/>\nbelieve he was blue to the level 36 warrior that helped me get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is one other staff the Fire Crystal Staff, but I can&#39;t remember off<br/>\nthe top of my head who has it and where.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll three staves are Magic Lore items, with damage ratios of 5 damage 28<br/>\ndelay.  This is the same ratio as a non-magic, non-cracked staff.  Their<br/>\nonly bonus is that they have a first level spell effect.<br/>\nSlime Crystal Staff casts Sickening<br/>\nWater Crystal Staff casts Shalow Breath<br/>\nFire Crystal Staff casts Shock of Fire.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom 1st hand experience the Shallow Breath does a max of 5 damage non<br/>\nmelee.  It goes off about 0-3 times in a fight, depending on how much melee<br/>\nI actually do.  However my 99 dex may help it work more often.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk well there are alot of other magical staves, but basically what I was<br/>\nsaying is that unless you can get an Orb of Tishan or a Staff of Writhing.<br/>\nMost aren&#39;t any better than the non-cracked staff as far as damage goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack, Knight Defender of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
