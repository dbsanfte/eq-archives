That message happened everyday.  :P  Nothing to do but <br/>\nwait it out...either the EQ log-in server is down or some node along the way <br/>\nis holding you up.  As much as I&#39;d like to bitch about it when it <br/>\nhappens...equipment fails so... *shrug*  Time to finally go to the restroom <br/>\nthen heh<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also get that EverMon thingie that will ping the EQ servers and tell <br/>\nyou when it&#39;s up.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
