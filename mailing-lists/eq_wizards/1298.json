Being a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2039729790\">Just another slant on Wizards and there effectiveness in a party.  In<br/>\naddition to my wizard I also I have a 19 level troll warrior that I play a<br/>\nlot.  Being a troll I tend to hang out quite a bit at Guk.  Of all of the<br/>\nmage types I prefer to group with wizards while in guk for two reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t1 - The Frogloks in Guk tend to be pretty fast runners sometimes I even<br/>\nencounter ones that have SOW cast on them.  Whenever the frogloks start to<br/>\nrun you have to either get it rooted, kill it, or be prepared for a possible<br/>\ntrain.  I have found that wizards are the most effective at stopping the<br/>\nfrogs in their tracks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t2 - Having a pet while in Guk can be very dangerous.  I have seen numerous<br/>\nNecromancers bit the bullet because somehow (Lag, Not paying attention,<br/>\n.etc) their pet took off after a Froglok running into the depths of Guk<br/>\nthereby causing a train.  Wizards don&#39;t really have this problem since they<br/>\ncan&#39;t have pets :).  Of course the other mage types can just not use pets<br/>\nwhile in Guk ,but they tend to not be as effective when they don&#39;t have<br/>\ntheir pets.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe above reasons might not hold for other dungeons ,but in Guk I much<br/>\nprefer to group with Wizards over all other mage types.<br/>\n<br/>\nGene<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW most of the mage types that I have grouped with have been in the 17 - 22<br/>\nlevel mosly Necromancers and  Wizards.  Just a few Enchanters and Magicians.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Marziani, Michael D.

I do know that we will be highly useful to a group once we get our<br/>\n&gt; escape and portal spells.  I am pretty sure that any high level group will<br/>\n&gt; have a cleric (to cast group divine aura) along with a wizard (to<br/>\n&gt; cast group<br/>\n&gt; teleport) in sticky situations.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>...</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
