I didn&#39;t really want to go and spend all the money<br/>\non the spells again. So, after I was &#39;returning to home point&#39; I immediately<br/>\nsat down and started memorizing. Good thing is, your spells are still<br/>\nscribed in your spell book. However, the game tells you that &#39;you&#39;re not<br/>\nhigh enough level to memorize that spell&#39;....<br/>\n<br/>\nConclusion: Die all your want !!<br/>\n<br/>\nZalbar<br/>\n14th Wizard<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: McCartney, Michael R &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.McCartney2@...\">Michael.McCartney2@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: 20 avril, 1999 16:26<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Can you cast spells above your level?
