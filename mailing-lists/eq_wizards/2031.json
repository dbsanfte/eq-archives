Why should it end there? Cold and Magic based buff / damage<br/>\nshields would be a very welcome addition.<br/>\n<br/>\nDruids are kings of damage shields, and enchanters are the king of buffs.<br/>\nWe get both, although weaker, in one spell<br/>\n<br/>\nand #5 to this<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Wizards seem to be very neglected when it comes to carrying or wearing<br/>\nitems that enhance our appearance. In addition, many completely different<br/>\nspells have the same visual effects.<br/>\n<br/>\n(In addition sounds better than &quot;also&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy feeling is that we should all sign one petition.
