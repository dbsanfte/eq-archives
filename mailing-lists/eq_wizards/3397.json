I have seen pairs of 23s pulling, but<br/>\nI only succeeded in making trains when I tried that.<br/>\n<br/>\nCamp in the lake area on the hill or in the alcove on the other side of the<br/>\ntower from the Lesser Faydark zone.  Then have someone pull from the<br/>\ncoutyard and lake or from the canyon leading to the graveyard.  If you are<br/>\nin a balanced group try pulling some stuff from the graveyard.<br/>\n<br/>\nWatch out for the Ssynthi (floating NPC book behind the morgue in the GY) ,<br/>\nit drops the robe of the keeper, but it also is a nasty faction hit against<br/>\nthe temple of Sulusek Ro to kill it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, avoid standing right next to the tower.  I have been told that is<br/>\nwhere Mayong Mistmoore himself spawns, and the tower can be pulled<br/>\naccidently if you are careless.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpell wise I use Tishan&#39;s Clash to stun runners (almost all familiars run<br/>\nwhen hurt) and casters.  I help out the melee guys with a shock of flame or<br/>\nforce shock here and there.  Be sure to nuke gargoyles hard, they seem to<br/>\nhave a high AC which makes all melee fights long.  If you can group with an<br/>\nenchanter make sure they use tashani and mes frequently as it is easy to get<br/>\nswarmed and magic resistance seems high on some of the spawns.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat exp, 1-2pp per kill at times, fast spawns, but VERY dangerous.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: PHAEDRA WHITLOCK &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PWHITLOCK@...\">PWHITLOCK@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, December 01, 1999 9:10 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_wizards] Low 20s Blues Was: staff of observers<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;PHAEDRA WHITLOCK&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PWHITLOCK@...\">PWHITLOCK@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ill give it a try... what tactics can you suggest there for spells and<br/>\njust &#39;dont do this&#39;?
