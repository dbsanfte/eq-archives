I was in unrest trying to retrieve my corpse.  Well I<br/>\nran in a barbed bone (probably the one that killed me originally, heh) along<br/>\nwith his pal a ghoul.  I couldnt see the way out because I had no light<br/>\nsource and was stunned and spun around.  I had no hope of running so I just<br/>\nhit gate and prayed (not much chance of gating out while being hit on due to<br/>\nthe long casting time).  The first time it was interrupted but the second<br/>\ntime I continued casting after being hit twice or three times for a total of<br/>\nover 50 damage by the skeleton and ghoul.  To my level 20 character the<br/>\nskeleton conned red (around level 25).  This is the most extreme and lucky<br/>\nexample I have seen of continuing casting, and my dexterity is only 74.  My<br/>\nwisdom is 93, so I would tend to think that wisdom has more of a bearing<br/>\nthat dexterity, although I have seen more people attribute continuing to<br/>\ndex, so I am not sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing is for sure, I didnt continue much against ANYTING including blues<br/>\nuntil about level 12 or 15.  This makes me thing that your channeling skill<br/>\nhas some bearing on this as well.  At level 21 now I do get interrupted<br/>\nquite a lot, but I also continue a lot.  If this trend continues, I figure<br/>\nat higher levels you will continue more often than you get interrupted.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny wizards out there with high dex (gnomes start with 85 dex I believe)<br/>\ncare to comment on this?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Solric of the 6th circle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Neil Lambert [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smartass@...\">smartass@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 01, 1999 9:36 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_wizards] Two ideas for wizards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Neil Lambert&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smartass@...\">smartass@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\napparently i have found that i&#39;ve only regained concentration on bluees but<br/>\nit&#39;s happened many times<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Dan Alexander &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dalex@...\">dalex@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, June 01, 1999 7:02 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_wizards] Two ideas for wizards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Dan Alexander &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dalex@...\">dalex@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At 04:00 PM 05/31/1999 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;if you wanted to keep it balanced you wouldn&#39;t be allowed to use it every<br/>\n&gt;couple of seconds!!! maybe every six minutes like mend. i think a better<br/>\n&gt;idea would be the it would do more damage and that spell when using<br/>\n&gt;concentrate would not be able to be interrupted (ever heard &quot;soandso<br/>\n&gt;regains concentration and continues casting&quot;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Never in my life  =).
