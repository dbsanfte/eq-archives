You need to have a clear path to your target and when the<br/>\nspell is fired off it takes off and chases your target down. As a comparison<br/>\nsomeone said in a mail the other day that he fights only blues and root is<br/>\nalways used, if he can get 2 spells off he knew he would win the fight, if<br/>\nnot he SS and gated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI solo blues, whites(black), and even yellows, am currently level 11 and<br/>\nhave been doing this since level 8. Bolt is a good lead off spell since it<br/>\nchases. While bolt is tracking down your victim from behind you are<br/>\ngauranteed getting off 1 more spell(shock) and sometimes 2. Best case<br/>\nscenario you have just got 3 spells to hit the crit and didn&#39;t have to use<br/>\nthe mana for the root. I do not suggest doing this on every opponent you<br/>\nface since some are faster than others(I have learned a few of them the hard<br/>\nway). Also this is more of an outdoor strategy.....young Wizards should stay<br/>\naway from dungeons and the horrors called trains!!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re a powerhouse! Don&#39;t let fear be your guide.<br/>\n<br/>\nCinius(Mith Marr) madman extraordinare<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Die! It&#39;s good for you! But only if you learn something.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your free, private email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.excite.com/\">http://mail.excite.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
