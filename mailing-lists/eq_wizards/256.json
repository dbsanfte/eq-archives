However, I read many<br/>\nreports from beta testers, guides and other people before setting out<br/>\non the path of the wizard and have a question relating to that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat confuses me, now after playing the game myself, are all the tips<br/>\nin various &quot;wizard guides&quot; about the importance of avoiding hits as a<br/>\nwizard. That it is important is obvious, but how should one manage<br/>\nit?<br/>\n<br/>\nI decided to &quot;solo&quot; the first five levels in order to learn the game.<br/>\nMy experience from that time is that it is almost impossible to avoid<br/>\nbeing hit during combat. Now at level seven I mostly team up with a<br/>\nnecromancer friend of mine and it is much easier avoiding getting<br/>\nhit.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do the guides mean? Are the advice for higher levels where one<br/>\nhave access to &quot;killed on impact&quot; spells or am I missing something<br/>\nobvious? What can one do except running away when trying to avoid<br/>\nhits? Is it the &quot;mini teleportation spells&quot; that are referred to or<br/>\nwhat? Please enlighten me so that I can continue my hitherto very<br/>\nrewarding and highly enjoying career as a wizard!<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nZachris, dark elf wizard of Bertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nHenrik Bergstr�m<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:henrik@...\">henrik@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nHave you visited the new ONElist home page lately?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\nONElist: The Leading e-mail list and community service on the Internet!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
