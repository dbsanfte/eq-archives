I thought<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Wow! Cool I&#39;ll be able to find new spells&quot;. But low and behold what a<br/>\n&gt;dismal dissapointment this skill is. It is a skill that you NEED to be of<br/>\n&gt;any use at high lvls. More and more of your &quot;Main Spells&quot; become research<br/>\n&gt;only, the skill is TEDIOUS AS HELL to raise, finding runes can be hard.<br/>\n&gt;Finding the ones you need is the worst and finding enough of the ones you<br/>\n&gt;need to get to a descent skill level is HELL.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So what do I suggest for this skill? A few things<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(A) Have 2 spell components per rank buyable at guilds. So you can buy the<br/>\n&gt;runes/components you need at that lvl to get to a descent skill to make<br/>\n </span></blockquote>your<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;other spells.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(B) Make all of the &quot;Main Spells&quot; buyable. So for<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Wizards : Direct damage, Gates<br/>\n&gt;- Magi : Direct damage, pets<br/>\n&gt;- Encs : ???? Buffs and Debuffs ???<br/>\n&gt;- Necros : Pets and DoTs<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;These would be the &quot;basic spells&quot; for those ranks. Things like area effect,<br/>\n&gt;buffs/debuffs for some class&#39;s. Root, util spells, etc would be research<br/>\n&gt;only. Then, have some nice &quot;upgraded&quot; DDs, DOTs, Buffs, etc that are rare<br/>\n&gt;research runes. And verant could constatnly be adding new combos, etc. ie)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;lvl 29 wiz spell does 240 dmg. Make it buyable (which it is), Have another<br/>\n&gt;lvl 29 wiz spell that is harder to get, research only, etc, but have it do<br/>\n&gt;like.. 270 dmg for only a few more mana.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If verant was to be constantly adding componet combos/etc to the game it<br/>\n&gt;would add alot to it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So for example, a wizard would get every DD and every teleport buyable. But<br/>\n&gt;any of his other spells would need to be researched, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Or a magi could buy every &quot;basic pets&quot; he would need. But he could be lucky<br/>\n&gt;and manage to research a pet at the same lvl that has more hp and hits for<br/>\n&gt;more damage then his standard one would.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(C) In certian areas in the game, you should be able to invoke the research<br/>\n&gt;skill to digup components. Much like the forage skill. ie) Wizard is<br/>\n </span></blockquote>putsing<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;about in Befallen, in the library he uses his research skill, he may dig up<br/>\n&gt;a rune from the shelf that could be used for a spellt aht he needs. This<br/>\n&gt;would also provide an alternative way to raise your skill.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(D) Have various components that change the effect of your spells. And the<br/>\n&gt;mana/dmg/cast time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(btw: I play a wizard so all my examples will use wizards, this does not<br/>\n&gt;mean I want to &quot;buff up the class&quot; since this would effect all the other<br/>\n&gt;casters in this game aswell)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So, lets say I find rune Hot and rune Bolt, which would make the Inferno<br/>\n&gt;Shock spell. I dont want to have the &quot;standard&quot; look of the inferno shock<br/>\n&gt;spell. I&#39;d like it to look like a healing spell but just do a pallet swap<br/>\n </span></blockquote>so<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;it looks like fire not the cool-healing blue it is. I&#39;d also like to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>incrase<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;its mana efficeny by sacraficing it&#39;s casting time ( so it takes longer to<br/>\n&gt;cast ). So while researching the spell, I toss in the componets and pop out<br/>\n&gt;the inferno shock spell. Then, I put the scrool back into the wizards<br/>\n&gt;lexcion, then mix/match combos etc untill I get the new desired effect that<br/>\n&gt;I want.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think this would add ALOT of diversity to all of the magic casters. Every<br/>\n&gt;other magi looks like the next, every wizard looks like the next when<br/>\n&gt;casting. Not a whole lot sets them apart.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Wizard (A) May have a fast casting inferno shock that is less manna<br/>\n&gt;efficent, but he can pop them off faster then wizard (B), whos inferno<br/>\n </span></blockquote>shock<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;does more damage but takes alot longer to cast.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Comments ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
