I used to Eye to check out the mines to see if they were safe and<br/>\nthe same thing happened.  2 seconds after they spotted the eye they came<br/>\nright after me.  Now I can justify this with &quot;the eye alerted them to<br/>\nintruders so they started patrolling&quot;  but they ran right by 3 or 4 other<br/>\npeople who were in the mines to get at me so this was no ordinary patrol<br/>\npattern.  Seems fishy to me.  Same type of thing has been happening with<br/>\ninvisibility, as long as I&#39;m invisible *before* the fight starts I&#39;m Ok, but<br/>\nif the fight starts and I run away to a safe spot, go invisible, then go<br/>\nback to check on the battle they zero in on me as if I was standing there in<br/>\nplain sight.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Joseph Brooks [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Joseph.Brooks@...\">Joseph.Brooks@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, April 16, 1999 4:30 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eq_wizards] Re: Hail fellow Norrathians<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Joseph Brooks &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Joseph.Brooks@...\">Joseph.Brooks@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know that using Eye of Zomm to spy on ghouls in W.
