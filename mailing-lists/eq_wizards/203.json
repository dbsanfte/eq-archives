I recently had lots of fun exploring befallen with my eye of zomm, whenever I reached one of the doors I just moved my eye up to it and it automatically opened.  The spell isn&#39;t one of the greatest for usefullness but it can be a lot of fun.

It&#39;s worth it though, because of the reaction people have seing this veincovered eyeball floating around. One guy ran screaming from it, saying that there were floating eyes (a known high lvl monster) in Black Burrow. Killed myself laughing. <br/>\n     <br/>\n    The spell doesn&#39;t last long enough to be useful, can&#39;t go through doors, and can&#39;t see in the dark. i.e. useless.
