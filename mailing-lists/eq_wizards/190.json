I am a level 17 Wizard on Fennin Ro.  I find that the<br/>\nonly way I can nuke an opponent is to Root him first because it is utterly<br/>\nimpossible to Nuke, say, Ambassador DVinn while he&#39;s piercing you.  I am<br/>\nexcellent at timing casts, and they just attack to fast for us to get the<br/>\ncast before their next hit, and most likely, they will.  I don&#39;t see at all<br/>\nhow Wizards cast fast, that&#39;s one of our fallbacks, the other is the long<br/>\nwaiting times for mana regeneration.  But no worries.  There are things you<br/>\nmay get that help restoration of mana.  Back to casting... It&#39;s terribly<br/>\nslow, Flame Shock takes a LONG time to cast, and it is impossible to cast it<br/>\non enemies that can Duel Wield and Bash.  Thankfully Root is there to save<br/>\nyou, because Root casts relativlely fast, but Root hardly holds.  And my<br/>\nAlteration is maxed.  I have 142 INT, soon to be 148.  I get 5 casts out of<br/>\nFlame Shock for 102 Dmg each on enemies with lower magic resistance.  Ok,<br/>\nwell, that was a fun chat.  I still love my Wizard and would never give him<br/>\nup for any other class.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
