I don&#39;t think you have a piercing upgrade &#39;til Stiletto and I<br/>\nbelieve that weapon is designed to be too tough to get until Lvl 40+.<br/>\nAlthough the RTS isn&#39;t perfect, it is pretty good and does prepare you (2H<br/>\nBlunt skill) for the Observer&#39;s Staff which I think is designed for Lvl 30+.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStats on Oberserver&#39;s Staff:   Dmg 12, Delay 39, +5 INT, +5 WIS, +30 MANA<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is obviously an excellent weapon to keep in mind...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the information we keep seeing here lends credence to the strategy<br/>\nof keeping all or at least two of your weapon skills up.

I am an advocate of it because<br/>\nof the Pugius, the <br/>\n\t\tfanged skull stilleto, and the certain skull that was talked<br/>\nabout so many <br/>\n\t\ttimes prior.  With a Pugius right now at lvl 13, and the<br/>\nskull, life is much <br/>\n\t\teasier.  Plus 20 mana is better than the runed staff can<br/>\nprovide, and the <br/>\n\t\tPugius attacks much, much quicker.  I am still looking for a<br/>\nfanged skull <br/>\n\t\tstilleto (anyone know where to get them), but once I have<br/>\nfound one, life <br/>\n\t\twill be much easier.<br/>\n\t\tZaeq, Wizard of E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGive back to your community through &quot;Grow to Give.&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\nSee homepage for details.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
