Cast the bonds of force and run---you can get enough distance<br/>\nbetween you and the guard to cast again with the guard never touching<br/>\nyou.  I also used it on the double dwarves in BB.  Would cast bonds of<br/>\nforce from as far away as I could, then root one of them and run run<br/>\nrun.   Then you only had to fight one at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nZoddie   retired solro wizzie<br/>\n<br/>\nLim Dul wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Lim Dul&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sevendegrees@...\">sevendegrees@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message: 5<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Fri, 21 Jan 2000 09:36:06 EST<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SPRUSBRUCE@...\">SPRUSBRUCE@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: outside vrs inside<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;I have a wizzie friend that I leveled with throughout myt life and when he<br/>\n&gt; &gt;got bonds he used that when we were fighting gaurds.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Bonds of Force?
