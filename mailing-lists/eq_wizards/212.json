More of a query than anything else. I haven&#39;t tried it as yet, but I&#39;d assume that if it IS possible, you sit down, open your spell book and instead of putting the spell in one of your slots, hit the scroll.<br/>\n<br/>\nEither that or it&#39;s a more complicated add blank scroll, ink, quill, into something and then cast the spell on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr perhap we can&#39;t do this, because if so we&#39;d me raping the lower level characters for money more than we do foreigners for binds.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot; Hello there, looks like you&#39;ve come a LOOOONG way....Sure would be a shame to die out here and have your body decompose, yes siree bob...You know, for 1 plat, I can fix that for you...heh..heh.... &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSound familiar? : )<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I&#39;ve never charged for my binds, but I&#39;ve taken to going &#39; /a &#39; so I&#39;m not flooded with requests all the time. I&#39;ll do it if they&#39;re near me, and I&#39;m not in a hurry to catch a boat or retrieve my corpse. You wouldn&#39;t believe how long some people will wait for a bind. One guy messaged me, and I told him yeah when I&#39;m back in Queynos. (He&#39;d come from  Freeport). I forgot about him, and was about to log, so I gated back home to the north gate, and the guy was still there waiting. He wasn&#39;t even pissed or anything...He&#39;d waited 4 hours real time. HE didn&#39;t adventure, just sat there...yeesh....<br/>\n<br/>\nZalbar<br/>\n14th Wizard<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
