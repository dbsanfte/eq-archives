You can take blue Tarentulas easy<br/>\n(they all have a Chitin that sells for a few silver, but half have one or more Spider<br/>\n Silk that sells for 1g7). At level 10, you can even take some Sand Scarabs with a<br/>\nmarginal luck (no fizzle), and those Scarabs have shells that sell for 1g2, and the<br/>\noccasional Scarab Egg Sac that sells for 4g. Plus there&#39;s a guard to run to if you<br/>\nget in over your head :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a two-hour hunting session, I usually make almost a plat. Granted, the last two<br/>\ndays were bad, because many people came in for the Tunare Festival, and the hunting<br/>\ngroups have swelled in number. When you see a Tarentula, you run fast, and /con later :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
