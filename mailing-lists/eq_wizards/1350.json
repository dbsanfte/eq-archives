This is<br/>\nquite a big buff for so little mana.  It is a must have when going against mobs<br/>\nwith a fire based attack.  The damage as far as I&#39;m concerned is just gravy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalkin<br/>\nIt&#39;s friday and I ain&#39;t working.  Now if only I could get EQ to run on a Sparc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; O&#39;keils radiation does pretty much suck.  I don&#39;t understand why it was<br/>\n&gt; given to us because we don&#39;t (to my knowledge) get any other damage shields,<br/>\n&gt; so it is not like a series of spells or anything like it should be.  I still<br/>\n&gt; use it a little at level 10 (and I think it does 3 damage now, not 2) to<br/>\n&gt; help our tank out a little, but I think by level 12 or 16 it will be out of<br/>\n&gt; my repertoire.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
