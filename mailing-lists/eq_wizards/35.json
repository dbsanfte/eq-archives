Is it just 1 extra point per level?  Is<br/>\nit spell dependant?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, as a fifth level wizard using Shock of Fire, I was<br/>\nconsistantly doing 13 points of damage.  After going to 6th<br/>\nlevel, I am consistantly doing 14 points.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Also, I have been playing around with the spells, and I am having<br/>\ntrouble getting O&#39;keils Radiation to work.  How does it work and<br/>\nwhat is the best way to use it?<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Any idea where I can find a Glimpse spell in Freeport?  I have<br/>\ntried the guild and can not find it for sale.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not that<br/>\ngreat<br/>\nof a spell, but I think it&#39;s the only one I don&#39;t have.<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                        Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                            Soren<br/>\n                                                            Wizard Level<br/>\n6</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
