I was in a party that ranged from<br/>\nlevel 9 to 12 while I was level 10. Everyone talked about the &#39;great exp&#39;<br/>\nthey got, while I was thinking &quot;Man they must never get any Exp&quot;. I asked<br/>\nabout what everyone got after a big fight and the results went something<br/>\nlike this:<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 9 got almost a 1/3rd of a bubble<br/>\nlevel 10-12 got close to 1/2 a bubble<br/>\nPoor old Cinius the only Wizard in the party saving everyones ass had to<br/>\nwait til the next fight to notice a combined total from both fights of 1/4<br/>\nof a bubble. Is it like this for anyone else? Hell I get 1/4 of a bubble<br/>\nwhen killing a yellow on my own. In my opinion that makes it worth the risk<br/>\nof getting killed by the yellows(happens maybe once out of every 7-10<br/>\nkills).<br/>\n<br/>\nmy apologies for the last double mail...had browser problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nCinius(Mith Marr)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your free, private email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.excite.com/\">http://mail.excite.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
