I came up<br/>\nwith two ideas besides us getting more mana points.  Other RPG&#39;s like<br/>\nFinal Fantasy, they have potions that restore some mana.  What if we<br/>\nwere to have something like that.  Like a kind of mana potion or<br/>\nsomething.  Then we would be more useful in groups, less meditating<br/>\ntime, and we would be able to fight solo....First root when getting low<br/>\non mana then bandage and cast.  The second idea that I had was a item or<br/>\npiece of  equipment (or many items and pieces of equipment) that would<br/>\nquicken the meditating process. Like a staff that would make our mana go<br/>\nup 20% faster or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nKodros<br/>\nServer of Prexus</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
