One of the biggest reason I gave up on my PvP char there was that my own race was killing me.  Each Race should stick together and fight other races not each other.  SO I think the faction system which then prevents them from going into their own town because they killed their own kind if GREAT.  But I also must say that it takes more than one kill to make this faction so.  It takes about 5-10 kills of your own race or any race to start to remove your good faction with them.<br/>\n    <br/>\n    Shadair J&#39;Axx<br/>\n    <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">         ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n        From: Tom Bratina <br/>\n        To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n        Sent: Wednesday, July 07, 1999 1:36 PM<br/>\n        Subject: Re: [eq_wizards] What is the best way to raise faction level with the Merchants of Felwithe?<br/>\n        <br/>\n        <br/>\n        i am not speaking of the NPC faction system, but rather the PC faction system they recently put in (which seems to be a totally different faction system).  when i kill a wood elf, my faction lowers with &quot;many elves&quot;.  what do i kill to raise this faction? yes, it&#39;s pretty obvious if they explicitly state which faction system u lose or gain with (such as indigo brotherhood in neriak), but &quot;many elves&quot;? what the hell is that?  and kos in ur own home town after killing 2 or 3 of ur brethren? i don&#39;t know about the non-pvp servers, but this is a HUGE issue on rallos zek.  and what about interracial guild wars and duels on the other servers? i heard that they have ceased to exist since the faction system was put in. on zek, some ppl have just totally given up on ever going &quot;home&quot;.  simply put, verant screwed up by putting it in, and i&#39;ve heard that they are going to remove it (maybe just a rumor, i don&#39;t know)...  too bad for all those that have already had the factions fubar&#39;ed tho.<br/>\n         <br/>\n        sinlaru ce`alen<br/>\n        rallos zek<br/>\n            -----Original Message-----<br/>\n            From: John Penman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jpenman@...\">jpenman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n            To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n            Date: Wednesday, July 07, 1999 12:48 PM<br/>\n            Subject: Re: [eq_wizards] What is the best way to raise faction level with the Merchants of Felwithe?<br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            You couldn&#39;t be more wrong.  The faction system makes you explore different areas of the game to find ways to improve your faction.  If they just told you how to improve or destroy your faction with any races then why have it.  Why would a DE be allowed to enter or even buy from venders of Good diety?  The faction system allows for a person to create their own destiny by choosing which faction they wish to increase and hunting that method out.<br/>\n            <br/>\n                In Guk there are two factions of Frogloks, Good and Undead (Ghoul).  At the begining if you do not harm any Good frogloks and head into Guk and get attacked by a Ghoul froglok, you can run to a good froglok and he will protect you just like a guard would in your city.  This of course depends on your starting faction with them.  Without a faction system then you will get attack by everyone of them.<br/>\n            <br/>\n            Just my 2 cps worth.<br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            Shadair J&#39;Axx<br/>\n            32 Wizard<br/>\n            The Chosen Ones<br/>\n            Karana<br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n                ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n                From: Tom Bratina <br/>\n                To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n                Sent: Wednesday, July 07, 1999 12:21 PM<br/>\n                Subject: Re: [eq_wizards] What is the best way to raise faction level with the Merchants of Felwithe?<br/>\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                well, i don&#39;t have an answer for u, but i think Verant royally screwed up with the PC faction system they implemented.  anyway, i say if Verant is going to continue with this patsy faction crap, they need to at least post how u can alter ur faction in a positive manner.  or just totally remove the stupid friggin PC faction system.<br/>\n                 <br/>\n                just my rant.<br/>\n                 <br/>\n                sinlaru ce`alen<br/>\n                rallos zek<br/>\n                    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n                    From: Mike Browne &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mbrowne@...\">mbrowne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n                    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n                    Date: Wednesday, July 07, 1999 10:48 AM<br/>\n                    Subject: [eq_wizards] What is the best way to raise faction level with the Merchants of Felwithe?<br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    Hello, fellow Wizards!<br/>\n                     <br/>\n                    Several weeks ago I participated in a guild war and slew a High Elf not knowing that there would be a faction hit as a result. Well, I can no longer purchase or sell items in Felwithe. I&#39;ve tried everything that I know of to improve my faction standing with the Merchants there, but to no avail. My faction standing with the guards is &quot;amiable&quot; -- It is with the &quot;Merchants&quot; that I need a faction adjustment. Does anyone have any ideas? Suggestions? Personal experience?
