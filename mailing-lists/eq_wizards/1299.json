Parties cant be bothered with wizards, they<br/>\n&gt; cant buff, cant heal<br/>\n&gt; and cant really help parties that much...&quot;we were supposed<br/>\n&gt; to be heavy<br/>\n&gt; artillery&quot; but that just is not correct. I think a wizard<br/>\n&gt; would be most parties<br/>\n&gt; last choice if they could choose from all the classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Let me just throw in the fact that this is not my experience.  A<br/>\nwizard can be a great help to a party if it is organized well and if<br/>\nthe wizard has brains.<br/>\nWhat do I mean by brains?  Well, some wizards immediately start<br/>\ncasting on a monster when the fight starts.  They do a good chunk of<br/>\ndamage so the monster runs for them.  From then on, the whole party<br/>\nhas to scramble to keep the wizard alive.<br/>\nIf played well, the wizard can make the difference between a tough<br/>\nfight and an easy one.  Throw in spells to take out nice chunks of<br/>\nhitpoints once in a while.  If things go wrong, blast away and do<br/>\n300-400 damage in a few seconds, saving the party.  If the monster<br/>\nruns, root it and finish it off, saving time.<br/>\nA smart wizard can be a great asset to any party.  The key is, don&#39;t<br/>\nput yourself in a position where everyone has to go out of their way<br/>\nto save you.<br/>\nAznyin<br/>\nLevel 15 Erudite Wizard<br/>\nChivalric Order of Norrath<br/>\nCurrent Residence: Rivervale [Solusek Ro]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
