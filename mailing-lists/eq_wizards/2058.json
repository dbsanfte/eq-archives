Some spells have no animations<br/>\nover the enemy, you just cast and then see the damage messages with NO<br/>\nanimation over the enemy at all.  And what about our lightning spells<br/>\nlooking exactly like the cleric (strike, furor, smite) spells?  And what<br/>\nabout our lightning bolt spell looking like Fire bolt???  This makes it get<br/>\nboring.  Why are we playing a graphical RPG in the first place?  Umm.. for<br/>\nthe graphics maybe?!  This is just insane maybe if we had a little more<br/>\nvariety in what we see in the world we wouldnt need to feel unique in other<br/>\nways.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Solric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mprez20@...\">mprez20@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mprez20@...\">mprez20@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, May 28, 1999 3:33 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_wizards] suggestions to Verant<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mprez20@...\">mprez20@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI see where your coming from on making a wizard &quot;different&quot;.  Wizards are<br/>\n99% <br/>\ndirect damage.  It does get boring after awhile, med. nuke nuke, med. repeat<br/>\n<br/>\nas necessary. <br/>\nWhile a necromancer has a pet, mage gets a pet, enchanter gets a ton of <br/>\nspells and each class can use some direct damage.  Shamans and druids...<br/>\nwell <br/>\nthey are just great and have a ton of diversity.  However we are wizards and<br/>\n<br/>\nthe exact opposite of warriors.  Warriors do nothing but bash in close<br/>\ncombat <br/>\nand they are damn good at it.  Wizards do nothing but destroy with magic and<br/>\n<br/>\nthey are damn good at that.  We are the only class that can teleport to<br/>\nother <br/>\nplanes &quot;although secret entrances do exist for the people that don&#39;t want to<br/>\n<br/>\nfind a wizard&quot;.  Our travel spells are very nice as are our area affect <br/>\nspells at high levels with a party.  You pay a price with power and that <br/>\nprice is a lack of diversity I think.  Truely no one can come close to the <br/>\ndamage a wizard can do in less then 5 seconds.  Truely a sight to see when a<br/>\n<br/>\n20th leve MOB is beating on your level 8 party and you can&#39;t hit it, then a <br/>\n36th level wizard walks by we yelled for help, he casts one spell and the<br/>\nMOB <br/>\ndies like that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDiversity Suggestions..<br/>\nWizard Only Special Robes and more graphics for them.  I must say the ones <br/>\nthey have now are great, but more couldn&#39;t help.  Again more quests and fix <br/>\nthe broken ones, this is everquest after all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI for one belive in the power of the wizard and I do know that brad and <br/>\nverant have absolutely no intent of changing them.  I quote &quot;Wizards are by <br/>\nfar the most balanced casting class and to change anything to them now would<br/>\n<br/>\ndestroy 1 years worth of game balancing&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAdaar<br/>\nEruidte Wizard Welcoming all comments =)<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nLooking to expand your world?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nONElist has over 150,000 e-mail communities from which to chose!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
