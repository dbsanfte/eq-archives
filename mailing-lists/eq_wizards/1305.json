With <br/>\nthat balance, the wizard can, if properly played, really shine. I find that <br/>\nwith a Paladin, Enchanter, Wizard and any other &quot;tank&quot; class in a party, <br/>\nit&#39;s possible to kill fast, and keep moving. For instance, in the Steamfront <br/>\nMinotaur Cave, I joined up with a group. The first time something came in at <br/>\nus, I fired off a Shock of Ice right off, then would let the rest go to work <br/>\non it. I&#39;d fire off a shot as needed to speed it to its death, but would <br/>\nrarely have to expend more than 25% of my mana. While our runner went <br/>\nlooking for more Minotaurs to bring back, I could meditate and get back to <br/>\nfull mana before the next wave. I can root fleeing Minos, finish them off at <br/>\nleisure, or nuke one to death if we get swarmed, giving the tanks some <br/>\nbreathing room.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour fellow players may not appreciate you at first, but the first time you <br/>\nrun out of mana and there&#39;s a fresh creature up, they will notice real fast <br/>\nthat it&#39;s taking them 3x longer to kill it than when you helped. They don&#39;t <br/>\nsee how much damage you actually do when you fire off spells, so sometimes <br/>\nyou may have to give a &quot;demonstration&quot; to sway them to invite you. I am <br/>\nhappy to give them :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nVash, 11th Level Wizardess, Felwithe, E&#39;Ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
