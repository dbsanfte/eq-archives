I find kill stealing is never a problem either on my server, or on <br/>\n&gt;my<br/>\n&gt;continent.  Not sure which, but I&#39;ve heard lots of complaints of KS&#39;ing, <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;I almost never see someone do it.  But that would seriously annoy me, if I<br/>\n&gt;attacked something and some fighter just jumped in, and then he gave me<br/>\n&gt;shit.
