Yet, it still doesn&#39;t make camping any more <br/>\n&gt; enjoyable does it?  All it does is delay the inevitable.  Assuming the MoB <br/>\n&gt; dropped your item everytime...your guild would STILL be the first ones to <br/>\n&gt; get it.  It doesn&#39;t mean you tried any harder...it just meant you didn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; have to waste so much time doing it.  How is that a bad thing?  Item Rarity <br/>\n&gt; should be dependant upon the difficulty in the MoB itself IMHO.  An item can <br/>\n&gt; even be made rare by making the MoB spawn less often... they DO that <br/>\n&gt; already...but the frustration is made worse when the item is not on the MoB. <br/>\n&gt;   It&#39;s like they want to double-up on your tension.  This point is not as <br/>\n&gt; important...but you gotta remember we are all on paid time.  Verant has no <br/>\n&gt; problem making us sit for 18hours at a time for an item now do they?  :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I liked the other post I read earlier that suggested random spawns...if it <br/>\n&gt; could be designed in such a way that a NPC would spawn *anywhere* in the <br/>\n&gt; level itself.  Now that&#39;s a fun challenge!  :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, now that the powergamers have gotten all there is to get, your point <br/>\n&gt; is moot my friend.  I have no desire to be the &quot;first&quot; to get an item...I <br/>\n&gt; just want it for personal satisfaction.  I killed the Mob...I got my item.  <br/>\n&gt; :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh, by the way Askur, the advice to go to Cazic is a good one.  From 24 and <br/>\n&gt; up....it&#39;s a haven for xp!  And I&#39;m not going to begin to say how much money <br/>\n&gt; you can get there hehe.   I&#39;ll probably run into you there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n&gt; 26 Wiz Veeshan<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Show your ONElist SPIRIT!<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/tshirt2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With a new ONElist SHIRT available through our website.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
