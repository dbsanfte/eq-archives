Well, words in, the race was won by some<br/>\nhalfling rogue who reached lvl 50 before you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t like others twinking, don&#39;t adventure with them. Sneer at<br/>\nthem because they&#39;re &quot;rich snobs who got money from mommy and daddy&quot;.<br/>\nChallenge them to a duel, show them that it&#39;s not the size of the sword<br/>\nthat matters, and then take the bigger sword from them when you win!<br/>\nLaugh at them when they die. Roleplay the jealous commoner who has to<br/>\nwork for his/her way in this world. And feel better knowing that you are<br/>\nthe true winner of the race to have fun and enjoy the game!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know what I&#39;m tired of? People trying to enforce their playing<br/>\nstyles on others. They think that just because a person does something<br/>\nthat they don&#39;t like (but doesn&#39;t actually hurt them) that the person<br/>\nshould be banned! Bah! Just as in real life there are people born with a<br/>\nsilver spoon up their a**. There are people who like to powergame and<br/>\ndont roleplay. Live with it. Learn from it. And go buy yourself a<br/>\nplatinum spoon with your hard earned money. Then wave it in their face,<br/>\ntype /rude &lt;twinker&gt;, and go on your merry way.<br/>\n<br/>\nCroesus Illuminatus (Xegony)<br/>\n*Mobile Nuclear Weapons Silo*<br/>\n<br/>\nElkantar The Wizard wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Elkantar The Wizard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:the_elkantar@...\">the_elkantar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hear a lot of players say that it is wrong and I agree. I hear few say<br/>\n&gt; leave it alone! I and a lot of other players left twinking alone in UO and<br/>\n&gt; look where that game is now. Same for Diablo. It does effect me and my<br/>\n&gt; character cause it will lead to every other player having to twinkle just to<br/>\n&gt; play on even ground. Then all the honest players will be left behind like<br/>\n&gt; UO.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Twinking the Definition....Giving high level gear to a low level character.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I agree that &quot;low level&quot; is not lower level. I a 10th level wizard gave<br/>\n&gt; items to a fighter who is 7th level. Things I can not use but he can and it<br/>\n&gt; helps our party. He being only 3 levels under me. This just makes sense. But<br/>\n&gt; when a 20th level character gives items high in value to a less then 10th<br/>\n&gt; level character that is simply foolish and exploitable.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now at 5th level I did find a mighty magical item that someone had<br/>\n&gt; mistakenly dropped. I belive this is fair in the game. But to have a<br/>\n&gt; character outfitted by other, in a guild or no, is simply cheating and will<br/>\n&gt; ruin the balance of the game.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Elkantar Keeper of the Tome of Magi Lore<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
