That is causes you to regain your<br/>\nconcentration in battle.  The higher your channeling skill, the more often<br/>\nyou&#39;ll regain your concentration after being hit.  My channeling is<br/>\ncurrently 110 and it kicks in all the time during battle ;)  I have heard<br/>\nrumors that eventually, once in gets up in the 200&#39;s you&#39;ll even be able to<br/>\nrun and still cast spells, although it will only seldom work ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nTalarin, High Elven Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  And no, its not something new that was just added in the last patch,<br/>\nit has been around since beta ;)  You&#39;re probably just now getting your<br/>\nskill high enough where its finally kicking it every so often ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: John Penman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jpenman@...\">jpenman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, April 27, 1999 11:43 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Re: Unfair?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;John Penman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jpenman@...\">jpenman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well I think they have taken some of this in to consideration because it<br/>\n&gt; seems they added somehting new to last nights patch.  During the game last<br/>\n&gt; night I received a message while in combat taht stated &quot;You regained<br/>\n&gt; concentration&quot; and it cast my spells after it told me I lost<br/>\nconcentration.<br/>\n&gt; Could be the first steps...?
