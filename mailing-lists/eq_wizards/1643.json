I haven&#39;t used or used very little melee since level <br/>\n12.  Although admittedly, melee was VERY useful during the 8-12lvl stages <br/>\nwhere you needed the extra dmg to finish the creatures off.  Since 12, if <br/>\nyou are lucky enough to find a regular group, you can begin your role as a <br/>\npure nuker...cast/med/cast/med.  I have met many a high level Wizard who <br/>\nhave gotten rid of staffs/daggers altogether in favor of mana or <br/>\nintelligence enhancing items (idols, tomes, wands, etc)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a group, and believe me, you WILL probably have to group at higher <br/>\nlevels, I find that your value to the group is more in your ability to <br/>\nstrike from a distance rather than risking your neck near a <br/>\ncreature..especially since it&#39;s pissed off at the 117 damage spell you just <br/>\ncasted 2 seconds ago.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Can anyone confirm this and/or give suggestions on how at this point<br/>\n&gt;(9th) I can improve my 1H fighting skills?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
