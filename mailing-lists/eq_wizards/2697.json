Things have been slowing <br/>\ndown for good &#39;ol LimDul lately and I&#39;m looking around for something else to <br/>\ndo besides all the senseless killing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I wish Verant had more items for us to find...we all know the <br/>\nitems everyone wants (ie.  Observer Robe/Staff, Shimmering Orb, etc)  Too <br/>\nbad there weren&#39;t enough variety of items so that we don&#39;t have to all camp <br/>\nfor the same things.  Imagine if there were several different varieties of <br/>\nObserver robes or Different colors of Orbs? Maybe just adjust the stats just <br/>\na fraction to allow for different combinations.  It&#39;s a shame everyone has <br/>\nto keep butting heads looking for the same things....only to find you look <br/>\nlike everyone else once you get it.  :(  I would think the above types of <br/>\nchanges wouldn&#39;t drastically be difficult under the current game <br/>\nengine...nor would they ruin game balance...or would they?<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see their rationale in limiting &quot;rare&quot; items to only 1 NPC.  But <br/>\nplaced in the perspective of 1500 on a server, that poor NPC is typically <br/>\ngoing to be camped by everyone who wants that item.  It would be nice to <br/>\nprovide other items that one might choose that would work in lieu of camping <br/>\nfor days for an item.<br/>\n<br/>\n*sigh*  Just dreaming to myself. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\nVeeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
