I think it&#39;s the EQ equivalent of speaking broken<br/>\n&gt; &gt; English - the chance of being misunderstood is bigger if your language<br/>\n&gt; &gt; skill is very low.  Just a conjecture , of course.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My friends have started practicing languages during my increasingly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; longer meditations.  Just start chattering away in your race language,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and in a few minutes you will see some gain.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My theory on this is you can only teach others up to your level in the<br/>\n&gt; language, or parhaps a bit less (seems logical that you can not teach them<br/>\n&gt; to speak better than you can). That&#39;s too bad, I&#39;d have loved raising my<br/>\n&gt; Old Erudian just talking with someone who also only put 1 point in it :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do you get one new language every two levels to train with, or is this<br/>\n&gt; random ? Or perhaps it depends on what critters you encounter ?<br/>\n&gt; I wanna learn griffin :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ramagh - level 10 (and raising !) wizard - Fenin Ro.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Have you visited the new ONElist home page lately?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ONElist: The Leading e-mail list and community service on the Internet!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
