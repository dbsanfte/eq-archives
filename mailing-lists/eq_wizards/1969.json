I also clarified some points that might be vague.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe, the Wizards of the Onelist.com Eq_Wizards mailing list, feel the Wizard<br/>\nclass requires revision and have compiled the following list of suggestions:<br/>\n<br/>\nNew Spells( to enhance our group desirablility)<br/>\n[suggested levels are between 8 and 29]<br/>\n<br/>\nSummon -     Teleports group member inside the zone to your location<br/>\nPhase -         Teleports yourself to location of other group member inside<br/>\nzone<br/>\nTap Afinity -  Teleport group member to their own bind spot<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChanges to existing spells:<br/>\n<br/>\nRoot -             Minimum time duration, with random maxium time duration.<br/>\nFade              Useless, remove completely<br/>\nShadowstep   Change to line of sight, with minimum travelled distance and<br/>\nrandom max. distance.<br/>\n<br/>\nSkill Changes<br/>\nMeditation skill max for level for wizard (Level +1) * 7.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also request your continued efforts on implementing the Specialization<br/>\nskill.<br/>\n<br/>\nGame Mechanics<br/>\n-Investigate the increase of spell failures (fizzles) of lower level spells<br/>\nas Wizard class advances in levels.  Should &quot;simpler&quot; spells fail more often<br/>\nas the Wizard increase in levels, regardless of appropriate skill?  (ie.<br/>\nRoot, Shielding etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Resolving the problem of high resistence of Level 20+ DD spells by greens,<br/>\nblues and higher (if this is the result of a stun effect we wish one spell<br/>\nwithout this effect at same level)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Resolving the balance problem of other magic-using classes still able to<br/>\naffect Monsters  (in a group situation) that are 6+ above their own levels<br/>\n(Necromancer - Lifetap & pets, Enchanters and Magicians - pets, buffs, etc)<br/>\nwhile Wizard DD spells are 100% resisted by 6+ level MoBs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- We wish real official feedback on planned changes or problems which you<br/>\nhave with balance in game on an official page which exists but never seems<br/>\nto be updated (eg. id&#39;s Quake .plan files)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe feel the Wizard class has been overlooked far too long and that there is<br/>\nnothing that is truly unique about our characters anymore.  We feel the<br/>\nabove changes would go a long way towards rectifying some of the classes<br/>\nshortcomings.  Thanks for your consideration.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Wizards of Norrath.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
