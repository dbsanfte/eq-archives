If <br/>\nyou enjoy large groups, the first and most helpful spell is clearly <br/>\nFireBolt. Your party members will be quite impressed with this spell <br/>\nbecause you will do tremendous amounts of damage for your level. <br/>\nHowever because,its casting time is long (too long to use one on <br/>\none), and range is short, it is only effective in a party (also you <br/>\ncan miss). <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are a more solitary fellow I would sugguest shock of ice. The <br/>\ndamage is still good and its casting time is such that you can cast <br/>\nand melee at the same time ( I don&#39;t recommend it though ). It is <br/>\nalso an effective spell for finishing off squirly runners.<br/>\nAfter obtaining one of these two spells I would suggest getting <br/>\nlesser shielding. It is a decent upgrade to minor shielding. Then get <br/>\nthe other of the two direct damage spells that you didn&#39;t get before. <br/>\nIn my opinion the rest of the spells are optional. These three are <br/>\nyour bread and butter for that rank. (shadow step can be quite handy <br/>\nfor getting out of a bad situation though).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my humble opinion. Hope this helps<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WriterDL@...\">WriterDL@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WriterDL@...\">WriterDL@...</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eq_wizards] Introductions<br/>\n&gt;Date: Fri, 16 Apr 1999 14:01:38 EDT<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WriterDL@...\">WriterDL@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Greetings and Good day.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am Gaedin, a 5th level High Elf Wizard on Veeshan who spends his <br/>\n </span></blockquote>days <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;wandering around Kelethin sniping at Orc Centurions.
