We have<br/>\nmany plans on the basis of this guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nSick of having to deal with the KS&#39;ing reputation that Wizards have? We will<br/>\nhelp others who are having problems with ANY KS&#39;ers and promote Wizards&#39;<br/>\nabilities in a very positive manner.<br/>\n<br/>\nSick of having less-than-ideal equipment because no one cares that you want<br/>\nto go to location X to get item Y? I have grouped with many Wizards at once,<br/>\nwe get the items that we want that no one else cares about. We have<br/>\ndeveloped very effective strategies that doesn&#39;t have any down time that you<br/>\nthink a group of wizards would have. Also, I believe that there is anything<br/>\nwrong with GIVING fellow Wizards hand-me-downs (making sure that the item in<br/>\nquestion isn&#39;t too powerful for person in question).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe always GIVE extra runes or extra spells (which ever the person prefers)<br/>\nto those who need them.<br/>\nThis is the only problem that Wizards have with joining this guild. Some<br/>\nfeel that they are given more runes by being surrounded by those who don&#39;t<br/>\nneed them. I totally agree with them.<br/>\nI totally feel, however, that this disadvantage is far out-weighed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are just some of the main focuses of our guild.<br/>\nIf you have any comments or suggestions or desire to join, PLEASE email me.<br/>\nI love to hear what people think about this guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if you want to start a Wizard guild on a different server, email me<br/>\nand I will give you all kinds of info and help to get you started.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading,<br/>\nTelor</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
