I got whacked last might (again =).  My<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s a hot button on the same button set as my offensive spells:<br/>\n&gt;\tHit Fx (whatever position the tank is), 6 (assist), 1 (big nuke)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; companion and I were jumped by three cents, and we pretty much just took<br/>\n&gt;&gt; whichever happened to be closest to us.  If mana had held out, we would<br/>\n&gt;&gt; have made quick work of them, but such is life.  Thinking back on it now,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; maybe it would have been better if we&#39;d both focused on the same one until<br/>\n&gt;&gt; it dropped, then regroup on the next one.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Assuming you have 3 peoples dealing the a fixed amount of damage over time<br/>\n&gt;vs 3 mobs dealing a fixed amount of damage, check what happens if:<br/>\n&gt;\t1) you engage each other 1-on-1<br/>\n&gt;\t2) all 3 engage 1, then switch to the next<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Basically, you can see that it will take the same time to kill them in both<br/>\n&gt;circumstances (you need the same amount). However, if you use tactic 1, the<br/>\n&gt;all mobs deal damage over the full time, while using tactic 2, only one mob<br/>\n&gt;deal damage over full time, while one will do damage over only 1/3. Since<br/>\n&gt;mobs do the same damage at all time, unless almost dead :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you forget one important thing about tactic one as all MOBs get hits on all<br/>\ncasters there is also VERY BIG probability that they will interupt at last<br/>\nsome spells so a.) battle will be longer and MOBs will deal more damage b.)<br/>\nYou will use all mana on interupts and fizzles and ........ MOBs<br/>\nwill....... You.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;How this is done is by having the combat leader doing the targetting. Once the<br/>\n&gt;leader says &quot;I have a target&quot;, all click /assist. The combat leader is<br/>\n&gt;usually the main tank - not necessarily the group leader.<br/>\n&gt;-- <br/>\n&gt;Vincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Tel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n&gt;        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Congratulations to &#39;Voice-Diary,&#39; our latest ONElist of the Week. <br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a> <br/>\n&gt;Visit our homepage and share with us how ONElist is changing YOUR life!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Silverion<br/>\nHigh elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\nFenin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\nmoderator mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
