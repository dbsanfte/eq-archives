Also, when I have<br/>\na magical item telling me I get +1 mana, does that mean just a +1 to my<br/>\n&lt;insert number here&gt; mana? Or does it mean an increase in regeneration?<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have only 102 i intelligence, as I had no idea what does what<br/>\nwhen I created the character. I had a general idea, but not specifics<br/>\n(thanks Verant for such great documentation). Anyway, I used the points<br/>\nto invest in other things, and I find I can hold my own against a blue<br/>\nor black orc centurion at my level 8, even when I run OOM and we come to<br/>\nblows (well, I come to blows, he was already at blows). It&#39;s obvious to<br/>\nme that later, my only weapon will be my spells, and I will maybe be<br/>\nable to cast one less DD than someone who invested it all in<br/>\nIntelligence, but that really doesn&#39;t discourage me. reasons are, that<br/>\nlater you have to travel in a party anyway, and no one will notice how<br/>\nmany DD&#39;s I cast. If things come to such extreme when another one DD<br/>\ncast is the difference between life and death, it means we&#39;re attacking<br/>\ntoo strong creatures anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to all those that are worried, don&#39;t. You will have easier times in<br/>\nmelee early on, and you won&#39;t be THAT much weaker later on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nQenelin<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\nNemo me impune lacessit!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
