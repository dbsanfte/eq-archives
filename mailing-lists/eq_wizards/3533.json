You can hang out by a zone line and<br/>\nkite them all day.  You should be able to take out<br/>\nWhite Pincer Beetles rather easily.  Do not worry<br/>\nabout rooting them.  You can easily out run the<br/>\nbeetles without SOW...you may have to jump a few times<br/>\nto get out of their range quickly (if they get too<br/>\nclose for some reason).  I have taken out yellow<br/>\nbeetles but did not do this very often due to resists<br/>\non my SOL spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck...and its great XP.<br/>\n<br/>\nZiffnab, 53rd Wizard of Xegony<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jpool10550@...\">jpool10550@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have a Lvl 12 DE wizard, I have been hunting in<br/>\n&gt; the WC fighting <br/>\n&gt; either YK, willos, are dervs, any other suggestions<br/>\n&gt; on where i could <br/>\n&gt; get some good, exp?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
