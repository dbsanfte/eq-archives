This<br/>\nall happened during the first week of the game.<br/>\nNow RTS are much more common,  I see them auctioned off for 10 to 20 plat<br/>\nall the time (average 15pp).<br/>\nIts generally the next step up if you want a magical weapon.  If your<br/>\nreally looking to upgrade, see if you can get a Fine Steel Great Staff, or<br/>\na Fine Steel Dagger.  Maybe I just haven&#39;t come accross them, but I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink I have encountered a FS Staff.<br/>\nAn RTS should last you a while.  Once you get to the upper 20s or 30s start<br/>\nlooking for an observer staff or some of the other magical 1 and 2 handed<br/>\nstaves in the game.  Also a Dragoon Dirk is pretty easy to get once in the<br/>\nmid 20s.  I could solo acquire one relatively easily at 28th.<br/>\nLomack, Knight Defender of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
