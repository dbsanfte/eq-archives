If the spell is in your <br/>\ncircle, you can scribe it.  You can purchase the spell from a vendor, <br/>\nresearch the spell yourself, or have someone with more skill, research the <br/>\nskill for you then give you the researched spell to scribe in your spellbook. <br/>\n You can also use those extra runes you have to practice and then either sell <br/>\nor give away to younger characters the spells you successfully research.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile visiting Halas, I successfully researched the Levitate spell several <br/>\ntimes and gave them to shaman friends of mine.  They were thrilled since that <br/>\nspell is a Level 16 spell, I believe, for them, and costs a few plat at that <br/>\nlevel.  I then turned around after finding out how expensive Root was for a <br/>\nshaman to purchase (I think I was told 8 plat...don&#39;t really remember now) <br/>\nand gated back to Felwithe and spent 4 gold and some odd coins each on 10 <br/>\nroot spells and handed them out to shamans who gave me sow :).  I NEVER have <br/>\nto worry about being SoW&#39;d while in Halas or Permafrost now.  A little <br/>\nkindness and thoughtfulness towards others can go a long way and many people <br/>\ndo NOT forget things like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI then turned around and made friends with several older wizards who did the <br/>\nsame thing for me in return.  They would sit in front of the bank, using up <br/>\nsurplus runes to practice researching spells and then give them to me.  I <br/>\nbanked some for when I am older and can scribe them :), and gave away a few <br/>\nthat I already had to those who would be needing them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWith the cost of upper level spells and with some of our spells being <br/>\nRESEARCH ONLY, it really helps when we help each other out and then pass on <br/>\nthat good will to another wizard, enchanter, magician, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are not sure what classes can use the same spells that you do, <br/>\nremember to right click on the spell and it will tell you.  Many of our <br/>\nspells are shared with other classes&#39; circles.  And I really kind of like it <br/>\nthat way....<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my thoughts....<br/>\n<br/>\nKasondra<br/>\nBristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
