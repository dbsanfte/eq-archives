I&#39;ve always thought it would be cool to have that spell those <br/>\nTentacle Terrors have in Najena...you know, the ones that knock you back ten <br/>\nbillion feet. :)   It wouldn&#39;t even need to give damage...but if it was able <br/>\nto knock a whole mob of creatures away from your body for a few secs...that <br/>\nwould aid a whole lot in terms of survivability.  Would make a good escape <br/>\ncombo with Shadow step.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
