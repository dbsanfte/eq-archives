As I was not twinked, but had many hundreds of platinum by level<br/>\n&gt; 12.  There have been in the past messages posted requesting language<br/>\n&gt; assitance.  Well, if someone has mastered all of the main languages in the<br/>\n&gt; game, player languages, monster languages, and most importantly the research<br/>\n&gt; languages (Old Erudian through elder Dragon).  Its amazing how well people<br/>\n&gt; will pay to become excellent in the research languages.  Its really not that<br/>\n&gt; hard to become excellent either, the most difficult thing is to find the<br/>\n&gt; languages. Just search the land, looking for someone who will train you one<br/>\n&gt; point in the language, and then get a friend, sit by a zone.  Whomever has<br/>\n&gt; learned the language begins by speaking while one sits on the ground<br/>\n&gt; listening.  When you have stopped improving, stand up and zone.  Then your<br/>\n&gt; friend sits down, and you speak in the language until your friend improves<br/>\n&gt; two points.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can do that simultaneously, you know? You can both talk to each<br/>\nother and you will both improve.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis should save you some time.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nQenelin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
