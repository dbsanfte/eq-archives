I have often been able to avoid certain<br/>\ndeath by outrunning a creature to a zone or to someone willing to help.  The<br/>\ntrick is the jump every once in a while when you do run.. that gives you an<br/>\nextra boost and allows you to stay out of the reach of the creature chasing<br/>\nyou.  If you do decide to run though, and you see some people you think may<br/>\nhelp you, make sure you shout out to warn them first, because training<br/>\nmonsters into people is not the way you want to go if you want to make<br/>\nfriends.<br/>\n<br/>\nTandayen, The Dark Elf Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;2. Never run after losing your sticks(warriors). The beast will catch<br/>\n&gt;   you anyways and all you will do is waste a couple hours looking<br/>\n&gt;   for your corpse cause it is not with the others. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
