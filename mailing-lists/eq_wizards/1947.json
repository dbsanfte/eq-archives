If they ask me what they<br/>\nshould buy first I tell them what I think, but I reiterate that they should<br/>\nalways buy all their spells.  Never let anyone tell you that some spell has<br/>\nno use.  The only time you should believe it is if you have experimented<br/>\nwith it enough to determine that for yourself.  Personally I think some<br/>\nspells are fairly useless, but it&#39;s only because I bought them all and tried<br/>\nto find something useful to do with them.  If you let someone else tell you<br/>\nthat something is useless, then it will condition you to not experiment, so<br/>\ndon&#39;t let that happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlways remember we are Wizards, seekers of knowledge and keepers of great<br/>\npower.  Seek to understand the spells you get and what they are for rather<br/>\nthan taking someone else&#39;s word for it.  I know that I don&#39;t have it all<br/>\nfigured out yet as I am only level 17, but I as I progress I will always try<br/>\neverything I can to make the most of the power and knowledge I receive.  I<br/>\nencourage you all to do the same.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Solric of the 5th circle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ken Lee [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kenlee@...\">kenlee@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 27, 1999 8:25 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_wizards] Spell Resistance - the reason<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Ken Lee&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kenlee@...\">kenlee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;advance in level, that most blue creatures will STILL be able to resists<br/>\n&gt;Force Shock.

I&#39;ve found that it works on pretty much anything<br/>\nthat cons blue. This includes, Emperor Crush, Ambassador Dvinn, a whole host<br/>\nof orcs, Crag spiders. Yeah I&#39;ve fizzled but never twice in a row. I&#39;ve had<br/>\nit resisted ONCE by a blue. I wouldn&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;m not casting it<br/>\nmore than once a fight anyways. Takes forever to be able to cast it again,<br/>\nand eats up a TON of mana. I wouldn&#39;t worry about other people&#39;s<br/>\nexperiences. Have your own, and take it from there. Like your mother said,<br/>\nif you friend jumped off the bridge you would have to as well? Seems to me<br/>\nit&#39;s all in perspective.
