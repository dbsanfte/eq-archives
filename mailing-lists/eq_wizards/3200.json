Stuff in E Karana, up to lvl 20, just<br/>\nbasically always ignored it.  Except the Chasm<br/>\nCrawlers.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Groups, my groups tend to have the critter dead in<br/>\n&gt; 5 seconds or less<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (orc camps) so the 15 rule wont help me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I had the same problem, so i just step in kinda<br/>\n&gt; close and guage off the HP<br/>\n&gt; bar...when it&#39;s ~1/8th down is generally a good time<br/>\n&gt; to start in on the<br/>\n&gt; critter...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It is definitely a feel thing.  Nuking slow is a<br/>\ntactic for a tank-heavy group which involves long<br/>\nfights. If I&#39;m in a caster heavy group, which takes<br/>\nthings down quickly, I&#39;ll generally just chain cast<br/>\nand keep my fingers crossed.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; And I always have Gate handy. So much better than<br/>\n&gt; Fade and Shadowstep!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Saved my life yesterday in the dervish camp.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; at your level shadowstep and then gate is a great<br/>\n&gt; escape method...i&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; found that when you hit the really high teens though<br/>\n&gt; that everythign moves<br/>\n&gt; really fast and shadow step doesn&#39;t help as much<br/>\n&gt; anymore...of course by<br/>\n&gt; then the mana you spend for root is trivial, so root<br/>\n&gt; and gate become a<br/>\n&gt; decently effective strat...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My experience has pretty much been opposite that.  If<br/>\nI&#39;m in a wide open area, Shadowstep/Gate is my only<br/>\nprayer for escape (course, it also makes corpse<br/>\nretrieval very frustrating).  Getting to higher levels<br/>\n(late teens) just meant that Channeling was higher, so<br/>\nGate is less likely to be interrupted when they do<br/>\ncatch up to me.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Stannis Starslyder<br/>\n&gt; Wizard of the Moon<br/>\n&gt; Innoruuk </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
