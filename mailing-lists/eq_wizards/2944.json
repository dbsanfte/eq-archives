At 44th level the necro does havea 500 point DD spell.  With casting<br/>\nand spell regeneration time  I am guessing that they can cast this spell<br/>\ntwice in 20 sec.  Dot attacks would be relatively useless as they may get<br/>\nabout 50% of the spell damage before the mob dies.  In roughly 20 seconds<br/>\nat these levels you can cast off about 4 Ice Shocks for 1250 damage total.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d say it was probably close in number every time.  However, wizards are<br/>\nsupposed to be able to deal the most damage in the shortest amount of time.<br/>\n Necromancers are MUCH more mana efficient than we are.  They can also do<br/>\nmore total damage than we can with their pool of mana, due to a DOTs high<br/>\nmana/damage ratio.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote, that I am not writing this to encourage wizards to KS from necros, or<br/>\nanyone else.  On the contrary I can&#39;t stand KSing myself and I am glad you<br/>\nwere able to keep your kills from the KSing Necro.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack, Knight Defender of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
