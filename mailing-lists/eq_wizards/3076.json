Go to Veeshan and visit Freeport on<br/>\na crowded night and you wont find 2 ppl of 10 that want to sell there stuff,<br/>\nonly trading. Money is worthles in EQ at higher level. Well some ppl say you<br/>\ncan invest it in a tradde skill, why the hell should I ?? the only trade<br/>\nskill worth the effort is jewelery and then you still only get more worthles<br/>\nmoney.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps money is worthless at higher levels, but will that last forever?<br/>\nWhen the game went live back in March, money was worthless to buy the best<br/>\nitems, too, because no one had many good items.  If you sold your rare item,<br/>\neven for a lot of money, you couldn&#39;t buy anything with the money, since<br/>\ngood items were too rare.   The higher levels who trade only for other items<br/>\nwith other high levels are doing so because those items are rare.  As time<br/>\ngoes on, there will be more and more high level players, and those &quot;rare&quot;<br/>\nitems will become not so rare.  Then people will sell them, if only to lower<br/>\nlevel people who have accumulated money. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
