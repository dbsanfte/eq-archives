I second that motion! :)  We need *something* to help out in <br/>\nsituations with large parties.  In such instances, it is most fun to plan a <br/>\nlarge assault on a tough creature... we gotta be able to contribute in some <br/>\nway.  I think your idea is great...a weak but reliable spell seems to be a <br/>\nreasonable compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\nForget the money and items....the best fun in EQ is taking out the named <br/>\nNPCs!  hehe. Dvinn and Dorn will fall many times before I will get sick of <br/>\nwatching them die.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;sniped from Solric&#39;s post&gt;<br/>\nNow I won&#39;t just cite a problem but also suggest a solution.  The solution<br/>\nis either to give us weak spells that cannot be resisted (the necros already<br/>\nhave one it&#39;s the lifetap series), make our DD spells less resisted, but do<br/>\nless damage against higher level creatures, or even better still give us<br/>\nsome utility spells (buffs?  damage shields?  spheres of protection?) that<br/>\ncan be cast on party members.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
