(for me anyways)  I bind people for 5 gold, unless they are very generous... sometimes they&#39;ll give me a plat.  (one occasion, a high level Ogre gave me 10 plat to bind him at HighHold)  But its the roleplaying.  I&#39;ve had lots of times where a low level character will asked to be bound...  I tell him that I will not bind him unless he can pay.  He says that he has 20 copper..  and offers 6 or 7 of it.  ..and even though, at level 16.. a few copper is trivial.  I&#39;ll accept it, and bind him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s something that I did the other day at West Gate...<br/>\n\tI was sitting there, medding.  My clan was having a guildwar with another clan at the time, and I had little time between skirmishes.  Someone pleaded for a bind.  I offered my services, if they were a paying customer.  He said that he had a few gold.. but he was trying to save up to buy himself a weapon.  I checked his level...  (thank you everyone who plays with anon off)  ...and found out that he was a level 3 monk.  My guild had been saving up pelts for our tailors/smiths in outfitting the entire clan with an extra set of armor.  So I asked the monk if he would be willing to perform a task for me...  in exchange for the bind.  He was very excited about it.  (for some reason..  people like quests. heh)  So I told him to get me 2 wolf pelts.  He said ok..  I grouped with him, and went ahead and bound him.  then I ran off and continued my war.  Later on..   maybe 30 min later.. I was back at west gate medding.  He came up to me and handed me 2 pelts.  It was a cool roleplayi!<br/>\nng experience.  So..  it doesn&#39;t take much.  But I think the main reason to charge for binding is to roleplay.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course.. if you dont like roleplaying..   then you dont charge anyway.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust MHO.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrev<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tMarziani, Michael D.[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Marziani@...\">Michael.Marziani@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tTuesday, May 11, 1999 1:16 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: \tRe: [eq_wizards] Charging for Services<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Marziani, Michael D.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Marziani@...\">Michael.Marziani@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Disclaimer: this is only my opinion so no flames please.  I am only hoping<br/>\n&gt; to elicit some other opinions on this subject as well.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know why but it has never made sense to me to charge for services<br/>\n&gt; such as binding, invis, and language training.  Perhaps it is just the<br/>\n&gt; personality of my character that he enjoys helping others and gets full<br/>\n&gt; satisfaction out of the good deed itself, not needing any sort of physical<br/>\n&gt; compensation.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I realize that I will be able to make make up to a plat or more each per<br/>\n&gt; bind and a plat or more for invis (depending on how bad they want it) but<br/>\n&gt; that just seems unkind.  I remember when I was level 8 just travelling over<br/>\n&gt; to freeport.  I only had a couple of my new 3rd circle spells because they<br/>\n&gt; were so expensive and I was flat broke.  I saw people auctioning: &quot;Binding<br/>\n&gt; at S. Gate, 15gp&quot;, and there was no way i could afford that without selling<br/>\n&gt; the few pieces of cloth armor i had left.  I was lucky to find a kind druid<br/>\n&gt; that bound me and asked for nothing in return, but I just wonder why so many<br/>\n&gt; seek to earn a profit from their abilities rather than just use them to help<br/>\n&gt; others and take joy in that.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I guess it is just based on your roleplaying style, but even if I have no<br/>\n&gt; money and still have spells to buy, I would not ask for or accept any sort<br/>\n&gt; of payment for using my talents.  Does anyone else agree with me or do you<br/>\n&gt; all think that you SHOULD rightfully earn a profit from using your skills?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; -Solric<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Ken Morris [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kmorris2@...\">kmorris2@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, May 11, 1999 2:30 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: EQ Wizards<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eq_wizards] Languages<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am excellent in Dragon, Combine, Old Eurdian, Elder Elvish, and am working<br/>\n&gt; on Elder Tier&#39;Dal today.
