I have all the RANK 2 spells except Glimpse and I need a <br/>\ngood way to kill things as I am getting nowhere towards my next level (Level <br/>\n7).  I currently reside in Qeynos (Human), and I am looking for some way to <br/>\nget to Level 7 without getting slain by Holly Crosstree or whatever her name <br/>\nis.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also looking to learn some new languages but it&#39;s hard to do as I have <br/>\nnone to trade in return.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for those of you are confused, what is thr &quot;Root and Shoot&quot; strategy?<br/>\n<br/>\n(The strategy I use sometimes is to cast Root then Icestrike, back away, and <br/>\nwatch the enemy get pelted, then finish them with my staff when Icestrike or <br/>\nRoot ends.)<br/>\n<br/>\nRaestlin (Raistlin was taken, OK?)<br/>\nLevel 6 Human Wizard<br/>\nTunare Server (*SNIFF* I miss Veeshan!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
