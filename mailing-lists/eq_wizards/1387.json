(not to mention some other magic users)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy comment wich i post under other tread i repeat it so to try to<br/>\nexplain it<br/>\nbetter and not to multyoly treads on same subject.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my first post i don&#39;t explained it good so i try to explain it<br/>\nbetter. <br/>\nI like to play a wizard as i play wizards in all games for more than 12<br/>\nyears now, but if we talk about balancing all magic users to same lv<br/>\nthen i<br/>\nsee some problems with� a wizard class, i wish to see your comments on<br/>\nthis<br/>\nand other ideas to make a game more playable without throwing a balance<br/>\nout<br/>\nor tring to make a overpowerfull class.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst positive things<br/>\n<br/>\n-� wizards are great for plane(after 34+ lv), group travel (druid is<br/>\nbest<br/>\nin individual and nearly as good in group)<br/>\n-� wizards are best in DD damage spells (but not in damage to mana ratio<br/>\nDOT)<br/>\n-� wizards spells are less resisted and it damage at last for one part<br/>\nmoust other class spells are resisted full<br/>\n-� wizard is fastest to deal a massive damage in shortest time (but a<br/>\nprice?)<br/>\n<br/>\nNegativ things<br/>\n<br/>\n- Wizards have lowest defence, hit points and ac of all classes (lowest<br/>\ncombat survivel)<br/>\n- wizard spells do massive damage but also use masive mana but when<br/>\nwizard<br/>\nuses it mana it is useless. Fighting is not a wizard strong side, wizard<br/>\ndont have pets, dont have buffs, dont heal, they dont run well.<br/>\n- Wizards risks very very much in combat agains only 2 blues<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst i don&#39;t wish to say that a wizard is not good or playable class it<br/>\nis<br/>\nnice but it is also a class with most downtime of all clases so as a<br/>\nresult<br/>\na 2 equaly expert people playing sametime will never get equal play<br/>\ntime,<br/>\nwizard will most time be in his book. Why this hmm lets see<br/>\n<br/>\nAll other Magic users have better mana usage then wizard, why pet is a<br/>\nbest<br/>\nmana use it damages, it defend, it tount and it never expires until it<br/>\ndies<br/>\n( i personaly dont like this pets i wish to have a cat or dog od mouse<br/>\n:-)<br/>\nnot for combat but as familiar ) . Buffs as result do more damage and<br/>\nDOT<br/>\nspells are much more mana efficent then our DD spells. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what can be done to make a wizard a time efficent to play as other<br/>\nclasses are. I suggest a faster mana recovering ratio not too much but a<br/>\n1.3 or 1.2 faster times can help and its easy to implement one number<br/>\nchange in formula and go go go.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere i dont put in effect of specialization as for now it is not in game<br/>\n(<br/>\nlong beta ) and i dont know if in later levels exist any only wizard<br/>\nmana<br/>\nregeneration booster but i heared of &quot;mana stone&quot; but noone knows what<br/>\nit<br/>\nis and when you find it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all for reading and as i live in italy my english is not maxed<br/>\nyet,<br/>\nbut i please you to join a discussion and to not take to hard my<br/>\nspelling<br/>\nmistakes. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSilverion<br/>\nHigh elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\nmoderator<br/>\n<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nHaving difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members? <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nTry ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
