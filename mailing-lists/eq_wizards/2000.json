I must say that force shock and enstill are<br/>\nthe only two spells i use regularly on blues and greens that get resisted<br/>\nregularly (this is seperate from the resists we get on reds which is another<br/>\nissue altogether).  so maybe it&#39;s not a resist issue, but more of a crappy<br/>\nspell issue.<br/>\n<br/>\na funny note: i was in guk with a lvl 22 shadowknight last week, and i was<br/>\ncomplaining about force shock getting resisted (yeah, he was about sick of<br/>\nmy ranting but i had to rant to somebody).  well, we got tired of the<br/>\nfroglock tad in the entrance (lvl 3ish i guess) that was healing the<br/>\nmonsters we were pulling, so we decided to end his healing expedition.<br/>\nafter we hit him once he started to run and the sk cast a spell on the<br/>\ntad....  low and behold, THE TAD RESISTED.  yes, a lvl 3ish tad resisted a<br/>\nlvl 22 sk spell.  hahaha. im sure u dont have to guess who was complaining<br/>\nabout resists the rest of the evening (believe me, i didnt say a word after<br/>\nthat little incident)!<br/>\n<br/>\nmaybe we dont have it so bad after all ????<br/>\n<br/>\nSinlaru Ce`alen<br/>\nRallos Zek<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: Mike Hoida &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mhoida@...\">mhoida@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Date: Thursday, May 27, 1999 3:05 PM<br/>\n    Subject: Re: [eq_wizards] Lets Agree to Disagree..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    that sounds good,  but I think we need to bring up the resist spells<br/>\nbug,  in a small party to medium party, there is no problem,  but in a party<br/>\nof 6, you take on high red mob&#39;s,  and all the other class can contribute to<br/>\nthe party in some way even if there spells can not effect the mob,  but the<br/>\nwizard class is left standing there with nothing to help out the party.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Edywen<br/>\n    Xegony<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">         ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n        From: Ken Morrison<br/>\n        To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n        Sent: Thursday, May 27, 1999 12:58 PM<br/>\n        Subject: [eq_wizards] Lets Agree to Disagree..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Okay, before the Verant text thing, I posted that we should and try<br/>\nto get one (1) thing changed.  Then people posted they wanted a ton of stuff<br/>\nto change.  Then I posted a ton of stuff and now they are saying post only<br/>\na couple of things....rrrr.<br/>\n<br/>\n        Actually, we sound just like a bunch of bickering Wizards, heh, I<br/>\ncan just picture us all in a dimly lit lecturing hall, trying to figure out<br/>\nhow to best approach the Master Wizard and tell him his spells suck, while<br/>\ntrying to second guess which way he will turn us into ash after we do. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n        Anyway, if we cant come together here, lets at least start sending<br/>\nVerant SOMETHING.  Seran is right, I just read on eq.stratics.com that they<br/>\nare working on Specialization and it should be implemented in a couple of<br/>\nweeks.  So no use bugging them for that.<br/>\n<br/>\n        If we are only going for a couple of things I would go for :<br/>\n<br/>\n        Meditate Skill cap of 7 rather than 5 - reason:  Hey, come on, they<br/>\ntook away 2 points from our combat abilities, at least they could give it<br/>\nback to us for mana, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n        Line of Sight Fade and Shadowstep spells with set minimum<br/>\ndistances - reason: Well, I came up with it originally (ahem, blush) and it<br/>\nwould serve a dual purpose of being a good escape spell and help with lower<br/>\nlevel travel, both of which are things we Wizards could desperately use.<br/>\n<br/>\n        Now, what do you all think...<br/>\n<br/>\n        Alhassim, 12th(yeah!)
