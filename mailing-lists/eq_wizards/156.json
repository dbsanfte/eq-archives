At 20th lvl, I&#39;m doing 171 dmg that also has a chance to stun the creature.  The clerics don&#39;t get their next Undead DD spell until 24th, so they are only doing 90+ dmg at 20th.  At 24th they will be doing close to 200, but the wizard&#39;s DD spell with be doing at least that much.<br/>\n<br/>\n *Major Spoiler*  At 49thh lvl, the wizards get a DD spell that does 1100 dmg!!!!  No other class can come close to that amount of dmg ;)  Gives ya something to look forward to ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nTalarin High Elven Wizard<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patrick.waal@...\">patrick.waal@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, April 18, 1999 3:01 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [eq_wizards] --==SPOILER==-- Well Wizards might get powerful but at lev 14 the y are still weak<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hail Fellow Wizards <br/>\n<br/>\n  My name is Oonagh i play on the E&#39;ci server <br/>\n<br/>\n  I am a devouted Wizard.. Don&#39;t get me wrong , but as a reply to Greg (Kronan) <br/>\n  I would say: <br/>\n<br/>\n  All caster class can do as much damage as a wizard until lev 15 at least (I am only 14 ) <br/>\n<br/>\n  Magicians does in the mid 70 dam with their spell DirectDam spell <br/>\n  Clerics do the same <br/>\n  Necros i don&#39;t know about, but think they do about mid 70 as well <br/>\n  Wizards does 80dam per DD spell <br/>\n  At 16 you do about 100 dam as your DD spell <br/>\n<br/>\n  So you would not see your class shine until higher lev.. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Perhaps 20.. I don&#39;t know but i heard the DD Wizard spell did 200dam there.. offcourse the Cleric undead spell at that lev does  close to 200 dam as well.. But thats just against undeads.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am 14th lev now and all the other casters i meet do just as much damage as me and have much more nicer utility spell like pets. buffs/debuffs etc..<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am in need of another player to really get xp (or actually any xp at all without the danger of dying or zoning to save my butt on every mob i attack).. wheras the magics and necros etc can solo perfectly alone..<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am sure the reward will be GREAT, BUT it will come at a later level than 14, believe me. <br/>\n  maybe 20 maybe higher. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Hang in there fellow Wizard, we WILL rule the world *snicker* <br/>\n<br/>\n  Oonagh the Gnome Wizard </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
