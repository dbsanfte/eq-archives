Until then you must melee.  So my <br/>\n&gt;question stands what weapon is best?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; oh and about the making money issue: sometimes your lucky. I was at <br/>\n&gt;the dervish camp in Northern Ro on Fennin Ro and for some reason for <br/>\n&gt;about 6 turns every derv that was on my turn had a BRONZE weapon! i <br/>\n&gt;got 3 bronze rapiers! (3pp per rapier) i made 30pp in two hours !<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am truely happy for you.  However, I went to NRO (with my bard I <br/>\n&gt;will take Guile soon) and was squished twice fortunately exp loss is <br/>\n&gt;inversely proportional to the creature level that kills you so other <br/>\n&gt;than leaving an ugly mark there was no big problem with it.  On the <br/>\n&gt;issue of luck, I have received 2 bronze weapons in all my time in NRO <br/>\n&gt;and 1 or 2 gems.  How much time have I spent there you ask?  I have 5 <br/>\n&gt;thats FIVE backpacks in the bank filled with derv rings that I cannot <br/>\n&gt;pay people to take FROM me!  So please don&#39;t tell me about LUCKY ways <br/>\n&gt;to make money.  I need real advice on tried and true ways to earn <br/>\n&gt;money to equip my character.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;=====================================================================<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Richard A.
