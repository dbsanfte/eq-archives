Because they know that i can do a bunch of damage if the thing<br/>\ngoes<br/>\nweird in a dungeon for exemple .<br/>\nAt my level they prefer group with a wizard who can do 250 dmg fast <br/>\nrather than with a magician who does like 150 with a pitfull Pet or <br/>\nand Enchanter .<br/>\nwhen the Mobs can hit at 80 per shot i tell you that they want it dead<br/>\nfast .<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a storie a friend in a full group wanted to kill a Steel Golem<br/>\na level 35sh mob . To do it they kicked away a level 30 warrior do let<br/>\nme in<br/>\nto help . That s what i call power . so dont say i m useless :p<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHanidus <br/>\nLevel 30 wizard on Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
