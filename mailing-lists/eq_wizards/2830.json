I&#39;m only level<br/>\n25 and I can believe that the quest is designed to be much, much higher than<br/>\nthat but, I wan&#39;t to know what is needed, so I can begin to look now. And if<br/>\nit&#39;s item related, I have the cash to purchase those items from people who<br/>\nmight not know any better.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird,<br/>\nI am still trying to get the Council of Wizardry started on Karana, but<br/>\nthere doesn&#39;t seem to be enough people to make it. I really need help on<br/>\nthis. Should I conform and make it the *Council of Magi and open it to all<br/>\nfour mage classes?<br/>\nI&#39;ve been in a few guilds and none so far concentrated on roleplay, player<br/>\ndriven quests, and helping each other quest for adnventure/knowledge/items.<br/>\n(So that is why I&#39;ve been in a few guilds. A collection of people isn&#39;t<br/>\nenough for this wizard.) Those of you on Karana or know some other mage<br/>\nclasses on Karana who might be interested or could offer some advice, please<br/>\ndrop me a line...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*or Council of Roke (if you&#39;re familiar with the Wizard of Earthsea books)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nTelor Strifesage - Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
