One thing I have noticed<br/>\n&gt; is that everything happens in batches.  I&#39;ll go 20 minutes without a<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My stance on this is that they probably changed their random number<br/>\ngenerators. I get more &quot;consistent&quot; fizzles and partial resists these days.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; same type of mob.  Another example is that my skills won&#39;t increases and<br/>\n&gt; then I&#39;ll get 2 skill increases back to back.5)  One other thing to keep in<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They increase pretty regularly for me. I always get 2 increase in meditation<br/>\non the next meditation after a level increase, and typically maximise<br/>\nchanelling and meditation within 15mn of my next level... unless I die first :)<br/>\nOffense and defense get maxed during the level, but I&#39;m falling behind<br/>\nin the weapon-specific skills :(<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think you can advance you throwing skills on /con greens. Can anyone<br/>\n&gt; confirm or deny this.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can confirm. My monk friend got twice combat skills increases on green<br/>\nmonsters, and no experience from these (as opposed from the rare green<br/>\nmonster that still yields experience).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Very good tip, and its true.  I&#39;ve checked it out myself<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Got killed by Lord Shin Ree yesterday. Lost 1/3rd of bubble. I had<br/>\nregagned it when three blue Orc centurions jumped me (at 1 pixel of 11th<br/>\nlevel). I had a little over a half bubble to regain that time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve purchased some netted the other day (cape, pants, shawl) and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t see any weight or AC advantage over cloth.  Is there any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; benefit to netted and, if not, what should I be buying?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s lighter, and its free.  Also you can sell the gloves to monks for a<br/>\n&gt; hefty profit.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Depends. If you are able to wear small size, it&#39;s the same weight. Pants<br/>\nare lighter, most aren&#39;t (shameless plug: go check my EQ treasure chest<br/>\nat <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.frmug.org/eqchest/,\">http://www.frmug.org/eqchest/,</a> which lists all one can use and usually<br/>\nwhere to find it).
