Then people posted they wanted a ton of stuff to change.  Then I posted a ton of stuff and now they are saying post only  a couple of things....rrrr.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, we sound just like a bunch of bickering Wizards, heh, I can just picture us all in a dimly lit lecturing hall, trying to figure out how to best approach the Master Wizard and tell him his spells suck, while trying to second guess which way he will turn us into ash after we do. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, if we cant come together here, lets at least start sending Verant SOMETHING.  Seran is right, I just read on eq.stratics.com that they are working on Specialization and it should be implemented in a couple of weeks.  So no use bugging them for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we are only going for a couple of things I would go for :<br/>\n<br/>\nMeditate Skill cap of 7 rather than 5 - reason:  Hey, come on, they took away 2 points from our combat abilities, at least they could give it back to us for mana, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nLine of Sight Fade and Shadowstep spells with set minimum distances - reason: Well, I came up with it originally (ahem, blush) and it would serve a dual purpose of being a good escape spell and help with lower level travel, both of which are things we Wizards could desperately use.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, what do you all think...<br/>\n<br/>\nAlhassim, 12th(yeah!) Level Erudite Wizard of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
