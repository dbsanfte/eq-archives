Kinda like how you would <br/>\nplay a single-player game where you kill the big baddie and win a prize a la <br/>\nZelda heh.  It still gives you the sense of acheivement and it will satisfy <br/>\nthose who need the items....you get it and you move on!  (one would <br/>\nhope....) :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHey! by the way, Cazic is a great spot for those in their 20&#39;s.  I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhang around without a group though...but if you&#39;re in a solid group you <br/>\ncan&#39;t beat the xp there.  I average 2 to 3 bubs of xp a night not to mention <br/>\npulling in near 100pp everytime I get back to town.  Heheh...last night I <br/>\nwas so encumbered poor Lim had to nearly crawl into town.
