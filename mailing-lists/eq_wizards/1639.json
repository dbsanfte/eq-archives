Tox Forest (across bridge) hunting Kobolds and Skellies.  If you find a<br/>\n&gt; Ranger to help, you can actually level fast, otherwise you&#39;ll be camping at<br/>\n&gt; the Kobold camps and fighting for kills, or wandering and hoping to find<br/>\n&gt; something.  Unless they changed the spawn rates since I was there several<br/>\n&gt; weeks ago, this can be slow compared to other newbie areas.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2. Kerra Isle.  Level 6 is (IMO) about the time you can start venturing here<br/>\n&gt; but need a good group to do well.  Usually there is a lack of tanks in this<br/>\n&gt; area of the world which makes this place more difficult than it should be.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3. N. Qeynos then Qeynos Hills  -  I stayed on Odus for a long time before I<br/>\n&gt; ventured across the ocean to Antonica.  When I finally did, my jaw DROPPED<br/>\n&gt; at the site of N. Qeynos newbie area.  There were kills as far as you could<br/>\n&gt; see since it is flat and practically treeless.  I was so amazed at how much<br/>\n&gt; easier it would have been to level here never having to &#39;search&#39; for kills<br/>\n&gt; like Tox Forest.  Even with the increased population, the ratio of animals<br/>\n&gt; was still MUCH higher than Tox.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 4. Erud&#39;s Crossing  -  Once you get over 10, you can start to consider<br/>\n&gt; stopping at the Isle in Erud&#39;s Crossing and hunt Wisps and Spiders.  This<br/>\n&gt; island can be a little dangerous but you can make a TON of money here<br/>\n&gt; getting Greater Lightstones.  This place is definitely Wisp Heaven!!  I made<br/>\n&gt; a ton of money here in my low teens and have been way ahead of the money<br/>\n&gt; game ever since.  I recommend grouping here like most places.  Spiders have<br/>\n&gt; nasty poison so beware picking fights.  I can give more strategies on this<br/>\n&gt; place but I&#39;ll shut up now ))<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Draco - Wizard 20 - Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:   Bryan Hinkel [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bjhinkel@...\">bjhinkel@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Subject:        Re: [eq_wizards] Off Topic!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Serious Question?
