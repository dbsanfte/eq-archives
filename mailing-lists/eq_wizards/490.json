Take the same<br/>\nsituation with 2 12th level characters and 1 50th level cleric. All are in<br/>\nthe same guild and the cleric wants to help them level up. The 2 warriors<br/>\nare joined but the cleric is not. The fighters jump the wooly�mammoth and<br/>\ncan actually hit it(which surprised me but if you said you were killing it<br/>\nthen your warriors were obviously able to hit it). They are� pounding on it<br/>\nbut are getting beat down rather quickly and have no real chance of killing<br/>\nthe hairy beast so the cleric jumps in a casts one of his low level heal<br/>\nspells and all of his buffs(which at 50th level are quite impressive and<br/>\nmake even�a 12th level character a worthy opponent). Now that they are both<br/>\nhealed and buffed they continue the fight. But even with these buffs they<br/>\nstill are getting beat down so the cleric heals them up again(even if the<br/>\ncritter turns on the cleric for healing them he will just sit there because<br/>\nthe mammoth has little to no chance of actually hurting him significantly).<br/>\nHe continues to heal them until they finally manage to beat the mammoth<br/>\ndown. Now the cleric didn&#39;t do any damage to it so he won&#39;t get any exp but<br/>\nthe two warriors who are grouped up do. And with the level difference<br/>\nbetween them and the critter they gain an exorbitant amout of experience,<br/>\nmuch more than what they actually earned considering they had a max level<br/>\ncharacter helping them. That is why they implemented it like this, to avoid<br/>\nthis type of situation.<br/>\n�<br/>\nYou may say this would never happen but I have already seen it on my server.<br/>\nNot only this type but also the &quot;twinking&quot; of guilds and friends. Granted<br/>\nthere aren&#39;t any 50th level characters yet but there are 30th level clerics<br/>\nand such wandering around in guilds. Anyway that is my opinion on the<br/>\nsituation.<br/>\n�<br/>\nYours,<br/>\n�<br/>\n~Aereuss Ravins of Tarew Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Gooey Smalls [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smullins@...\">smullins@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, April 23, 1999 7:20 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Linear game play<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n��� Were you aware that the game of EverQuest is linear game play,<br/>\nreminiscent of the console RPG&#39;s and single player RPG&#39;s of yore.� &quot;But you<br/>\ncan go anywhere&quot;, you say, well my friend here&#39;s how you are wrong.� Two<br/>\ngroups of 6 formed last night to try to take down a Wolly Mammoth (not a<br/>\ncalf but a full blown lvl 20+ 1000 HP 50 damage a hit and 2 hits a round<br/>\nmammoth).� Which surprisingly we accomplished this feat with noone over lvl<br/>\n12 in either of the two groups on the Bertoxxulous server.� When the great<br/>\nbeast fell noone earned any EXP or could loot the body.� 20 or so peitions<br/>\nwere sent and 2 GM&#39;s showed up, one to help and one to show off his awesome<br/>\nequipment and levitate there like a pimp.� Basically if a creature is more<br/>\nthan 2 times you lvl you get no EXP even if you kill it fairly, to prevent<br/>\nexploits and trapping monsters behind rocks.� We later demonstrated for the<br/>\nGM&#39;s by killing another Mammoth, this time we only lost 1 warrior (the first<br/>\ntime it was 5).� Now they claim it is partly a design flaw and partly a bug<br/>\nwithin the game...now my question to you is, do you like being told what is<br/>\ntoo strong for you to possibly kill and therefore you get no EXP?� I know I<br/>\ndon&#39;t care if it&#39;s god and 100 lvl 1&#39;s killed the god of hate...i want the<br/>\nexp.� I suggest everyone petition and use the feedback option to complain to<br/>\nverant about this.� This is a total contradiction of what they claim the<br/>\ngame is about (you know how hard it is to convince ppl we can kill a<br/>\nmammoth?) and what was our reward? nothing...this is a tragedy...i&#39;m about<br/>\nto go Colorado on some fools...!<br/>\n�<br/>\nTeferi level 12 wizard Bertoxxulous server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
