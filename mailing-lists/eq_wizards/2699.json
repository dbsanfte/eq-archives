I<br/>\ndon t receive more then 1 list all 2 days now :(<br/>\nCome an guys, we need to wake up ! :)<br/>\nOn another point, i just read the new patch message.. Damn.... From the<br/>\nbegining, nothing as been change for the wizzards... They just change during<br/>\nthe patch , the casting time . I have tested BEFORE and after : no change<br/>\n(that a clock can see, so it s surely a change of let s say 0,001 second or<br/>\nsomething like that.In other words : nothing.<br/>\nAll patch just power up the race... Now the druid dot spel are fast like<br/>\nhell, necro same. And us ?? From the beginning, we have major bug who are<br/>\nnot resolved and they do nothing for us...<br/>\nForce shock is bugged cause he is resisted too much (and i am ok that he get<br/>\nresisted so much IF he stun like he must do). The enstill spel doesn&#39;t work<br/>\n(i have tested with root : root is 10 times more effective). I am a playing<br/>\na shaman and i think i will stop my wizzard... We have nothing funny : we<br/>\njust level and wait for what ? Our dd spel nothing more, no buf, no pet, no<br/>\nlife tap, no shield,no dot, no sow, nothing cool except some gate spel...<br/>\nThat s so boring.. For solo from level 8 to 50 you root nuke nuke root nuke<br/>\nnuke dead... Wow that s pretty funny :( :( :(.<br/>\nWhat about our ae spel ? and pe spel ?? Did someone here use them ????<br/>\nNOBODY...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo guys, we were talking some weeks ago to petition.. Nothing has be done or<br/>\nyou just don t send the letter ???<br/>\n<br/>\nSee you on karana<br/>\nyakos level 25 wizzard AND dabou level 13 shaman<br/>\n(playtime for wizzard : 20 days, for shaman , 2 days....)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
