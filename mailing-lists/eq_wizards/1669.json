Play the game yourself and<br/>\n&gt;do your thing. It&#39;s kind of painfull to get a 30 day suspension. If you<br/>\n&gt;really want to do harm to someone look for the people exploiting bugs and<br/>\n&gt;stuff like that not some tiny little thing like tweaking their characters<br/>\n&gt;and you never know she might have had something happen to her like for<br/>\n&gt;example a friend of mine refused to pay a toll in freeport and the guard<br/>\n&gt;attacked him so he killed the guard now he can&#39;t walk into freeport because<br/>\n&gt;the guards kill him so he made a new character and transfered all his stuff<br/>\n&gt;to his new character. Find things out or just mind your own buisness before<br/>\n&gt;messing up a persons gaming.
