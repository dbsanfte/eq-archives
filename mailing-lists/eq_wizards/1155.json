This would go along with the items carried by the bandit <br/>\nsisters in Lesser Faydark. They sometimes have pearl necklaces, non-magical <br/>\nbut are listed as lore items. These necklaces also disappear if you already <br/>\nhave one in your inventory. Could we draw the conclusion that all lore items<br/>\n<br/>\nare considered to be &quot;unique&quot; for any given PC?<br/>\n<br/>\nVash, 11th Level Wizardess, Felwithe, E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
