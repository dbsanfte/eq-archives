Frogloks have netted armor, which is exactly the same as<br/>\n&gt;&gt;cloth, but as light or lighter as small sizes - thus you can scrap 1 or<br/>\n&gt;&gt;2 units of weight. Probably not worth the bother. It wasn&#39;t for me: I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;&gt;high elf, and thus able to wear small size.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;After this, you must relocate to Freeport. Woven armor is gotten out of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Frogloks too, but you must go down to the Innothule Swamp and their home<br/>\n&gt;&gt;of Upper Guk for this.
