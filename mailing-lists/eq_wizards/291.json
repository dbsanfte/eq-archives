When you get to lvl 20 you get your first group teleport spell. :)","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-171919279\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; I think that the wizard becomes much more powerful at higher levels.<br/>\n&gt; Up until level 8 you&#39;re very weak.  After that it gets a little<br/>\n&gt; better, and at level 12 you really start to become impressive.  My<br/>\n&gt; advice is to stick with it, continue to grow and explore.  At level 12<br/>\n&gt; you get &quot;Bind Affinity&quot;, which makes travelling around a lot easier.<br/>\n&gt; You will get high damage spells which cast faster and easier as you<br/>\n&gt; advance.  As soon as you pass that mark, you&#39;ll be able to deal<br/>\n&gt; 300-400 hitpoints of damage in a few seconds.  At level 20 you&#39;ll be<br/>\n&gt; able to teleport to certain locations, and if I am not mistaken,<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ll be able to gate your party members.<br/>\n&gt; Stick with the wizard for now.  Before you know it, you will have a<br/>\n&gt; very powerful character that many people will want to have in their<br/>\n&gt; party.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When you get to lvl 20 you get your first group teleport spell. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Aznyin, level 10 Erudite Wizard<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Tired of empty chat rooms and out of date bulletin boards?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ONElist: Making the Internet Intimate </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
