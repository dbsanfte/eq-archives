The first 9 levels went<br/>\nvery quickly. I was one of the first Wizards in my area and on my servers to<br/>\nget to 9th. Now I am finding it very difficult to get past lvl 10. I seem to<br/>\ndie every time I am on whether grouped or solo. I almost never can get my<br/>\ngate spell off in time to get out of trouble.  I do not want to resort to<br/>\nKill Stealing (this is very easy for a wizard)<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have advice on how to advance faster. And combinations of spells<br/>\nto use when solo or in a group. I know there are not many options but I am<br/>\nhoping I have missed something and someone can help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mostly adventure right now with a friend (11th level ranger) in Crushbone.<br/>\nHe seems to be sucking up most of the experience.(even when we were at the<br/>\nsame level.
