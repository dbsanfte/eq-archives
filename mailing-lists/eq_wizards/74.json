Whenever you are engaged in battle, wether you think you can win<br/>\n   or not, always type /loc before or during battle. That way when<br/>\n   or if you die you can scroll up in the chat window and get a <br/>\n   general idea asto where your corpse is.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Never run after losing your sticks(warriors). The beast will catch<br/>\n   you anyways and all you will do is waste a couple hours looking<br/>\n   for your corpse cause it is not with the others.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Before you train up from leveling. Make sure you have researched<br/>\n   what skills you will really need for the next level.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHope these help.
