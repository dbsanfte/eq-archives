I&#39;m not even at level<br/>\n16 yet but i&#39;ll tell you that those spells are incredible. now there are two<br/>\ntypes of wizard spells. Bolt spells and Shock spells. Bolts do more damage<br/>\nbut they MUST have a clear path to the target. if they hit anything in<br/>\nbetween they stop. Shock spells are generally weaker but hit the target<br/>\ninstantly. Both can be useful. i still use Fire Bolt (lvl 8 spell) when the<br/>\ntarget is far away because that gives me time to cast root before the target<br/>\ngets hit. Now that i&#39;ve talked about spells let me give you advice for<br/>\nhunting.<br/>\n<br/>\nlevels 1-8 or 9 (to be safe) you want to stay in Nektulos forest and East<br/>\ncommons. at level 8 or 9 you&#39;re ready to go to the place that you&#39;ll<br/>\nprobably be in for at least 3 - 4 levels. the Desert of Ro. North Ro is the<br/>\neasiest place in the desert. in between Northern and Southern Ro is the<br/>\nOasis or Marr. that is a pretty hard zone and has some powerful monsters. I<br/>\nstill spend a lot of time in Ro and i&#39;m 15.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that&#39;s about it. i&#39;m sure once you realize how good the exp is in Ro<br/>\nyou&#39;ll stay for a while then start exploring, maybe going to Felwithe (if<br/>\nyou can stay invis long enough to get to the docks in freeport.<br/>\n<br/>\ngood luck on your new character!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nArtannis<br/>\nLevel 15 Wizard<br/>\nErudite<br/>\n(i used to have a Dark Elf so I DO know what i&#39;m talking about!)<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CyanLeVey@...\">CyanLeVey@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CyanLeVey@...\">CyanLeVey@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_wizards@onelist.com\">EQ_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_wizards@onelist.com\">EQ_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_wizards_eq@onelist.com\">EQ_wizards_eq@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_wizards_eq@onelist.com\">EQ_wizards_eq@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, May 17, 1999 10:02 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Advice<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CyanLeVey@...\">CyanLeVey@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hello all, I`ve just started a new wizard, after decided that my old<br/>\n&gt;character wasnt fulfilling enough for me...I am a DarkElf on the E`Ci<br/>\n </span></blockquote>server,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;at level 3 right now....any advice for me through the ranks?
