With this in mind I seriously<br/>\n&gt; doubt they would &quot;neuter&quot; the wizard class or make any changes at all<br/>\n&gt; without serious forethought.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But I do think we might see these kind of downgrades (along with<br/>\n&gt; upgrades) pretty often.  MUDs do this all the time, and EQ is<br/>\n&gt; a lot like a MUD.  Verant seems to pay much closer attention to game<br/>\n&gt; balance than UO ever did, thats a good thing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With all that said, my guess is that if they do lower the high-<br/>\n&gt; end wizard damage, then they&#39;ll give wizards something else to<br/>\n&gt; make up for it.  I have to admit the kill-stealing thing is a<br/>\n&gt; valid complaint - it IS easy for wizards to steal kills.  But<br/>\n&gt; looking at the evidence so far, having played in beta, I&#39;d say<br/>\n&gt; Verant knows what they&#39;re doing and I trust them not to screw<br/>\n&gt; us over.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
