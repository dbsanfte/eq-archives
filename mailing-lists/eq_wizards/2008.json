Now, as<br/>\n </span></blockquote>wizards we are masters of transportation, and we do this through<br/>\nmanipulation of space and time (unlike those strange druids who pray to<br/>\ntheir god and hope he or she drops them off in the right place).<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;I could see phase coming into action around level 12; high enough so it<br/>\n </span></blockquote>doesn&#39;t become unbalancing, low enough to give players a taste of<br/>\nteleportation.  Summon, somewhere between 20 and 29.  Summon can and should<br/>\nbe able to be cast on another during combat, the little &quot;do you wish to be<br/>\nsummoned Y/N&quot; box should be more then enough of a pain so you can&#39;t just<br/>\nhave someone sit a little bit back and pull off people who are next to<br/>\ndeath.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;I wouldn&#39;t expect to see the greater summon or phase spell to come in much<br/>\n </span></blockquote>later, perhaps a little something for us for the expasion pack, like a level<br/>\n59 spell or something.  You have to have been in the same zone to group up<br/>\nwith the person after all.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;I doubt we would really see group gate abused as someone said it would, woe<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to the wizard to binds himself in a dragons lair and dies with his party.<br/>\nPersonally, since evacuate spells drop you and your party off somewhere else<br/>\nwhen things get nasty, the only difference is that you don&#39;t have to walk as<br/>\nfar to get back to where you want to be.  Plus, as it stands now wizards<br/>\ncan&#39;t hurt monsters 6 levels above them, a caster heavy party gets worked by<br/>\nhigh level monsters, while a tank heavy party with a goodly number of<br/>\nhealers does just fine against very high level mobs.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;As for a haste spell, lets make it a bit more &quot;fun&quot;.  Let&#39;s do exactly what<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Verrant doesn&#39;t want us to do, make Norrath smaller.  Well, actually make us<br/>\nbigger, it&#39;s all relative.  I humbly present:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Fastus&#39; Spatial Warp (Fastus&#39; optional of course, just a little bit of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>egoism, hey, we all want to have a spell named after us right?) - Doubles<br/>\nyour size, and because of this self only increase in size, your speed is<br/>\nincreased, you get 50 strength, and you eat eight times as much.  Imagine<br/>\ngnomes: you can walk up to an orge and say &quot;whats up shorty?&quot;  =P<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Maybe add a cast on other varient in the 60&#39;s range for the expantion pack.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think somewhere between level 29 to 39 would be a more then fair for the<br/>\nself only varient and would not cause a playbalence issue.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;So, what do you all think?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Fastus Atrox<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Congratulations to &quot;M-K-ROSES,&quot; our latest ONElist of the Week.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Visit our homepage and share with us how ONElist is changing YOUR life!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
