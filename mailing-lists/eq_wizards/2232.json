Quit trying to read into everything.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So you just like stating facts for no particular reason or contribution<br/>\nto the discussion at hand? If so, excuse me, because I thought you were<br/>\ntrying to make some points about Wizard&#39;s ineptitude as a class, but now<br/>\nI see it&#39;s just a fact.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s see, I&#39;ll have a try at it:<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbarians are high.<br/>\n<br/>\nYep, works fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ditto ditto.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Dark elves are not really dark, they&#39;re blue.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill works.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Incorrect incorrect. I believe I saw a posting here not too long ago saying<br/>\n&gt; other classes (Druid?) get more powerful DD spells than we do at one of the<br/>\n&gt; higher levels.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Can you please cite the spell, the wizard DD spell of the same level and<br/>\ntheir mana cost and time of casting?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf indeed the spell does more damage, then, yes, you&#39;ve found *one*. But<br/>\nI&#39;m sure that the mana to damage ratio and casting times are better for<br/>\nthe wizard anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Enchanters and magicians can cast beneficial buffs on party members, debuff<br/>\n&gt; mobs, and have summoned creatures to fight for them. Hell, their creatures<br/>\n&gt; can even cast now!  Clerics can heal party members, as can Rangers, Druids,<br/>\n&gt; and Shamen. All we can do is cast O&#39;Keil&#39;s radiation on a tank for a paltry<br/>\n&gt; 2 points per melee hit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; With a level spread of *2* in the party, if something cons red to the tank<br/>\n&gt; but is known to be only a few levels above the highest level char, groups<br/>\n&gt; will often engage for the extra exp, esp if they&#39;re mostly<br/>\n&gt; warrior/paladin/melee types. In a well-balanced party of melee, healers and<br/>\n&gt; casters, wizards are the least useful in this situation if they&#39;re a couple<br/>\n&gt; levels lower than the main tank ppl. And against &quot;medium&quot; or &quot;low&quot; reds,<br/>\n&gt; yeah I love burning a bubble of mana on a creature and only do a 15% of the<br/>\n&gt; damage it should, when it is not completely resisted. This means more<br/>\n&gt; downtime for the wiz and embarassment because your spells suddenly suck.<br/>\n&gt; Worse-case, the mobs get irritated that you&#39;re even TRYING to shoot them,<br/>\n&gt; and you die very, very quickly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So the situation you&#39;re describing is when a party with, oh say, a level<br/>\n14 wizard and a level 16 warrior wants to attack a level 20 monster? How<br/>\noften do you see that happen?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if this does happen, it shouldn&#39;t. A level 14 warrior would not help<br/>\nany anyway. You think he would hit? Or do you think a level 14<br/>\nEnchanter&#39;s buffs would make any difference against a level 20 enemy?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Actually, I would have said &quot;I suck&quot; instead. Appreciate your diplomacy.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve followed the teachings of Zaeq, North Karana beetle-kiter<br/>\n&gt; extraordinare. What ends up happening is I run to the beetle, hit it, get it<br/>\n&gt; down, then some damned animal jumps me and I have to zone.  There&#39;s no place<br/>\n&gt; else I can solo in the queynos/karana area that&#39;s not overly camped. Even<br/>\n&gt; wisps give me little exp anymore, many con green at 15th.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The location, as a said, sucks. travel to Freeport and hunt in North Ro,<br/>\nyou&#39;ll find it *perfect*. It has as much prey as the Karanas, but<br/>\nsignificantly less aggressive animals. It also has dervish camps where<br/>\nin a party you&#39;ll get good exp and great loot. You can also take turns<br/>\nand solo them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome zones are just bad for some levels. The trick is to find a good<br/>\nzone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Did I state that? No. Now that you mention it, they&#39;ve promised it since<br/>\n&gt; retail release, nothing has come of it so far.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The plains are operational. So nyah :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nQenelin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
