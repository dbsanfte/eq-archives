Woven armor is though it<br/>\ntypically is 1AC less than leather, and each piece weighs less than 1.  You<br/>\nget can get woven armor off of the Frogloks of Guk.  These are the types<br/>\nthat carry it Sentry, Sentiel, Guards, Tuk Warrior, Apprentice, Novice,<br/>\nNeopyte, Witch Doctor, Tuk shaman, and a couple of the other frog types.<br/>\nMesh armor is on Gaz Frogloks and higher.  Guk is a dungeon near Grobb.  As<br/>\nfar as price depends on how close you are to Guk.  Normally you can get it<br/>\nfor 1 - 2 plat a piece at Guk.<br/>\n<br/>\nGene</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
