I joined because the<br/>\nguilds were started by friends, or I became friends<br/>\nwith current guild members who talked me into joining.<br/>\n Both guilds eventually disbanded as the leaders left<br/>\nand everyone else drifted off.  I haven&#39;t joined<br/>\nanother because I don&#39;t play enough now to make it<br/>\nworthwhile.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Do you attend guild events?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I do when I&#39;m in a guild<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you plan to ahead of time to attend guild events?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you normally group with<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) People you meet that session<br/>\n&gt; 2) People you knew prior to playing Everquest<br/>\n&gt; 3) People you met through Everquest<br/>\n&gt; 4) Guildmate you found in your area<br/>\n&gt; 5) Other (please specify)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Options 1, 2, or 3.  Just depends on who&#39;s online at<br/>\nthe time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Have your grouping patterns changed as you&#39;ve gained<br/>\n&gt; experience at the game?  How so?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a lot less likely to group now, because I&#39;m<br/>\npickier about people with whom I spend my time. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Time questions<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How many hours a week (on average) do you play<br/>\n&gt; Everquest?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>8<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How many hours do you play each session?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>6<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How do you normally spend your time in Norrath?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Generally by trying to be the group clown while we&#39;re<br/>\nkilling stuff.  Assuming I&#39;m in a group.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Are you on a constant quest to level or do you take<br/>\n&gt; time off from gaining experience while playing?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m on a constant quest to have fun.  Leveling&#39;s nice,<br/>\nbut very minor.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; What do you do when you take time off from the mobs?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Help newbies.  Travel and get screen shots.  Chat with<br/>\nfriends. Waste money on trade skills.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; While trying to level do you ever take time out to<br/>\n&gt; help others? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If yes (to the previous question), in what ways?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Help with corpse retrieval, saving from death, escort<br/>\nduty, playing guide, assistance in killing some rare<br/>\nmob which might have a good drop.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Did you know the other avatars prior to helping<br/>\n&gt; them?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Usually not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Can you give any reasons why you chose to help<br/>\n&gt; others?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Part of the point to playing is to be heroic and do<br/>\ngreat deeds, helping others.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Have you ever died helping others (outside of a<br/>\n&gt; group situation)? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Calls for help <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Do you ever help newbies?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If yes (to the previous question), how do you help<br/>\n&gt; newbies?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Same as above.  Guide, protection, buffs, healing. <br/>\nUsually won&#39;t help them kill something they shouldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave tackled.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can you give any reasons why you helped them?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Passing along good deeds that were done when I was a<br/>\nnewbie.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Were you helped as a newbie? (This does not include<br/>\n&gt; help from friends you met prior to playing)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If yes (to the previous question), how were you<br/>\n&gt; helped?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I once lost a corpse in Faydark.  A bard tried to help<br/>\nme find it, and wound up dying several times.<br/>\n <br/>\nI had one budding cook buy a stack of batwings from my<br/>\npaladin and pay a pair of bronze gloves.<br/>\n<br/>\nFood donated when I was running across country for a<br/>\ncorpse retrieval.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you respond to the /yell command?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve never figured yet out where the yeller is in time<br/>\nto do any good.  But I try.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does your respose to a plea for help depend on any<br/>\n&gt; factors? What are those factors?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Of course it does.  I&#39;m much less likely to help<br/>\ntwinks.  Courtesy is a major factor. I don&#39;t help<br/>\npeople who beg for items or money.  (Well, a level 5<br/>\ncharacter whose corpse has just disappeared would be<br/>\nan exception). If I&#39;ve had a chance to observe the<br/>\nother player, for good or ill, in action will adjust<br/>\nthings.  And, of course, how immediately the help is<br/>\nneeded, and how capable I am of helping.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Are you more likely to help members of a specific<br/>\n&gt; race? gender? <br/>\n&gt; class? Why?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m more likely to donate things to wizards, because<br/>\nthat&#39;s where I&#39;m most likely to have equipment I&#39;ve<br/>\noutgrown.  Other than that, I don&#39;t bother with such<br/>\ndistinctions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Was there any time in your avatars life when you<br/>\n&gt; were more likely to <br/>\n&gt; help others? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If yes (to the previous question), what brought<br/>\n&gt; about the difference <br/>\n&gt; in game play? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>n/a<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Why do you think that people help others in<br/>\n&gt; Everquest?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Partly because it&#39;s a miniature of real life. Society<br/>\nhas developed because people are more effective in<br/>\ngreater numbers than alone.  The same is very true in<br/>\nEQ.  The &quot;scratching each others&#39; back&quot; thing.  And<br/>\nthere&#39;s also the point about playing a heroic<br/>\nrole-playing game.  Most of us have a swash-buckler<br/>\nlurking inside (people attracted to EQ are probably<br/>\nmore likely than most to have this suppressed in<br/>\nthere), and it&#39;s more possible to let this loose in<br/>\nreal life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe flip side of the coin also holds true, of course. <br/>\nThere are also people who will only help a limited<br/>\nsample of others, or no one else at all. I think most<br/>\nof those people will not last long on EQ, because they<br/>\nwon&#39;t make many friends, and that&#39;s vital at higher<br/>\nlevels. (At least, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve seen in all my<br/>\npeers who are now lvl 50+)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Comments?
