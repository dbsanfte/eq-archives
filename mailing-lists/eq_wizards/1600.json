Sorry to sound like I am yet another whining <br/>\nabout the Wizard class.  I actually love the Wizard class but can&#39;t <br/>\nhelp but be envious of the others I have seen at my level runing <br/>\naround with items that give them 50 extra mana points and AC&#39;s near <br/>\n250 at level 10 and I can&#39;t raise enough money to buy basic spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you really believe that I can be more effective with a snake fang <br/>\nthen a GS.  I have to melee quite a bit now and the staff although it <br/>\nseems that I swing it only once every 10 secs and the damage I do is <br/>\nproportional to the creatures HP&#39;s it does hit regularly for 16 points <br/>\nof damage. The senario is like this I can hit for 64 points in the <br/>\nfirst four strikes then can&#39;t hit for 3 points in 10 strikes while the <br/>\ncreature crawls away from me - not run crawl like a slug, follow, <br/>\nmiss, follow, miss, follow, miss, umph! I am stunned by an ambush of 4 <br/>\ncreatures as I tried to deal the last 3 points to the creature I have <br/>\nalready beaten.  Then I die or run losing the kill and becoming very <br/>\nbitter.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI could kill without meleeing at all but at 9th level I&#39;d use all my <br/>\nmana in every fight and would have to run back to a safe place to med <br/>\nconstantly.  Lately in groups I am a fighting Wizard.  I let the tanks <br/>\nbuild a heathly hate with the creatures then join in with my staff.  I <br/>\nonly use my mana to stop a fleeing creature or save my group when <br/>\nthings go wrong or to minimize the damage they endure.  My rule is I <br/>\ntry to use slightly more mana then the tanks take damage.  This way I <br/>\nrecover my mana in about the same amount of time they recover their <br/>\nlife and neither of us slows the other. If I burn to recklessly I <br/>\ncause the whole group to slow down by having to wait for me to <br/>\nregenerate.  I am concerned that with a snake tooth (6dmg I think) I <br/>\nwould not do nearly as much damage and would be forced to use mana.  I <br/>\nconserve mana at all costs even to the point of nearing death or <br/>\nhaving to flee rather than win the fight.  Mana is life.  If I use it <br/>\nindescrimanantly I risk the lives of my party or I become a burden to <br/>\nthem rather than an asset.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I have used a staff since day one.  I have practically no skill <br/>\nin one hand piece(?).  How long would it take me to build my dagger <br/>\nskill to 50 (my current 2H blunt skill)?  How much damage over time <br/>\ndoes the dagger do verses the staff?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\nGuile<br/>\n=====================================================================<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Richard A.
