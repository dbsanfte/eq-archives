I have tryed to start<br/>\n&gt; discusions and i also send test of petition what we write before to Verant<br/>\n&gt; and to some boards only one wich post something was  Notcrazy Network.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; First i wish to state a wizard is playable class, it is hard to play at<br/>\n&gt; start but a problem is if it stay so hard also on last lv? and on lv 24 i<br/>\n&gt; realy feel nice, new shield, new leather skeen, new damage spell, But<br/>\n&gt; wizards can be improved in many areas it is nice idea of a damage dealing,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Definite agreement<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; teleporting explorer. Only we dont have where to use more then half of our<br/>\n&gt; spells they are useles you will use them once or twice nearly all time as<br/>\n&gt; you buyed them or if you research them and never more.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is common of most spell casting classes as far as I can tell.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen playing an enchanter and a cleric recently, and grouping with a ranger<br/>\nand paladin.  The common complaint is that most spells aren&#39;t terribly<br/>\nuseful.  For ALL classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have visited many boards in all i see that there are wizards complainig<br/>\n&gt; about our class.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>True.  I think you&#39;re looking at a vocal minority though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Some of most valid things is that our class is boring,<br/>\n&gt; there is problems with lv 20 force shock spell wich is resisted too much,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>lvl 20 force shock was almost NEVER resisted for me.  Similarly the lvl 29<br/>\nThunder strike (which I hear complaints about) is also almost never<br/>\nresisted.  I&#39;ve wondered if this might be a function of stats or usage.  For<br/>\none, my wisdom is above 100, which is uncommon among wizards.  For another,<br/>\nI never cast these spells until the mob is under, say, 50% health.  Magic<br/>\nresistance is lower on injured mobs.  I&#39;d be interested in hearing more<br/>\ndetails about the stats of people who have found that the spells work vs.<br/>\nthose that haven&#39;t.  Maybe we can pin down the underlying cause.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; you will get at lv 24 one spell wich hit for less damage, cast faster and<br/>\n&gt; is nearly never resisted. We are class wich are false king of damage, we<br/>\n&gt; are surpased with necros wich are more mana efficent, combination of<br/>\n&gt; magician and pet do more damage than we can do for less mana,  we without<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Personally, I don&#39;t see either necros or magicians as surpassing us.  They<br/>\nare better at soloing, IMO, but that&#39;s about it.  And I don&#39;t see soloing as<br/>\nany real advantage.  At about lvl 20, you need to start thinking in terms of<br/>\nregular or permanent grouping anyway.  (I&#39;ve seen many druids power game up<br/>\nto lvl 30 only to find that they can&#39;t kite in dungeons, don&#39;t have friends,<br/>\nand really don&#39;t know how to use their class well anyway.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; any doubt do more damage in unit of time than any other class but this is<br/>\n&gt; best suicide mode in game. We have less spell lines then other classes and<br/>\n&gt; this fey wich we have are nearly all screwed. Who use Area damage at 20<br/>\n&gt; lv?, or better personal centered version of it?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve started playing with the lvl 16 and lvl 24 AE damage spells lately.<br/>\nThey have some surprisingly good uses.  The lvl 29 Cast force is an<br/>\nexcellent spell in just the right circumstances.  But you have to be in a<br/>\ngroup that knows how to work with you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ( they have potencial use<br/>\n&gt; for cleaning green mobs . . . but i never seen it used), excelent sight<br/>\n&gt; spells wich are best to vaste you money on so you can take a look at<br/>\n </span></blockquote>beeach<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; girls from other side ... only girls here go in water with full platemail<br/>\n&gt; if they can, also there are 2 portals wich are one near other ( west<br/>\n </span></blockquote>karana<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and north karana), not to talk about our problem when we have to fight<br/>\n&gt; something red +6 lv from your lv. Now verant give you possibility to group<br/>\n&gt; with somone 8 lv higer then you he fight something blue so it is  6 lv up<br/>\n&gt; from your lv and you cant do anything ... cast a damage shield on warriors<br/>\n&gt; and boldly hach with your mighty weapon if you stel have it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sight spells are a total waste, as I see it.  And the west karana teleport<br/>\nis just plain insulting.  On the other hand, the six lvl limit bit is not,<br/>\nimo, that big of a deal.  All spell casters suffer from it to some extent<br/>\n(with the DOTers suffering the least).  We&#39;re the worst of course, but that<br/>\njust means we need to pick our mobs carefully.  Consider that a lvl 30<br/>\nwarrior can&#39;t consistently solo a blue mob (even now with their<br/>\npatch--partly because they can&#39;t run down fast fleeing mobs, partly because<br/>\nthey still don&#39;t deal out that much damage), or that magicians and<br/>\nenchanters can&#39;t take their pets up ramps or through dungeons very well.  We<br/>\nall have weaknesses.  This 6 lvl limit is the wizard&#39;s big one.  If you<br/>\ndon&#39;t see that as an acceptable weakness, what do you propose instead?  Keep<br/>\nin mind that Verant wants all classes to have weaknesses and depend on one<br/>\nanother, etc.  Also keep in mind that this is no longer a problem in getting<br/>\nour Ice Shock spell, as we thought it might be.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;On another point, i just read the new patch message.. Damn.... From the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;begining, nothing as been change for the wizzards... They just change<br/>\n </span></blockquote>during<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;the patch , the casting time . I have tested BEFORE and after : no change<br/>\n&gt; &gt;(that a clock can see, so it s surely a change of let s say 0,001 second<br/>\n </span></blockquote>or<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;something like that.In other words : nothing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;All patch just power up the race... Now the druid dot spel are fast like<br/>\n&gt; &gt;hell, necro same.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Increasing DOT rate is NOT, I repeat NOT an improvement on the spells.  In<br/>\nfact, if anything, it is a nerf.  DOTs don&#39;t just cause damage, they prevent<br/>\nregen.  That means that smart necros cast them at the beginning of the fight<br/>\nnot just for the damage, but to prevent mob from healing.  Sometimes, the<br/>\nhealing is the bigger concern.  Now DOT spell casters have to cast DOTs<br/>\ntwice as often to keep the effect going.  This makes kiting a bit harder<br/>\nalso because the kiter has to stop and recast more quickly.  Not as much<br/>\ntime to gain distance, or recover that thin sliver of mana needed for maybe<br/>\none extra cast, etc.  Go talk to a necro and see how much they like the<br/>\nchange.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And us ?? From the beginning, we have major bug who are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;not resolved and they do nothing for us...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Force shock is bugged cause he is resisted too much (and i am ok that he<br/>\n </span></blockquote>get<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;resisted so much IF he stun like he must do). The enstill spel doesn&#39;t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>work<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;(i have tested with root : root is 10 times more effective). I am a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>playing<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve played with both root and enstil repeatedly.  Enstil is not, IMO, all<br/>\nthat bad.  But like root, it doesn&#39;t become effective for a few levels after<br/>\nyou get it (I didn&#39;t switch to it until lvl 25).  And I keep both enstil and<br/>\nroot memorized at times.  For my particular character this is what I find:<br/>\n<br/>\n-Root has a much better chance of not being resisted against a yellow or red<br/>\nmob.  However, these mobs will break a root almost instantly.  Not much<br/>\nadvantage, but may save your hide sometime I suppose<br/>\n<br/>\n-Both get resisted against black or blue mobs, with root getting resisted<br/>\nsomewhat less<br/>\n<br/>\n-Enstil, when it hits, hold for MUCH longer duration.  Sheesh, I can<br/>\nsometimes regen 2 bubbles of mana on a single enstil.  We&#39;re talking almost<br/>\n2 minutes.  With enstil, you can actually solo high blues if you&#39;re careful.<br/>\nGo get a SOW for safety&#39;s sake, and try (at lvl 28) to solo harriers in<br/>\nsouth karanas with root and enstil.  I found that root would hold for at<br/>\nmost one strike of inferno shock--often it broke before I got my first spell<br/>\noff.  Enstil often broke after one shot, but regularly held for all 3 or 4.<br/>\nMy point being, with enstil we can still solo blues in the high 20&#39;s.  Not<br/>\nall classes can do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n-I never hunt greens so I haven&#39;t really compared the two systematically for<br/>\ngreens.  However, I have had to root running greens for my group on occasion<br/>\nand have never noticed any deficiency in enstil.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, this may in part be due to differences in attributes.  Hard to say.<br/>\nWhat we need is some discussion on how the spells are being used, the<br/>\nspecific mobs we are rooting, and the attributes and lvl of the caster.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; enstill have a little bit diferent use then root i use both when i solo<br/>\n </span></blockquote>but<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it is funny that it is resised by green guys. I dont know how you tested<br/>\n&gt; enstill against root?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;a shaman and i think i will stop my wizzard... We have nothing funny : we<br/>\n&gt; &gt;just level and wait for what ? Our dd spel nothing more, no buf, no pet,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>no<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;life tap, no shield,no dot, no sow, nothing cool except some gate spel...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;That s so boring.. For solo from level 8 to 50 you root nuke nuke root<br/>\n </span></blockquote>nuke<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, we can root, we can stun, we can blast with impunity when the mob is<br/>\nlower than 50% health.  My group really doesn&#39;t have a regular healer<br/>\nbecause they don&#39;t take much damage when I&#39;m there.  Hehe.  We seldom die.<br/>\nWe went the entire last lvl (29 - 31, depending on group member) without<br/>\nANYONE dying once.  And I love my gate spells.  Last week while dungeon<br/>\ncrawling, my group got simultaneously hit by about 4 area effect rain spells<br/>\nand several mobs.  We were all dying fast.  I called for evac and about 4 or<br/>\n5 secs later we were off to N Karanas.  Long run back to the dungeon, but no<br/>\none seemed offended.  They had plenty of time while recovering 4+ bubbles of<br/>\nhealth to contemplate the benefits of having me around.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there&#39;s the gate spells to the other planes.  Oh, I don&#39;t suppose I&#39;ll<br/>\nbe visiting Fear at lvl 34, but maybe not too long afterwards (after I put<br/>\nall of my equipment in the bank first, hehe).  And, of course, I like being<br/>\nable to teleport my friends and guild members around.  Or turn a quick buck<br/>\nteleporting someone from toxxullia to faydark.  (As an aside, I charge 10pp<br/>\nfor single person transport, 5pp for each additional person, and 5pp for<br/>\neach zone I have to cross to pick someone up.  If this sounds insanely high,<br/>\nwait until you hit lvl 29 and get a tell almost every 5 minutes from someone<br/>\nconvinced they are the only person in the world needing your services.  The<br/>\nprice weeds out a lot of the noise and gives you a chance to play.  I<br/>\nteleport friends and guild members free at my convenience, and I generally<br/>\noffer free teleports when I&#39;m making the trip myself.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWizards can be a lot of fun.  Oh, btw.  Killed Borxx last night and went and<br/>\ngot my staff of the observers.  For those of you who haven&#39;t figured it out,<br/>\ngetting items on your own is so much more satisfying than buying them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;nuke dead... Wow that s pretty funny :( :( :(.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;What about our ae spel ? and pe spel ?? Did someone here use them ????<br/>\n&gt; &gt;NOBODY...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I use PAE now regularly and AE occasionally, but since AE can hit me I tend<br/>\nto just wade into fight and use PAE.  It is absolutely critical that you<br/>\nhave full tank support as well as a decent AC before you try it though.  For<br/>\ninstance, I have two tanks I regularly group with that know exactly what to<br/>\ndo when I start casting AE.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen your group gets hit by a couple of big baddies and several greens, you<br/>\ncan clean the trash out extremely quickly.  AE spells when used right are<br/>\nmana efficient and effective.  I hear they get better too.  Still haven&#39;t<br/>\ngotten the runes for the lvl 29 spell (why are AE runes always so hard to<br/>\nfind?) so I&#39;m looking forward to getting that one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;So guys, we were talking some weeks ago to petition.. Nothing has be done<br/>\n </span></blockquote>or<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;you just don t send the letter ???<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Personally, no, I don&#39;t want a letter.  EQ has serious problems that, IMO,<br/>\nrank much higher than twiddling with our spells.  Serious zone crowding,<br/>\nzoning bugs, PL, etc.  They&#39;ve made ice shock obtainable, fixed research<br/>\n(and included a practice quest), gave us an extra lvl 49 DD spell (and a<br/>\nvery nice one at that) purchasable from stores, etc.  Mind you, I don&#39;t<br/>\nobject to you sending in a letter.  You&#39;re entitled to your opinions and, I<br/>\nthink, Verant ought to know how you feel because your frustration with<br/>\nwizards is just as important to them as is my satisfaction.  But I,<br/>\npersonally, disagree with many of your complaints.  We are an extremely well<br/>\nbalanced and effective class.  Just tough to play right, and I like it that<br/>\nway.  Making lvl 50 as a wizard means something right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlyphin E`Mondredon<br/>\nThe Rathe<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  Lvl 29 is a blast.  Inferno shock actually has a somewhat different<br/>\nspell effect (woohoo), does impressive damage, casts reasonably quickly,<br/>\nplus you get Thunder Strike (almost 250 damage, plus it gives one heck of a<br/>\nkick; try it on yourself, just not on a ledge like I did), portal spells and<br/>\nan evac).  Anyone thinking of giving up a wizard ought to wait at least<br/>\nuntil this lvl before making up their mind, IMO.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
