Five slots? Which five slots? You may write any spell at any place in your spellbook. How you organise it is your prerogative. Buy the spell, and write it","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1189186799\">According to Robert Jones:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have a question about spell books which I could easily test in game for a<br/>\n&gt; small fee, but I never get around to it so I figured I&#39;d see if one of you<br/>\n&gt; could help (and save my few GP).  Let&#39;s say I did something stupid (this<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t happen) like not buy root at lvl4, and already filled all five slots<br/>\n&gt; in my spellbook... can I go out and buy root and scribe it over top of one<br/>\n&gt; of my lvl4 spells that I think sucks?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Five slots? Which five slots?<br/>\nYou may write any spell at any place in your spellbook. How you organise<br/>\nit is your prerogative.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuy the spell, and write it somewhere. You don&#39;t (you even can&#39;t) erase<br/>\nother spells. But you can purchase all spells at any level and write them<br/>\ndown.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
