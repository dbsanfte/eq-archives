I&#39;d keep him, but if you do start a new character my<br/>\nsuggestion would be to make the intellegence divisable by 5.  I saw the equation<br/>\nfor calculating mana on the message boards during beta, and although I can&#39;t<br/>\nremember exactly what it was; I do rember that they divided your Int by 5 when<br/>\ncalculating it.  Lastly I would put any extra skill points in either dexterity<br/>\nor wisdom.  Dexterity will keep you from getting interupted as often and wisdom<br/>\nwill provide you with some magic resistance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Thomas Sommer&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sommer_thomas@...\">sommer_thomas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; maybe you can help me:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve created a darkelf wizard und spent 20 points to INT, 5 points to STR<br/>\n&gt; and 5 points to CHARISMA (stupid, I don&#39;t know why i did that).
