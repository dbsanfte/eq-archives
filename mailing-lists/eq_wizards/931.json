All of the spells, when right clicked upon list the amount of<br/>\nmana that they use.  It is silly to say, this spell requires 10 mana per<br/>\ncast, but hey, we are only gonna tell you what percentage of your limit you<br/>\nhave with this nifty colored bar thing.  The other thing to consider is that<br/>\nall RPG&#39;s that I have seen/played/heard of are very numerically based.  All<br/>\nof them represent stats as numbers, and it just doesn&#39;t feel like a proper<br/>\nRPG unless this detail is available to me.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Clint Chenault &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ccc@...\">ccc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, May 02, 1999 4:30 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Answer to mana question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Clint Chenault &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ccc@...\">ccc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To answer your question about mana this is the one and only answer for ya.<br/>\nThis is<br/>\n&gt; an RPG.  In other words pretend it&#39;s your life.  You ARE this wizard and<br/>\nin real<br/>\n&gt; life you wouldn&#39;t be saying OH Hold Up &lt;insert name here&gt; I only have 10<br/>\nmana left.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You just wouldn&#39;t say that you dont have a clue how much mana you have<br/>\nyou&#39;d just<br/>\n&gt; say &quot;wait a second I am feeling exhausted I need to regen some mana&quot;<br/>\n&gt; But I do believe it&#39;s unfair that they get to see their HP I personally<br/>\nthink they<br/>\n&gt; should take hp numbers out also.  Because this game is not meant to be<br/>\nnumerical<br/>\n&gt; thus the reason why they didnt include Mana # stam # exp # or skills #<br/>\n&gt; you just wouldnt know that you could only run 15 more feet youd know your<br/>\ntired and<br/>\n&gt; have jkust a lil bit left in ya or how much exp you needed to become<br/>\nbetter youd<br/>\n&gt; learn from doing it not saying oh i need to change the oil in my car 3<br/>\nmore times<br/>\n&gt; to be a MASTER oil changer<br/>\n&gt; I hope this has enlightened you Please respond back.
