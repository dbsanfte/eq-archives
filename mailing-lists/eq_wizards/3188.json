I think that<br/>\n&gt; we (or everybody) should get spells every lvl or every other lvl.<br/>\n&gt; Especially for wizards.  My friend who is a lvl 5 enchanter almost has<br/>\n&gt; more spells then I do.  They gave us so many useless spells.  Like the<br/>\n&gt; low lvl Sphere of light.  I havent had the need for any other damage<br/>\n&gt; spell besides shocks or bolts.  Then again I am also at a low lvl.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Enchanters have a ton of useful spells and this gives them a great deal of<br/>\nversitility.  A lvl 8 enchanter can run and &quot;nuke,&quot; or they can Fear and<br/>\nDOT, or they can mesmerize a group, and let their pet take mobs one at a<br/>\ntime.  This makes them a blast to play.  And of course, they pay a lot more<br/>\nin the end.  Spells aren&#39;t free.  A Wizard generally only needs about 3<br/>\nspells per lvl until they get teleports, the rest are optional.  Nice on the<br/>\nwallet.  Another benefit to being a wizard is that the 8 spells slots is<br/>\nusually (almost) enough.  For enchanters, it never is.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, there&#39;s nothing subtle about wizards.  Bomb, Bomb, Bomb.  About the<br/>\nonly question is, How much damage do I want to do this strike?  I don&#39;t see<br/>\nhow changing spell distribution (say, 2 or 3 every level instead of 8 to 10<br/>\nevery 4 or 5) would change anything, unless you&#39;re imagining that they&#39;d<br/>\ngive us even more spells as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf in the end you want a spell every level, you might consider playing a<br/>\nbard.  If you just envy the enchanters line of spells, you might consider<br/>\nplaying an enchanter (though they definitely have their drawbacks).  You<br/>\nhave 8 character slots.  Play, have fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last thought:  Spells such as Sphere of Light are not entirely useless<br/>\nas they also serve as trainer spells.  They are low mana cost spells that<br/>\nlet you practice a skill without blowing a chunk of mana at each attempt.<br/>\nThey have a small amount of functionality, but their real benefit is in<br/>\npreparing you for higher lvl spells (e.g. Sphere of Light and Sense Magic<br/>\nboth train for, say, Invisibility).<br/>\n<br/>\n-Brian</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
