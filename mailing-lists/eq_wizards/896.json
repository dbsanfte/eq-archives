Well my friend is a shaman who just<br/>\nturned 14. Well he just brought<br/>\nhis new damage spell and he said it does 77 damage, to which i replied kewl<br/>\nmy next spell does that amount<br/>\ntoo. That was a mistake he started laughing and saying things like &quot;why<br/>\nwould anyone want to play the wizard<br/>\nwhen they can play the shaman&quot;.  &quot;the shaman can stand toe to toe like the<br/>\nwarrior and do the same damage<br/>\nas the wizard, Ha HA HA HA .....&quot; . Then he went on saying crap like now he<br/>\nknows the shaman is the best<br/>\nclass in the game. All he could talk about before was the sow spell, and now<br/>\nit is he does the same damage<br/>\nas the wizard.  My question is this, i thought i picked the wizard so i<br/>\nwould not have to hear stuff like this?<br/>\nI thought level 12 was when the wizard started to leave other mage class<br/>\nbehind.  Know i have to hear alot<br/>\naggraviating crap from this shaman, laughing at the wizard class. Dam that<br/>\nis going to suck.  Someone<br/>\nplease tell me there is hope out there as far as the damage spells go.<br/>\n<br/>\n****************************************************************************<br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes your friend have Root spell?  Or does he have to stand there and try<br/>\nto beat the monster to death?  Can he gate if the going gets tough?  At<br/>\nlevel 16, and level 20 will he start getting all kinds of cool gating<br/>\nspells?  Stuff like, &quot;Well, I&#39;m in freeport and I&#39;d really rather be in<br/>\nFeydwit, so ZAP! POOF!  Here I am!&quot; kind of stuff?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think not!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou should also note how long his spell delays are, and how many he can<br/>\ncast before he is out of mana??  And how many offensive spells can he cast<br/>\nwithout having to save mana to heal up because he can&#39;t root the monster?<br/>\nI would suspect the answer to these questions would provide feedback as to<br/>\nwhy Wizards are the #1 damage dishers in the whole game.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know that as a level 15 gnome wizard, I can cast shock of lightning,<br/>\nwhich hits for 81 points of damage and costs 60 mana, I can cast this spell<br/>\nat least 5 times and STILL have some mana left over for a couple roots and<br/>\neven a shock of ice if I still need to blast a little bit more!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yeah, shamans are kind of buff, they have healing, SoW, and some other<br/>\nstuff thats really pretty cool, but I SERIOUSLY doubt a shaman can dish out<br/>\n300-360 points of damage with his/her spells, they just don&#39;t have enough<br/>\nmana for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFlik</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
