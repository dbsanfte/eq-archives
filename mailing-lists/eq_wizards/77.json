This will<br/>\nmake it quicker when you are about to die and will help you navigate a lot<br/>\nbetter.<br/>\n<br/>\nAND while you&#39;re at that, bind /corpse to another hot button.  If you find<br/>\nyour corpse, you can drag it to safety by running and quickly hitting the<br/>\ncorpse button.  (Now that I have told you this they will probably program<br/>\nthat out of the game...)<br/>\n<br/>\nMazurik<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Whenever you are engaged in battle, wether you think you can win<br/>\n   or not, always type /loc before or during battle. That way when<br/>\n   or if you die you can scroll up in the chat window and get a<br/>\n   general idea asto where your corpse is.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
