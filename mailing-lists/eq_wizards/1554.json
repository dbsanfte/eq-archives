I know it&#39;s WAY off topic,<br/>\nbut this thing has potential.  I received this Email a while ago and have<br/>\nsince gone through with the process; my name is the one at the bottom as of<br/>\nnow.  Here is the Email:<br/>\n<br/>\nThis letter is about an opportunity to make an incredible amount<br/>\nof<br/>\nMoney (CASH!!!) in a very short time.  The cost is only $6.00!<br/>\nThis is<br/>\nmy ninth day at this, and so far I have received $121 (in<br/>\n$1Bills)...so<br/>\nguess this is starting to work already! $121 doesn&#39;t  sound like<br/>\nmuch,<br/>\nbut this is the most money that I have ever made at one of these<br/>\nprograms.<br/>\n<br/>\nGive it a try! I hope we all make lots of money!!! All I did was<br/>\nfollow<br/>\nthe instructions in the letter that I received below, and sent<br/>\nout some<br/>\ne-mail to people that responded to my ads.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few weeks ago I received a letter from an attorney that said: I<br/>\nam a<br/>\nretired attorney, and about two years ago a man came to me with a<br/>\nletter. The letter he brought to me is the same letter before you<br/>\nnow.<br/>\nHe asked me to verify that this letter was legal. I told him that<br/>\nI<br/>\nwould review it and get back to him. When I first read the<br/>\nletter, I<br/>\nthought it was some off the wall idea to make money. A week later<br/>\nI met<br/>\nagain with my client to discuss the issue. I told him that the<br/>\nletter<br/>\noriginally brought to me was not 100% legal. I advised him to<br/>\nmake a<br/>\nsmall change in the letter and it will be all right. I was<br/>\ncurious about<br/>\nthe letter, so he told me how it worked. I thought it was along<br/>\nshot, so<br/>\nI decided against participating. Before my client left, I asked<br/>\nhim to<br/>\nkeep me updated as to his results. About two months later he<br/>\ncalled me<br/>\nto tell me that he had received more than $8OO,OOO.OO in cash!! I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve him so he asked me to try the plan and see for myself. I<br/>\nthought<br/>\nabout it for a few days and decided that there was not much to<br/>\nlose. I<br/>\nfollowed the instructions exactly and mailed out 200 letters.<br/>\nSure<br/>\nenough the money started coming in! It came slowly at first, but<br/>\nafter<br/>\nthree weeks I was getting more than I could open in a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter three months the money stopped coming. I kept a precise<br/>\nrecord of<br/>\nmy earnings and at the end it totaled $868,439.00. I earn a good<br/>\nliving<br/>\nas a attorney, but as anyone in the legal profession will tell<br/>\nyou,<br/>\nthere is a lot of stress that comes with the territory. I decided<br/>\nif<br/>\nthings worked out, I would retire from practice and play golf.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis time I sent out 500 letters. Well, three months later, I had<br/>\ntotaled $2,344,178.00. I met my old client for lunch to find out<br/>\nexactly<br/>\nhow it works. He told me that there were a few similar letters<br/>\ngoing<br/>\naround. What made this one different is the fact that there were<br/>\nsix<br/>\nnames on the letter, not three like most others. That fact alone<br/>\nresulted in more returns. The other factor was the advice I gave<br/>\nhim in<br/>\nmaking sure the whole thing was perfectly legal, since no one<br/>\nwants to<br/>\nrisk doing anything illegal. I bet now you are curious abou what<br/>\nlittle<br/>\nchanges I told him to make.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell if you send a letter like this one out, to be legal, you<br/>\nmust sell<br/>\nsomething if you expect to receive a dollar. I told him that<br/>\nanyone<br/>\nsending a dollar must receive something in RETURN. So when you<br/>\nsend a<br/>\ndollar to each of the six names on the list, you must include a<br/>\nslip of<br/>\npaper saying, {&quot;Please put me on your mailing list and notify me<br/>\nof other exciting opportunities&quot;} and include your<br/>\nname, mailing address and e-mail address. (This is the key to the<br/>\nprogram.} The item you will receive for your dollar is THIS<br/>\nletter and<br/>\nthe right to earn thousands. Follow the simple<br/>\ninstructions EXACTLY, and in less than three months you should<br/>\nreceive<br/>\nMORE THAN $8OO,OOO.OO IN COLD HARD CASH!<br/>\n<br/>\n1) IMMEDIATELY send $1.00 (or equivalent other currency) to each<br/>\nof the<br/>\nsix people listed below. THE SOONER YOU SEND THE &quot;$1.00 LETTERS&quot;<br/>\nTHE<br/>\nSOONER YOU CAN START GETTING A RETURN! =&gt; Wrap the dollar in a<br/>\nnote<br/>\nsaying &quot;Please add me to your mailing list and notify me of other<br/>\nexciting opportunities&quot;. Include YOUR<br/>\nNAME, MAILING ADDRESS AND E-MAIL ADDRESS.<br/>\n<br/>\n***REMEMBER, if you don&#39;t ask for the service, USE OF THIS LETTER<br/>\n  WILL BE ILLEGAL FOR YOU.<br/>\n<br/>\n  1.
