Okay, confusing I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2051709432\">When you hit /assist it will immediately switch your target to whatever your<br/>\nexisting target is targeting as well as put you in attack mode. Okay,<br/>\nconfusing I know. Here&#39;s an example:<br/>\n<br/>\n    You&#39;re walking along with your friend Mr. Tank and company, when<br/>\nsuddenly a train of gnolls is forced into your midst, and the person who<br/>\nstarted the whole thing dies at their feet. There&#39;s 5 gnolls and 6 of you.<br/>\nBeing the mage, you step back out of combat to be more effective. However,<br/>\nthe whole thing is a mess of creatures moving back and forth. Everytime you<br/>\ntry to get a creature to unleash your mystic might you&#39;re selecting either<br/>\none of your own guys, or the dead putz that&#39;s on the ground. You&#39;re friends<br/>\nare screaming for help, and the Barbarian warriors health starts heading<br/>\nsouth. What do you do?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, luckily you remember your old pal and mentor Zalbar, heh heh heh ,<br/>\nand what he told you to do in this situation. Calmly selecting your<br/>\nbarbarian warrior friend using the F2 - F6 keys (F1 selects yourself), and<br/>\nselect from top down. First person on the list if F2, next one down is F3,<br/>\netc...<br/>\n<br/>\n    So your barbarian warrior is selected, and now you hit the /ASSIST<br/>\nbutton. Presto, your target is now the gnoll that your barbarian is<br/>\nfighting. Clicking on another button, and a gnoll convulses as lightning<br/>\narcs through them. YOU have slain a gnoll. Hitting F4 you select that green<br/>\nmagician that&#39;s trying unsuccessfully to be a warrior and trying to pierce a<br/>\ngnoll shaman with a dagger. You sigh, hit /ASSIST and there&#39;s the gnoll<br/>\nshaman. Checking man you figure that you&#39;d better go with a shock of flame<br/>\nand tell the fool to back off. Besides, the Warriors are starting to<br/>\nengage...<br/>\n<br/>\nTHAT&#39;S how you use /assist. Just make sure that after your target is<br/>\nselected, hit your melee attack to turn it off. If not, a passing tag will<br/>\nturn the monster on you.<br/>\n<br/>\nZalbar<br/>\n14th Wizard<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mata &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mata_eq@...\">mata_eq@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: 22 avril, 1999 09:49<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] please explain /assist cmd<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Mata&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mata_eq@...\">mata_eq@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please explain what the /assist command does and how to use it.
