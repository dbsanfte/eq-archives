I do know that we will be highly useful to a group once we get our<br/>\n&gt; escape and portal spells.  I am pretty sure that any high level group will<br/>\n&gt; have a cleric (to cast group divine aura) along with a wizard (to cast group<br/>\n&gt; teleport) in sticky situations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Other things I have seen is that wizards (at least at level 12 with<br/>\n&gt; lightning shock) can be superb kill stealers.  In crushbone there is<br/>\n&gt; commonly a level 12 wizard camping the trainer for his coveted shiny brass<br/>\n&gt; shield.  In 3 or 4 lightning shocks the trainer is dead and no group can<br/>\n&gt; hope to get the kill that quickly unless they have a level 12 wizard as<br/>\n&gt; well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am sad that wizards dont get any additional damage shields after o&#39;kiels<br/>\n&gt; radiation at level 4, and other than that dont really have any group buff<br/>\n&gt; spells at all.  I don&#39;t really know about the higher levels very much, but<br/>\n&gt; wizards dont seem to have a whole lot to offer the group than teleport<br/>\n&gt; spells and a bit of direct damage.  Other classes might very well be more<br/>\n&gt; useful in a group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; More feedback would be appreciated fellow Wizards.

Parties cant be bothered with wizards, they cant buff, cant<br/>\n&gt; heal<br/>\n&gt; and cant really help parties that much...&quot;we were supposed to be heavy<br/>\n&gt; artillery&quot; but that just is not correct. I think a wizard would be most<br/>\n&gt; parties<br/>\n&gt; last choice if they could choose from all the classes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Its very easy to demonstrate the wizard immbalance; get into an arena with a<br/>\n&gt; dual wield barbarian warrior of the same level and see how you do!<br/>\n&gt; Hmm doesn&#39;t sound too promising eh?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have always played a wizard character class in AD&D and UO but I regret<br/>\n&gt; playing one in EQ. I think EQ were nervous about the power wizards in UO and<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t want to unbalance the game. I think they swung the pendalum too far<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; other way. Root &#39;n&#39; Shoot, if that fails death, thats about it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hopefully e-mails will pour in and tell me how wrong I am. Great, show me<br/>\n&gt; its<br/>\n&gt; not the case so I feel I have a character with a future!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Simon<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  bringing the world together.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Get involved.
