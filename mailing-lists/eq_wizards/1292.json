These<br/>\nwizards do give us a very bad name.  I would really like to see some more<br/>\nutility spells for wizards, a more extensive line of magical force stunning<br/>\nspells would be in line with the wizard theme and would make us more useful<br/>\nto groups.  Perhaps we could bestow magic resistance on other classes?  Or<br/>\ngive us more utilities for interrupting other magic using classes to make<br/>\nwizards more effective against npc mage types.  All these things would<br/>\nincrease our usefulness to a group.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Solric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Simon Hinshelwood &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:iktome@...\">iktome@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDear Marziani,<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds reasonable but kill stealing isn&#39;t really a unique charcter ability,<br/>\nit<br/>\nwont make wizards more popular with other parties. Instead it will just<br/>\nconfirm<br/>\nour reputation as something between a scavenger and a leech. Group teleport<br/>\nis<br/>\ndefinately our salvation, but dont other casters get that too? ie Druid, who<br/>\ncan<br/>\nheal and hurt too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Marziani, Michael D.&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Marziani, Michael D.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Marziani@...\">Michael.Marziani@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well I am hoping that this is not so as my level 10 wizard is developing<br/>\n&gt; more.  I do know that we will be highly useful to a group once we get our<br/>\n&gt; escape and portal spells.  I am pretty sure that any high level group will<br/>\n&gt; have a cleric (to cast group divine aura) along with a wizard (to cast<br/>\n </span></blockquote>group<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; teleport) in sticky situations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Other things I have seen is that wizards (at least at level 12 with<br/>\n&gt; lightning shock) can be superb kill stealers.  In crushbone there is<br/>\n&gt; commonly a level 12 wizard camping the trainer for his coveted shiny brass<br/>\n&gt; shield.  In 3 or 4 lightning shocks the trainer is dead and no group can<br/>\n&gt; hope to get the kill that quickly unless they have a level 12 wizard as<br/>\n&gt; well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am sad that wizards dont get any additional damage shields after o&#39;kiels<br/>\n&gt; radiation at level 4, and other than that dont really have any group buff<br/>\n&gt; spells at all.  I don&#39;t really know about the higher levels very much, but<br/>\n&gt; wizards dont seem to have a whole lot to offer the group than teleport<br/>\n&gt; spells and a bit of direct damage.  Other classes might very well be more<br/>\n&gt; useful in a group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; More feedback would be appreciated fellow Wizards.
