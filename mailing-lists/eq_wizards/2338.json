I had a good friend die last night because<br/>\nthe aqua-goblin wizard he was fleeing from was pegging him with arrows<br/>\nfired through a mountain.  Can non-named NPC wizards even use bows (much<br/>\nless those firing vorpal-arrows)?  This same friend has also died from<br/>\nunprovoked critters attacking through the walls of shops.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI was reading last week where someone was 500+ feet up in a tree and being<br/>\nattacked by a lion on the ground.  The lion was hitting him and doing<br/>\ndamage... from 500+ vertical feet!  Okay, I can see what Verant was trying<br/>\nto do with this.  They didn&#39;t want people in trees attacking from safty.<br/>\nWe *should* be able to do this though!  We&#39;ve got got bigger brains and<br/>\nopposable thumbs.  A far better solution would be to have the critter run<br/>\nlike hell and to avoid the area in the future.  Or put in a leopard or a<br/>\ncougar, something that can climb trees, into the game (though in reality,<br/>\nthese would probably run like the dickens too).<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t personnally died this way, so I won&#39;t use the Griffon vs Safespot<br/>\nexploit the other guy was mentioning.  The first time I do however, I plan<br/>\nto head out there and start blasting as a form of protest.  Consider it<br/>\ncheating, or making up exp lost to an unfairly demise, or what have you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>PS. an exploit is not something that is &quot;morally wrong.&quot; It is the &quot;use&quot; of<br/>\na bug in everquest to your advantage.<br/>\n Who cares if it&#39;s considered an exploit or not. My rule of thimb is: &quot;If<br/>\nit works for you and the game allows it, then do it!&quot;  If it&#39;s considered<br/>\nan exploit then don&#39;t tell anyone.  Basically an &quot;Exploit&quot; is anything that<br/>\nis considered morally wrong.  Thievery is morally wrong but the game allows<br/>\nit.  Just don&#39;t brag about your &quot;exploits&quot; and its&#39; ok.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I don&#39;t agree with his rule of thumb, &quot;If it&#39;s lets you, do it&quot;.<br/>\nHell, a couple of levels ago I stopped rooting snakes because they look so<br/>\npitiful stuck to the ground while I was blasting.  But if a critter cheats<br/>\nme and I find a way to cheat it back, I&#39;m gonna do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Pennaggolan, 3rd Circle Wizard of Felwithe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
