I made the choice, long ago, to use a dagger as my<br/>\n&gt; melee weapon as opposed to a staff of some sort. Now I am finding that<br/>\n&gt; everyone is speaking of magical staves, and never see talk of magical<br/>\n&gt; daggers. Would any of you happen to know where I might be able to find<br/>\n&gt; myself a runed dagger of some sort?<br/>\n&gt; Thanks much for the answers!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; BTW I think a news group version of this list would be a great idea. I like<br/>\n&gt; the list alot, but trying to read 100+ messages every morning before I<br/>\n&gt; leave for classes kind of sucks.<br/>\n&gt; Garret E.
