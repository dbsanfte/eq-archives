I keep getting told that the journal strongbox I need to get is in the water by the freeport docks but I cannot find it!  I&#39;ve tried killing the sharks to see if it was loot, and I didn&#39;t get any loot. Can anybody who is familiar with this quest help?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Michael Cherin </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
