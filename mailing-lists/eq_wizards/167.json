Zone to BB, hook a right at the crossroads, and follow that path all the<br/>\nway past Kaladim til you get to the last guard fort before the port (If you hit a<br/>\nlittle henge stone, you&#39;ve gone too far).  At the fort, go left.  You&#39;ll come to a group<br/>\nof about 6 stones, with two dwarf NPC&#39;s.  This area is rife with large skunks, goblin<br/>\ngrunts, and rock spiderlings.  There are even a few Krag chicks, which give great<br/>\nexp (for level 5, anyway).  Make sure you con the chicks 1st, some of them are toughies.<br/>\nWhen you load up on the loot, you can run right to the port.  There&#39;s a high elf merchant<br/>\ninside and to the right.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you hit six, you&#39;ll have graduated from this area, except for the chicks.  But<br/>\nfor 5, it&#39;s a good area for the solo wiz.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nXimena (Fennin Ro)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Empress <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, April 18, 1999 11:27 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [eq_wizards] (no subject)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  hey everyone, i&#39;m a level five high elf, and i&#39;m really scared to leave the greater faydark, everytime i do, i get killed by something, but everthing where i&#39;m fighting is green now!!
