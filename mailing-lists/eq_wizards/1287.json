Parties cant be bothered with wizards, they cant buff, cant heal<br/>\nand cant really help parties that much...&quot;we were supposed to be heavy<br/>\nartillery&quot; but that just is not correct. I think a wizard would be most parties<br/>\nlast choice if they could choose from all the classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts very easy to demonstrate the wizard immbalance; get into an arena with a<br/>\ndual wield barbarian warrior of the same level and see how you do!<br/>\nHmm doesn&#39;t sound too promising eh?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always played a wizard character class in AD&D and UO but I regret<br/>\nplaying one in EQ. I think EQ were nervous about the power wizards in UO and<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to unbalance the game. I think they swung the pendalum too far the<br/>\nother way. Root &#39;n&#39; Shoot, if that fails death, thats about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully e-mails will pour in and tell me how wrong I am. Great, show me its<br/>\nnot the case so I feel I have a character with a future!<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
