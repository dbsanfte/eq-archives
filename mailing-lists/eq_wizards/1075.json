No quills, no paper, just the lexicon and runes.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe two spells I have made so far are Project Lightning and Pillar of Fire.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTo make Project lightning you use the runes of Periphery and Fulgeration.  For Pillar of Fire you need Proximity and Nagafen.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI can make another of both of these.  Tell me if you are interested in buying one of these two spells, or the unbuyable Project Lightning.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYou also need books for other spells, the spells these books contain are:\r<br/>\nWizards Cannon:\r<br/>\nIdentify, Project Lightning, Pillar of fire\r<br/>\nDoctrine of Wizardry:\r<br/>\nEnstill, Fire Spiral of Al&#39;Kabor, Cast Force, Column of Lightning, Tox Portal, Shock spiral of Al&#39;Kabor, Energy Storm\r<br/>\nIpsors Enlightenment III:\r<br/>\nNullify Magic, Circle of Force, Lava Storm, Thunderclab, Immobilize, Common Portal, Frost Spiral fo Al&#39;Kabor\r<br/>\nIpsors Enlightenment IV:\r<br/>\nGravity Flux, Wrath of Al&#39;kabor, Ice Commet, Super Nova, Paralizing Earth\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs you can see the spells you can research vary from level 16 all the way to the ungodly 1100 damage ice commet at level 49.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI&#39;m sure there are other books, but I havn&#39;t found them.  If you come across them, let me know!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThese spells were read off with below average in old Erudian.  I&#39;d really love it if someone on the Rathe who has excellent would train me in it.  I&#39;ll pay 20pp for the honor.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what paralizing earth is, my guess is that its along the root line of spells.  I guess you *have* to research Ice Commet, Super Nova, etc or buy them from a wizard who made them.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYou didn&#39;t believe me when I said this was a massive spoiler did you?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOne last note, I am almost certain that there are more spells you can research.  I have a rune that starts with a &quot;V&quot;, forget the name of it at this instant.  I already translated all the components required to make these spells from these book, and none of them had this rune as a component.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFastus\r<br/>\n21st level Wizard\r<br/>\nThe Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
