At 8th, I was able to make a run to Innothule.<br/>\nI made 3 runs overall, and died once entering South Ro... and never in<br/>\nInnothule proper, to grab netted.

The only magical items I have beside<br/>\none woven pants I got are a pair of dervish rings, since those can be<br/>\ngotten at bargain prices in North Ro (1pp for a pair is the max I&#39;ve<br/>\nseen).<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
