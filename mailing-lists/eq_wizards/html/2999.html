&gt; Same effect i have seen in mistmore .. grouping with many people i have<br/>
&gt; seen what diference can make overpowered items... warrior hitting for 70 a<br/>
&gt; hit it is 140 - 160 counting a bash ... without mana use a turn!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Warriors hitting for 70 when they are in their mid twenties is extremely<br/>
rare. They might sometime get a critical hit that high. Or, maybe, if<br/>
they are twinked with the best of items, I might believe it. Otherwise,<br/>
I think you probably saw something rare and consider it a regularity.<br/>
<br/>
You know, sometimes root holds all the battle and let&#39;s you med and fire<br/>
some more. Rarely, but sometimes. A warrior seeing this would go and<br/>
complain about the overpowered wizards. You have to take things with a<br/>
perspective.<br/>
