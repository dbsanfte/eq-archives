<div id="ygrps-yiv-512655213">I wish to create a &quot;Tome of Magi Lor&quot; web page. If you have or know where I <br/>
can get a CGI/HTML script that will allow others to add their comments to <br/>
this web page please let me know. What I am looking for is a CGI data base <br/>
that allows external entries to be added then automatically updates a FAQ <br/>
sheet. The automatic part is a must cause I like to play EQ too much to get <br/>
stuck updating a web page. I can screen the page and omit others. I would <br/>
really like a CIG data base that would allow me to have a login and password <br/>
security that way those pesky fighters could not steal information. Also I <br/>
would be able to track who said what about quests or items to glean more <br/>
info from then if needed.<br/>
