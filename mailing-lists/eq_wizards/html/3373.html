<div id="ygrps-yiv-649763084">According to Paul Kundrat:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;     For levels 6 to about 9 try the gnoll guards and scrawny gnoll guards, not in<br/>
&gt; Blackburrow, but on the Everfrost side in the tunnel leading to Blackburrow.  I think<br/>
&gt; there are 4 spawns (if I remember correctly), two at the entrance, one at the 2nd corner,<br/>
&gt; and one more in a little nook a ways down the hall.  The only bad part is that if you have<br/>
&gt; to zone into BB you may run into a train. A good thing is that passersby may be able to<br/>
&gt; help if you get into trouble and they drop fairly decent loot.  Good luck.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At level 8, only two out of 4 guards still give you experience, and at level 9,<br/>
all are green, but one at times still give you a microscopic sliver of XP.<br/>
You may solo them at level 6, at a reasonable rate, but you then start killing them<br/>
faster than they respawn after that.<br/>
<br/>
You also quickly learn the layout of Blackburrow, and where it is safe to hunt<br/>
topside.<br/>
<br/>
If you do not care about loot, hunting at the border of the everfrost plain is good,<br/>
as there are plenty of large spiderlings, skeletons for level 6-7, then polar bears<br/>
at level 8 and 9, then you may start hunting lower level orcs and snow leopards. If<br/>
you run in trouble, you have guards nearby :)<br/>
