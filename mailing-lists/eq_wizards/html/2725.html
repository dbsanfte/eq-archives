<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey hey, don&#39;t worry about it.  I&#39;ve been playing both a Shaman & Druid to <br/>
get a feel for it, but nothing compares to a Wizard.  I&#39;m thinking of <br/>
dropping my Druid character because she just plain sucks. Druids are good <br/>
solo and group characters up to about 20level, then that&#39;s it.  All my high <br/>
45+ level friends tell me they never invite Druids in their parties <br/>
anymore...but Wizards are ALWAYS welcome.<br/>
At high levels, a Druid will not have good enough armor to tank...so they <br/>
essentially become weak Wizards.<br/>
<br/>
By that time, a Wizard of equal level will have strong shields and DD <br/>
spells, AND all the teleport spells of a Druid.  So what about a Druid&#39;s DOT <br/>
spells, you can&#39;t kite Lady Voxx.  :)  (or can you? hehe)<br/>
Nor will a Druid&#39;s heal spells be worthy of a Cleric.  So why have them?<br/>
<br/>
The grass always looks greener somewhere else, but trust me....other <br/>
characters are envious of a Wizard&#39;s spells as well.<br/>
<br/>
We *maybe* need to be tweaked here and there...but stop comparing us to <br/>
other characters.  It will get us nowhere.  We have a few 50Level Wizards on <br/>
our server that have demonstrated the effectiveness of our spells.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO,<br/>
