<b>Subject:</b> Question about offense and defense (and ac) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1423277813">Hi all,<br/>
just a question about defense and offense .<br/>
First of all, i am an erudine wizzard level 12 .Yesterday i talked with a<br/>
wizzard level 13 and i was surprised when he tells me that his ac was ...<br/>
211 . He is an half elf, so i agree they have more agility then us. But i<br/>
already make some test and it seems that +8 in agility only give 1 in ac (i<br/>
tried with two rings +4 agility). Our dex are the same and for the armor he<br/>
only get 5 ac more then me. My current armor class (without any spel) is<br/>
177. Not bad, not good i agree :). So i come to the fact : what is the<br/>
maximum defense skill for a wizzard ??? Can you gain offense (and defense)<br/>
skill vs green creatures ? I know of a rules telling that a wizzard can have<br/>
3+ (level *3) in his attack skill (piercing for example) but i know that i<br/>
am at 48 at defense so this rule dones&#39;t seem to apply for offense and<br/>
defense (only for piercing blunt ect). So someone can tell me more about<br/>
this rule or about ac in general (for wizzard?). And last question any good<br/>
idea where i can find good armor for a wizzard ? (actually the best armor i<br/>
get is bear boot 5ac).<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all<br/>
<br/>
