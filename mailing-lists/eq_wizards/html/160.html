<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642014930">Ok I have a problem....<br/>
<br/>
I am a level 8 Human Wizard in Freeport, Xegony server. My problem is I do not have any friends playing EQ. My game so far has been solo. The levels are coming very slow. I have grouped up with people several times. This turns into a nightmare. Most of the time we all just run around aimlessly, it takes so much time just to get sometime going its not really worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any suggestions? I have a friend who is going to buy the game soon, its just hard to wait. It took me 1 week to level up from 7 to 8.<br/>
Not to mention Humans can&#39;t see in the dark.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the long winning post.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks <br/>
