<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-886592092">I recently purchased the root spell and tried it out on an easy target, a<br/>
large rat, to see how well it would work. I&#39;m currently level 7. The spell<br/>
hardly ever works for me. Will it be more effective the more you cast it? I<br/>
can&#39;t see trying to use it on higher level creatures to gain xp if I can&#39;t<br/>
even root a large rat.<br/>
