<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116868986">Thanks for the info on Lydl.  I assume he is in the East Freeport zone and not<br/>
<br/>
North Ro?<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t found the locked box.  I made the same mistake thinking you could<br/>
swim to the island, but after re-reading the info you are given, I believe you<br/>
have<br/>
to take the boat out.  I have taken the boat out to the first island stop,<br/>
searched<br/>
and found nothing.  I also made it to the second stop, searched and found<br/>
nothing.<br/>
I had to stop playing at this point, but I understand there is one more island<br/>
stop<br/>
(it was my first trip on the boat).  Let me know if you find it or get any<br/>
more<br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
On the bright side, my swimming skill is pretty high now!<br/>
<br/>
                                                                        Thanks<br/>
again,<br/>

&gt; Lydl Mastat is near the East Freeport.  He walks around between 1pm to 7pm<br/>
&gt; game time.  In regard to the second quest, where did you find the locked<br/>
&gt; box?  I swam across but find nothing.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have found 2 different quests which I am having problems with.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1.  Find Lydl Mastat outside of Freeport and get the locked book from<br/>
&gt; &gt; him.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have tried to find him out both gates, in North Ro, and in East<br/>
&gt; &gt; Commanlands<br/>
&gt; &gt; and can&#39;t find him.  Where is he?  Does he only appear at certain<br/>
&gt; &gt; times?  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have looked MANY times and can&#39;t find him.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2.  Get the locked strongbox back.  I have found that the box is on an<br/>
&gt; &gt; island<br/>
&gt; &gt; which is straight out from the docks.  Is it possible to swim there or<br/>
&gt; &gt; do I need<br/>
&gt; &gt; a boat?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
