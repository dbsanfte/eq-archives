<div id="ygrps-yiv-454886873">You could almost belive verrant wants camping for items! i mean NOT anything they have done to try and fix it helps against camping, it only makes it worse. and if this goes on i think alot of ppl will leave EQ for this reason. Soon there will be AC to play and more games will come iï¿½m sure.<br/>
We are paying customers and not many ppl have 10 hours sessions to waste on camping for an item they should be able to get right away if they are apropiate level and group.<br/>
The majority of the campers are the ones that where lv 50 2-3 months after release and they will always get those items, someone from Veerant wrote once that they cant balance the game after those who are powergaming!!!! Why the hell are they doing that now then with items! that is a question i would like to have an anwser tho.<br/>
<br/>
Take  me for an example, sometimes i have so much to do in workload so i cant play for a week or 2 and when i can play i dont want to spend all that time camping for items. But i do want them so the only thing to do is to camp for them ?. But i hate camping so i go without those items that i could have at my level. Most of the items i have i have gotten from friends that are high levels. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; the fact that it goes against the boreing camping sessions.  personally the <br/>
&gt; items should be always spawned on npcs  not for the reason that i want items <br/>
&gt; but for the fact that it would stop some abuse of zone camping items, allow <br/>
&gt; alot of players to get item and enjoy the game more with out sitting ina room <br/>
