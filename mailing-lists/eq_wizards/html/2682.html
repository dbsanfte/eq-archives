<div id="ygrps-yiv-252655673">well, i don&#39;t have an answer for u, but i think Verant royally screwed up with the PC faction system they implemented.  anyway, i say if Verant is going to continue with this patsy faction crap, they need to at least post how u can alter ur faction in a positive manner.  or just totally remove the stupid friggin PC faction system.<br/>
<br/>

    Hello, fellow Wizards!<br/>
     <br/>
    Several weeks ago I participated in a guild war and slew a High Elf not knowing that there would be a faction hit as a result. Well, I can no longer purchase or sell items in Felwithe. I&#39;ve tried everything that I know of to improve my faction standing with the Merchants there, but to no avail. My faction standing with the guards is &quot;amiable&quot; -- It is with the &quot;Merchants&quot; that I need a faction adjustment. Does anyone have any ideas? Suggestions? Personal experience? Would appreciate any and all advice.<br/>
