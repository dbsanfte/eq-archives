<div id="ygrps-yiv-756075346">I agree a farmiliar would be nice.  I used to play GS3 and wizards <br/>
and farmiliars in that game and they were great.  But it is useless to write <br/>
to feedback with this idea, beacuse we all know what Verant will say: &quot;this <br/>
will create imbalance.&quot;  We ar ebatter off sticking to minor things we have a <br/>
shot of getting.<br/>
