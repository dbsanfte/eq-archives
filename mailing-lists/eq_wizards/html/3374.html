<b>Subject:</b> [EQ Wizard/Items] Nightshade wreath <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-416921164">A friend wishes a nightshade wreath (and from the stats who wouldnt). Another friend had this to say....<br/>
<br/>
Nightshade wreath is in the DEEPEST part of Mistmoore<br/>
castle&#39;s first level.... TONS of mobs to get by.. yes you can get by them<br/>
with inviso and if your high enough (48th+ or so) you can solo pull mobs<br/>
away from her &quot;door.&quot;  But alas shes (Maid Issisi) guarded by 3 mobs and theres a few right nearby.. so its kinda tough... <br/>
<br/>
So, can anyone suggest strategy or spells or classes or levels to go after this thing? Ive never seen one auctioned, but heard that they are trade only.<br/>
