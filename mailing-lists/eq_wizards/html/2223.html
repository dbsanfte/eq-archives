Actually, just to let u know, both AIR and HATE planes have already been<br/>
created, i know others that have gone their, i also check frequently around for<br/>
the GMs who VERY OFTEN reside in the AIR PLANE but also seen em a few times in<br/>
the PLANE OF HATE. Our specialization will also be implemented within the month<br/>
of June(so they say :P) Don&#39;t give up hope yet!<br/>
