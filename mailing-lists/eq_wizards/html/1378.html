&gt;&quot;It appears that yes we wizards<br/>
&gt;to a increasing damage amount per circle of spells (near double each time),<br/>
&gt;but what troubles me is that the monsters get factorially more hit points.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t quite understand your point here.� Are you saying that we should be<br/>
&gt;able to take out creatures in one or two shots???� That&#39;s crazy, it would<br/>
&gt;totally unbalance the game.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree on this<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;� Of course the creatures are going to get more<br/>
&gt;HP the higher lvl you go.� We still do more dmg than any other class in any<br/>
&gt;given round.� I can now cast a spell that does 175 dmg.� I can cast this<br/>
&gt;spell 6 times and enstill 1 time.� I&#39;m currently taking out yellow Tidal<br/>
&gt;Lords solo in the Cauldron and in a group, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nice thing ..... a necromancer can do it also and will not have to sit and<br/>
meditate after this why?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have reduced the amount of dmg<br/>
&gt;our tanks normally take because the creatures die much faster.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Enchanter is much better on this if you fight multiple enemies his buffs are<br/>
valid all time you will spend your mana very fast and he will have a pet after<br/>
a fight.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&quot;But, as it has been<br/>
&gt;pointed out, the wizard is constantly on his ass meditating.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Of course he is, that&#39;s part of being a wizard, or any other magic-using<br/>
&gt;class.�� Sitting on your ass meditating is not any different for a mage or<br/>
&gt;enchanter than it is a wizard, so once again I miss your point here.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is much different a magician or necro or enchanter will have to sit much<br/>
much less then you, ask somone who played at last two classes to over lv 20.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&quot;1.� Speed up casting time for Wizards.� This would allow us to cast<br/>
&gt;in-between attacks with our newest spells.(the only class that would be able<br/>
&gt;to do so).&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;First off, our casting time IS faster than the other magic-using classes.<br/>
&gt;Secondly, what you purpose about casting in between attacks would seriously<br/>
&gt;hinder our class.� As it is now, if we are in a group and attack too often,<br/>
&gt;the creature turns to us and starts ripping us a new one.� Not a good thing.<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s why you spread your attacks out, never blasting them one right after<br/>
&gt;another.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No need for faster casting time but... <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;that extra little kick, although there is nothing &#39;little&#39; about being able<br/>
&gt;to deliver 175 dmg in one shot.� A warrior of the same lvl with a 2-h sword<br/>
&gt;can still only do 40 dmg in one round.� I CAN solo 2-3 blues before I&#39;m out<br/>
&gt;of mana.� I&#39;ve been hunting Bosuns and Shamans, both of which are blue to<br/>
&gt;me, in the Cauldron and can usually take 2-3 of them before I have to med.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm what do you think how many blue can solo a expert magician at lv 22<br/>
without<br/>
need to med and he can survive 3 blues in same time if he sacrifices a pet and<br/>
sometimes also win. (not to mention some other magic users)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My comment wich i post under other tread i repeat it so to try to explain it<br/>
better and not to multyoly treads on same subject.<br/>
<br/>
In my first post i don&#39;t explained it good so i try to explain it better. <br/>
I like to play a wizard as i play wizards in all games for more than 12<br/>
years now, but if we talk about balancing all magic users to same lv then i<br/>
see some problems with� a wizard class, i wish to see your comments on this<br/>
and other ideas to make a game more playable without throwing a balance out<br/>
or tring to make a overpowerfull class.<br/>
<br/>
First positive things<br/>
<br/>
-� wizards are great for plane(after 34+ lv), group travel (druid is best<br/>
in individual and nearly as good in group)<br/>
-� wizards are best in DD damage spells (but not in damage to mana ratio DOT)<br/>
-� wizards spells are less resisted and it damage at last for one part<br/>
moust other class spells are resisted full<br/>
-� wizard is fastest to deal a massive damage in shortest time (but a price?)<br/>
<br/>
Negativ things<br/>
<br/>
- Wizards have lowest defence, hit points and ac of all classes (lowest<br/>
combat survivel)<br/>
- wizard spells do massive damage but also use masive mana but when wizard<br/>
uses it mana it is useless. Fighting is not a wizard strong side, wizard<br/>
dont have pets, dont have buffs, dont heal, they dont run well.<br/>
- Wizards risks very very much in combat agains only 2 blues<br/>
<br/>
First i don&#39;t wish to say that a wizard is not good or playable class it is<br/>
nice but it is also a class with most downtime of all clases so as a result<br/>
a 2 equaly expert people playing sametime will never get equal play time,<br/>
wizard will most time be in his book. Why this hmm lets see<br/>
<br/>
All other Magic users have better mana usage then wizard, why pet is a best<br/>
mana use it damages, it defend, it tount and it never expires until it dies<br/>
( i personaly dont like this pets i wish to have a cat or dog od mouse :-)<br/>
not for combat but as familiar ) . Buffs as result do more damage and DOT<br/>
spells are much more mana efficent then our DD spells. <br/>
<br/>
So what can be done to make a wizard a time efficent to play as other<br/>
classes are. I suggest a faster mana recovering ratio not too much but a<br/>
1.3 or 1.2 faster times can help and its easy to implement one number<br/>
change in formula and go go go.<br/>
<br/>
Here i dont put in effect of specialization as for now it is not in game (<br/>
long beta ) and i dont know if in later levels exist any only wizard mana<br/>
regeneration booster but i heared of &quot;mana stone&quot; but noone knows what it<br/>
is and when you find it. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks all for reading and as i live in italy my english is not maxed yet,<br/>
but i please you to join a discussion and to not take to hard my spelling<br/>
mistakes. <br/>
