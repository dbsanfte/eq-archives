<div id="ygrps-yiv-409582282">It sounds like either you need to zone to have your languages update, or he<br/>
is teaching you some other language and should really change the wording on<br/>
his macro.<br/>

&gt;I have a friend who is teaching me Elvish. He spams me with a macro, &quot;you<br/>
&gt;are learning the Elvish tongue&quot;, and I occasionally get a message saying my<br/>
&gt;language skill is improving. But then I noticed that the only language I<br/>
&gt;have a skill for, besides common, is Erudian, which is at awful level. Does<br/>
&gt;anyone know if you can learn the other languages if they are not listed in<br/>
&gt;your skills? Thanks. </span></blockquote></div>
