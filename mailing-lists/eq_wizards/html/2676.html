&lt;role&gt;Lim&#39;Dul furiously shakes the irritating gnome off his leg and looks <br/>
for some leaves to wipe the stains off&lt;/role&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One another note, I&#39;ve been experimenting with a Druid on the newer server <br/>
just to see what the fuss was about.  I must say it was faster getting up <br/>
levels than I had with a Wizard.  To me, a Druid is more like a weaker <br/>
Wizard but with stonger melee.  Everything on the magic side was a bit <br/>
slower...you gain spells every 5 levels and you don&#39;t get meditate till 8. <br/>
:P   I must say it WAS fun playing a class that could do a little of <br/>
everything...<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;ll still take a Wizard anyday. :)<br/>
