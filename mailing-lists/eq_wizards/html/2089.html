So basically what you are saying is &quot;I don&#39;t have a problem so you<br/>
shouldn&#39;t too and you&#39;re just whiners&quot;, right?<br/>
<br/>
Listen up, bucko. If you don&#39;t have a problem, then go play some more<br/>
and stop clogging the list with useless posts like that. It&#39;s obvious<br/>
that most people here DO have problems and we have decided to do<br/>
something about them. Your little stories about UO are fascinating, I&#39;m<br/>
sure, but off topic for the list, and the topic.<br/>
<br/>
More specifically, no one cares about what your opinion is. The problems<br/>
we are talking about have been noticed by many many people (all whiners,<br/>
by your logic) and do not stem out of selfish ambition and power<br/>
hungriness. They are not personal problems (or the lack of thereof) but<br/>
universal wizard problems.<br/>
<br/>
Get it?<br/>
<br/>
Here, I&#39;ll make it simple - it&#39;s like if your town was being bombed and<br/>
your house didn&#39;t get hit and you&#39;d go and talk about how all these<br/>
homeless people are just whiners and tell them stories about your life<br/>
in another town.<br/>
<br/>
HTH, HAND.</div>
