<div id="ygrps-yiv-498519719">Verant has always stated that classes are not balanced at every level, but as a<br/>
whole.  I have yet to meet a happy level 24 magician, or an early level<br/>
enchanter.  Magicians sometimes  go eight levels before getting their next DD<br/>
spell.  Enchanters get resisted way more than us. (They never figured out that<br/>
they need to boost Cha, not Int).  My point is that levels 1-11 WE SUCK.  12-19<br/>
we&#39;re growing, and 20+ get out of our way.  Don&#39;t look at mana to damage<br/>
ratios, look at damage to time ratios.  That is the important stat because the<br/>
quicker the mob is dead, the less down time the group has, and nobody past the<br/>
level of 20 can touch us in that area.  As for specialization, if any other<br/>
class specializes in evocation they are doing themselves a great disservice.<br/>
It&#39;s not their area, just as conjuration is not ours.  Necros and Enchanters<br/>
live and die with Alteration, Mages conjure, Druids Abjurate, etc.  I<br/>
personally like the fact that wizards start so weak, people give up with it and<br/>
that separates the wheat from the chaff.  I&#39;m glad to see that you are sticking<br/>
with it.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, I found out that tanks don&#39;t see the damage that we inflict on<br/>
the mob.  We see &quot;mob says hit for 86 non melee damage&quot;.  The tanks get the the<br/>
message &quot;a mobs skin freezes&quot; But I digress.<br/>
