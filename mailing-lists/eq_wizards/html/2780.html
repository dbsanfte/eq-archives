<div id="ygrps-yiv-1284553396">Hey, the water crystal staff isn&#39;t the one that looks like a little purple <br/>
ice cream cone does it?  :)  Getting me curious now...maybe I&#39;ll spend some <br/>
time sitting my butt down in Rathe tonight to see if he shows up.  hehe<br/>
<br/>
One another note...for the person who asked about a Wizard&#39;s guild on <br/>
Veeshan.  There isn&#39;t any.  Just a whole lot of powergamers. :)  The <br/>
infamous FoH guild comes to mind, along with the Companions, and Aradani as <br/>
some of the other bigger ones.<br/>
