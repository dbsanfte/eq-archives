<div id="ygrps-yiv-120747934">According to Marziani, Michael D.:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Aye I have seen the rod you speak of.  Tis the Shimmering Orb, not sure<br/>
&gt; where it comes from though.  Does anyone know what level you need to be to<br/>
&gt; get the flowing black robes?  I have started to see more and more<br/>
&gt; spellcasters with this item on them, and some are only level 20.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since it is a spellcaster-only item, I expect that any player that gets it as<br/>
loot will sell it quick.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As far as looking &quot;cool&quot;, one of my main reasons for wanting to get to level<br/>
&gt; 24 (I am 21 now) is for a stylistic reason, namely levitate.  I just think<br/>
&gt; this is one of the coolest spells out there, even beyond its practical uses.<br/>
<br/>
