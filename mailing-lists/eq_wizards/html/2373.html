&gt; If people paid only for bugless software, the computer industry would crash down<br/>
&gt; overnight :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Software industry faces two choices:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - Refine their products until nothing can be done, release it after three years,<br/>
&gt;         and ask $300 per copy<br/>
&gt; - Release a working product, release it after a year, and ask $50 per copy<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another problem is that, if you want to release a product that will be used by 100,000<br/>
&gt; persons, and want it bugless, you need to use 100,000 beta-testers over a period roughly<br/>
&gt; equal to the product lifetime... or people will find bugs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (non-regression testing also delay fixing, yadda, yadda)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I said I would stop, but this is just wrong. It&#39;s what the industry<br/>
wants you to believe. You CAN release adequate products. I&#39;m not talking<br/>
completely bug free, especially in a game like EQ. But EQ wasn&#39;t even<br/>
complete! Even in the design and development department! The game is<br/>
still in Beta, don&#39;t you see? If we dismiss the few little bugs, what<br/>
about things like specialization or the rouge skills that have only been<br/>
worked in three months after release? Why does my Skull of Jhen&#39;Tra look<br/>
like a wooden totem? Why do some of the research spells don&#39;t work? The<br/>
research mechanism is there - it&#39;s the same as any combine mechanism.<br/>
But some stuff don&#39;t work - why? Why was jewelry fixed only now?<br/>
<br/>
These are all things that have nothing to do with coding and everything<br/>
to do with design. What I&#39;m griping about is not only the existing low<br/>
quality, but the ever present decrease in quality as well. Verant<br/>
released an uncompleted product. No other industry would tolerate a<br/>
manufacturer releasing a product so uncompleted as EQ at release date.<br/>
Whether we like it or not, we are being fucked up the ass (excuse my<br/>
french) by game developers. Yes, they are pushed by marketing which is<br/>
in place pushed by demands. I understand that the developers themselves,<br/>
the programmers would like to make the game perfect.<br/>
<br/>
But, the end product is that the consumer is getting an uncompleted<br/>
product for very complete money. The great irony of this is that this is<br/>
driven by the consumer&#39;s lack of will power to abstain from buying this<br/>
buggy software and the consumer&#39;s great demand. Face it - entertainment<br/>
is not like other businesses. You can get two different microwaves and<br/>
they&#39;ll both heat. But two different games will always be much more<br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
And so, the consumers are the biggest justifiers of this phenomenon,<br/>
becoming the closing link in this circle of inadequacy and lack of<br/>
backlash. We can only hope that in the future, with the rise of game<br/>
popularity and the rise of choce in any genre, developers won&#39;t allow<br/>
themselves to release such products. Simply because the competitor will<br/>
be better and bug free as well.<br/>
