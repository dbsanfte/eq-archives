<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895027731">If you are playing +PVP then I can see twinking have a negative effect<br/>
on gameplay, but in -PVP it doesnt. &quot;Then all the honest players will be<br/>
left behind&quot; from your post suggests that you think the game is a race<br/>
to get to the finish line. Well, words in, the race was won by some<br/>
halfling rogue who reached lvl 50 before you.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t like others twinking, don&#39;t adventure with them. Sneer at<br/>
them because they&#39;re &quot;rich snobs who got money from mommy and daddy&quot;.<br/>
Challenge them to a duel, show them that it&#39;s not the size of the sword<br/>
that matters, and then take the bigger sword from them when you win!<br/>
Laugh at them when they die. Roleplay the jealous commoner who has to<br/>
work for his/her way in this world. And feel better knowing that you are<br/>
the true winner of the race to have fun and enjoy the game!<br/>
<br/>
You know what I&#39;m tired of? People trying to enforce their playing<br/>
styles on others. They think that just because a person does something<br/>
that they don&#39;t like (but doesn&#39;t actually hurt them) that the person<br/>
should be banned! Bah! Just as in real life there are people born with a<br/>
silver spoon up their a**. There are people who like to powergame and<br/>
dont roleplay. Live with it. Learn from it. And go buy yourself a<br/>
platinum spoon with your hard earned money. Then wave it in their face,<br/>
type /rude &lt;twinker&gt;, and go on your merry way.<br/>

&gt; I hear a lot of players say that it is wrong and I agree. I hear few say<br/>
&gt; leave it alone! I and a lot of other players left twinking alone in UO and<br/>
&gt; look where that game is now. Same for Diablo. It does effect me and my<br/>
&gt; character cause it will lead to every other player having to twinkle just to<br/>
&gt; play on even ground. Then all the honest players will be left behind like<br/>
&gt; UO.<br/>

&gt; Twinking the Definition....Giving high level gear to a low level character.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I agree that &quot;low level&quot; is not lower level. I a 10th level wizard gave<br/>
&gt; items to a fighter who is 7th level. Things I can not use but he can and it<br/>
&gt; helps our party. He being only 3 levels under me. This just makes sense. But<br/>
&gt; when a 20th level character gives items high in value to a less then 10th<br/>
&gt; level character that is simply foolish and exploitable.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now at 5th level I did find a mighty magical item that someone had<br/>
&gt; mistakenly dropped. I belive this is fair in the game. But to have a<br/>
&gt; character outfitted by other, in a guild or no, is simply cheating and will<br/>
&gt; ruin the balance of the game.<br/>
