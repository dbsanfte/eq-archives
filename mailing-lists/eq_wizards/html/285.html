<b>Subject:</b> Places in Karana plains to solo? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759215462">I am a 15th level wizard on Xegony and have had a bad run of luck recently.<br/>
Seems I have no problem with coins (I have 50 plat in the bank and 7 plat on<br/>
me).  I cannot seem to push into 16th level.  <br/>
<br/>
Can someone tell me in what part of karana (north, south ,east west) I can<br/>
solo my wizard?  I play on my lunch hour and would like to solo for that<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
