I&#39;ve heard you can make compasses and collapsable fishing poles, and compasses<br/>
comand quite a premium on the market (good bye sense heading).<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody know the advantages of the collapsable fishing pole?<br/>
What else can you make?<br/>
<br/>
By the way tinkering was my sole reason for creating a gnome.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m a 12th (almost 13th WhoooHooo!) Gnome wizard and I would like to do<br/>
&gt; what all Gnomes do best and that is tinker.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Has anyone else done any tinkering?  What did you make?  Was it hard to<br/>
&gt; make, was it useful, were you able to sell it for profit?  Where did you<br/>
&gt; get the parts... how did you figure out how to make it?  etc... etc...<br/>
