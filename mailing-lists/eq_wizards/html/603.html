<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007048577">Runes are used in later lvls for Research of new spells.  Some highger 16th<br/>
and above lvl spells can only be created (not bought) by combining rune to<br/>
make the spell.  I have finally gotten my Old Erudin to Excellent and can<br/>
read the books offered by our guilds.  These books tell you what Runes amke<br/>
which spells, so if you found one Keep it safe until you reach uppers lvls.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, where were you hunting that you found the Rune of Banding?<br/>
