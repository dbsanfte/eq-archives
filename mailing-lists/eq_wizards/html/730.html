<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648084938">The other night I played in Oasis for about 6 hours and got 1 bubble within lvl 20. Then this morning my co-op was closed for school so I got to play for an extra 2 hours, and boom! I hit lvl 20. I cheered and yelped and ran off to buy my new spells.<br/>
<br/>
- Force Shock<br/>
- Tashans Clash<br/>
- Elemental Skin<br/>
- Enstill<br/>
<br/>
And later tonight I am going to go back to Fewlthiwe and buy my gate spells *cheers*<br/>
Well, after I got my spells I had 30 mins before I had to logoff for the night. So I am all pumped up not a single kill in my belt under lvl 20, so I run off<br/>
<br/>
- Cast Tashans Clash - does a 2 - 3 second stun.<br/>
- Cast Enstill (65 mana) RESISTS!<br/>
- Cast Force Shock (120 mana if I recall) RESISTS!<br/>
<br/>
There goes a VAST majortiy of  mana,. I yell oh shit, dish out a few shock of ice since it was the only spell I had mana for basicly and run around yelling help.<br/>
<br/>
What a dissapointment *grin* going to do some playing around tonight and see if I have better luck. I think that either<br/>
<br/>
a) Croc&#39;s have a high resistance against force spells and enstill<br/>
b) I need to kill a few things with those spells first (easier things) before they start working.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure which is what, but all I know is that after the whole deal was done I was 80 or so hp within loseing lvl 20</div>
