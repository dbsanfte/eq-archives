<b>Subject:</b> Old Euridan and Elder Elvish learning <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-392578610">Please tell me if there is truth to this:<br/>
<br/>
I want to improve my Old Euridan language skill.  I plan on traveling to<br/>
Euridan and hanging out with the NPC&#39;s there in the wizards guild.  I plan<br/>
on sitting down next to some of them.  Should this improve my skill?  <br/>
<br/>
I noticed I have Elder Elvish as a skill now (maybe because I used to hang<br/>
out in my hometown of Felwithe allot and just picked it up)  I do not want<br/>
to spend another training point in Old Euridan or any language for that<br/>
fact.  I also do not want to have someone SPAM to me anymore unless I pay<br/>
them to SPAM me ...and me alone (not fair to others in my group).<br/>
