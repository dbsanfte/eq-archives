<div id="ygrps-yiv-1058054265">1. Your ac will go up with your level. I&#39;m 14th and with lesser shielding<br/>
I&#39;ve got an ac in the 220&#39;s (well, over 200 in any case)<br/>
2. If your spell is interrupted keep clicking. You don&#39;t lose mana if you&#39;re<br/>
interrupted.<br/>
3. Make damned sure that you&#39;re not set on attack when you wanna do this.<br/>
4. Always take a step or 2 backwards. Sometime the beast is just attacking<br/>
you because you laced into it with more than the combined damage of your<br/>
barbarian friends combined. Most times they&#39;ll turn back on someone else.<br/>
Unless they&#39;re REALLY pissed, in that case go for roots cuz&#39; if you haven&#39;t<br/>
taken it out by now and it&#39;s attacking you, you&#39;re probably dead.  : )<br/>
(happens to me all the time, annoying but understandable when after 2 shocks<br/>
of lightning they&#39;ve eaten 160 pts of damage)<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m sure many of us have the same problem... cloth armor.  Sure, it&#39;s fine<br/>
 </span></blockquote>for level 1-4 where that&#39;s all anyone has, but as I get up past level 10 I&#39;m<br/>
finding it really lacking.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t expect to be a tank like the other classes, but it would be nice if<br/>
 </span></blockquote>monsters missed enough that when they turn on me in our party, I have a<br/>
chance of getting a root spell off because they miss, y&#39;know?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;So my question is simple: has anyone found any armor anywhere for wizards<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that is better than normal Cloth? I&#39;m looking for stuff that can be worn by<br/>
a High Elf, but I&#39;m sure there are other classes around that are interested<br/>
as well...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If you know of anything, what kind of armor is it, where do you get it,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>what do you have to do, and what kind of protection does it provide?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone know any other good tricks to improving armor class for wizards?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(magic items, special earrings or rings, whatever?)<br/>
