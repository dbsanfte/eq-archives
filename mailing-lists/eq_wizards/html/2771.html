<div id="ygrps-yiv-467453463">Ya know, I agree with um...mstokes I believe (too lazy to scroll back <br/>
there) and I mentioned this before in my earlier post.. how about buying <br/>
yourself a goss robe?  Its A/C is 8 and isn&#39;t a bad robe ... its white and <br/>
looks good..albeit still a bathrobe look...you should be able to pick one <br/>
up for some plat or go to befallen and head to third level and acquire one <br/>
yourself.. :)  its much more satisfying to be able to get one <br/>
yourself...really.  OR invis and run through nek forest to lavastorm and go <br/>
into the dungeon Najena and wait with the other throngs to try to get a <br/>
flowing black robe off Najena.  Might be a fun challenge for you...it&#39;ll <br/>
just take some time is all....</div>
