&gt; Hunting grounds for a low-level Erudite Wizard?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. Tox Forest (across bridge) hunting Kobolds and Skellies.  If you find a<br/>
&gt; Ranger to help, you can actually level fast, otherwise you&#39;ll be camping at<br/>
&gt; the Kobold camps and fighting for kills, or wandering and hoping to find<br/>
&gt; something.  Unless they changed the spawn rates since I was there several<br/>
&gt; weeks ago, this can be slow compared to other newbie areas.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. Kerra Isle.  Level 6 is (IMO) about the time you can start venturing here<br/>
&gt; but need a good group to do well.  Usually there is a lack of tanks in this<br/>
&gt; area of the world which makes this place more difficult than it should be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3. N. Qeynos then Qeynos Hills  -  I stayed on Odus for a long time before I<br/>
&gt; ventured across the ocean to Antonica.  When I finally did, my jaw DROPPED<br/>
&gt; at the site of N. Qeynos newbie area.  There were kills as far as you could<br/>
&gt; see since it is flat and practically treeless.  I was so amazed at how much<br/>
&gt; easier it would have been to level here never having to &#39;search&#39; for kills<br/>
&gt; like Tox Forest.  Even with the increased population, the ratio of animals<br/>
&gt; was still MUCH higher than Tox.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4. Erud&#39;s Crossing  -  Once you get over 10, you can start to consider<br/>
&gt; stopping at the Isle in Erud&#39;s Crossing and hunt Wisps and Spiders.  This<br/>
&gt; island can be a little dangerous but you can make a TON of money here<br/>
&gt; getting Greater Lightstones.  This place is definitely Wisp Heaven!!  I made<br/>
&gt; a ton of money here in my low teens and have been way ahead of the money<br/>
&gt; game ever since.  I recommend grouping here like most places.  Spiders have<br/>
&gt; nasty poison so beware picking fights.  I can give more strategies on this<br/>
&gt; place but I&#39;ll shut up now ))<br/>

&gt; Serious Question?  Other than Kerra Island, what is the best place for a<br/>
&gt; Erudite Wizard of the 6th Rank to practice magic?<br/>
