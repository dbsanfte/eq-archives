<b>Subject:</b> Interrupting monsters&#39; spells <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923502294">Ken - PCs CAN interrupt monster spells. Goblin Wizard in BB is the <br/>
example I&#39;ll cite. I&#39;ve seen him be interrupted numerous times, by me, <br/>
as I blast him into oblivion for not taking back what he said about my <br/>
mother. <br/>
<br/>
As for getting experience in a group, I find the best results occur <br/>
when you group with people of your own level, with no one higher than <br/>
one level above you. Depending on what you&#39;re killing, you may do well <br/>
even with people 2 levels above you in the group, but for the most <br/>
part stick with your own level as much as you can.<br/>
<br/>
Finally - I reached 8th level, got some sort of fire bolt spell that <br/>
does 45 points/shot. Talk about an attention-getter! I use it in CB to <br/>
blast Cents and Legionnaires, so my party has less work to do to <br/>
finish them off. <br/>
<br/>
Eventually, I&#39;ll post something on mana conservation, a topic near and <br/>
dear to all our hearts..<br/>
