<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-690649184">Does this really Happen? I could swear that earlier, when my group was<br/>
hunting the mino caves, I could hit a mino that was around the corner. I<br/>
would make my stand near that lava lamp. The Tank would venture deep into<br/>
the cave maze and when he had a mino on him he would gsay&quot;incoming&quot;. I then<br/>
simply targeted that tank with the corresponding F1- F5 keys and then hit my<br/>
/Assist hot key. The mino that my tanks was currently fighting was<br/>
automatically targeted and I could cast Away. Heck , I hardly ever moved<br/>
past the lamp and hardly ever even saw the fearsome minos till the were<br/>
dead. I never got the messg that the I couldnt see the target. Is this all<br/>
my imagination?<br/>

&gt;Does it bug anyone besides me how you lose mana when you&#39;re chasing a<br/>
&gt;fleeing monster down a corridor, say BlackBurrow or Mistmoore, and the<br/>
&gt;target JUST rounds a corner before the timer has finished?  &quot;You cannot<br/>
&gt;see your target&quot;, the mana is lost.  I can understand the spell not<br/>
&gt;connecting, but why the mana loss?  Drives me nuts.<br/>
