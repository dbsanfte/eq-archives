<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443468799">Aye I have seen the rod you speak of.  Tis the Shimmering Orb, not sure<br/>
where it comes from though.  Does anyone know what level you need to be to<br/>
get the flowing black robes?  I have started to see more and more<br/>
spellcasters with this item on them, and some are only level 20.<br/>
<br/>
As far as looking &quot;cool&quot;, one of my main reasons for wanting to get to level<br/>
24 (I am 21 now) is for a stylistic reason, namely levitate.  I just think<br/>
this is one of the coolest spells out there, even beyond its practical uses.<br/>
Hehe, oh well it should be fun :)<br/>

Hehe.  Yup, although it won&#39;t ruin my gaming experience to keep things as <br/>
they are...I think we are all missing out on one of the fun things about the<br/>
<br/>
game: *looking cool* ;)   I was a little dissapointed (? sorry my spelling <br/>
is bad because I play too much :)  that the one of the strongest robes we <br/>
have to look forward to is that fluffy Observer robe that looks as if it was<br/>
<br/>
out of the closet of Liberace.  yuck!<br/>
<br/>
Closest thing to being visually cool I&#39;ve seen is this Wizard I saw last <br/>
night carrying a pulsing rod (forget what it was called).  His wrist kept <br/>
pulsing with a luminescent light...neat!<br/>

&gt;  -- You get that nice savants cap, black iron medallion, damask<br/>
&gt;leggings, skull of jen tra, different daggers and staff types (no new<br/>
&gt;graphics for them...warrior classes see differences in every<br/>
&gt;weapon..just about).<br/>
