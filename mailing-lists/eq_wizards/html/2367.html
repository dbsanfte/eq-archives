<b>Subject:</b> A nice group fight i&#39;d like to share... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-192821513">lemme tell you all about a big fight we had in cazic with 2 troll sk&#39;s, 1<br/>
monk, 1 ranger, 1 ogre shaman, and me, the lonely little wizard (everybody<br/>
was in the lvl 24-26 range, me being right smack dab in the middle at 25)...<br/>
don&#39;t worry, the moral of the story is at the end if you want to skip the<br/>
details :)<br/>
<br/>
monk is pulling (he seems to know the maze the best...  and the big fat ugly<br/>
trolls and ogres get stuck in the doorway trying to get out.. hehe. anybody<br/>
that&#39;s been to cazic knows what i&#39;m talking about).  monk pulls 4 defenders<br/>
and 1 sent (all conned blue except for sent which conned white).  monk comes<br/>
out, and immediately, the trolls and ranger jump on the sent first (the ogre<br/>
shaman DOES NOT engage, as he is our acting healer). i cast tishans clash<br/>
(stun) on the sent (great starter spell, as it does a little dmg, and gives<br/>
the melee guys a few free licks). by the time the stun wears off, i blast<br/>
him (frost shock) once to finish him. the two trolls move to the first<br/>
defender, monk and ranger move to the second defender. i stun the<br/>
monk/ranger defender, and turn around and blast (frost shock) the trolls<br/>
defender (at this point, i&#39;m close to half down on mana). shaman is healing<br/>
the guys that need it, as well as the ranger. monk is hurting the worst so i<br/>
finish off his defender (one blast of frost shock and he becomes a runner,<br/>
so i cast shock of fire to finish him). trolls easily handle their first<br/>
defender at about the same time. two defenders left, shaman running oom, as<br/>
well as ranger. i have enough for two more blasts and a stun. trolls, monk,<br/>
and ranger jump on third defender, while i stun the fourth. then i turn<br/>
around and cast dmg on the third defender that is almost dead to finish him<br/>
(he went REAL quick with 4 melee and my dmg on him). we then turn to fourth<br/>
defender (who is just getting out of his stun), and finish him quickly (i<br/>
did not need to cast on the fourth defender, so i ended  up having a little<br/>
less than a bar of mana left).<br/>
<br/>
end of fight, and everybody gave out a big WHEW!  we all congratulated each<br/>
other on a terrific battle, and then went to clean our britches out heh.<br/>
one of the best we&#39;ve had, and one of the most &quot;organized&quot; (one death and it<br/>
would have been considered a failure).  it just worked out that everybody<br/>
knew what we were supposed to be doing (no, we didn&#39;t plan on pulling 5, but<br/>
it just ended up like that, and we had a zone close by, so we knew we could<br/>
run if needed).  mind you, that at this level, i probably could not have<br/>
taken one on my own. i probably would have had a resist or two, or maybe a<br/>
spell that did half dmg, or enstill may falter, etc....  Some of you may<br/>
say, &quot;well, lets see, 6 of you, five of them, all blue, with one white....<br/>
your group could have just individually solo&#39;ed them&quot;.  NOT! remember, the<br/>
whole is greater than the sum of it&#39;s parts :)<br/>
<br/>
all dmg tolled, i didn&#39;t get touched once (everybody else but the shaman was<br/>
less than half health, the shaman was 3/4 health), but i was able to cast at<br/>
the beginning (doing 34dmg) as well as keeping the melee guys from being hit<br/>
as much (although i do wish the recovery time on tishan was a little<br/>
quicker, as i&#39;m really starting to like it).  if i ever blasted with my<br/>
biggie twice on a baddie, he woulda come after me (unless the second blast<br/>
was a finisher of course).<br/>
<br/>
the point of this msg is to show you that 1.) the stun spell we get at 20 is<br/>
not very useful when solo&#39;ing, but it sure did come in handy that night, and<br/>
2.) i don&#39;t care what anybody says, no other spellcasting class could have<br/>
replaced me in that particular fight (mainly because of the dmg/mana ratio i<br/>
was getting on my dmg spells, as i was casting when the monster was over<br/>
half dead, which usually means full dmg), and 3.) you can use your big<br/>
spells in a fight (and should as they are normally gonna be your best<br/>
dmg/mana ratio spells), and 4.) monsters don&#39;t frenzy you if you time your<br/>
casts right, and don&#39;t get to rapped up in *blasting* the heck out of the<br/>
monsters.<br/>
<br/>
if anybody else has any cool or unusual group fights involving us little<br/>
&#39;ole wizzies, i&#39;d love to hear them, as I&#39;m still trying to master the art<br/>
of grouping without getting hit...  it&#39;s real tough holding back when you<br/>
know you can blast that baddie straight to errr. well, a bad place :)  it&#39;s<br/>
also very embarrassing to start your group tell &quot;oom!!! oom!!!&quot; when there&#39;s<br/>
still one or two baddies left :(<br/>
