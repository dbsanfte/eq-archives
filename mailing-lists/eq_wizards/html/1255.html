<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525383846">Good point.. hadn&#39;t thought of that but it makes perfect sense.  Maybe the <br/>
video card companies should just send everyone a great  400 meg 3d <br/>
card...heh.. don&#39;t we wish...wonder if they will ever make something like <br/>
that in our lifetime... I suppose 3d would be a thing of the past at that <br/>
point...probably just have little bitty people in our box to do the stuff <br/>
for us.  Freaky thought.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree.  I like the &quot;eye candy&quot; as well.  It makes the game for me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    I agree as well, but I think the reason we don&#39;t see more is the same<br/>
&gt;reason we don&#39;t see more variation in what our character is wearing (ie.,<br/>
&gt;cloth pieces not showing up, lack of modifiable colors, etc). Verant made<br/>
&gt;the decision long ago that they wanted to make the game accessible to the<br/>
&gt;greatest number of 3d cards possible which includes, unfortunately(1),<br/>
&gt;4meg cards. Thus, they had to severely limit the number of textures used<br/>
&gt;in the game, and I _think_ that spells may fall under that category.<br/>

&gt;(1) Unfortunately for those of us with greater that 4 meg cards, very<br/>
&gt;fortunately for those of us that might still have voodoo1 cards.<br/>
