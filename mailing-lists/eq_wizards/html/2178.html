<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374617527">Here is another.  This worked very well I was in a group of 2 wizards (I was<br/>
one), 1 cleric, and 1 druid.  The druid had enough hp to tank so they did so<br/>
with the cleric healing them.  The druid would also cast offensive spells<br/>
while tanking and of course myself and the other wizard would blast.  We<br/>
ALWAYS used ASSIST so that we all focused on 1 at a time.  Using this<br/>
tactic, we could take on several mobs conning red to me (I was the lowest<br/>
level in the group) at once.  ASSIST is by far the key in this setup, which<br/>
is what you will pretty much always use if both a tank and cleric are in<br/>
your group.  If you don&#39;t have BOTH a cleric and tank, you will probably end<br/>
up having to root and blast at some point unless you arent fighting very<br/>
hard monsters.<br/>
