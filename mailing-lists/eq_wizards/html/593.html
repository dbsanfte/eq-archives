<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493764475">You can buy the spell in Ak&#39;Anon and save yourself the trip. If you don&#39;t<br/>
know how to get to the gnomish city then follow these simple directions.<br/>
Cross into Lesser Faydark and follow the mountainside to the left of the<br/>
zone. The first zone entrance you pass is where you want to be, it will take<br/>
you into Steamfont Mountains. From there follow the road until it branches<br/>
left and right(there will be a gnomish watchman at the crossroads). Follow<br/>
the right branch straight into the city and from there you can probably ask<br/>
directions to the library.<br/>
