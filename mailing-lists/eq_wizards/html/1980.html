<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576897530">Okay,<br/>
<br/>
I spent the last 1/2 hour rewriting the petition.  Hopefully this will<br/>
get us closer to bring this to a conclusion.  I left the majority of the<br/>
spells out only because I really feel that we as a group will never come<br/>
to an agreement on them.<br/>

Dear EverQuest Staff,<br/>
<br/>
We are a large group of wizards who have come together through a mailing<br/>
list. Through much discussion and debate, we have agreed to send you<br/>
this feedback concerning improvements to the wizard. We would like to<br/>
thank you in advance for your careful consideration of these<br/>
modifications.<br/>
<br/>
1) Spells are 100% resisted by mobs 6+ levels above the caster. In large<br/>
groups hunting big prey this level cap turns a wizard from the main<br/>
dealer of damage to a useless member in the group. Our suggestion is<br/>
that either the cap be raised to 6+ levels of the highest member in the<br/>
group, or the cap be raised to 8+ levels higher than the caster.<br/>
<br/>
2) Spells that both stun and damage targets are often resisted by mobs<br/>
that /con green and blue. If this is the result of the stun effect, we<br/>
would like one spell without this effect at the same level.<br/>
<br/>
3) Many spell suggestions have crossed this list. Here is one that we<br/>
all feel would be a great addition.<br/>
<br/>
Tap Affinity - Teleport targeted group member to their own bind spot<br/>
<br/>
4) O&#39;Kiels Radiation seems that it would be the beginning of a great<br/>
line of spells. Why should it end there? Cold and Magic based<br/>
buffs/shields would be a very welcome addition.<br/>
<br/>
5) Wizards seem to be very neglected when it comes to carrying or<br/>
wearing items that enhance our appearance. Also, many completely<br/>
different spells have the same visual effects.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We would like to thank you again for your time. Any type of feedback<br/>
would be greatly appriciated.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
The Wizards of Norrath<br/>
