&gt; Hi all guys,<br/>
&gt; it seems that OR we are all on hollidays OR we know all about wizzard :). I<br/>
&gt; don t receive more then 1 list all 2 days now :(<br/>
&gt; Come an guys, we need to wake up ! :)<br/>
&gt; On another point, i just read the new patch message.. Damn.... From the<br/>
&gt; begining, nothing as been change for the wizzards... They just change during<br/>
&gt; the patch , the casting time . I have tested BEFORE and after : no change<br/>
&gt; (that a clock can see, so it s surely a change of let s say 0,001 second or<br/>
&gt; something like that.In other words : nothing.<br/>
&gt; All patch just power up the race... Now the druid dot spel are fast like<br/>
&gt; hell, necro same. And us ?? From the beginning, we have major bug who are<br/>
&gt; not resolved and they do nothing for us...<br/>
&gt; Force shock is bugged cause he is resisted too much (and i am ok that he get<br/>
&gt; resisted so much IF he stun like he must do). The enstill spel doesn&#39;t work<br/>
&gt; (i have tested with root : root is 10 times more effective). I am a playing<br/>
&gt; a shaman and i think i will stop my wizzard... We have nothing funny : we<br/>
&gt; just level and wait for what ? Our dd spel nothing more, no buf, no pet, no<br/>
&gt; life tap, no shield,no dot, no sow, nothing cool except some gate spel...<br/>
&gt; That s so boring..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s boring, reading the same damn whining post over and over<br/>
and *over* again!<br/>
<br/>
Even if I agreed with you I would have the good taste to STOP THE WHINING,<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s obvious by now that posting it here does nothing for you. Just spawns these<br/>
useless debates. You don&#39;t like wizards? Fine, don&#39;t play them, but do you<br/>
really think everyone needs to hear the same complaints for the 20th time?<br/>
