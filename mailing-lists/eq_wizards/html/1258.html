<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561245265">Since you are lvl 10, I would suggest heading to the OOT and killing some<br/>
Aqua Gobs.  You always get at least 2.5 gold off of them for their bow and<br/>
arrows.  In just an hour of adventuring, you can have 4 or 5 plat saved up<br/>
and get good xp too.  That&#39;s what I did from 10th to 12th lvl.  Got more<br/>
than enough money for my spells ;)<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;Why is it everyone has problems with getting cash? Through normal<br/>
&gt; adventuring I, at level 13, have just over 70pp more than enuff to buy my<br/>
&gt; 5th rank spells and some of the 6th rank spells.... What&#39;s everyone doing<br/>
&gt; for cash?&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know about others, but I haven&#39;t found a ready source for cash<br/>
that I can<br/>
&gt; survive hunting.  I generally hunt with a similar level warrior.  By<br/>
scrimping and saving<br/>
&gt; tho I have gotten a full set of cloth armor and most of my level 8 spells.<br/>
Currently am<br/>
&gt; level 10.  Now begins the scrimping and saving to get level 12 spells.  I<br/>
know that<br/>
&gt; some others have taken up smithing, etc to make money.. but I chose to<br/>
save my<br/>
&gt; money for the spells themselves rather than spend the little I made on<br/>
supplies for a<br/>
&gt; skill like smithing.  I&#39;d love to find a money tree but since I think<br/>
that&#39;s unlikely will just<br/>
&gt; play patiently and save up slowly.  As others have pointed out here, I<br/>
suspect that<br/>
&gt; getting cash will be easier at higher levels.<br/>
