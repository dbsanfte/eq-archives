<div id="ygrps-yiv-429229774">thsi is not a flame adaar but the one thing i see is you have only played <br/>
characters to lvl 16.  I agree wizards should actually be a total wimp up to <br/>
lvl 20 in my opinion.  After that the wizard should dominate.  I mean no one <br/>
can come close to touching him by lvl 40.  I mean it should be the toughest <br/>
class to play to lvl 20 so to weed out the week and unwilling.  but the thing <br/>
is it is still even up to from what i&#39;ve heard at lvl 35.  people still dont <br/>
really appreciate the wizard because all the classes do the same or more even <br/>
though the wizard is supposed to deliver the most damage.  What&#39;s the point <br/>
of playeing the most powerful person in the game if he is even with everyone <br/>
else.  I mean these people that created the game are supposed to be D&D fans <br/>
and MUD fans.  What happens to your lvl 1 wiz in D&D, he dies about 1,000,000 <br/>
it seems like.  But when he reaches around lvl 9 hardly anyone can touch him. <br/>
 This is how i think it should be in EQ.  Just my little rant on why people <br/>
want more spells and more power.  sorry if it&#39;s to long.<br/>
