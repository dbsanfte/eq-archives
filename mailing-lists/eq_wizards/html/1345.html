<div id="ygrps-yiv-633308862">Think about it.  A shieldskin spell (absorbs 100HP dmg) and casting<br/>
Root or enstill (Root should suffice).  When you are of equal footing<br/>
(lvl wise) ROOT should hold for at least 2 casts....then ROOT again and<br/>
CAST 2 more times and he is dead.  I will put it to the test with my<br/>
lvl 19 Wizard and a equal level dual wielder.  He or she cant hit me if<br/>
they cant move towards me.  There is a balance and the fight would be<br/>
close. But the root should hold and knowing how quick we can take out a<br/>
target..he should die quickly as well.<br/>

&gt; Dear Valacian,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good answer. But are you prepared to put it to the<br/>
&gt; test as an experiment? (serious question) I think<br/>
&gt; someone of your level would be appropriate to test<br/>
&gt; the wizards power, or lack of it. Would you be<br/>
&gt; able to cast any spells while he hits you on the<br/>
&gt; head? It&#39;s all well and good doing 1100 damage with<br/>
&gt; an Ice Comet but how long would it take to cast.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; PS Well done getting to 22nd level, your right it<br/>
&gt; has to be VERY HARD for us until we reach high<br/>
&gt; levels.<br/>
