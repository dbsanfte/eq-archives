 </span></blockquote>The Ak&#39;anon map is in the manual.  I think its listed as the library of<br/>
magencia or something like that.<br/>
You get there by entering the city and follow the tunnels to the waterfall.<br/>
Take a Right.  Walk through more tunnels until you see the main shopping<br/>
district (4 merchants under tents) follow the righthand wall until it opens up<br/>
into a chasm.  Walk through  the chasm.  On the right side of the chasm starts<br/>
a long upward ramp.  WALK up the ramp and on top lies the Library which houses<br/>
the wizard, enchanter, necro guilds.  In the center of the library is a common<br/>
area with two merchants. One sells low level common spells the other sells high<br/>
level common spells. Off the center are three rooms, one for each class.  Two<br/>
merchants and a guild master in each room.  Wizard guildmaster is the start of<br/>
the telescope lens quest.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps<br/>
