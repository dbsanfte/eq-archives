&gt;<br/>
&gt; Greetings all. I write this letter to perhaps aid any who have begun down<br/>
&gt; the long path of wizardry.<br/>
&gt; I am Mirrin, high elf wizard, of the new Nife server, formally of the<br/>
&gt; Karana server.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My first wizard was up to level 12 when I re-rolled to the new server. I<br/>
&gt; did so for several reasons:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First to increase my intelligence. My first wiz had a 110 INT and my new<br/>
&gt; wiz a 126 INT.<br/>
&gt; I can not stress enough how much the extra 16 points have helped my<br/>
overall<br/>
&gt; mana. The extra mana has been<br/>
&gt; incredible. For instance:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; + I now spend more time actually hunting and less time in meditation. This<br/>
&gt; makes your &quot;tank&quot; friends happier because your not always<br/>
&gt; meditating. Mana management helps here too.<br/>
&gt; + I now have that extra mana needed to finish off that high level<br/>
creature.<br/>
&gt; Nice to pick off that creature thats about to run<br/>
&gt; to get reinforcements.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another reason I re-rolled is, as many of you have noticed, our combat<br/>
&gt; skills tend to raise slowly.<br/>
&gt; Higher INT will help compensate for this. I have also learned a few tricks<br/>
&gt; along the way. Many of you probably already<br/>
&gt; know this but I put this here because of an old rule my master taught me.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Never assume what you know is common<br/>
&gt; knowledge. Let those who read your words decide that.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; + I have learned that you can raise your Off and Def skills very fast<br/>
&gt; combating multiple creatures at the same time. Find 2 or 3 that do<br/>
&gt; very little damage to you and let them smack away at ya. If you do this<br/>
&gt; every level for a short while It is very easy to keep your<br/>
&gt; skills high.<br/>
&gt; + Have a &quot;tank&quot; friend help you keep your OHB and 2HB&lt;one hand blunt and<br/>
&gt; two hand blunt&gt; skills maxed up. I hunt with a ranger<br/>
&gt; and he is more then happy to take the damage on a few critters while I<br/>
&gt; beat on them my a staff. Once you have maxed out your<br/>
&gt; skills, you then only need repeat this tactic for a short while every time<br/>
&gt; you level. This works well with dagger skills as well. Remember you can<br/>
&gt; help you &quot;tank&quot; friends with skills too. Like with language skills.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A few tips of the trade:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; + Wizards are the keepers of knowledge. Learn where your &quot;tank&quot; friends<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; find those magical weapons before they do.<br/>
&gt; Do some research. There are many on-line resources to find out where<br/>
&gt; little knick-knacks can be found. If your friends begin<br/>
&gt; to rely on you for such information then you will indeed become a TRUE<br/>
&gt; wizard.<br/>
&gt; + Keep this in mind. It is in your best interest to make sure your &quot;tanks&quot;<br/>
&gt; can take as much damage as possible. Help<br/>
&gt; them get that leather tunic they need or the weapon they REALLY want.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Tanks&quot; are very simple to please and it only takes<br/>
&gt; a minimal amount of effort to make them your &quot;loyal friend&quot;.<br/>
&gt; + Take risks! Overhunt when-ever you can! Press your limit and you shall<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; rewarded. Instead of hunting those easy critters<br/>
&gt; until you reach level 4 go out and hunt... pixies for instance in lesser<br/>
&gt; feydark. You and a &quot;tank&quot; can get from level 3 to 6 in just a few hours<br/>
&gt; there. From there press yourself to the huge spiders and then right over<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; CrushBone at level 7 or 8.<br/>
&gt; + Always, always, always keep an eye on your skills. Once your OHB is<br/>
maxed<br/>
&gt; then get that great staff out and get it going.<br/>
&gt; You need to be able to use many weapons. Don&#39;t want to limit your<br/>
&gt; effectiveness with any magical item. It would be a shame<br/>
&gt; to not be able to hold that magic book (+30 mana and +10 Int) because you<br/>
&gt; can only use a 2 handed staff and the book has to be held<br/>
&gt; in your left hand to get the bonus.<br/>
&gt; + Lastly, remember we wizards are known for our Intelligence. Play that<br/>
&gt; way! Write that way! Think that way!<br/>
&gt; Take great pride in your class!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Be well and remember that the fate of Norrath does indeed lay within the<br/>
&gt; hands of the wizards. Accept this simple fact.<br/>
