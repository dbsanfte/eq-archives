<div id="ygrps-yiv-252657223">I agree, good point.  On that note, for some of the younger wizards, you&#39;ll <br/>
find a percieved hatred of our class in certain areas...notoriously because <br/>
of our abilities to strike from afar, and more likely because you are <br/>
playing with others who are ignorant of class balance.<br/>
<br/>
Places that are sometimes hostile to Wizards include BlackBurrow around the <br/>
Queynos area, and Crushbone over near Felwithe.  I would say those in BB <br/>
were more hostile to our class...more sensitive to issues about steal kills <br/>
and such.  Of course, there ARE those wizards I have seen that have used <br/>
their powers to exploit others and place shame on our class.  I&#39;d like to <br/>
name names...but.......nah.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Once I hit 16...it was amazing how many groups start looking favorable to <br/>
our class.  Start looking in areas such as Highhold Pass and Unrest... <br/>
people are always ready to allow a Wizard in the group.  So don&#39;t dispair <br/>
folks...the wait isn&#39;t THAT long. :)<br/>
