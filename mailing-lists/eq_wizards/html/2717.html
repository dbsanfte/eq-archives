<div id="ygrps-yiv-56945008">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Did they just post what was going to be changed without actually changing it?  I noticed that they decided to make the invisibility spell icon blink before it wears off, a change I am quite happy about.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t work.  At least, not for me.  Did they patch this or not?</div>
