<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116050841">Well, I&#39;ll admit that I haven&#39;t gotten any real &#39;experience&#39; with using it.<br/>
Not countless battles and such. I&#39;ll be hitting Aviak central tonight, and<br/>
will post my results tomorrow on a whole night of using it. Anyone got any<br/>
really good spell combos they use? My preferred burn is the following right<br/>
now:<br/>
<br/>
Force Shock<br/>
Lightning Bolt<br/>
Root<br/>
Flame Shock<br/>
<br/>
Around 400 pts of dmg. Haven&#39;t seen any blue that took that damage and lived<br/>
aside from Named beasts.<br/>
<br/>
Before Force Shock I had to have a tank or I&#39;d be running half the time from<br/>
blues.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, with my enchanter friend we pack a MEAN punch, she&#39;ll lower magic<br/>
resistance I bomb, she whirls I step back and burn. Easy way to take reds<br/>
and yellows. Make friends with enchanters. you&#39;ll never regret it.<br/>
