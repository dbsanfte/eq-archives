Subject: [eq_wizards] All players and the 6 lvl resist / cant hit melee<br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To me, it seams like alot of people assume that though all lvls of the game<br/>
we group with people that are generally the same level as eachother. But,<br/>
this is fale. I have grouped with people upto 7 - 8 lvls above me, for fun,<br/>
and for some exp since I can still usualy get a worth while ammount of exp<br/>
while grouped with them. And this is where the &quot;resistance&quot; complaint comes<br/>
in.<br/>
<br/>
When a wizard is the lower lvl in the group, and the higher lvls want to go<br/>
after something that is even - yellow to them, it could quite possibly be<br/>
8-9+ lvls above the magic casters, and that is when this problem comes up,<br/>
and it is not just wizards, but all of the other class&#39;s, they cant hit it<br/>
melee, or their spells wont even put a dent in it.<br/>
 <br/>
People think that when we complain about resistance, we are complaning that<br/>
a group of similar lvls wont be able to kill something 6 lvls above them,<br/>
that is false. If I am with a group of lvl 20-22s, and go after something<br/>
that is lvl 26 or 27. I would expect to have our ass&#39;s handed to us. But, if<br/>
I am with a group of a few lvl 29s, and a few mid-30s (lvl 35-36), and the<br/>
high lvls want to go after a yellow or an even in the group, everyone should<br/>
be able to help in some way, but with how things work (espically magic<br/>
resistance) that is not the case. You would think that if the group had<br/>
 <br/>
- a lvl 29 wizard<br/>
- a lvl 30 cleric<br/>
- a lvl 33 cleric<br/>
- a lvl 30 ranger<br/>
- a lvl 35 warrior<br/>
- a lvl 31 druid<br/>
 <br/>
That they should be able to take on a monster and all put towards the battle<br/>
and win if the monster is lvl 36-37. Which in fact they can, the bitch is -<br/>
The wizard would be useless in that fight because the monster is to high<br/>
above them That is when this thing becomes a problem. If verant allows the<br/>
exp-gap to widen so much at the higher lvls, they should make sure that<br/>
EVERYONE in the group can contribute to a &quot;high lvl fight&quot; some how. Right<br/>
now people 8 lvls below me can group with me, but if that lvl 21 wizard cant<br/>
help at all in my group ( I am lvl 29 ), for the things that I am fighting,<br/>
why would I want them?<br/>
 <br/>
... This is why verant needs to take a look and tweak magic resistance in<br/>
some way.</div>
