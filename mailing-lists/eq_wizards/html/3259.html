<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308950899">According to Bob:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Nope I don&#39;t think that is it.  There have been no banners or anything,  I<br/>
&gt; use Cazic Thule server and so far it&#39;s been pretty reliable.and crowded.  I<br/>
&gt; am begining to think the problem may be either my modem or my ISP  I have a<br/>
&gt; winmodem and i understand from some recent articals that they aren&#39;t really<br/>
&gt; very good and use some of the cpu to process the data comming in ans<br/>
&gt; therefor slow my system down.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The winmodem shouldn&#39;t be the cause. Unless you have a P70 or something,<br/>
you should have plenty of CPU available for processing. The symptoms<br/>
are those of a server-specific route problem: you can patch (different<br/>
network), log-in (different network), select world (again a different<br/>
network), but cannot enter a specific world.<br/>
<br/>
When this occurs, check other worlds. If you can log on some, you have<br/>
a route problem. Now, it might be an ISP-related problem, or a UUNET<br/>
problem (if I remember right Cazic is a UUNET hosted farm. Try Quellious.<br/>
If you go to the character screen, there you have. UUNET blocked, CERFnet<br/>
ok). But in any case, there&#39;s nothing you can do on your own. Except<br/>
changing ISP, which will only change the frequency and the time where<br/>
the next IP problem will occur.<br/>
