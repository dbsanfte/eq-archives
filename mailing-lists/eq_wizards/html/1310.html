What exactly is the difference between root and enstill? And can you cast them while getting bashed? Somtimes I can sometimes I cant.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Aye, I would be more than willing to test this.  You are correct, I cannot cast if I&#39;m getting bashed.. so the trick for me is to not get bashed.  That&#39;s why Root and Enstill become vital spells against warriors and such who can melee.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The ONLY way I would lose a battle is if I happen to fizzle 2 or more of my spells during combat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have proven this.  I have dueled at my level and I seem to always win.  I would not want to tackle any level higher than me as my spells might get resisted and than I would be in real trouble.<br/>

&gt; Dear Valacian,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good answer. But are you prepared to put it to the test as an experiment? (serious question) I think<br/>
&gt; someone of your level would be appropriate to test the wizards power, or lack of it. Would you be<br/>
&gt; able to cast any spells while he hits you on the head? It&#39;s all well and good doing 1100 damage with<br/>
&gt; an Ice Comet but how long would it take to cast.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; PS Well done getting to 22nd level, your right it has to be VERY HARD for us until we reach high<br/>
&gt; levels.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well said Jay. Parties cant be bothered with wizards, they cant buff, cant heal<br/>
&gt; &gt; and cant really help parties that much...&quot;we were supposed to be heavy<br/>
&gt; &gt; artillery&quot; but that just is not correct. I think a wizard would be most parties<br/>
&gt; &gt; last choice if they could choose from all the classes.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Its very easy to demonstrate the wizard immbalance; get into an arena with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; dual wield barbarian warrior of the same level and see how you do!<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hmm doesn&#39;t sound too promising eh?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have always played a wizard character class in AD&D and UO but I regret<br/>
&gt; &gt; playing one in EQ. I think EQ were nervous about the power wizards in UO and<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t want to unbalance the game. I think they swung the pendalum too far the<br/>
&gt; &gt; other way. Root &#39;n&#39; Shoot, if that fails death, thats about it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hopefully e-mails will pour in and tell me how wrong I am. Great, show me its<br/>
&gt; &gt; not the case so I feel I have a character with a future!<br/>
