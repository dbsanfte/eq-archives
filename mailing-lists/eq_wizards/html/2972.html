<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416449029">I mean evryone want those good items and nothing is gona stop them, so sooner or later ppl will have em. So Veerrant cant keep those items away from ppl couse they want it, they are just making more tension in game with making things lore item and no drop. Couse then we will see those lv 45-50 ppl coming to Najena to get Jboots if they havent before or lost them. Better to let it be, make it spawn on a MOB at a certain level in a zone instead, lets say 75% of the good stuff spawn like that and then the rest on the same MOB evry time. Veerant bite there own hand on this. I mean they are making it harder and harder to get those items you want, trade skills are close to worthless and money to. I am playing AC beta and cant say i like it 100% but then i didnt like Everquest when i first playd it in beta. So when they have sorted things out and they release it i might go for that insted. I think the best way to go is not making items lore and no drop but class specifik.<br/>
<br/>
You could say that we are paying customers and not evryone can camp for 5 days to get there hands on Jboots and why should they ? yeah they should be hard to get but not becouse the MOB is so damn rare or camped, but for the skill and level of the MOB.  If anything will make me stop playing EQ it will be for this.<br/>
<br/>
On the same note if you drop a weapon that are lore item on the ground it will disapear<br/>
at once that i found out when droped my dagger of marnek on the ground ! :-(<br/>

&gt; &gt;meet many ppl willing to sell there hard earned items for gold.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Verrant are fools who think they shuld keep the number of items down, &gt;and <br/>
&gt; &gt;with<br/>
&gt; &gt;making them lore item and no drop. if this keeps up ill go play AC <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;instead.<br/>
&gt; &gt;/Askur Wizard of Veeshan<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have to agree with you there Askur.  I can understand why Verrant made <br/>
&gt; things hard to get and rare... but the current method tends to encourage a <br/>
&gt; lot of the parts of the game that is NOT fun.  (ie camping, hording for <br/>
&gt; guildmembers, etc.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t offer a solution...would it be a better game if Verrant made it so <br/>
&gt; every NPC *guaranteed* that you&#39;ll get the item you wanted?  Or if they made <br/>
&gt; things spawn faster so everyone has a chance to kill it? I&#39;m divided....<br/>
