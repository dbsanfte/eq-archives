I&#39;m on Rallos Zek... If you tell me where to get the stone, I&#39;ll let you in<br/>
on a secret as to how and why wizards can be the fastest leveling classes in<br/>
the game with a tiny bit of help and sometimes none at all.  Also I would<br/>
expect you to keep this secret as i don&#39;t want too many people to know about<br/>
it yet and have other classes complain that we are too powerful(When played<br/>
right, we are very, very powerful).  Thanks.<br/>
