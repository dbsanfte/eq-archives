<div id="ygrps-yiv-380588682">I found your comments very interesting Glyphin.  I look forward to testing them <br/>
out.  It&#39;ll be many levels yet before I have the chance as I&#39;m only level 14...heh <br/>
you level slower when you have 2 primary characters &lt;G&gt;...but it&#39;s nice to hear <br/>
some positive comments.<br/>
<br/>
For those who are so frustrated with the wizard class, take a break for a bit.  <br/>
Go play another class up to level 10..something that has intrigued you maybe.  <br/>
I have 6 of my char slots with chars in them because when I get frustrated I go <br/>
play another char.   We all get frustrated at times but sending yet another <br/>
petition isn&#39;t the answer.  <br/>
