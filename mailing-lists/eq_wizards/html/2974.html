<div id="ygrps-yiv-455133283">&quot;verants poed about tweeking then just put a lvl limit on the item cant be<br/>
worn till ** lvl thats what muds have and it works very well.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I like this idea to.  I have also seen similar things done in other typs of<br/>
games.  A person would not be able to use cetain items untill their<br/>
profiency in that skill is high enough to use it.  Since skill levels are<br/>
based on character level this shouldn&#39;t be too difficult to so.  Of course i<br/>
am no programer so waht do I know.</div>
