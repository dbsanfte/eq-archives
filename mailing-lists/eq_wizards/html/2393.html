<div id="ygrps-yiv-1641705406">First of all,  if you notice in my post, it says &quot; ROOT &quot; not enstill or<br/>
immobilize or other high level spells.  I am talking about stuff around lvl 15<br/>
or blow.   This method of teaming up with just wizards works great,  mobs arond<br/>
this lvl hit me for around 30 dmg a pop,  and with 210 hp, i can stand for a few<br/>
shots. they also miss a lot too, so not to worry.  come on, with 3 wizards<br/>
blasting, how long do you THINK the mob is gona live huh ??   it will be dead<br/>
within the fist 4 shots.   Everyone use Shock of LIghtning in my groups and hit<br/>
for around 79 dmg each time.  thats 3 x 79 at the first shot, and 237 dmg done<br/>
already.  Most will not resist, if some resist, fine,  we can still combine hit<br/>
for around 100 dmg at least.  If root works, great, mob is gone in seconds, if<br/>
root don&#39;t work, mob will also die within 20 seconds.    Just kill it fast and<br/>
we won&#39;t need those dumb tanks.   Anyways, 2 or 3 wizzies together also make<br/>
great KS team.  Both can stand at opposite sides of a derv camp and blast, those<br/>
other ppl don&#39;t even know we are teamed haha.     anyways, just some ways for<br/>
all u power gamers out there to gain lvl even faster.<br/>

haha. won&#39;t work to &quot;stand and melee&quot; at higher lvls (not many classes can<br/>
actually do this without a healer).  believe me, when you&#39;ve got a total of<br/>
roughly 450-500 hp and the monsters are hitting for anywhere from 50-70 in<br/>
the mid to high 20&#39;s and kicking/bashing for a descent amount of dmg (and<br/>
just about all monsters stun on a regular basis), then you WILL NOT STAND<br/>
AND MELEE.  And no, the mob will not leave you if he senses that he can kill<br/>
you (ie. once your health is down far enough, there&#39;s no getting him off of<br/>
you. period).<br/>
<br/>
your best bet is just to stay back and make sure he doesn&#39;t come after you,<br/>
or root the son-of-a-bitch.  if he does get a hold of you, you&#39;re gonna die<br/>
real quick if you don&#39;t do something about it (and no, that doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
melee).<br/>
<br/>
keep on with your melee, as it is not suicide at lvl 13...  but make sure<br/>
you don&#39;t make a habit of it, as when you pass 20, and move into the mid<br/>
20&#39;s and higher, you&#39;ll see the light, and realize why some of us don&#39;t even<br/>
carry a weapon anymore :)<br/>
