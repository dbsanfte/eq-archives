<div id="ygrps-yiv-1870382490">I don&#39;t think that is nessesary,  You still have more intellegence than a maxed<br/>
out human wizard or a maxed out high elf wizard, and both of them are very<br/>
usable class/race combo&#39;s.  I&#39;d keep him, but if you do start a new character my<br/>
suggestion would be to make the intellegence divisable by 5.  I saw the equation<br/>
for calculating mana on the message boards during beta, and although I can&#39;t<br/>
remember exactly what it was; I do rember that they divided your Int by 5 when<br/>
calculating it.  Lastly I would put any extra skill points in either dexterity<br/>
or wisdom.  Dexterity will keep you from getting interupted as often and wisdom<br/>
will provide you with some magic resistance.<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; maybe you can help me:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve created a darkelf wizard und spent 20 points to INT, 5 points to STR<br/>
&gt; and 5 points to CHARISMA (stupid, I don&#39;t know why i did that). Do you<br/>
&gt; think it&#39;s worth to recreate my character spending 25 points to INT and 5<br/>
&gt; to AGILITY?<br/>
&gt; Or do you think the stats are ok and I will have no major disadvantages in<br/>
&gt; the future? By the way I&#39;m lvl 8 now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; These are my stats:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; STR 65   STA 75   AGI 90   DEX 75   WIS 83   INT 129   CHA 65<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Greetings<br/>
