<br/>
  I&#39;ve seen a lot of posts recently about where to hunt at what lvls.  I<br/>
have been able to reach 20th lvl now and thought I&#39;d share my thoughts and<br/>
experiences on this matter.<br/>
<br/>
  I am a High Elf, so for my first 3 lvls, I stuck around Felwithe.  Now<br/>
matter what city you start in, just stick around the gates and solo the<br/>
various creatures there, you should make 4th lvl in no time.<br/>
<br/>
  At 4th lvl, I traveled to BB (ButcherBlock), braving the rampaging Ogres,<br/>
and went just outside the docks there, again soloing the various creatures<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
  At 5th lvl, I teamed with a Cleric and we started taking out some of the<br/>
monsters around the crossroads.  I wish to stress here that, while soloing<br/>
beyond 4th lvl is certainly possible, I don&#39;t recommend it.  Just grab one<br/>
other person who can tank for you and you&#39;ll see that its easier and faster<br/>
to gain those earlier lvls.  From 5th til 16th lvl, I only teamed with this<br/>
Cleric friend of mine and we seldom had any problems.  I would venture to<br/>
say, that as a 2 man team goes, a Wizard and Cleric have to be one of the<br/>
best combinations around, especially against Undead.<br/>
<br/>
  From 6th to 8th, we went around killing skeletons and goblins.  We found<br/>
that it was actually faster to roam the countryside looking for these<br/>
creatures than actually going to a spawn site and camping.  Usually the<br/>
spawn site was already camped and you could only kill as fast as it spawned.<br/>
<br/>
  The following is a little known secret.  From 9th to 11th, we went on the<br/>
boat and as soon as it zoned into the OOT (Ocean Of Tears) from BB, there is<br/>
a few rocky islands with Aqua Goblins on them.  These Aqua Goblins are great<br/>
xp, have an excellent spawn rate, very good loot, and are hardly ever camped<br/>
out.  Since both of us had Gate, it was a simple matter to exit the zone,<br/>
but if you have a partner without that spell, there is a hidden door at the<br/>
bottom of the boat.  When it sails by, all you have to do is press up<br/>
against the side of the boat and you will pop through it as it sails by you.<br/>
<br/>
  12th lvl was the hardest for us to obtain, but we did it over in SF<br/>
(SteamFont Mountains) killing the various creatures outside of the Minotaur<br/>
Cave.  We actually camped over by the mountains opposite of the cave so as<br/>
not to attract the attention of the Minotaur Hero when he spawned.<br/>
<br/>
  From 12th to 16th lvl, we hunted in Unrest.  I can&#39;t stress enough how<br/>
much xp and loot we earned over there.  We made those 4 lvls in just 2<br/>
days!!!  Just stay by the zone entrance, never go in the house and you&#39;ll be<br/>
fine.  If someone trains too many critters, you are right next to the zone<br/>
and can escape.  This is also where the Cleric shines.  His DD spells<br/>
against Undead, coupled with our Wizard spells are incredible.<br/>
<br/>
  From 16th to present, we started traveling in larger groups, going to the<br/>
various Dungeons in the world.  The Dungeons offer great xp and loot, but<br/>
usually require a full party as they get much tougher the deeper you go.<br/>
<br/>
  I apologize for the length of this post, but I hope it helps you in<br/>
determining where to hunt and how to gain those lvls.  I&#39;m sure that other<br/>
ppl out there have some great hunting spots as well and I encourage you all<br/>
to share them with us.<br/>
