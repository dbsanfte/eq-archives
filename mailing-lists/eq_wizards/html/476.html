<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-676606418">Yes. I&#39;m positive.  But you&#39;re right though. You cant pick the robe up. It HAS to be in a bag. (holder, backpack, etc.)  Have the other person put it into a container, and then commit suicide.  When he consents you, you can pick the bag up, with the robe in it.  You cant pick the robe up individually, you can only take the bag. but if the robe is in the bag, you get it.  I should have mentioned that in my original message.  Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>
<br/>
Keep the questions coming...  I&#39;ve got another 35 minutes to kill before I get to go home and play.  hehe<br/>

&gt; Aye, I ran into the same problem, Tandayen.  I don&#39;t think another player can loot a robe of your dead carcass.<br/>

&gt; 	Are you sure about that?  You&#39;ve done it before?  I died once a long way<br/>
&gt; 	from home, and consented someone to loot my body and bring my stuff back.<br/>
&gt; 	He was able to take everything except my robe.  No matter how many times he<br/>
&gt; 	dragged it over to his inventory it stayed on my body.<br/>

&gt; 	&gt;because of all the messages I&#39;m gettin about how to get them, I&#39;ve decided<br/>
&gt; 	to post it...<br/>
&gt; 	&gt;<br/>
&gt; 	&gt;/consent    Yep.  Thats how.  If you die..  and you consent someone else to<br/>
&gt; 	retrieve your belongings.. they can take your robe.  Then, they cant give it<br/>
&gt; 	back to you.<br/>
&gt; 	&gt;<br/>
&gt; 	&gt;EXAMPLE:  You want that black robe from Neriak..   problem is..  you&#39;re a<br/>
&gt; 	High Elf.  You travel into Neriak..  just near the zone..  do a /who all and<br/>
&gt; 	find a wizard in there...  start telling people to help you out.   Heres the<br/>
&gt; 	deal...  your &quot;friend&quot; the dark elf has to go buy it.  Whether you give him<br/>
&gt; 	money or whatever is inconsequential.  He gets the robe, and goes to meet<br/>
&gt; 	you.  He has to die.  After he dies, he /consent s you to retrieve things<br/>
&gt; 	off of his corpse.  You take the robe.   Now you&#39;ve got it.   If you try to<br/>
&gt; 	give it back to him, you&#39;ll get the error message &quot;This item cannot be<br/>
&gt; 	dropped, traded, or sold.&quot;  but its yours now.<br/>
&gt; 	&gt;<br/>
&gt; 	&gt;Hope that helps.<br/>
&gt; 	&gt;<br/>
&gt; 	&gt;Let me know if there are any questions.<br/>
