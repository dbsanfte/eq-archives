<br/>
I was in BB and wanted to get around the Gnoll Guard in the little alcove<br/>
and I didn&#39;t want to just run by him so I figured what the hell, Shadowstep.<br/>
Took me 6 tries but I made it from the water up to the rock area just above<br/>
the guard. It wasn&#39;t much vertical distance but it was enuff. It could be<br/>
that I was just in the right position too but I did seem to move up.<br/>
