<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026186933">.  :P  I&#39;m not a very good solo wizzie, I don&#39;t know how<br/>
you solo guys do it. :)  I don&#39;t trust root at all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One thing that helps me is I got Jboots before they became a quest item.  If<br/>
my root fails, i can get away.  Also somethings resist root a lot more than<br/>
others.  Aviaks for instace are nearly root proof to me.</div>
