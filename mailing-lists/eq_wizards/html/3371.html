&gt; Hi folks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just made it to lvl 6.  I am presently in North Qeynos and wondering where a<br/>
&gt; lvl 6 wiz should go for good hunting.  Any advice as to what I should do at<br/>
&gt; this level?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You can take a quick trip over to East commons.  Finding a group should be<br/>
easy, and the hunting, plentiful.  The ooc attitude is a bit immature there<br/>
though.   Single orcs in N. Ro are also possible.  You can also do the entance<br/>
to many dungeons.  ie Guk,  Blackburrow, and old Paw (Don&#39;t know if its<br/>
upgraded yet).  Level 8 is when your horizons really expand.  Most zones offer<br/>
something to hunt at this level..</div>
