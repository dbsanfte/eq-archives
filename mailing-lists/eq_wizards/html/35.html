<div id="ygrps-yiv-749235301">I have a few questions...<br/>
<br/>
1.  Spell damage seems to be linked to level somehow, anyone<br/>
have any idea how?  Is it just 1 extra point per level?  Is<br/>
it spell dependant?<br/>
<br/>
For example, as a fifth level wizard using Shock of Fire, I was<br/>
consistantly doing 13 points of damage.  After going to 6th<br/>
level, I am consistantly doing 14 points.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Also, I have been playing around with the spells, and I am having<br/>
trouble getting O&#39;keils Radiation to work.  How does it work and<br/>
what is the best way to use it?<br/>
<br/>
3.  Any idea where I can find a Glimpse spell in Freeport?  I have<br/>
tried the guild and can not find it for sale.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not that<br/>
great<br/>
of a spell, but I think it&#39;s the only one I don&#39;t have.<br/>
<br/>
                                                        Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
