<div id="ygrps-yiv-466197071">If I were buying only one, it would be Shock of Ice.  Bolts do have their <br/>
place, and I regret waiting so long to buy some good ones, but they can miss <br/>
or be blocked and in my opinion that is just too risky.  When you first get <br/>
the level new spells will use too much of your mana for you to want to risk <br/>
any failures.  Save up for a bolt, it will be VERY useful at L10 or L11.<br/>

&gt;What is the best DD spell? Was planning on Fire Bolt, but would Shock of<br/>
&gt;Ice be better?<br/>
