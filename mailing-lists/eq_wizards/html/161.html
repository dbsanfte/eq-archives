<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256461630">Well, I have no good news for you. I found lvl 8 and 9 to be my hardest thus<br/>
far simply because when you go solo everything is either too hard, or too<br/>
easy.. there aren&#39;t many in betweens.  (at least that is what I found for<br/>
the creatures around the neriak/freeport area)  The way I made it through<br/>
was by meeting people who played the game well, and we went out and hunted.<br/>
For a lower lvl wizard going solo can be disastrous.. at 14 I still have<br/>
tons of problems solo.  The only advice I can give you, is keep trying in<br/>
the parties.. eventually you will find some good people who play well, and<br/>
who you get along with.  Then when you play after that you&#39;ll know who to<br/>
look for a little better so that you can get back together as a good group.<br/>
Sorry I have nothing really conforting to say.. but grouping is a major part<br/>
of playing a wizard.  If it&#39;s impossible to find anyone around the freeport<br/>
area, then you try moving to another city.  Travelling to Qeynos is not<br/>
extremely hard from freeport (1 really hard zone) and I&#39;m sure you could<br/>
find someone there to bind you, and hopefully more people who you would be<br/>
able to group with.  Good luck to you...<br/>

&gt;Ok I have a problem....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am a level 8 Human Wizard in Freeport, Xegony server. My problem is I do<br/>
 </span></blockquote>not have any friends playing EQ. My game so far has been solo. The levels<br/>
are coming very slow. I have grouped up with people several times. This<br/>
turns into a nightmare. Most of the time we all just run around aimlessly,<br/>
it takes so much time just to get sometime going its not really worth it.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone have any suggestions? I have a friend who is going to buy the game<br/>
 </span></blockquote>soon, its just hard to wait. It took me 1 week to level up from 7 to 8.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Not to mention Humans can&#39;t see in the dark.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry for the long winning post.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>
&gt;<br/>
