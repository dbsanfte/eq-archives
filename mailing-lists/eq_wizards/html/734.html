<b>Subject:</b> Lvl 29 and over Spells! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-700703322">Hello, I am putting together a list that will soon be ready for all the<br/>
wizards of all of Norrath on any server(i.e. its not server specified,<br/>
just wizards, but we will soon be branching off into other classes!)!<br/>
This information is going to be VERY detailed, so me and Albryno would<br/>
really like it if anyone here is over lvl 29! We need a list of those<br/>
spells, what they do, actually, we need any information you got on<br/>
spells over lvl 29!<br/>
Thx for all the help :)<br/>
