&gt;&gt;&quot;Your gate is unstable and closes&quot;  I&#39;ve gotten this message a couple of<br/>
&gt;&gt;times now (since the last patch) Has anybody else gotten this?<br/>

&gt;I remember fondly the first time I got this message. It was weeks ago, <br/>
&gt;before I crossed the ocean from Kaladim to Freeport. I had just gotten my <br/>
&gt;new Gate spell, among others, and was anxious to journey across the water to <br/>
&gt;see the world. Ah, the folly of youth! Anyway, I had JUST missed the boat at <br/>
&gt;Kaladim, and decided for the heck of it to jump into the water and swim <br/>
&gt;after it. I figured, &quot;I&#39;ve got a 30 in swimming, I&#39;ll be fine!&quot;. Well of <br/>
&gt;course I failed to catch up to the boat, so I told my friend to give me locs <br/>
&gt;once in awhile to help guide me along, and I&#39;d meet him in Freeport. Ha! It <br/>
&gt;was then that I discovered that you cannot zone from the middle of the <br/>
&gt;water, even if you make it to the point where the boat crosses the zone <br/>
&gt;line! I was so frustrated (though I HAD become a much better swimmer by <br/>
&gt;then!) I decided to let myself sink to the bottom, and cast GATE. The spell <br/>
&gt;started, the timer went to zero, and I was greeted with the disturbing <br/>
&gt;message that my gate was unstable and had collapsed! I took this to mean <br/>
&gt;that it was because of the water overhead, and never again attempted to gate <br/>
&gt;from underwater.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Slightly off-topic: that reminds me of my levels spent in Crushbone. When <br/>
&gt;I&#39;d get too beat-up and things got scary with Lego trains, I&#39;d jump into the <br/>
&gt;water by the Slaver cabin and med. Of course I couldn&#39;t see my air bubble to <br/>
&gt;tell when I needed to go up for more air, but I usually had a very good <br/>
&gt;sense of timing when it came to checking on it. I was congratulating myself <br/>
&gt;on my cleverness one day while meditating at the bottom of the pool when I <br/>
&gt;realized I had spent too much time gabbing with my party and not enough time <br/>
&gt;paying attention to my DROWNING. I swam to the surface but was losing HPs <br/>
&gt;fast! By the time I got to the surface, I was down to 0 hps, and was knocked <br/>
&gt;unconscious. However, at the exact moment I hit unconscious, I managed to <br/>
&gt;surface and get a breath. Down I sank, down to the bottom of the foul pool, <br/>
&gt;unconscious and burning air reserve. About then I began making plans to <br/>
&gt;abandon Crushbone for greener (and less watery) pastures. I was VERY lucky <br/>
&gt;and managed to regain consciousness and rise to the surface just before my <br/>
&gt;air ran out. I immediately gated back to Felwithe, and once healed I made <br/>
&gt;the journey to Steamfront with great haste.<br/>
