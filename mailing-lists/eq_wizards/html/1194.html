<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269210516">Its not about the money.  (for me anyways)  I bind people for 5 gold, unless they are very generous... sometimes they&#39;ll give me a plat.  (one occasion, a high level Ogre gave me 10 plat to bind him at HighHold)  But its the roleplaying.  I&#39;ve had lots of times where a low level character will asked to be bound...  I tell him that I will not bind him unless he can pay.  He says that he has 20 copper..  and offers 6 or 7 of it.  ..and even though, at level 16.. a few copper is trivial.  I&#39;ll accept it, and bind him.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something that I did the other day at West Gate...<br/>
	I was sitting there, medding.  My clan was having a guildwar with another clan at the time, and I had little time between skirmishes.  Someone pleaded for a bind.  I offered my services, if they were a paying customer.  He said that he had a few gold.. but he was trying to save up to buy himself a weapon.  I checked his level...  (thank you everyone who plays with anon off)  ...and found out that he was a level 3 monk.  My guild had been saving up pelts for our tailors/smiths in outfitting the entire clan with an extra set of armor.  So I asked the monk if he would be willing to perform a task for me...  in exchange for the bind.  He was very excited about it.  (for some reason..  people like quests. heh)  So I told him to get me 2 wolf pelts.  He said ok..  I grouped with him, and went ahead and bound him.  then I ran off and continued my war.  Later on..   maybe 30 min later.. I was back at west gate medding.  He came up to me and handed me 2 pelts.  It was a cool roleplayi!<br/>
ng experience.  So..  it doesn&#39;t take much.  But I think the main reason to charge for binding is to roleplay.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course.. if you dont like roleplaying..   then you dont charge anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
Just MHO.<br/>

&gt; Disclaimer: this is only my opinion so no flames please.  I am only hoping<br/>
&gt; to elicit some other opinions on this subject as well.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know why but it has never made sense to me to charge for services<br/>
&gt; such as binding, invis, and language training.  Perhaps it is just the<br/>
&gt; personality of my character that he enjoys helping others and gets full<br/>
&gt; satisfaction out of the good deed itself, not needing any sort of physical<br/>
&gt; compensation.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I realize that I will be able to make make up to a plat or more each per<br/>
&gt; bind and a plat or more for invis (depending on how bad they want it) but<br/>
&gt; that just seems unkind.  I remember when I was level 8 just travelling over<br/>
&gt; to freeport.  I only had a couple of my new 3rd circle spells because they<br/>
&gt; were so expensive and I was flat broke.  I saw people auctioning: &quot;Binding<br/>
&gt; at S. Gate, 15gp&quot;, and there was no way i could afford that without selling<br/>
&gt; the few pieces of cloth armor i had left.  I was lucky to find a kind druid<br/>
&gt; that bound me and asked for nothing in return, but I just wonder why so many<br/>
&gt; seek to earn a profit from their abilities rather than just use them to help<br/>
&gt; others and take joy in that.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I guess it is just based on your roleplaying style, but even if I have no<br/>
&gt; money and still have spells to buy, I would not ask for or accept any sort<br/>
&gt; of payment for using my talents.  Does anyone else agree with me or do you<br/>
&gt; all think that you SHOULD rightfully earn a profit from using your skills?<br/>

&gt; I am excellent in Dragon, Combine, Old Eurdian, Elder Elvish, and am working<br/>
&gt; on Elder Tier&#39;Dal today.  I will be happy to teach Dragon and Combine for 6&gt; <br/>
&gt; runes each.  The rest, I will teach for 3 runes or 5 plat each.  I am<br/>
&gt; located on the Tarew Marr server.  I am firm on the Dragon and Combine btw.<br/>
&gt; I won&#39;t accept money but only runes for those languages.<br/>
