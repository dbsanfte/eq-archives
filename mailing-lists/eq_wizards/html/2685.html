<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113796003">Yes I can see where &quot;many elves&#39; would be difficult to figure out, but I<br/>
also totally agree with the PC faction system when it comes to your own<br/>
race.  One of the biggest reason I gave up on my PvP char there was that my<br/>
own race was killing me.  Each Race should stick together and fight other<br/>
races not each other.  SO I think the faction system which then prevents<br/>
them from going into their own town because they killed their own kind if<br/>
GREAT.  But I also must say that it takes more than one kill to make this<br/>
faction so.  It takes about 5-10 kills of your own race or any race to start<br/>
to remove your good faction with them.<br/>

  i am not speaking of the NPC faction system, but rather the PC faction<br/>
system they recently put in (which seems to be a totally different faction<br/>
system).  when i kill a wood elf, my faction lowers with &quot;many elves&quot;.  what<br/>
do i kill to raise this faction? yes, it&#39;s pretty obvious if they explicitly<br/>
state which faction system u lose or gain with (such as indigo brotherhood<br/>
in neriak), but &quot;many elves&quot;? what the hell is that?  and kos in ur own home<br/>
town after killing 2 or 3 of ur brethren? i don&#39;t know about the non-pvp<br/>
servers, but this is a HUGE issue on rallos zek.  and what about interracial<br/>
guild wars and duels on the other servers? i heard that they have ceased to<br/>
exist since the faction system was put in. on zek, some ppl have just<br/>
totally given up on ever going &quot;home&quot;.  simply put, verant screwed up by<br/>
putting it in, and i&#39;ve heard that they are going to remove it (maybe just a<br/>
rumor, i don&#39;t know)...  too bad for all those that have already had the<br/>
factions fubar&#39;ed tho.<br/>

    You couldn&#39;t be more wrong.  The faction system makes you explore<br/>
different areas of the game to find ways to improve your faction.  If they<br/>
just told you how to improve or destroy your faction with any races then why<br/>
have it.  Why would a DE be allowed to enter or even buy from venders of<br/>
Good diety?  The faction system allows for a person to create their own<br/>
destiny by choosing which faction they wish to increase and hunting that<br/>
method out.<br/>
<br/>
        In Guk there are two factions of Frogloks, Good and Undead (Ghoul).<br/>
At the begining if you do not harm any Good frogloks and head into Guk and<br/>
get attacked by a Ghoul froglok, you can run to a good froglok and he will<br/>
protect you just like a guard would in your city.  This of course depends on<br/>
your starting faction with them.  Without a faction system then you will get<br/>
attack by everyone of them.<br/>

      well, i don&#39;t have an answer for u, but i think Verant royally screwed<br/>
up with the PC faction system they implemented.  anyway, i say if Verant is<br/>
going to continue with this patsy faction crap, they need to at least post<br/>
how u can alter ur faction in a positive manner.  or just totally remove the<br/>
stupid friggin PC faction system.<br/>
<br/>
      just my rant.<br/>

        Hello, fellow Wizards!<br/>
<br/>
        Several weeks ago I participated in a guild war and slew a High Elf<br/>
not knowing that there would be a faction hit as a result. Well, I can no<br/>
longer purchase or sell items in Felwithe. I&#39;ve tried everything that I know<br/>
of to improve my faction standing with the Merchants there, but to no avail.<br/>
My faction standing with the guards is &quot;amiable&quot; -- It is with the<br/>
&quot;Merchants&quot; that I need a faction adjustment. Does anyone have any ideas?<br/>
Suggestions? Personal experience? Would appreciate any and all advice.<br/>
