<div id="ygrps-yiv-808077422">That&#39;s a good idea. Seeing as that is one the wizards specialties, we<br/>
should feedback verant to expand us in that direction. Rather than<br/>
trying to make our class what it isn&#39;t (with pets and SoW and such). I<br/>
see 4 spell ideas in your post:<br/>
<br/>
bind affinity 2: Bind yourself ONLY to a second bind point<br/>
gate 2: Gate to yours second bind point<br/>
portal home: Group teleport back to our bind location<br/>
gate other: teleport group member back to their bind location<br/>
<br/>
If we work together and figure out a *fair* level to get these spells at<br/>
we could give feedback to verant about it. After all, we as seekers of<br/>
knowledge should be thinking of ways ( in game ) to increase our power.<br/>
These could be researched spells for instance where we have to discover<br/>
the runes that make it! Or a Norrath-wide contest to see who can figure<br/>
out the correct combination first.<br/>
<br/>
Oh btw, what are you fighting and where at 19th level? That&#39;s how far I<br/>
am and just got there! Thanks!<br/>

&gt; Wizards are supposed to be masters of teleportation, right?  So why can&#39;t we<br/>
&gt; have little perks like two bind points, or the ability to group teleport<br/>
&gt; back to our bind location, or a spell to teleport someone else, in group, to<br/>
&gt; their bind spot?  Sure would make traveling and acquiring knowledge a lot<br/>
&gt; quicker...<br/>
