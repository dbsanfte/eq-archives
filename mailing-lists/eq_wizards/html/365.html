<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552772670">Apprentice robes cannot be trade or sold.  hence, your friend in another town<br/>
cannot buy a robe for you and pass it along.  nor can apprentice robes be picked<br/>
up from your corpse by someone who has consent to loot it.  that robe is yours,<br/>
through and through.<br/>

Isn&#39;t the robe just anoher piece of clothing????   You should be able to<br/>
trade and/or buy them anywhere from anyone . . .<br/>

stay on the road??<br/>
