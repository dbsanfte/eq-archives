<b>Subject:</b> On possible twinking, with language info <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205436983">People who have high level items at low levels may not necessarily have been <br/>
twinked.  As I was not twinked, but had many hundreds of platinum by level <br/>
12.  There have been in the past messages posted requesting language <br/>
assitance.  Well, if someone has mastered all of the main languages in the <br/>
game, player languages, monster languages, and most importantly the research <br/>
languages (Old Erudian through elder Dragon).  Its amazing how well people <br/>
will pay to become excellent in the research languages.  Its really not that <br/>
hard to become excellent either, the most difficult thing is to find the <br/>
languages. Just search the land, looking for someone who will train you one <br/>
point in the language, and then get a friend, sit by a zone.  Whomever has <br/>
learned the language begins by speaking while one sits on the ground <br/>
listening.  When you have stopped improving, stand up and zone.  Then your <br/>
friend sits down, and you speak in the language until your friend improves <br/>
two points.   Then your friend stands up and you both zone again.  Repeat the <br/>
two point then zone process till your tired of it, or you&#39;re excellent.  This <br/>
method will take you from awful or higher to excellent, in an hour or two.  <br/>
Enjoy.  If anyone finds this info helpful, then I would appreciate a few <br/>
alcoholic beverages!  Enjoy, and good learning.<br/>
