<div id="ygrps-yiv-1716588168"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I spent one training point on the languages Dwarven, Gnoll,<br/>
&gt; and Erudian (sp)<br/>
&gt; when at the Academy of Sciences in Freeport but these<br/>
&gt; languages do not show<br/>
&gt; up in my skills when training at other trainers, and they<br/>
&gt; also are not<br/>
&gt; available as languages in my chat window. Anyone have any<br/>
&gt; idea why? Also<br/>
&gt; assuming I figure out how this can be fixed how can I<br/>
&gt; improve my skill in<br/>
&gt; these easiest.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think they will show up when your skill improves in these languages.<br/>
Also, after they improve some more you will see them show up in the<br/>
language selection box, so you can practice speaking them yourself.  I<br/>
have no idea how long this takes.<br/>
