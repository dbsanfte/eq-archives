<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1184185402">Yay!  Some useful information.  I will do my best to add to this promising<br/>
thread.<br/>
<br/>
Let me use the example of Unrest.  There is a long narrow passageway from<br/>
the zone to the area where most groups bring monsters to fight.  If a tank<br/>
becomes overwhelmed and starts to run for the zone, all the monsters follow<br/>
into the narrow tunnel and once the tank zones (or is killed) they will<br/>
immediately attack anyone else who is in the tunnel.  For a mage type, 3 or<br/>
4 level 25 skeletons will make VERY quick work of you if they are between<br/>
you and the zone.  Because of this you will almost always have to gate out<br/>
if you are in a bad situation.<br/>
<br/>
I also find that as a wizard you can greatly assist your group by organizing<br/>
attacks and providing information.  Standing back from the group (as<br/>
mentioned below) I will report on monsters around us and possible trains<br/>
forming, as well as reminding the party which monsters to attack first (I<br/>
can&#39;t believe that there are still so many level 18+ players who don&#39;t know<br/>
how to ASSIST).  Anyway, try your best to be on top of the situation and<br/>
gauge the ability of your group.  Should things turn bad you can pull a few<br/>
baddies off your tank so that they can escape, and hopefully shieldskin will<br/>
last long enough for you to stay alive as well. :)<br/>
<br/>
Please add your battle tactics to this thread and hopefully we will all die<br/>
less :)<br/>

That&#39;s a good question.  It really depends.  Assuming you have a balanced <br/>
group (ie a healer, a tank or two, and some nukers) more likely than not, <br/>
you&#39;ll have enough time in the group during battles to dictate who needs to <br/>
run and when.  My regular group finds it best to have the tank buffed up <br/>
with SOW so that he/she can run when necessary without jeapardizing (sp?) <br/>
the rest of the group.  If it&#39;s a controlled & organized party, the <br/>
creature(s) will most likely all be attacking your &quot;pulling&quot; tank.<br/>
<br/>
If I find myself in an unfamiliar group I kinda play it by ear.  It&#39;s a lot <br/>
different playing against orcs in Oasis & CB versus training Dry Bone Skels <br/>
in Unrest.  Main thing I found helpful is to call out who you&#39;re assisting <br/>
in a fight so that everybody can zero in on one creature at a time.  /ASSIST<br/>
<br/>
is our friend. :)<br/>
<br/>
I try not to cast too early as to call attention from a tank.  And I try not<br/>
<br/>
to cast too little as to have left my tank high and dry.  I think it&#39;s our <br/>
obligation to make sure we are not engaged in melee during battle so as to <br/>
not be interrupted during attacks and so the tanks need not chase the <br/>
creature about.<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes make judgement calls if I feel that my tank is not going to make<br/>
<br/>
it to zone.  I have sometimes let loose on spells to draw some creatures to <br/>
me....with Shieldskin up, I can afford to absorb some blows where I can then<br/>
<br/>
choose to run them away from the tank or to keep their attention while my <br/>
tank hits them from behind.  This works OK, but it sometimes results in a <br/>
gory death. :)  But this is no problem if you trust your party...tanks die <br/>
for you...be willing to die for your tanks sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Whoa, I&#39;ve talked too much.  Hope these tips help somebody.  I am by no <br/>
means an expert so don&#39;t expect these to work for everybody.  I&#39;d like to <br/>
encourage everybody to express some of their battle tactics here rather than<br/>
<br/>
argue all the time! hehe<br/>
