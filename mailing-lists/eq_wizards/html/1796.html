<div id="ygrps-yiv-290713883">According to Wizard:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Lucky hmmm in everquest all is in luck i got nearly 60 plat in one hour<br/>
&gt; when i go in bank and i sell all what i have but it is result of 10 hours<br/>
&gt; of play at 12 and 13 lv. If you got a god loot and all nobles in PAW have a<br/>
&gt; snakeskin wich you sell for 6 to 10 plat then you have a luck.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At 11 and above, hunt wisps. Preferably at night, and picks wisps that gives<br/>
off light. The three I have picked so far that were giving off light had<br/>
lightstones (one had a greater) and 1g5 to 3g in cash.<br/>
<br/>
Commonlands have an abundance of wisps. Faydark has some too, and Erud&#39;s<br/>
crossing is rumored to have a true nest of the pests.<br/>
