<b>Subject:</b> Raising Faction in Freeport? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1414628836">Hail all,<br/>
I&#39;m a 13th lvl Erudite wizard currently residing in Qeynos. My <br/>
faction there is pretty good ( I&#39;ve killed many gnolls and turned in <br/>
at least 20 fangs to Capt Tilian )I plan to relocate to Freeport <br/>
shortly and would like to get my faction up as quickly as possible. <br/>
What and where should I hunt to do this. I&#39;m not as interested in exp <br/>
until I build some good faction. Any suggestions would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
TIA<br/>
Larimus<br/>
