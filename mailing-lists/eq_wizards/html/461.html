<div id="ygrps-yiv-1338216909">I&#39;m 14th right now, and the other people I&#39;m with are 9-11th. Unrest was a<br/>
waste because of the overcrowding of mega-level characters, and the really<br/>
big bad assed things that would come along, totally resist all my spells as<br/>
my comrades were running for the exit and I did the shadowstep/gate dance.<br/>
<br/>
Crushbone seems to be right up my alley. I&#39;m in Kaladim right now, how do I<br/>
get there?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

Oh, if I was you, I know a great place to power level, but it&#39;s Kerra Isle<br/>
between Queynos and Erudin. Just sit by the shipwreck and take on the zombie<br/>
sailors. I rocketed through 11-13 with them. However, you&#39;ll need to flesh<br/>
out your group some to do this, because the initial wave is 3. If you delay<br/>
looting corpses you can then take them on 1 at a time or 2 at a time. The<br/>
place also spawns 3 wisps, and because you can lap the island in under 2<br/>
minutes, they&#39;re readily found. Good cash, and great xps at 10-11th level.<br/>
As well, not a lot of people go there. Well, that&#39;s my experience.<br/>

&gt;Hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I play a High Elf Wizard. He is currently 10th lvl. The first 9 levels went<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does anyone have advice on how to advance faster. And combinations of<br/>
