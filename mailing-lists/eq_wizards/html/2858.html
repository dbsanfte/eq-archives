<div id="ygrps-yiv-94639800">I have no confirmation if this is true or just a rumor, but I heard that<br/>
Verant originally planned to give us a real flight spell, but they were<br/>
unable to either make it work correctly, or there was a balance issue, so<br/>
they just changed it to the levitate spell.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anyone have any idea why it is listed as &quot;flight&quot; and not levitate?  is it<br/>
&gt; just me, or does anyone else remember early spell lists having the spell<br/>
&gt; flight in it? i may have been dreaming &lt;and thats most likely the case&gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; i think i remember seeing flight as a mage spell?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; and if it wasnt, dont you think flight would be a cool spell to have? :) </span></blockquote></div>
