<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534691601">Yes, there are 2 different planes, but the teleportation spell for the Plane of Hate is a 34th lvl spell.  The Plane of Air is 44th lvl.  Also, for those that are unaware, these teleportation spells are group teleportations, not just for yourself.  These spells can be find at the guildhouse in Felwithe and the Library in Erudin.<br/>

  Yes there are 2 different planes besides the normal one. Hate and Sky (or air). The spells are Alter Plane: Hate and Alter Plane: Sky. They are both lvl 44 spells. I have a friend who traveled there. He said there are liches on the hate plane. Personally i cant wait to get to go there but are there only certain places from which you can cast these spells? This i do no know he didnt say, but from the way you were talking there is. </span></blockquote></div>
