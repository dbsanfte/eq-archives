<b>Subject:</b> Re: Woven Or Netted Armor For A Wizard? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-919271508">Im wandering myself i just turn 15th and i have currently been hunting<br/>
in befallen searching for the fabaled (sp) Damask armor i heard only a<br/>
few pieces could be found there but haven&#39;t scene any thus far..<br/>
However i also hurt a type of white robe is here also.. but im afraid<br/>
ill have to catch a partyu of more expirence before i venture further..<br/>
some other places i heard to search, forgive my spelling, Is lower in<br/>
some dungeon beginning with a n.. Najela or something of that nature.<br/>
But alas all my journeys has turned up is one damask wristband which i<br/>
found to be very familair to that of Legionarrie bracers. AC 3 in all.<br/>
but no magical prorties this only leads me to belive that armro for a<br/>
wizard does not get strong enough entill a Enchanter helps out a little<br/>
i guess.. Which also makes him a excellent person two pair with a<br/>
wizard.. but Hope this helps at the least most somewhat useful to ya..<br/>
I&#39;ll try to add more later. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am currently a level 10 High Elf Wizard, and I<br/>
&gt; have a Sr. Apprentice robe along with a full set of<br/>
&gt; cloth armor. I would like to get either a full set<br/>
&gt; of the woven or the netted armor next, as an upgrade<br/>
&gt; from the cloth that I have now. I would like to know<br/>
&gt; which of the two types would be best to get next.<br/>
&gt; Also, what are the stats compared to the cloth<br/>
&gt; armor? Any help would be appreciated!<br/>
&gt; Regards,<br/>
&gt; Kelill <br/>
