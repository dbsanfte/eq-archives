<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076861520"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; As far as I can tell the wizard is pretty much useless and I have put him on the side because I can&#39;t solo (tried<br/>
&gt; many a time) and I can&#39;t find a party that wants me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I m a level 30 wizard on Karana and i have no problem to find group .<br/>
Why ? Because they know that i can do a bunch of damage if the thing<br/>
goes<br/>
weird in a dungeon for exemple .<br/>
At my level they prefer group with a wizard who can do 250 dmg fast <br/>
rather than with a magician who does like 150 with a pitfull Pet or <br/>
and Enchanter .<br/>
when the Mobs can hit at 80 per shot i tell you that they want it dead<br/>
fast .<br/>
<br/>
For a storie a friend in a full group wanted to kill a Steel Golem<br/>
a level 35sh mob . To do it they kicked away a level 30 warrior do let<br/>
me in<br/>
to help . That s what i call power . so dont say i m useless :p<br/>
