<div id="ygrps-yiv-827936864">Hehe, I&#39;ve seen you there doing that, and you might have seen me.  I<br/>
have found that the old adage about a little honey...  I rarely use<br/>
O&#39;Kiels Radiation now, but keep it memorized.  I see fighters, I cast it<br/>
on them, and make sure they see me doing it.  I root their kills when<br/>
they try to run.  And I get a LOT less complaints about kill-stealing,<br/>
cause the INSTANT anyone says it &quot;to the room&quot; about how wizards steal<br/>
kills, I jump on them, and get everyone else to back me that I&#39;ve been a<br/>
decent sort.  You will always get the random jerks, but you cant help<br/>
that.  <br/>
<br/>
Honestly - if you are dying, you would expect a fighter to help a bit. <br/>
Someone diseased? Of COURSE the cleric will cure it.  So I figure there<br/>
is usually dang little us wizards have that can help other players, we<br/>
should use all we can.  Make us just a BIT less hated.  <br/>
<br/>
I just played today, and it took about a 1/2 hr, but a guy who started<br/>
ranting, by the end was bowing and thanking me cause he realized that<br/>
even if not grouped, wizards can be a boon to an area.  (saved his life<br/>
a few times, and rooted a few of his runaways, etc)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The only problem with the Root and Shoot strategy is in places like<br/>
&gt;Crushbone or other open areas as soon as you root something a fighter &gt;or other class will charge the monster and start fighting it. This is &gt;usually not a problem because the damage our spells deliver can easily &gt;outmatch a fighter of similar level.  However the fighter will swear &gt;you stole his kill and you&#39;ll get a 20 min rant about how wizards are &gt;just a bunch of kill stealers.  It use to bother me at first but now a &gt;say what the hell I&#39;m a Wizard.<br/>
