<b>Subject:</b> question regarding area of effect <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-185074199">It seems that the area of effect spells all have<br/>
different ranges and shapes.  I cant seem to figure<br/>
out the third circle spell Column of Frost.  every<br/>
time I have targetted a monster or party member, only<br/>
one monster seems to be affected.  Am I supposed to<br/>
line up the monsters so they make up a column in front<br/>
of me?  What exactly is the area?<br/>
<br/>
Also, this spell seems to have a very short range,<br/>
relative to the (albeit unuseful) 2nd circle<br/>
Icestrike.<br/>
<br/>
I have also heard that for AE spells, targetting party<br/>
members is better than targetting the monster.  Is<br/>
this b/c (1) its maximizes the range and number of<br/>
monsters affected or (2) b/c it gets the monsters less<br/>
mad at you?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
