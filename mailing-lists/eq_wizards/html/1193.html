<b>Subject:</b> dueling strategies <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-112675302">I&#39;m just wondering what kind of strategies we should use in dueling other<br/>
classes.  I am a 17lvl erudite wiz playin on Rallos Zek.  I get challenges<br/>
to duel fairly frequently.  I have accepted one against a Dark Elf wiz and<br/>
whipped him as he had cast root first and I cast shock of lightning first.<br/>
I was able to get him lower quicker and when he tried to run I then cast<br/>
root.  I was wondering what kind of strategies we should use in dueling<br/>
other classes.  I know that we can do the most damage quickly but some<br/>
classes have heal and other spells which can ruin my day such as blind or<br/>
fear.  When it comes to the pure melee type classes such as warriors or<br/>
monks, it seems fairly easy to beat them as long as you can root them.  The<br/>
two classes that worry me the most are necros and druids.  The necro can<br/>
cast DOT spells then fear me so I can&#39;t attack and just wait as I slowly die<br/>
and the druid seems to be able to melee me, cast good Direct Damage and heal<br/>
more efficiently than I can hit for.  Plus if the druid is able to keep the<br/>
battle goin for a while thier DOT spells are extremely mana efficient.  Let<br/>
me know what you guys think, I don&#39;t like backing down to an even fight when<br/>
someone is being an a$$, but with my inexperience in dueling other classes I<br/>
really would hate to lose.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
