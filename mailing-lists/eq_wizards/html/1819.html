<div id="ygrps-yiv-1108409682">Hi<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am totaly with you Karim, when i started as a wizard i was told they where masters of damage and travel. Now i am lv 18 and getting near my first travel spells so i look them over and what do i see ? MOST of them go to bad zones for most wizards and the nearby ones !!. Why 2 travel spells to Karan for taking an example ? this is not what i was expecting. If i hade info on this before i hade playd a Druid maybe. One of the reasons i chose wizard was of the travel spells, and sure we get spells to outher planes. But do they work yet ? atleast one aint working maybe more. And that with resisiting spells well some resist and that often happens when the monster is way to high for you.<br/>
<br/>
Do anyone know how much XP penalty Wizards get ? even Paladins who are an hybrid class and get XP penalty get more XP then me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I play on Veeshan and if anyone see me on and want to group give me a tell. I am in High Hold Pass at the moment<br/>
