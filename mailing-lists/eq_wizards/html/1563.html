&gt; &gt; No, eye of zom is conjuration that s right but halo of<br/>
&gt; &gt; light is divination<br/>
&gt; &gt; (as sense magic). A question for all of you guys :<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s funny though, I just checked it again and my Conjuration goes up<br/>
&gt; when casting the Halo of Light spell.  Is it possible it checks<br/>
&gt; against both?<br/>
&gt; My Conjuration was at 0 before I got Halo, because I never used (never<br/>
&gt; got Eye of Zomm).  Since I started using Halo it&#39;s gone up a few<br/>
&gt; points, very slowly, to 7 now.  So my guess is it checks against both<br/>
&gt; Divination and Conjuration.  That&#39;s the only explanation I can come up<br/>
&gt; with.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, Halo Of Light is pure conjuration. Just right click on the spell in<br/>
your spell book and it says what skill it uses.<br/>
