<div id="ygrps-yiv-1124684316">I was attracted to playing a wizard by the way the class was described in<br/>
the game&#39;s manual, but if I had to do it over again (and I won&#39;t because I<br/>
have already put a lot of time into my character, and want to play with my<br/>
friends who are of the same level as I), I would pick a druid or shaman<br/>
type character. They have great spells, which can also be cast on other<br/>
party members, and aren&#39;t so weak in weapons and AC as wizards are. I hate<br/>
it when I tell my friends about the spells I can get, only to find out they<br/>
can be cast only on myself (shielding, resistant skin, etc.) My ranger<br/>
friend casts Skin like Wood on my all the time, I have nothing to<br/>
reciprocate. I think wizards as a class are short changed, and have never<br/>
seen anyone do a /shout looking for a wizard to join with them as they do<br/>
for rangers, shamans, bards, etc. Just my 2 cents.<br/>
