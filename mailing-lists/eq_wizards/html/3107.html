<div id="ygrps-yiv-314298262">I thinking today about how this mana thing could be settled.  I came up<br/>
with two ideas besides us getting more mana points.  Other RPG&#39;s like<br/>
Final Fantasy, they have potions that restore some mana.  What if we<br/>
were to have something like that.  Like a kind of mana potion or<br/>
something.  Then we would be more useful in groups, less meditating<br/>
time, and we would be able to fight solo....First root when getting low<br/>
on mana then bandage and cast.  The second idea that I had was a item or<br/>
piece of  equipment (or many items and pieces of equipment) that would<br/>
quicken the meditating process. Like a staff that would make our mana go<br/>
up 20% faster or whatever.<br/>
