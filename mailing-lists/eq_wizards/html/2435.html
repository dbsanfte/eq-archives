<div id="ygrps-yiv-2012184311">I only have a very limited knowledge of a couple of things in Butcher.  I <br/>
know that there is definitely a tie-in with Dvinn over in Crushbone; <br/>
something akin to how Dvinn is twisting some evil plot with Emporer Crush <br/>
about something. (sorry, I forget)  Anyway, there&#39;s a paladin&#39;s quest over <br/>
in Felwithe in which you are supposed to help foil this evil plot by <br/>
stopping Dvinn&#39;s orc messenger/runner in Butcher before he reaches his <br/>
destination.  The plot unravels itself between this quest and the one on CB <br/>
for the screaming mace.<br/>
<br/>
As for Corflunk and Zarchoomi there&#39;s a dwarf quest over in Kaladim in which <br/>
you are to collect their heads.  I haven&#39;t completed this one yet so I have <br/>
a stinky head in my bank account.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I don&#39;t know more...<br/>
