<div id="ygrps-yiv-1686908570">Well, it looks like Brad reads alt.games.everquest so it&#39;s worth a try<br/>

Maximum exposure means they&#39;ll notice us.<br/>

If such a thing happens, and a debate ensues, I encourage everyone to<br/>
subscribe to the newsgroup and support our views. Most people have never<br/>

we must show them they are wrong.<br/>
