<b>Subject:</b> Notes to the &quot;make research fun&quot; post .. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-839228027">I think that some of you may of missed the point in my &#39;make research fun&#39;<br/>
post. I am a lvl 34 wizard, I have purchased most of my spells from Erudin<br/>
and Felthiwe (sp?). But my post was NOT just aimed at wizards, but magic<br/>
users in general. If they made all the &quot;run of the mill basic spells to<br/>
their class&quot; buyable. Such as<br/>
<br/>
- the necromancers pet<br/>
- high lvl DD spells for magi and wizards<br/>
- the &quot;basic&quot; enchanter spells (no clue what they are)<br/>
- magicians pets (arnt those buyable now anyways?)<br/>
<br/>
But leave the more interesting spells up for research only, and more<br/>
powerfull varaints of spells research only.<br/>
<br/>
Research SHOULD be something that is fun and adds to the game enviroment,<br/>
not a distracting pain in the ass that makes you wish you were a wis-based<br/>
caster since you could just buy all your spells.<br/>
<br/>
Also the suggestion about being able to &quot;Dig Up&quot; runes is to provide us with<br/>
something to do BESIDES KILL THINGS . To many things in EverQuest focus<br/>
around one thing - KILLING<br/>
<br/>
- To gain any descent amount of exp. you KILL<br/>
- To get any sort of loot/items. you KILL<br/>
- To make the next level. you KILL<br/>
- To find runes. you KILL<br/>
<br/>
Being able to quest and &quot;search&quot; for runes would add a fair bit to the game<br/>
I think.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, research could also add DIVERSITY to the game. To many people are<br/>
exactly the same. Same amour same spells same this same that. The only thing<br/>
that sperats people are their stats. And for wizards it&#39;s basicly maxed int<br/>
and what you can put into the other stats is slow it they dont make that<br/>
much of a diff.<br/>
<br/>
But imagin this..<br/>
<br/>
- Sammy the wizard has reached lvl 29. He gates over to Tox forest, and<br/>
trundles over to the libary of Erudin and buys his spells. They are the<br/>
basic run-of-the-mill spells.<br/>
<br/>
- Jippy the wizard has reached lvl 29. He gates over to tox forest, and buys<br/>
a few spells. He decideds to hold off on buying his gate spell because he<br/>
has some runes that have been rumoued to make a &quot;better gate&quot;, he also buys<br/>
the inferno spell, but dosnt scribe it right away.<br/>
<br/>
- Jippy wanders off to his lab, he mixes his runes and up comes a &quot;Toxxiula<br/>
Portal&quot; spell, but sicne Jippy put hte time and the effort into this new<br/>
gate spell, it may be a tad bit faster then Sammies.<br/>
<br/>
- Next jippy wanders off to his bank account and digs up a &quot;vial of<br/>
healing&quot;, and &quot;Erud&#39;s slowing&quot;. He toss&#39;s his inferno spell into his<br/>
lexcion, and mix&#39;s in the vial of healing and erud&#39;s slowing. And he<br/>
produces a new spell, he scripes this into his book. His spell is more mana<br/>
efficent does a bit more damage, looks like the healing spell with a pallet<br/>
swap. But it also takes longer to cast.<br/>
<br/>
So Jippy and Sammy are both lvl 29 wizards with all of their lvl 29 spells.<br/>
But Jippy has some more &quot;exoctic&quot; ones that just arnt standard run of the<br/>
mill. It makes the 2 wizards different.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the area effect and root spells should be research only, and possibly<br/>
the self-buff.. Whatever.. but point is<br/>
<br/>
- Research needs to be changed so it is NOT a tedious pain in the ass. But<br/>
something that is fun, adds diversity to magic users of the same class, and<br/>
does not distract from game play.<br/>
<br/>
As it stands now I find that research distracts more from game play then<br/>
anyhting else.</div>
