&gt; I think that only getting spells every 4 lvls is stupid.   I think that<br/>
&gt; we (or everybody) should get spells every lvl or every other lvl.<br/>
&gt; Especially for wizards.  My friend who is a lvl 5 enchanter almost has<br/>
&gt; more spells then I do.  They gave us so many useless spells.  Like the<br/>
&gt; low lvl Sphere of light.<br/>

High Elf, and fail to see that human wizards need this spell, as they<br/>
can&#39;t see in the night.<br/>
