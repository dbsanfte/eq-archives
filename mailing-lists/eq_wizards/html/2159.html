&gt; Any wizards out there with high dex (gnomes start with 85 dex I believe)<br/>
&gt; care to comment on this?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a gnomish Wizard, I also put 5 of my bonus points into dex (90?), and 3<br/>
into wisdom (70).  It doesn&#39;t seem to matter what is hitting me when I<br/>
recover.  I&#39;ve recovered while being hit by deep reds and Decaying skels.  I<br/>
tend to recover most while being hit by blues, but I have attacked/been<br/>
attacked by blues more than anything else.  Anyway, I pulled this from the<br/>
manual.<br/>
<br/>
Very interesting...... I&#39;m a lvl 12 Gnome Wizard with dex of 89 and I have<br/>
*never* been able to continue a spell against anything. Perhaps it&#39;s my<br/>
relatively low level?<br/>
