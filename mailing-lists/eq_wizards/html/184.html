<div id="ygrps-yiv-454887769">Surefall is located in Qeynos Hills, just follow the road straight out of<br/>
Qeynos and you will usually see Chanda by the fire near the entrance.<br/>

		&gt; Hail and well met adventurers, this is Eantos of the<br/>
Crafter of New Vision<br/>
		Guild. As I have seen numerous post I will be covering a few<br/>
topics in this<br/>
		E-mail. First, up the topic of armor.<br/>
		&gt; I personaly know of a Quest with Baobob and Chanda Miller<br/>
infront of<br/>
		Surefall glade. To get the great items made by these NPCs<br/>
all one has to do<br/>
		is raise you faction with them a little bit (kill bandits in<br/>
Karana plains,<br/>
		or gnolls in Splitpaw). Then target them and say phrases as<br/>
&quot;what belt?&quot;,<br/>
		&quot;what boots&quot;, and &quot;what cloak&quot;. They&#39;ll be sure to tell you<br/>
the rest. The<br/>
		armor they made is wearable by everyone, and is the same AC<br/>
as chainmail<br/>
		armor. Truely a wizards best friend. The seond topic I would<br/>
like to address<br/>
		is weapons.<br/>
		&gt; Personaly I have a great lust for two-handed weapons, and<br/>
just recently<br/>
		last night I found the secret to acquiring one of the most<br/>
powerfull<br/>
		two-handed staffs I have seen around. The name of the staff<br/>
is the &quot;Runed<br/>
		Totem Staff&quot;. This staff usualy has a street price of 35 to<br/>
55 plat. To<br/>
		acquire this staff, you must  travel to Splitpaw dungeon (in<br/>
South Karana).<br/>
		After you arrive at Splitpaw you must get together a tough<br/>
group of level<br/>
		12s and higher, then travel down into the depths of the<br/>
dungeon and find a<br/>
		NPC named &quot;Shaman Ren Rex&quot;. He puts up a good fight but<br/>
gives out a staff<br/>
		every 10th time he spawns or so. Also I have timed his<br/>
spawning to<br/>
		approximately 17 minutes. So, run around, kill him and come<br/>
back in 17<br/>
		minutes for him later....Well thats all that time I have<br/>
right now. I&#39;ll be<br/>
		back with some more information soon....<br/>
		&gt;<br/>
		&gt;<br/>
		&gt; -Eantos<br/>
		&gt;<br/>
		&gt; By the way, stats on Runed Totem Staff, +5 mana, +5<br/>
hitpoints, damage of<br/>
		9, delay of 37. (better than Great staff that sells in<br/>
stores for 25 plat)<br/>
