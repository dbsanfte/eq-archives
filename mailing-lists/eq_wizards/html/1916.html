&gt;These are very good ideas - I like them a lot.  Instead of Haste though,<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d like to see Shadowstep become a Line-of-sight teleport spell (as<br/>
&gt;someone on the list suggested earlier), and use that as our<br/>
&gt;travelling/exploring spell.  <br/>
<br/>

giant wich you cannot see as you were to long way from him.<br/>

SoW by any other name is still SoW.<br/>

&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve been thinking about a few new spells that Verant should implement,<br/>
&gt;tell me what you all think.  Most of these new spells is to reinforce the<br/>
&gt;ability for wizards to travel, so far it appears that Druids are just as<br/>
&gt;good, or even better then wizards with Spirt of the Wolf for traveling.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Summon - Teleports group member inside the zone to your location<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Phase - Teleports yourself to location of other group member inside zone<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Greater Summon - Teleports group member to your location, even across zones<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Greater Phase - Teleports yourself to a group members location, even<br/>
&gt;across zones<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Group Gate - Slow casting spell which teleports group to your bind spot,<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t leave anyone behind<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Retreat - Evacuate version of group gate<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Haste - Increases movement rate for self only.<br/>
