<b>Subject:</b> General new observations from a level 13 wiz <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-819955802">Okay, I guess it is bad I come on here to give my observations, but here<br/>
they are:<br/>
<br/>
Well I have discovered the wonders of doing the most damage to a Monster,<br/>
They come right at you.  Hunt you till you cry, and then kill you, no matter<br/>
what your friends do to try to save&#92;taunt&#92;interpose for you.  I have to<br/>
stand so far back that I don&#39;t even get the combat messages or sounds, and<br/>
that doesn&#39;t even work all the time.  Yes I&#39;m kicking ass and taking<br/>
names... but at what cost...  (It was great when a dwarf was complaining<br/>
about me being in the group as a exp. stealer when I shocked of lighting<br/>
once too often and  the monster left the party 100 yards back in preference<br/>
for me. :)  shut him up quick *chuckle*)<br/>
<br/>
Next I have discovered the POWER of the druids...  What I&#39;m about to relate<br/>
to you was fully observed and discussed with a druid in my clan...  She at<br/>
14th level gets a spell called conflageration(sp)  it does 65 points of<br/>
damage for 35 mana. 1.86 dam per mana.  I do at level 13, 79 points of<br/>
damage for 60 mana. 1.32 dam per mana.  We casted the spells at close to the<br/>
same rate... we timed 5 of mine to 4 of hers.  How can we claim to be the<br/>
masters of anything after this little show of power? btw at the end of the<br/>
test she did 260 hps dam for 140 mana and I did 395 hps dam for 240 mana.<br/>
Fruther I would like you to realize that when I get to level 14 i&#39;ll do 1<br/>
more hps dam in a slightly shorter period of time.  Not bad but nothing like<br/>
i would expect from the masters of damage that I expected and still do<br/>
expect the wizard to be.  (she pulled a monster off of me with her spells<br/>
once and another time she pulled the monster on herself after a set of<br/>
spells [it saved vs 2 of mine I had cast doing only 36 and 39 respectivly])<br/>
(these were wolly calfs, and orc Mounteneers/shamans)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Next, Wizards are AWSOME at learning skills.  We all choose some of the<br/>
highest int scores we can get so that we have the most mana, but this also<br/>
gives us the fastest skill increase rates of anyone.  I get all my skills<br/>
maxed out after about 15 to 20 attempts of the skill (5 points) at a 142<br/>
int.  Now this is great!  But what value does it hold for us?  So we max our<br/>
skills before we get half a buble of exp into our next one?  This reminds me<br/>
of the &#39;we do the most damage&#39; thing but if we try to &#39;do the most damage&#39;<br/>
we are monster enemy number 1!(well before the monster is dead I might add)<br/>
<br/>
Ah yes the one good trend I&#39;m seeing, Level 12 brought new found respect.  I<br/>
can find a group fast now... very fast(some may be that I joined/started a<br/>
Guild).  I think the fact that I stand a mile away and draw in the monster<br/>
has a demoralizing effect on our tanks and makes them understand that we are<br/>
now dealing more damage than they can.  At least it is a love hate<br/>
relationship, they hate us because they love what we can do.<br/>
<br/>
oh well I&#39;ll report more after I hit 16th+ :)<br/>
