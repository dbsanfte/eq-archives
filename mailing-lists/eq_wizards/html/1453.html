<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737580716">I tend to agree with this.  10 seconds really isn&#39;t that much (enough for 1<br/>
casting at least, but depending on distance away and which spell you cast<br/>
may not be enough for 2).  If this was too much then they could have it that<br/>
we only get the guaranteed 10 seconds on mobs that are the same level or<br/>
below.  If we try to root a yellow or red the 10 second guarantee is not<br/>
valid.<br/>
 <br/>
My main gripes (I don&#39;t have many) are that like Alhassim stated, our<br/>
utility spells really arent very useful.  I can think of maybe 2 times that<br/>
shadowstep has saved my life (out of the 15 times I have tried it when in<br/>
big trouble), and not once has fade helped at all (and believe me I tried).<br/>
If they want to make fade completely useless, at least allow shadowstep to<br/>
help us by giving it a minimum distance of teleport (at least enough to<br/>
where we can start running rather than just end up behind the monster and<br/>
get hit immediately).  If we are supposedly the masters of teleport spells<br/>
then why the heck is shadowstep and fade so random?  Ok maybe these lower<br/>
circle spells should be a little random as we are low level and maybe not<br/>
very good at wizardry yet, but how about having a 4th or 5th circle spell<br/>
upgrade from shadowstep to a spell that will reliably teleport us a decent<br/>
distance in a fairly straight line in the direction we are facing?  Look at<br/>
it this way by level 20 we have the knowledge to teleport our WHOLE group to<br/>
a distant location, yet we still cant teleport ourselves a mere 100 yards<br/>
with any reliability?  The fade --&gt; shadowstep series needs another --&gt; ???.<br/>
Hopefully Verant has been smart enough to include a researchable spell that<br/>
does this, but I won&#39;t hold my breath (sorry I am getting a bit cynical<br/>
here).<br/>

Well I think we all realize that Verant seems to have done a pretty good job<br/>
balancing the classes.  It is also evident that they have slanted the whole<br/>
game towards grouping...which makes perfect sense.  It is an online, social<br/>
game.  If all one wants to do is solo, go play another game, like Might and<br/>
Magic or a similar game.  Fine, no problem, everyone understands that.<br/>
 <br/>
My point, and one which someone has no doubt made before is, that you cant<br/>
always go on at the same time as your regular group of close friends, or you<br/>
cant always find a &quot;good&quot; bunch of people to spontaneously group with.<br/>
Therefore, there SHOULD be some kind of provision for ALL classes to be able<br/>
to solo fairly effectively.  What I am not saying is Verant make Wizards<br/>
powerhouses, just revamp the &quot;utility&quot; spells that are supposed to be<br/>
helpful, but which arent.<br/>
 <br/>
Take, for instance, the Root spell (again).  Having a set minimum time limit<br/>
to it, even for 10 seconds, doesnt really greatly enhance its effectiveness<br/>
for grouping, but makes a HUGE difference for soloing.  In a group, if you<br/>
ever cast it at all (and what would be the point, assuming you have some<br/>
warriors) it would be a waste of mana because the warriors are there to take<br/>
punishment and taunt the mob to keep it off of spellcasters.  If the mob<br/>
runs, sure cast Root (or just blast and finish it for a more spectacular<br/>
finish ;-), if you have mana left, and the warriors finish it anyway, which<br/>
will be in way under 10 seconds, guaranteed.  While soloing, if my Root only<br/>
lasts for 1 sec, why did I even bother casting it at all.  Didnt help me and<br/>
I could have used the mana to blast it for a free shot at first or to get a<br/>
head start running.<br/>
 <br/>
Just seems to me that Root, Fade and Shadowstep are ALMOST insultingly<br/>
useless spells because of lazy programming.  Seems like they got away with<br/>
generating some random numbers for spells and are happy that no one is<br/>
complaining that much.<br/>

P.S.  (And I dont care about the creatures willpower or magic resistance,<br/>
who says Root isnt an impenetrable dome of force that traps it physically<br/>
rather than mentally.)</div>
