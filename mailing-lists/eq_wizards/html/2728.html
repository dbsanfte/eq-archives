<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366154339">According to Joe Wallace:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Did they just post what was going to be changed without actually changing it?  I noticed that they decided to make the invisibility spell icon blink before it wears off, a change I am quite happy about.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t work.  At least, not for me.  Did they patch this or not?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Didn&#39;t for me either. I would have liked that. Died again in Blackburrow<br/>

Elite, which promptly enlisted two passing Gnoll Guardsmen into dispatching<br/>
that pesky half-elf...<br/>
