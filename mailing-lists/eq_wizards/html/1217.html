<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428629473">Piercing is the way to go.  I am an advocate of it because of the Pugius, the <br/>
fanged skull stilleto, and the certain skull that was talked about so many <br/>
times prior.  With a Pugius right now at lvl 13, and the skull, life is much <br/>
easier.  Plus 20 mana is better than the runed staff can provide, and the <br/>
Pugius attacks much, much quicker.  I am still looking for a fanged skull <br/>
stilleto (anyone know where to get them), but once I have found one, life <br/>
will be much easier.<br/>
