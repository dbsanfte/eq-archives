just wondering, what&#39;s your INT? cause i don&#39;t rember having as many<br/>

 </span></blockquote>at your level shadowstep and then gate is a great escape method...i&#39;ve<br/>
found that when you hit the really high teens though that everythign moves<br/>
really fast and shadow step doesn&#39;t help as much anymore...of course by<br/>
then the mana you spend for root is trivial, so root and gate become a<br/>
decently effective strat...<br/>
