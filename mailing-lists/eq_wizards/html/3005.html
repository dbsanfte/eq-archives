<div id="ygrps-yiv-945246234">Actualy if you visit a magic board on vault you will see that many 50 lv<br/>
wizards say that items and resistance are two things wich create most<br/>
problems with balance of clases. I have writen many articles about wizards<br/>
are nice class also and how to play and diferent tactics wich i use, this<br/>
maybe are not best or errorfree but are at last something wich people wich<br/>
start to get in problems can use. I cant talk about problems wich other<br/>
classes have as there are many worst classes then wizard but i try to get<br/>
attention to some problems wich  i know best and wizard i play realy muchso<br/>
i know its problem more. I have been playing wizard from a beta and i know<br/>
a bit about mechanic under a game also. Im sorry that my poor english many<br/>
times require that my articles you have to read with attention as first<br/>
look it is not exactly what i wished to say.<br/>
<br/>
Wizard dont suck as you say but they need some attention as they was very<br/>
god balanced class at start but as others get powered up and fine tuned<br/>
also wizard class need to get some changes.<br/>
<br/>
First i will like for all clases to have less meditation  time and healing<br/>
time as it is something wrong that i have to stay looking in same book 50%<br/>
of the game for me it is not funny and i dont think it is my time spent well !<br/>
<br/>
Second every class have its strong and low levels ... wizards are low at<br/>
start (what is expected) and at end (what is not expected) but are strong<br/>
at middle lv. I wish to get lo high lv and be able to participate at dragon<br/>
hunt if you read some posts of 50 lv guys WIZARD cant do it now and this is<br/>
a BIG problem for me. Wich can be maybe resolved with items wich lower<br/>
resistence so we return to my first post.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After i played 5 classes until lv 10 - 27 i have some experience to say and<br/>
point to problems wich i have seen.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Dear Vincent,<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; I realy only can see that you are in bad mode maybe you can think a bit<br/>
&gt;&gt; before replying, and if you dont have to say anything useful take a break.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Only useful was that you say about your warrior at 3 lv but other things<br/>
&gt;&gt; are realy dont help any discusion and your tone is realy arogant.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Actually, I found Vincent&#39;s article to be interesting. He sure had a lot<br/>
&gt;more insight and understanding of the game than you. All you ever post<br/>
&gt;is how Wizards suck compared to other classes, and use out of whack<br/>
&gt;examples (like the warrior hitting for 70). Sure, some complaints are<br/>
&gt;justified, but you make it a regularity to reiterate the same things<br/>
&gt;over and over at set intervals.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I wouldn&#39;t be going this hard on you would you have not attacked Vincent<br/>
&gt;for no apparent reason. But I do mean what I say. To use your own words,<br/>
&gt;Vincent&#39;s post was a lot more &quot;useful&quot; than yours.<br/>
