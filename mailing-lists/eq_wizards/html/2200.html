<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226898616">Well, I&#39;m finally going to break down and seriously play a spellcasting<br/>
class.  Of course due to the raw power of the class, as well as the<br/>
versatility of teleportation, Wizards are my first choice.  I realize that<br/>
people have most likely time and again requested spell lists, but here I am,<br/>
brand spanking new to the list.  I was wondering if perhaps some nice soul<br/>
out there might be able to send me a complete list.  I&#39;ve checked EQLizer,<br/>
EQVault, and EQstratics and none of them have every spell, thanks in advance<br/>
everyone.</div>
