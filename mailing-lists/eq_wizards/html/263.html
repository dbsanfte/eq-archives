<div id="ygrps-yiv-80700479"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; ok guys so as i say it in a previous message i always tell<br/>
&gt; when i am wrong<br/>
&gt; :). And i was wrong :))). You can hit a rooted monster,<br/>
&gt; move and he is still<br/>
&gt; rooted :). So i apologize :) But it seemns that this<br/>
&gt; djfjdfkdj queen quiclik<br/>
&gt; just stay 5 sec rooted no more (tried three times this<br/>
&gt; night hehe).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That probably is directly related to magic resistance.  Yes, there is<br/>
magic resistance in this game, it just seems to be a stat instead of a<br/>
skill (i.e. it doesn&#39;t improve except with magic items and buffs).<br/>
I think monsters get a chance every round to resist a spell.  I&#39;ve<br/>
seen the same monster stay rooted for 3 seconds and for 2 minutes.  So<br/>
my guess is: every round, they get a chance to resist.  If it&#39;s<br/>
successful, they&#39;re set free and come for you.  If it isn&#39;t, they stay<br/>
put.<br/>
