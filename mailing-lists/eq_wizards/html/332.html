<div id="ygrps-yiv-108314392">I have a DE Necro friend, no matter what i do, he can always do it better, he can solo monsters that /con yellow w/o his pet because of the vampiric touch type spells, and he can take on even more WITH his pet! i can&#39;t even catch up with exp anymore! is there ever going to be a point when i can just kick ass? <br/>
<br/>
P.S. whens the next root spell come along? level 12?</div>
