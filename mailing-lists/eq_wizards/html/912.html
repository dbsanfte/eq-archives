<div id="ygrps-yiv-303885621">I know that as a darkelf or Higelf you start with elder elvish.<br/>
If you sit by them, I dont think you would learn any thing. But maybe if you<br/>
hailed them in Old erudin they would answer you in old erudin and you would<br/>
learn :)  ( this Im not sure off)<br/>
<br/>
And why would it not be fair to the other in the group, ill be happy to<br/>
learn the language. :)<br/>

&gt;Please tell me if there is truth to this:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I want to improve my Old Euridan language skill.  I plan on traveling to<br/>
&gt;Euridan and hanging out with the NPC&#39;s there in the wizards guild.  I plan<br/>
&gt;on sitting down next to some of them.  Should this improve my skill?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I noticed I have Elder Elvish as a skill now (maybe because I used to hang<br/>
&gt;out in my hometown of Felwithe allot and just picked it up)  I do not want<br/>
&gt;to spend another training point in Old Euridan or any language for that<br/>
&gt;fact.  I also do not want to have someone SPAM to me anymore unless I pay<br/>
&gt;them to SPAM me ...and me alone (not fair to others in my group).<br/>
