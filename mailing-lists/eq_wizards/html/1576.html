<b>Subject:</b> Re: Advice up to 14th level (long) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918347094">I am at 14th now so I can&#39;t really comment on what is beyond.  I will try to<br/>
give some good advice for getting to where I am and for doing well once you<br/>
get here.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I strongly recommend is travel.  I started in Felwithe (being a<br/>
high elf) and faught around there up to 5th level or so, then I moved on to<br/>
the orcs of crushbone for a couple levels (up to about 8th I think).  At<br/>
that time I went to Butcherblock where I found lots of good stuff to hunt<br/>
including goblins, scarabs, drakes, and undead skeletons (at the<br/>
chessboard).  Most or all of this time (levels 6 through 10) I was in a<br/>
small group of 2 to 4 people.  At this point I felt ready to travel a bit<br/>
and went to the continent of antonica.<br/>
<br/>
There I started fighting in the North desert of Ro (again in a group) for<br/>
good money and xp.  We could fight desert scarabs, tarantulas, madmen, and<br/>
dervishes.  I leveled up till 12th or 13th level here when I decided to head<br/>
west.  I went from Freeport all the way to Qeynos on the west side of<br/>
Antonica and then across to Erudin on the western island of Odus.  While<br/>
travelling I stopped in as many places as I could find.  I went to the<br/>
dungeons of Befallen (off west commons), Splitpaw (off of S. Karana), and<br/>
Blackburrow (off Qeynos hills) and did as much adventuring as possible in<br/>
each.<br/>
<br/>
The key to travelling is 12th level I feel, because at that point you can<br/>
bind yourself along your journey.  The point of travelling is to get a feel<br/>
for the lands.  I discovered lots of new zones and areas to fight (and earn<br/>
money) that I would not have had a knowledge of unless I travelled (and<br/>
reading spoiler sites barely scratches the surface of what you will find in<br/>
areas, trust me).<br/>
<br/>
I leveled up to 14th in blackburrow and then went with a newly met friend<br/>
back east to the beholder maze.  This area is really cool yet dangerous.  I<br/>
will go back there around 16th level when I can fight more effectively<br/>
against the higher level beasts there.<br/>
<br/>
Now still at level 14 (close to 15th) I made my way back to freeport and am<br/>
currently fighting caimans in oasis (solo for the first time in a while) and<br/>
am doing really well.  I had tried soloing these caimans at level 12 and 13<br/>
and I just barely couldnt do it.  But now at level 14 I can root (which is<br/>
holding surprisingly well) and have enough mana to kill a caiman (which con<br/>
blue by the way) and still have about 20% mana left when done.  One time I<br/>
encountered a pretty nasty one that seemed to have high resistance against<br/>
my spells (did 2 damage and 4 damage instead of 80).  I had to get a little<br/>
help to finish this one off, but that was the only one I really had a<br/>
problem with.  Soloing caimans and resting I can earn about a bubble of xp<br/>
per hour (not much loot but good xp) which is pretty good I feel.<br/>
<br/>
So If you are wondering why you cant solo very well at level 8 or 9 or 10,<br/>
its because we just cant.  Root is way too unreliable usually, and we just<br/>
dont have the mana to cast it 2 or 3 times that might be needed to get a<br/>
good hold.  We dont have enough hp to take the damage while getting root<br/>
off, and we dont have enough mana left to kill the beast after rooting.<br/>
Trust me by about level 14th this will all get better.  I can now solo very<br/>
effectively I feel and will probably level up to 16th very quickly and by<br/>
myself.  After grouping from levels 5 to 14, I am ready for a little solo<br/>
play.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this has been really long, but the basic fact is that you have to<br/>
play in a group most of the time.  Travel a lot and you will find areas that<br/>
are solo viable and new ways to make good money.  Through my travels I didnt<br/>
earn much xp but put about 40 plat in the bank in just a few days of play<br/>
(not bad for level 13).  Find a good group and enjoy group play, but know<br/>
that you will be able to solo if you take the time to explore new areas.<br/>
