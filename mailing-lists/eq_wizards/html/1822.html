&gt;All I have been hearing from a lot of people are whines about the wizard<br/>
&gt;class.  Well I am a 24th level Wizard who has been solo-ing since lvl 16.<br/>

&gt;Well granted that was the case sometimes, but I Learned to adapt to the<br/>
&gt;environment I fought in.  Like fighting YK&#39;s in West Commonlands, which<br/>

&gt;Caimans, crocks, and Deep Water crocks and Caimans.  Know your limits<br/>
&gt;people, our class was not meant to jump into a fight and melee the monster,<br/>
&gt;we were meant to stand back and blast them out of existence.  If you have<br/>
&gt;not seen on any of the messages before our melee skills are only (lvl +1) *<br/>
&gt;3 which is quite low for any class.  Maybe this should be a hint to you as<br/>
&gt;not to try and jump into a fight.  If you are in a group that is fighting<br/>
&gt;RED mobs and your spells are being resisted then I say you shouldn&#39;t be in<br/>
&gt;that group to begin with.  Those mobs are 5+ levels above you and your<br/>
&gt;skills as a WIZARD can not help.  Go back to that spot after a few more<br/>
&gt;levels and try again, don&#39;t whine that you couldn&#39;t do anything to help.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have my share of deaths, and until I found Lake Rathe at Level 19 I was<br/>
&gt;getting waxed by Sand Giants in Oasis of Marr because people were training<br/>
&gt;them left and right down the beach for fun.  At Level 24 I am still<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;mob resists 3 of my spells which leave me with no mana and about 1/4 of his<br/>
&gt;health.  Sure I would love to be able to jump in there and melee it.  And<br/>
&gt;for those times I have to I use O&#39;Kiels Radiation which gives me a little<br/>
&gt;extra punch to the mob.  I rarely fight White or Yellow mobs unless I am<br/>
&gt;grouped.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Whining that Veriant did us wrong or that we are weak is not the correct<br/>
&gt;thing to do.  The best thing I see is make the best of wheat we have and<br/>
&gt;that is our power and knowledge of how to use it wisely, not foolishly.<br/>
