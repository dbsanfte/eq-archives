<div id="ygrps-yiv-2093846730">Dear Brothers and Sisters,<br/>
<br/>
After reading all the petitions, suggestions and well thought improvements to our classes I got but one thing to say, dream on :)<br/>
<br/>
Verant thinks we are overpowered, and quite frankly at higher levels we are devastating.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m currently level 31 and *I* can solo very well, so do NOT lose that will, we DO get better and the level is called TWENTY NINE (29).<br/>
<br/>
Would like to coment on a few things.<br/>
<br/>
1) Groups, we can&#39;t hit red.  After level 29 or so you wont get close to reds, not even in a full party. :) So, its only a low mid level thing. <br/>
<br/>
2) Root/Enstill.  Remember when you got root at level 4 and it was horrible ? Remember how it got better at level 8 ? Same thing with Enstill, at 26+ it gets MUCH better.  Sure, you would recast in battle, but it works great.<br/>
<br/>
3) SoW, Speed Spells.  At level 24 or so you don&#39;t need this, you can teleport pretty much everywhere except planes.  If you need to run, just keep rooting and flee or just buy yourself SoW for a plat or so, dont ask, OFFER the plat.<br/>
<br/>
4) Petitions to Verant, utility spells ? Perhaps, anything that will make us better in combat, forget it.  We are already devastating.<br/>
<br/>
5) And Most Important.  Level 20-23 SUCKS !!!<br/>
<br/>
I can ALMOST solo yellow Giants, HANG IN THERE !<br/>
<br/>
Good luck my friends.</div>
