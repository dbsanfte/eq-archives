<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166841335">There *should* be plenty of diversity in our spell effects to keep us happy<br/>
except for the fact that Verant blows chunks when it comes to different<br/>
graphics for spells.  Up through level 20 our spell effects go like this:<br/>
<br/>
Rank 1 (Achieved at level 1)<br/>
Frost Bolt     - shock of frost animation + frost bolt<br/>
Shock of Frost - (2) shock of frost animation<br/>
Numbing Cold   - VERY cool animation - AE cold animation<br/>
<br/>
Rank 2 (Achieved at Level 4)<br/>
Shock of Fire  - shock of fire animation<br/>
Icestrike      - rain animation<br/>
<br/>
Rank 3 (Achieved at Level 8)<br/>
Fingers of Fire - fire spreading animation<br/>
Column of Frost - NO ANIMATION<br/>
Fire Bolt       - (2) shock of fire animation + fire bolt<br/>
Shock of Ice    - (3) shock of frost animation<br/>
<br/>
Rank 4 (Achieved at Level 12)<br/>
Firestorm       - (2) rain animation<br/>
Frost Spiral    - (2) NO ANIMATION<br/>
Shock of Lightn - shock of lightning animation<br/>
<br/>
Rank 5 (Achieved at Level 16)<br/>
Lightning Bolt  - (3) shock of fire animation + fire bolt<br/>
Flame Shock     - (4) shock of fire animation<br/>
Project Lightn  - ???<br/>
Pillar of Fire  - ???<br/>
<br/>
Rank 6 (Achieved at Level 20)<br/>
Force Shock     - (2) shock of lightning animation<br/>
Fire Spiral     - ???<br/>
<br/>
These are just the spells up to level 20.  Some spells have no animations<br/>
over the enemy, you just cast and then see the damage messages with NO<br/>
animation over the enemy at all.  And what about our lightning spells<br/>
looking exactly like the cleric (strike, furor, smite) spells?  And what<br/>
about our lightning bolt spell looking like Fire bolt???  This makes it get<br/>
boring.  Why are we playing a graphical RPG in the first place?  Umm.. for<br/>
the graphics maybe?!  This is just insane maybe if we had a little more<br/>
variety in what we see in the world we wouldnt need to feel unique in other<br/>
ways.<br/>

I see where your coming from on making a wizard &quot;different&quot;.  Wizards are<br/>
99% <br/>
direct damage.  It does get boring after awhile, med. nuke nuke, med. repeat<br/>
<br/>
as necessary. <br/>
While a necromancer has a pet, mage gets a pet, enchanter gets a ton of <br/>
spells and each class can use some direct damage.  Shamans and druids...<br/>
well <br/>
they are just great and have a ton of diversity.  However we are wizards and<br/>
<br/>
the exact opposite of warriors.  Warriors do nothing but bash in close<br/>
combat <br/>
and they are damn good at it.  Wizards do nothing but destroy with magic and<br/>
<br/>
they are damn good at that.  We are the only class that can teleport to<br/>
other <br/>
planes &quot;although secret entrances do exist for the people that don&#39;t want to<br/>
<br/>
find a wizard&quot;.  Our travel spells are very nice as are our area affect <br/>
spells at high levels with a party.  You pay a price with power and that <br/>
price is a lack of diversity I think.  Truely no one can come close to the <br/>
damage a wizard can do in less then 5 seconds.  Truely a sight to see when a<br/>
<br/>
20th leve MOB is beating on your level 8 party and you can&#39;t hit it, then a <br/>
36th level wizard walks by we yelled for help, he casts one spell and the<br/>
MOB <br/>
dies like that.  <br/>
<br/>
Diversity Suggestions..<br/>
Wizard Only Special Robes and more graphics for them.  I must say the ones <br/>
they have now are great, but more couldn&#39;t help.  Again more quests and fix <br/>
the broken ones, this is everquest after all.<br/>
<br/>
I for one belive in the power of the wizard and I do know that brad and <br/>
verant have absolutely no intent of changing them.  I quote &quot;Wizards are by <br/>
far the most balanced casting class and to change anything to them now would<br/>
<br/>
destroy 1 years worth of game balancing&quot;.  <br/>
