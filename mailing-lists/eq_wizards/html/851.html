<b>Subject:</b> Runed Totem Staff and Skull of Jhen &#39;Tra  **SPOILER** <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1040514805">Ladies and gentleman,<br/>
<br/>
I recently acquired a Runed Totem Staff and a skull and tried to combine<br/>
them by placing said skull on my picture while I held the staff.  Didn&#39;t<br/>
work.  I then tried a huge number of other cominations with no luck.  When i<br/>
bought this skull from a friend he billed it as the skull of Vier Dal.  Like<br/>
an idiot, i didn&#39;t check it out.  It turns out its the Skull of Jhen &#39;Tra.<br/>
Stats are mana +20, SV magic +3, Wt. 2.5, Race and Class: All.  When I<br/>
queried my friend he said the skull came from the same gnoll as the Skull of<br/>
Vier Dal and it should still work.  The stats appear to be very similar.<br/>
<br/>
3 questions:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Has anyone seen the Skull of Jhen &#39;Tra and know how to utilize it?<br/>
<br/>
2. Will this skull attach to the Runed Totem Staff?<br/>
<br/>
3.  How do you attach this skull or the skull of Vier Dal to the staff?  Has<br/>
anyone succesfully dropped it on their picture, or is this just hearsay?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance for your help,<br/>
