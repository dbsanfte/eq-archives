<b>Subject:</b> Re: IMPORTANT INFO FOR LVL 20 AND HIGHER (Resistance undone) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1704912908">This could be very well the most important information you will ever<br/>
here, it will also bring back to man soloing, which for me has relented<br/>
wonderful exp.<br/>
<br/>
One miseable day in unrest upon reaching 21rst lvl, i grouped with a<br/>
party reletive to my lvl and we decided to fight red things, which<br/>
means i would probably be useless in casting, but we were brave and<br/>
tried anyways. I ended up being resisted 100% of the time.<br/>
<br/>
How many of you really hate that you cant help your friends when this<br/>
happens.... Worry no longer, after a long and miserable complaint to<br/>
the gms, i was finally reviled why to why this was happeneing... You<br/>
see, at higher lvls ,Gm said your spells are extremly valuable to a<br/>
party because they way lay final blow to creature.. this means wait<br/>
till the thing is hurt in a tanking party... but he said for soloing<br/>
you will have no other choice but to enlist the aid of a enchanter... I<br/>
responded, you need a enchanter to kill blues?, he said not so much for<br/>
blues(although i beg to differ) but he said in the big bright yellow<br/>
that at lower lvls we loved to kill for exp in two man teams. I<br/>
responded to this , &quot;But why a enchanter?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
WEll folks one simply anwser, which being in mage class, i was extremly<br/>
embarressed i had not though of it. A enchanter, you see, posses not<br/>
str but, magical influence, ie, they can cast weaken magic reistance<br/>
spells on creatures......Are you getting the picture.. so i was<br/>
extremely intrested in putting this to work. So i quickly( not really)<br/>
looked up the aid of a 21rst lvl enchanter.. however i could not find<br/>
one... If any of you have a chance to confirm or deny this method,<br/>
please repost this message as i will do so also.<br/>
<br/>
So Enchanter cast weaken resistance, or whatever spell they may have to<br/>
do this, Wizards then go to work casting root, blast happy with no<br/>
resistance, or at least i hope a much higher success rate.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting, Elmara of Povar<br/>
