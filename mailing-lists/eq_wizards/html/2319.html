<div id="ygrps-yiv-311497638">I have experienced many of the things you have in  the game also.  I am<br/>
current a level 14 wizard and I am slowly learning to conserve my manna<br/>
and to keep the monsters off me while grouped.  What i do is generally<br/>
stand just in range of the monster and hit it hard.  Then I fade back<br/>
and let the tanks take it.  After the have the mob securely contained, I<br/>
watch the fight as it progresses.  If it&#39;s going easily for the tanks, i<br/>
may not even cast again.  If the going is tough, I will take the minster<br/>
down as fast as I can.  If we are fighting more than one, I try to<br/>
monitor the health of all the involved monsters and take down the<br/>
weakest first.  A weak monster ca still hurt someone  nearly as well as<br/>
a strong one.  Once it&#39;s gone, I check for the next weakest or the one<br/>
that&#39;s hurting us the most. and flame it next.  With any luck, we all<br/>
live the mob dies and I still have a couple of bubbles of manna left and<br/>
no loss of hit points.   Of course sometimes I mess up and hit something<br/>
too hard and they start trashing me but usually a good group can pull<br/>
and taunt the mob off of me.  If not there&#39;s always shadow step and then<br/>
root.<br/>
