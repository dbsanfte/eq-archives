<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-309889601">I&#39;m writing because i found out something about a tournament on the Povar <br/>
server.  For those that read EQ vault you know about this.  I say all wizards <br/>
boycott this tournament because the root spell is not allowed in it.  It is <br/>
obviously run by a melee type character.  I&#39;m not on this server but i would <br/>
hate to see a wizard get slaughtered because they can&#39;t root.  So if you want <br/>
send this message to everyone on povar server!!  <br/>
