<div id="ygrps-yiv-570553933">Atrus, don&#39;t let it stress you out too much that others have leveled faster than <br/>
you for whatever reason.  I&#39;ve always had at least 2 characters in whichever <br/>
online RPG I ventured to.  My rpg roots are in Neverwinter Nights.  I have <br/>
characters in 2 guilds and those 2 characters have followed me to each game <br/>
I&#39;ve gone to after the cataclysm destroyed that world.  Therefore I almost <br/>
always level slower than others around me because I try to devote equal time to <br/>
the two guilds.  I look for others around my level and can almost always find <br/>
someone to hunt with.  Take heart...there are others out there like you.  <br/>
