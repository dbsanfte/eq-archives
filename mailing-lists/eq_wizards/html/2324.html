<div id="ygrps-yiv-140280350">I hesistate to say it but from what I&#39;ve been told you better check again<br/>
with your Druid friend or maybe you should ask another druid..... The power<br/>
spell for Druids at lvl 14 is stinging swarm which is a DOT spell.... The<br/>
class that is close to outdamaging us at this level is Enchanters and<br/>
definitely not Druids.... Yup I&#39;m just gonna suggest you find another Druid<br/>
to talk to instead of your &quot;Guildmate&quot;. I run with alot of Druids in the<br/>
game. Let us know what you find out when you talk to someone else.... :o)<br/>
<br/>
Oh and what was the animation that this &quot;Conflaguration&quot; used while you guys<br/>
were standing there testing it out?<br/>
