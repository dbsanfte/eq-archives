<div id="ygrps-yiv-126480041">Ok, Ken and others out there. I am a level 19 wizard on the Xegony<br/>
server. I have found that it is nigh impossible for me to solo more than<br/>
one blue creature. I did solo blue orcs from lvl 16 to 19 and found that<br/>
I would be out of mana at the end of the battle with just ONE! At 19 I<br/>
would sometimes end up with 2 bubbles left still not enough to get<br/>
another with root.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I am asking WHEN it becomes possible to do the 2-3 you<br/>
mentioned. I must point out that it MAY be possible at 19 to do two<br/>
orcs, but they are blue/green border so the LOWEST of the LOWEST blue. I<br/>
also can not solo a yellow orc ( or any yellow I&#39;ve tried ) as my root<br/>
never lasts long enough for me to do more than 1 blast. Maybe I&#39;m doing<br/>
the wrong creatures, but I think my root-and-shoot strategy is the only<br/>
one out there.<br/>
<br/>
I am excited about 20, and have enjoyed my wizard so far. But, being a<br/>
human ( in RL) I can&#39;t help feeling spell-envy looking at other classes<br/>
being able to solo yellows or more than one blue. It seems that the<br/>
*bar* keeps getting raised at where people say: at THIS level you will<br/>
shine. At first it was 12, then 16, then 20, now it&#39;s up in the 30&#39;s!<br/>
Well who has been there, who can confirm or deny our delusions of future<br/>
grandeur? And to those in the 20&#39;s, what can you solo and where?<br/>
<br/>
As far as being in a group, many many people appreciate my help as a<br/>
wizard. I also have seen many people asking for magic user help. I guess<br/>
they are starting to learn that all the mages are good for something!<br/>
Unfortunately, I often see them telling me to &quot;BLAST&quot; &quot;BLAST&quot; in the<br/>
midst of battle when my better judgement tells me that I will get mobbed<br/>
if I do so quick. My response of course, &quot;Dark Elf is about to die.&quot;<br/>

&gt; My friend, I invite you to bring a 22nd lvl Necro out to the Cauldron, take<br/>
&gt; on a yellow Tidal Lord and then tell me he doesn&#39;t have to med.  You are<br/>
&gt; very much mistaken if you think he doesn&#39;t and I almost guarantee he will<br/>
&gt; lose his pet in the process.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The enchanter&#39;s have some nice buffs, this is true, but against mutiple<br/>
&gt; enemies, I will take a Cleric and a Wizard every time.  Our AE spells are<br/>
&gt; unmatched by any and the Enchanter can&#39;t touch a Cleric when it comes to<br/>
&gt; buff spells.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Again, I disagree, I have never had to sit longer than a mage or necro of<br/>
&gt; the same lvl in our group.  Never.  Its all on how you play your character.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Once again, a Mage can take out 2-3 blues just like us, but will lose his<br/>
&gt; pet and will be out of mana.  Guaranteed.  I know, I&#39;ve played a Mage up to<br/>
&gt; lvl 17.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just my thoughts on this.  Again, eveyone is entitled to their own opinions<br/>
&gt; and I&#39;m not putting you down for stating yours, but in my belief,  you are<br/>
&gt; mistaken.<br/>
