<b>Subject:</b> MANA RING QUESTION . . . <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336130942">OK I was told that the mana ring was +5 mana and it helps you regenerate your mana FASTER while meditating . ..   so this guy wanted 10PP for it and I was like grrrrrrr OK cus I thought &quot;hey! +5 mana AND faster regen!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
but I just read a post that said that it DOESN&#39;T help regen . .  pls say it ain&#39;t so.   Any info on mana items would be most appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
