<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487344587">I have seen this since the first time I cast gate.... It seems to happen<br/>
more when I&#39;m near a wall or a player....  Just my probably random<br/>
observation.....<br/>

&gt; &quot;Your gate is unstable and closes&quot;  I&#39;ve gotten this message a couple of<br/>
&gt; times now (since the last patch) Has anybody else gotten this?  Has it<br/>
&gt; been that way since day one, and I&#39;ve just been lucky until now?<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s happened 3 or 4 times to me so far.  Once when it was a life or<br/>
&gt; death situation.  I died and it really pissed me off.   I did a shadow<br/>
&gt; step then a gate.  The gate went through the complete casting time, used<br/>
&gt; 100 mana, did the graphics, and then came up with that message.<br/>
