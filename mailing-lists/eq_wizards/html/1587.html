<div id="ygrps-yiv-460990497">Ah come on, don&#39;t go.  I think you have a lot of good ideas and I agree there are things that need to be fixed in our class as well as the many others in the game.  I haven&#39;t had any stellar ideas strike me or I would be suggesting different types of spells as well... brain freeze...it no worky right now :)<br/>

    Okay, this is Alhassim signing off...<br/>
     <br/>
    After reading the last couple of subtle brush off posts regarding &quot;lets work with what we have ..etc&quot;  I will no longer be posting to this list. (And the villagers rejoice..)<br/>
     <br/>
    I still find it unbelievable at how complacent you &quot;seekers of knowledge&quot; are and at how many of the repetitive posts on this list concern &quot;where can I find this spell or item&quot; when the reader could just go back and read the archive to find his/her answer.<br/>
     <br/>
    Anyway, my hats off to the people who suggested the Teleport Others/Tap Affinity type spells, that was the only thing I read that was worthwhile on this list.<br/>
     <br/>
    Bye</div>
