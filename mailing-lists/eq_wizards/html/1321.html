<div id="ygrps-yiv-106245666">So, the max damage that you can do will be 1050dmg assuming no fizzles, interupts, and no resistance..Im not sure what a warriors HP is like at that level, as I have never played one myself (anybody help here?) but I could see you being In a lot of trouble when dueling one..if you get a root of and manage to take him down from afar with remaining mana all well and good but wizards are a very feeble class one on one when it comes to fighting face to face, you end up exhausting your mana trying to get a quick root in and then backing off to cast dmg spells again..<br/>

As a 22nd lvl wizard, I most definitely have to disagree with you.  Wizards<br/>
can make all the difference on whether your group survives or not.  I can do<br/>
175 dmg with one cast.  I can cast this spell 6 times.  Believe me, fights<br/>
go a lot faster and safer with a wizard that can deal out that much dmg.<br/>
And, when you get 2 wizards in a group, well you can imagine the devastation<br/>
that can happen.<br/>
<br/>
Lets not forget our group teleportation spells either.  Not to mention, we<br/>
are the ONLY class that can teleport a group to an alternate plane.<br/>
<br/>
So, your statement that &quot;parties can&#39;t be bothered with wizards&quot; is totally<br/>
inaccurate.  I have never had a problem finding a group to adventure with.<br/>
And, like Valacian stated, I would be more than happy to duel a barbarian<br/>
warrior with dual wield.<br/>

&gt; Well said Jay. Parties cant be bothered with wizards, they cant buff, cant<br/>
heal<br/>
&gt; and cant really help parties that much...&quot;we were supposed to be heavy<br/>
&gt; artillery&quot; but that just is not correct. I think a wizard would be most<br/>
parties<br/>
&gt; last choice if they could choose from all the classes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Its very easy to demonstrate the wizard immbalance; get into an arena with<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; dual wield barbarian warrior of the same level and see how you do!<br/>
&gt; Hmm doesn&#39;t sound too promising eh?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have always played a wizard character class in AD&D and UO but I regret<br/>
&gt; playing one in EQ. I think EQ were nervous about the power wizards in UO<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t want to unbalance the game. I think they swung the pendalum too far<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; other way. Root &#39;n&#39; Shoot, if that fails death, thats about it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hopefully e-mails will pour in and tell me how wrong I am. Great, show me<br/>
its<br/>
&gt; not the case so I feel I have a character with a future!<br/>
