<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-929364058">I have found that Verant recently patched the wizard(all I know, but im<br/>
sure all other casting classes) so that u must SEE your target, and it<br/>
cannot be very high above you<br/>
This got really annoying, its also a new thing, so its buggy, i was<br/>
trying to hit a cent above 2 feet in front of my guy in cb, by the<br/>
slaver cave with Rondo, well, there was a cent up there and i couldnt<br/>
cast, i think Verant is making the Wizard diminishingly useless to<br/>
groups, and this new sight-to-cast thing that wastes mana is CRAP in my<br/>
opinion :(<br/>
