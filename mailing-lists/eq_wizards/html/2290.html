<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535396275">At level 21, I was happily soloing blue aviak guards and even the occasional<br/>
blue conning dry bone skeleton in lake rathe.  I might have had to run about<br/>
50% of the time from the skeletons unless there was someone there to give me<br/>
a hand when i got in too deep, but I only had to run about 5% of the time<br/>
from the aviaks.  There are so many things to fight at this level it is<br/>
unreal.  The people that complain how they can&#39;t solo should either 1) find<br/>
a group or 2) explore a bit more.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I like to group.  After soloing from level 22 to 24 I was bored<br/>
out of my mind.  In a group downtime seems so less significant because you<br/>
have someone to chat with.  Also grouping affords much greater safety than<br/>
being alone.<br/>
