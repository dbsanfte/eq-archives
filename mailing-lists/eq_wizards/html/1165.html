<div id="ygrps-yiv-728935692">Greetings fellow members of the wizard&#39;s guild.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone tell me what slaver keys 22, 23, and 24 are for in Crushbone?<br/>
The other keys of course will free the slaves when given to the proper<br/>
slave. If you give each slave a copper they tell you which key they need to<br/>
be set free. As of yet none of the slaves have asked for key&#39;s 22 - 24.<br/>
Could there be a hidden area in CB possibly? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help on this.<br/>
