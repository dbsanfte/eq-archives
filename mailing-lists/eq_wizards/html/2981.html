<div id="ygrps-yiv-354774364">Well, I wouldn&#39;t recommend soloing a Sand Giant (or any giants) at level 35. <br/>
  There&#39;s far better things you can kill for experience that have half as <br/>
many hit points.  On a rare occasion, they do drop upwards of 40pp, but the <br/>
time that it takes to kill them and the high risk of death barely makes it <br/>
worthwhile.  If you just wanna show off to the lower levels in Oasis, try <br/>
going back once you&#39;re 39 (or better yet once you have Ice Comet), you&#39;ll <br/>
have a much better chance and you&#39;ll need all that extra mana.  Don&#39;t use <br/>
root while you are fighting, use Bonds of Force instead.  Also, keep a zone <br/>
line close cuz you might need it.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
