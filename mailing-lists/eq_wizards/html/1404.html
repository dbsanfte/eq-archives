<b>Subject:</b> off topic but VERYimportant- virus passing <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272761094">There is a person on the spell research list who has mailed out the <br/>
happy99.exe virus executable to people on the list this morning.  His <br/>
address is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:rkubin@...">rkubin@...</a><br/>
and his isp has been notified by myself and others I&#39;m very sure judging <br/>
from the response in the list.<br/>
Please be very cautious about opening anything up that you get as an exe <br/>
file from the mailing lists, there are malicious people out there <br/>
unfortunately.</div>
