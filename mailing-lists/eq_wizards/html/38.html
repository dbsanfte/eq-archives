<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765704488">Well I have first hand experience with Minotaur slavers doing the same<br/>
thing.  I used to Eye to check out the mines to see if they were safe and<br/>
the same thing happened.  2 seconds after they spotted the eye they came<br/>
right after me.  Now I can justify this with &quot;the eye alerted them to<br/>
intruders so they started patrolling&quot;  but they ran right by 3 or 4 other<br/>
people who were in the mines to get at me so this was no ordinary patrol<br/>
pattern.  Seems fishy to me.  Same type of thing has been happening with<br/>
invisibility, as long as I&#39;m invisible *before* the fight starts I&#39;m Ok, but<br/>
if the fight starts and I run away to a safe spot, go invisible, then go<br/>
back to check on the battle they zero in on me as if I was standing there in<br/>
plain sight.<br/>

&gt; I know that using Eye of Zomm to spy on ghouls in W. Kanara is not a good<br/>
&gt; idea.. I wanted to see ghouls up close when I was 8th level and the things<br/>
&gt; somehow traced the eye back to its source and I got an express trip home..<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t try this at home kiddies! Does anyone know if all monsters do this?<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am wondering if there are others with similar experiences<br/>
&gt; &gt; to my own when<br/>
&gt; &gt; using spells such as invisibility and the eye of zomm to name a few?<br/>
