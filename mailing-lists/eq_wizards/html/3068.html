&gt; Hmm i bit of a rant there but as you can see, if wizards where more sought after for groups &gt; then it would be much easier for all us wizards in Norrath.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t know, wizards are pretty much sought after where I come from. I<br/>
never have problems getting a group in Mistmoore, if there is a group<br/>
wit ha free spot. People do want wizards because they know that if the<br/>
situation gets bad, but not hopeless, a wizard can quickly turn the<br/>
tides, thus saving someone&#39;s life. And I&#39;m not talking about stopping a<br/>
higher level train here. I&#39;m talking bout a too big pull that the group<br/>
is evenly matched with (pull does not necessarily refer to just one mob.<br/>
I just mean an even fight all around), a wizard can very quickly take<br/>
out one of the evens (with some minimal tanking to help) or take out one<br/>
blue and seriously damage another. why is that important? Well, clearly,<br/>
when you kill someone quickly, you no longer take damage from them for<br/>
the rest of the fight. Then the wizard can med and maybe get enough for<br/>
another blast or two while the rest of the party will end up beat up,<br/>
but definitely not dead.<br/>
<br/>
Also, evacs are a must at higher level. Yeah, druids have them too, but<br/>
that&#39;s just one other class with the skill. Shamans have SOW too, but<br/>
you don&#39;t see that diminishing from Druid power.<br/>
