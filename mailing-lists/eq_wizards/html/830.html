<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323580606">From what I have read previously,  I believe you are both right.  It is<br/>
very easy to turn on clipping for monsters, but it would allow an obsene<br/>
amount of exploitable bugs.  For instance,  if you stand in a certin spot<br/>
and open a door, your character will get stuck in the door.(I have done<br/>
this) If you gain the ability to do this to a monster, it would allow us<br/>
weak mage types to solo mobs that con red.  It would also allow players to<br/>
attack linked monsters one at a time by getting one to charge while the<br/>
rest a stuck in a tent or behind a dungeon wall.<br/>

&gt; On the contrary I was told that it was VERY hard to make buildings off<br/>
&gt; limits.  To implement that code for every creatures AI would have been a<br/>
&gt; large task and due to time constraints was not implemented<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just to inform everyone.  This behavior where monsters can attack through<br/>
solid object is not a glitch.  It is a choice they have made, the code to<br/>
turn clipping on for<br/>
monsters is there.  It would be very easy for them to make it so that<br/>
monsters cannot attack through things, but they have chosen to allow this.<br/>
I personally can&#39;t<br/>
think of any reasons why they would allow this to happen, but I&#39;m sure they<br/>
have their reasons.<br/>
