<div id="ygrps-yiv-1955504341">The problems I have with enstill is that it is resisted at a really high<br/>
rate. Whites, yellows, reds almost always resits while blues resist a<br/>
majority of the time. Greens resist their fare share too :P<br/>

&gt; That&#39;s very interesting.  I am new to my 20th level spells so I&#39;ve just been<br/>
&gt; experimenting with them every now and again.  You say enstill sucks?  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; been very successful with it so far...although I haven&#39;t used it that much<br/>
&gt; yet, I LOVE the period of time it takes for a creature to get out of it.  :)<br/>
&gt;   Not too many fizzles yet...no more than root I&#39;d say.  Was I just lucky?<br/>
&gt; Granted, Root is still more mana efficient for me right now at 20.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t used the stun spell &quot;Tishan&#39;s Clash&quot; (?) yet. More people hate it<br/>
&gt; than like it so far when I ask around.  I know it stuns casters... how long<br/>
&gt; does this stun period last?  Does this stun spell cast at a faster rate than<br/>
&gt; any of the shock spells?  I&#39;m just wondering if we&#39;d be better off just<br/>
&gt; nuking the MoB as fast as we can rather than waste time stunning it?  PLEASE<br/>
&gt; prove me wrong. ;)  (I&#39;d love to use new spells)<br/>

&gt; &gt;I very rarely use a root in a group anymore (and enstill really is<br/>
&gt; &gt;terrible)<br/>
&gt; &gt;since when I group I usually have 3 tanks in the group that do some good<br/>
&gt; &gt;damge when they are circled around a Target..I wait till I see the targets<br/>
&gt; &gt;health go down a bit then cast...watch the health bar go down someomore<br/>
&gt; &gt;from<br/>
&gt; &gt;my cast and the damage the Fighters are doing then cast one last time for a<br/>
&gt; &gt;take down.<br/>
