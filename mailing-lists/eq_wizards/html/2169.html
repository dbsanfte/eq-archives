<div id="ygrps-yiv-1465705966">Well, this is my observation (anybody correct me if I&#39;m wrong):<br/>
<br/>
Mobs will zero in on the party member that initiates the first hit.  Being <br/>
the case where there is one tank pulling, the entire train will usually keep <br/>
to that one member.  The rest of the train will keep to that tank unless <br/>
they are attacked by another member...so it&#39;s often important to use Assist <br/>
over and over again to validate the MoB your tank is pursuing.  In a <br/>
controlled group, the scenario should be that everybody need only <br/>
concentrate on the tank&#39;s HP to do any healing or decision to run.<br/>
<br/>
Assuming it&#39;s a free for all party it&#39;s hard to say.  I would assume that a <br/>
MoB would then target the player with the worst faction.  In a case where <br/>
everybody has a creature to worry about, it would be the best idea to ask <br/>
your tanks to help free you up first so that you can then cast uninterrupted <br/>
to finish up the battle.  If not possible, I usually try to let my tanks <br/>
know that I am occupied...decisions can then be made for everybody to run.  <br/>
It then becomes a question of whether the tanks feel confident enough to <br/>
clean up the train of MoBs. I&#39;ve been in situations where we&#39;ve left a <br/>
battle even though I have found myself with nearly 80% mana left...shame it <br/>
was wasted, but we lived to fight another day.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure about creature intelligence.  So far, the MoBs I&#39;ve encountered <br/>
all seem to share the same reaction as described above...only difference is <br/>
usually the size of the trains and/or their bravery. I say bravery only in a <br/>
sense where some areas like Unrest greens will decide to attack you just on <br/>
a whim.... in a case where you are busy taking on a tomb...it becomes a BIG <br/>
problem when a group of small little green beetles decide they want in on <br/>
the battle.  :)<br/>
Anybody have bug spray?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Hypothetical situation:<br/>
&gt;What happens if you&#39;re in a train situation, a party of 6 players &gt;being<br/>
&gt;chased by 15+ critters and the party decides to scatter?  If everyone <br/>
&gt; &gt;stays<br/>
&gt;together you end up with one group of players leading one group of<br/>
&gt;critters, but if they scatter...<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Does the train follow one poor bastard?  Does the train split up to &gt;follow<br/>
&gt;each individual?  Does creature intelligence play a part in this?  &gt;I&#39;m <br/>
&gt;very<br/>
&gt;curious about this, as it may change the survival rate of the group<br/>
&gt;drastically.  If no one has tried it, I&#39;ll try to test it out with a &gt;group<br/>
