<div id="ygrps-yiv-682404159">According to Iggie/Alyssandra/Jane Pierson:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t know about others, but I haven&#39;t found a ready source for cash that I can <br/>
&gt; survive hunting.  I generally hunt with a similar level warrior.  By scrimping and saving <br/>
&gt; tho I have gotten a full set of cloth armor and most of my level 8 spells.  Currently am <br/>
&gt; level 10.  Now begins the scrimping and saving to get level 12 spells.  I know that <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Where are you? North Ro is perfect for that level. You can take blue Tarentulas easy<br/>
(they all have a Chitin that sells for a few silver, but half have one or more Spider<br/>
 Silk that sells for 1g7). At level 10, you can even take some Sand Scarabs with a<br/>
marginal luck (no fizzle), and those Scarabs have shells that sell for 1g2, and the<br/>
occasional Scarab Egg Sac that sells for 4g. Plus there&#39;s a guard to run to if you<br/>
get in over your head :)<br/>
<br/>
In a two-hour hunting session, I usually make almost a plat. Granted, the last two<br/>
days were bad, because many people came in for the Tunare Festival, and the hunting<br/>
groups have swelled in number. When you see a Tarentula, you run fast, and /con later :)<br/>
