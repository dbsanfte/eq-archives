<div id="ygrps-yiv-242686260">I can see your point, but I don&#39;t think Verant intended for people to be <br/>
grouping with party members to are that far apart in Levels.  Otherwise, <br/>
what&#39;s to stop us from grouping with 40+ levelers and going after Giants and <br/>
Dragons! :)  Yeah, damn exciting...but pointless. ;)<br/>
<br/>
My understanding is that the farther up in levels we go...the wider range we <br/>
can group up with people.  It may not be out of the question for a level 40 <br/>
PC to group with a 30 PC probably.  At 18 now, I&#39;ve noticed it&#39;s still a <br/>
pretty even challenge for everybody even 5 levels above me.  xp gains is <br/>
still fairly even although the high-level player in the group would probably <br/>
forfeit a few xp by killing things that might be conning green to him/her.<br/>
<br/>
At lower teens, I&#39;ve noticed that it was usually better to stick between 3 <br/>
levels.<br/>
<br/>
Just my observation, not a science. :)<br/>

<br/>
&gt;To me, it seams like alot of people assume that though all lvls of the game <br/>
&gt;we<br/>
&gt;group with people that are generally the same level as eachother. But, this <br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;fale. I have grouped with people upto 7 - 8 lvls above me, for fun, and for <br/>
&gt;some<br/>
&gt;exp since I can still usualy get a worth while ammount of exp while grouped <br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt;them. And this is where the &quot;resistance&quot; complaint comes in.<br/>
