<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947817147">That sounds like classic &quot;I take no responsibility for my actions&quot; sort of<br/>
defence for basically immature behavior.  Oh poor you, you can&#39;t find a<br/>
group, therefore I&#39;ll just steal.  Sounds kind of familiar to stuff like,<br/>
Poor me, I had no parental guidance as a child, so I mug people.  You have<br/>
some very faulty reasoning going on.  If you want to get groups, you don&#39;t<br/>
kill steal--EVER.  You do it once, and you&#39;re already risking getting a bad<br/>
name for yourself.  Do it more than that and you can guarantee you&#39;ll never<br/>
get groups again.  Not only that, but kill stealing has a very short life<br/>
span.  You can kill steal up to a certain level, and then parties begin to<br/>
decend into dungeons where you can&#39;t crawl by yourself to steal.  Also,<br/>
total party damage at these higher levels will begin to outstrip yours if<br/>
they have a balanced group.  Your leveling will begin to peter out, and<br/>
you&#39;ll be left roaming around looking for something worth exp that a group<br/>
is killing so that you can get your smidgeon of exp by stealing it.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing too, have you not considered that all the other classes have<br/>
the same grouping problems you do?  I also play a cleric, and there have<br/>
been many a time I was planted on my duff waiting for a group.  None of<br/>
these other classes are able to effectively kill steal, so what about them?<br/>
To hell with them, is probably what you&#39;d say.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why you don&#39;t get groups.  You don&#39;t know how to interact with other<br/>
people.  You&#39;ll be a fringe parasite for a long time unless you shape up.<br/>
&quot;I can&#39;t get groups, so that&#39;s why I kill steal,&quot; is a two year old&#39;s<br/>

because he didn&#39;t do anything to deserve one from momma too.<br/>

Waah.<br/>

&gt;      You guys don&#39;t seem to understand why some of us (such as<br/>
&gt; myself) kill<br/>
&gt; steal all the time.  IT IS BECAUSE WE CANNOT FIND GROUPS !!!<br/>
&gt; simple as that.<br/>
&gt; no groups, KS !  thats it.  I don&#39;t feel like sitting on my ass<br/>
&gt; for 30 - 40 min<br/>
&gt; waiting for ppl to group, while shouting all the time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) people hate us for shouting so much<br/>
&gt; 2) people don&#39;t message us even if they need group member (weird)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      You ppl who are against kill stealers by shouting their<br/>
&gt; names out so no one<br/>
&gt; will group them are so god damn stupid, all you have to do is<br/>
&gt; group with them<br/>
&gt; and BINGO !! no more kill stealing.   If i am getting good xp ,<br/>
&gt; why kill steal<br/>
&gt; ??  there is no point for me to risk my life trying to get xp<br/>
&gt; from some monster<br/>
&gt; 6 others are beating up on.  I rarely die in a group since I<br/>
&gt; stand so far back,<br/>
&gt; but while kill stealing if i beat them up too much, the mob might<br/>
&gt; run to me with<br/>
&gt; no one else helping.   If you really want to stop kill stealing,<br/>
&gt; then just group<br/>
&gt; with those people so you guys can take on higher mobs together.   I would<br/>
&gt; happily stop KS anytime during the day to Group with ppl passing<br/>
&gt; by.  I only KS<br/>
&gt; while waiting for groups and i do shout for groups while i KS as well.<br/>
&gt; People are stupid and don&#39;t know how to stop a problem,  oh<br/>
&gt; well... what can you<br/>
&gt; do ?<br/>
