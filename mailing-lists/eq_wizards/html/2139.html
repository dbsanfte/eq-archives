<div id="ygrps-yiv-686920312">Wizard solo ability starts off excellent. I&#39;d say 16 and above it<br/>
becomes increasingly difficult whereas you can only solo 1 blue<br/>
creature. Theres just not enough mana to do more. <br/>
<br/>
Why can&#39;t we get more mana? I&#39;m insane for thinking that? :P Maybe,<br/>
maybe. I do know that wizard class is entirely dependent on mana to<br/>
survive, where all the other classes have some non-mana way of dealing<br/>
with things. You&#39;d think, then, that we as a class would discover a way<br/>
to get more mana while our colleagues are focusing on how to get<br/>
otherworldy beings to follow their orders.<br/>

&gt; Heyas, I got no beef with you, and yes, I think that if you keep up thinking<br/>
&gt; that a wizard is a crappy class, and want to change it to your needs, thats<br/>
&gt; never gonna happen, so why dont u stay on topic first off. The topic for this<br/>
&gt; list wasnt &quot;Discuss how a wizard can be made better&quot; so over all, you flamed<br/>
&gt; me with a dumb response that made jack for sense.<br/>
&gt; I also don&#39;t see why your freakin out so bad, I mean, gosh, I personally<br/>
&gt; understand how the wizards work in all games, they ARE NOT supposed to be the<br/>
&gt; masters of melee, or other magic kinds, they are supposed to be able to Damage<br/>
&gt; the target very fast, thats EXACTLY what they do! If you think a wizard needs<br/>
&gt; to be able to get more mana or crap, your insane, I can kill 4-6 blues in a<br/>
&gt; row without medding(at lvl 9), and I can take on 3 blues at a time, and I can<br/>
&gt; do 1 even! If you dont got what it takes to be a wizard, then just go play a<br/>
&gt; Magician so you can summon, go play your trix, wannabee.<br/>
