<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353269906">Sounds like a cool idea I would definitely add your site to my list of sites<br/>
I visit each day.  I would highly recommend that you keep the site secure<br/>
and only allow those to make submissions who have proved themselves to be<br/>
trustworthy.  Also, there needs to be a way for us to correct incorrect<br/>
submissions if we find out new information.  I don&#39;t know of the tools to<br/>
automate all this, but I am sure they are out there.<br/>

I wish to create a &quot;Tome of Magi Lor&quot; web page. If you have or know where I <br/>
can get a CGI/HTML script that will allow others to add their comments to <br/>
this web page please let me know. What I am looking for is a CGI data base <br/>
that allows external entries to be added then automatically updates a FAQ <br/>
sheet. The automatic part is a must cause I like to play EQ too much to get <br/>
stuck updating a web page. I can screen the page and omit others. I would <br/>
really like a CIG data base that would allow me to have a login and password<br/>
<br/>
security that way those pesky fighters could not steal information. Also I <br/>
would be able to track who said what about quests or items to glean more <br/>
info from then if needed.<br/>
