<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018537548">Ooops, looks like Ipsor&#39;s Enlightenment III has all sorts of levels worth of recipies in it.  I assume the same for the next in the series, but I havn&#39;t blown 20 plat on that one yet.<br/>
<br/>
But anyways, I&#39;m certian there are more books out there!  Anyone know where one can get them?  Some of the Gypsy camps perhaps (Gypsy camps don&#39;t like selling to Dark elves)?  If so are they written in Cobine tounge, AKA Giant?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
