<div id="ygrps-yiv-1817661030">its not so bad that our spells are resisted with lvl 6+ higher<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been in Unrest since lvl 15 and most of my spells are resisted by Dark<br/>
Bones and Dry Bones.  But its not so bad as long as your groups are doing fine.<br/>
Just join up and sit there to gain Xp and Loot. no danger since u don&#39;t hit the<br/>
mob, so it won&#39;t come after u.  Just cast it once at start of fight to see if<br/>
its resisted. and then start on the Radiation.  I gained a lot Xp and only died<br/>
Once from a skeleton monk that killed someone else and then came after me from<br/>
behind.   if they ask you why you aren&#39;t helping, just say ur resisted.  or just<br/>
cast a few frost shocks to pretend ur helping out :)</div>
