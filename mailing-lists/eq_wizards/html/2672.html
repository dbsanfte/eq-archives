<br/>
  Has anybody done the journal strongbox quest in freeport?  I keep getting told that the journal strongbox I need to get is in the water by the freeport docks but I cannot find it!  I&#39;ve tried killing the sharks to see if it was loot, and I didn&#39;t get any loot. Can anybody who is familiar with this quest help?<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks,<br/>
