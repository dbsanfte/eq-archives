<div id="ygrps-yiv-774687838">Hi Robert and evryone else<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can understand your frustration and i have been there to, want to know what i did ?. I started an Dwarf Paladin couse i want to be able to have magic, i playd him almost 20 hours and got him up to lv 10.<br/>
I think that Paladin�s are a great class but when i came back to my Wizard again and evrything was fun again, i got him leveld u from 16 to 19 and now that feeling comes over me again.<br/>
I  have so hard finding any XP by myself or find a group to get XP in, i have been to unrest but i dont like that place. Either your in a strong group there and you don get much in XP or you are in a group around the same level so you have to zone sometimes with the result it takes ages to regroup and get back to the killing of undeads.<br/>
I have been Lv 19 so long now i cant take much more of this so i will play my Paladin for a while i think and wait for the feeling for my litle gnome wizard to get back, it always does so i�m not worried about that.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm that was not what i intended to write in the first place :-)<br/>
<br/>
Wizards are fun to play!!!! <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, I&#39;m finally going to break down and seriously play a spellcasting <br/>
&gt;class.  Of course due to the raw power of the class, as well as the <br/>
&gt;versatility of teleportation, Wizards are my first choice.  I realize that <br/>
&gt;people have most likely time and again requested spell lists, but here I am, <br/>
&gt;brand spanking new to the list.  I was wondering if perhaps some nice soul <br/>
&gt;out there might be able to send me a complete list.  I&#39;ve checked EQLizer, <br/>
&gt;EQVault, and EQstratics and none of them have every spell, thanks in advance <br/>
&gt;everyone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;----------------------------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m a 14th level wizard on E&#39;Ci. David, if I may be honest here, I would <br/>
&gt;like to suggest that if you want to have fun playing a spellcaster, pick <br/>
&gt;about anything other than Wizard. Enchanters get pets and can make magical <br/>
&gt;items. If I were to start over and pick a pure mage class, that would be the <br/>
&gt;one I&#39;d go with.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;*ducks flameage*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&lt;rant mode&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Let me explain - Verant hasn&#39;t implemented specialization skills or the <br/>
&gt;alternate planes, we have almost nothing for armor or hitpoints, our melee <br/>
&gt;skills are pathetic and our powers don&#39;t become greater than other classes <br/>
&gt;until 40-somethingth level. Plus, the single greatest way of leveling up - <br/>
&gt;killing har red mobs - is unavailable to us, because our spells are often <br/>
&gt;resisted completely by these creatures. So, instead of grouping with <br/>
&gt;powerful warriors to beat up on mobs that will actually give EVERYONE in the <br/>
&gt;group decent experience, we&#39;re relegated to trying to solo weak blues or <br/>
&gt;fight white and yellow creatures in a group for pitiful experience because <br/>
&gt;WE CAN&#39;T TOUCH HARD MOBS LIKE EVERY OTHER CLASS CAN!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve watched every group I&#39;ve run with pass me up in level. I&#39;ve watched <br/>
&gt;characters started while I was at level 12 PASS ME at level 13. It&#39;s not as <br/>
&gt;though I never play, it&#39;s just that I CANNOT GAIN MORE THAN HALF A BUBBLE <br/>
&gt;EXP PER HOUR, on average. That&#39;s powergaming, soloing in the Karanas vs. <br/>
&gt;blue beetles and the occasional white/yellow.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Needless to say, I&#39;m very frustrated in playing this class right now. The <br/>
&gt;only reason I remain a Wizard is stubbornness. Everyone says it gets better <br/>
&gt;at higher levels, but the fact of the matter is that we&#39;ll always be a <br/>
&gt;second-rate class unless Verant fixes specialization, plane travel and <br/>
&gt;spell-resistances of higher-level mobs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&lt;/rant mode&gt;<br/>
