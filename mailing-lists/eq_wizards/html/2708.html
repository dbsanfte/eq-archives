<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117556926"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Like most of you at level 22 and beyond we have trained in Specialize.<br/>
&gt; I have a few questions I&#39;m sure you may have the answers to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1: How do we know if a particular CASTING has utilized the<br/>
&gt; Specializatioin Skill of that particular magic type (i.e. evocation,<br/>
&gt; abjuration) to see if we got a savings of mana useage?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It always uses it.  When the check is done to see if the spell casts,<br/>
fizzles, or how much mana is used, it takes into account you current skill<br/>
level.  For a DD spell, this is Evoke and Specialize: Evoke, as well as your<br/>
Dex level, and whatever else goes into their formula that is used when you<br/>
cast a spell.  Your current skill level in specialize is just part of the<br/>
formula, and hence always used.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2:  My Skill in Evocation Specialization is at 51.  I am level 24 now<br/>
&gt; and cannot put any training points into it.  Is there something wrong<br/>
&gt; or can I not apply any more points until a later level or never?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure if you can train beyond that point, but my Specialize: Evoke is<br/>
at about 140 now just through use if Evoke spells in combat.<br/>
