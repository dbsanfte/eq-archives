<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256011018">Very well said.  I agree with you 100% as I also played a Mage up through<br/>
17th and know exactly what you&#39;re talking about.  I&#39;m very happy with my<br/>
wizard and the wizard class in general.  Yes, there are some disadvantages<br/>
to being a wizard, but the same is true for all classes and I rather think<br/>
the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages.<br/>

&gt; I have just started playing a wizard, only 9th right now, however i have<br/>
two magicians on different servers. One is 20th lvl the other 16th. So not<br/>
to add fuel to the fire, but a mage does 91+1 dam every lvl after 16 with<br/>
his shock of flame spell while the wiz does 117, so i have been told. Now i<br/>
heard it stated on this board that a mage doesn&#39;t recieve any more DD spells<br/>
until 24 this however is incorrect; the mage gets a spell at 20th. Bolt of<br/>
flame which does 141+ 1 per lvl after 20.( Note that both these spells have<br/>
damage caps of 99 and 150ish) i am not certain what the wiz does at 20.<br/>
&gt;  However just remember the grass is always greener syndrome. Mage spells<br/>
are very slow to cast compared to wiz. Mages also recieve no spells such as<br/>
shadow step or root for escape. If the pet dies the mage is in<br/>
rouble( losing pets happens quite a bit. Remember pet death=mages death<br/>
almost always).. Pets also dont always follow you closely and will attack<br/>
monsters you dont want them too sometimes.  Yhere are many zones that have<br/>
terrible construction on them so that a pet can not be used at all. Any time<br/>
a mage is travelling if he does not have his pet he is screwed. If attacked<br/>
he will never be able to cast his spells fast enough to save himself if the<br/>
monster is high blue or above. Mages also require more down time just to<br/>
start. Load into a dungeon summon pet med back 3 bubbles of mana hope train<br/>
doesnt come by and make you load and start all over again. Also of course<br/>
pets randomly kill them selves and get lost in dungeons making dungeons<br/>
harder to do as a mage. And as pets fall behind the caster in lvls they<br/>
bring in the green monsters that would not mess with the mage normally and i<br/>
can assure you that enough greens will still kill you.<br/>
&gt; Now dont take this wrong I liked my mage a lot but i think you guys only<br/>
see the advantages none of the disads. As a wizard i love being at full<br/>
combat readiness even when we just zoned, and not needing to stop and think<br/>
that if i zone my pet will be gone, and i&#39;m running out of components to<br/>
cast him and on and on. Wizards have there own advantages and disads. At low<br/>
lvls mages are much more powerful if they have thier pets but much less<br/>
without. Anyway dont despair about wizz they just need a higer lvl to obtain<br/>
thier power. If you are impatient play a necro or mage to get power now but<br/>
you will find that they all have thier weaknesses too.<br/>
