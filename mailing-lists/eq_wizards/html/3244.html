<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166619960">&lt;&lt;&lt;Hmm, Bonds of Force spell lasts only a few seconds? What the heck is it<br/>
good for then? Does anyone actually use it for anything? Leave it to Verant<br/>
to give druids a level 1 snare spell that costs 15 mana, is virtually never<br/>
resisted by blues, lasts the duration of the kill, and to give wizards a<br/>
snare-like spell at level 29 that costs 75 mana and lasts a few seconds.<br/>

The bonds of force spell is random in duration, just like snare. Sometimes<br/>
you can BoF a creature and it will last the entire fight or sometimes you<br/>
can use it and it lasts for 5 seconds. One of the main reasons BoF is so<br/>
high level is that it is an area effect spell. You can BoF multiple critters<br/>
if they are all together but beware that if you cast it on something that is<br/>
within melee range you can bind yourself as well. I use BoF as my opening<br/>
spell whenever I am soloing. About 50% of the time the spell will last for 3<br/>
or 4 nukes, about 35% of the time it will last for 1 nuke, and about 15% of<br/>
the time it will last until the creature is dead. I am a 38th level high-elf<br/>
wizard with a 191 Intelligence. Also root is much the same, as far as the<br/>
amount of time it lasts when soloing.<br/>
