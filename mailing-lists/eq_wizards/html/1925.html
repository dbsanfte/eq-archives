<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551826895">According to Don Bickner:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>1: You can find runes. However, you&#39;ll find the research components only<br/>
   infrequently, and you have one chance out of 4 to find one useable.<br/>
   =&gt; you have to trade for them. They are even rarer in stores :)<br/>
<br/>
2: You can sell them. The spell created is another spell scroll. However,<br/>
   it is also a Lore item, like other spells, so you cannot stock. You can<br/>
   only stock the components and make the spell just prior to sale.<br/>
<br/>
3: I don&#39;t expect much money to come out of this<br/>
