&gt; I wish to add that a god web page must have also a cast time of a spell.<br/>
&gt; and it will be nice to have near also lv of chanaling and evocation spell<br/>
&gt; skill in moment of misuration i think it will not be same for a lv 40 and<br/>
&gt; lv 20 wiz to cast a same spell. As i understand many class balances in<br/>
&gt; combat are also conected to this very important time to cast component.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I posted this idea before and it got no response, but I am very interested in<br/>
what the results would be.</div>
