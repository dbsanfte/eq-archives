&gt;&gt;Personnaly try solusek sometime<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sol huh?  Yeah, I want to go there but I assumed it would be better to get <br/>
&gt;there around 28+ lvl or so.  What do you think?  26/27 might be pushing it <br/>
&gt;if I had to go there solo eh?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I know I want a lot of stuff there!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually Sol A (Solusek Eye) you can start out in the low 20s.  I&#39;v found<br/>
stuff that still gives me exp at level 35 in Sol A, but it sure isn&#39;t much<br/>
when it happens.  If your going to solo there, best be level, oh say, 50.<br/>
I don;t believe there to be a way to safely solo in Sol and still get exp<br/>
at any level.  Most of the place was green to me even at 33 (when I first<br/>
went there).  However, 95% of all those Greens still attacked me.  I do<br/>
believe some of the casting goblins can see through Invis.  I don&#39;t see it<br/>
as being a good place for soloing at all.  Espically with all that lava<br/>
near the zone entrance.  Its just too easy to fall in if your trying to<br/>
make it to the zone at full speed.<br/>
<br/>
Sol B (Nagafen&#39;s Lair) I wouldn&#39;t try for till I was 34th at least.  When I<br/>
went there at 34th,  I don&#39;t remember seeing anything that was blue to me.<br/>
at 35th the occasional Kobold is white.  I have seen one or two persons<br/>
solo there but its really rare.  They tend to pull one thing at a time back<br/>
to the entrance and try to kill it there.<br/>
<br/>
As a wizard I personally wouldn&#39;t recomend Soloing in any dungeon.  Its<br/>
just too easy to get mobed, besides its not as fun as having group members<br/>
to talk to.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;yes our mana is calcualted by our charisma and dexterity.  it is only for<br/>
&gt;one song, level 43, which i haven&#39;t used since it came out.  they may have<br/>
&gt;fixed it though, it used to do damage to the bard singing it as well.  guess<br/>
&gt;like a wizard AE spell?  i have to play around with it, only problem is one<br/>
&gt;cast and we have to get our mana back to full.  it takes 4 bubbs, and we can<br/>
&gt;not med, nor does our mana song or clarity help, just sitting.  so how do<br/>
&gt;you cast an AE spell?  i have heard horror stories about them.  do you<br/>
&gt;target yourself, or a tank in your group?  anyway, just a note on bard mana.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Try sitting down with your bard when you need to regen mana.  Mana regen is<br/>
like healing hps naturally.  Its slow and works better if your sitting<br/>
instead of standing.<br/>
<br/>
I rarely use any form of AOE spells.  I group almost exclusively.  If I am<br/>
soloing its because either I am exploring, or waiting for my guild mates to<br/>
have a spot in a group.  Generally for a group and for individuals its<br/>
always safer to pull one mob at a time.  Hence AoE is no good in that case.<br/>
 If your expecting a big pull, and want to test out your AoE spells.  My<br/>
best advice is to target the tank in the group and hit him with the AoE.<br/>
Make sure your standing a decent distance away so that you don&#39;t get hit by<br/>
the AoE too.  The AoE will not damage other players, but it will hurt you<br/>
unless its a caster based AoE.<br/>
Its rare that I pull something on to myself when I AoE, but its also not<br/>
very efficient unless there are 3 or more mobs.<br/>
1. Be a safe distance away from the group.<br/>
2. Never use AoE to start a fight, wait till the mob that the tank is<br/>
fighting is down a bit so that if stuff does pull to you atleast it won&#39;t<br/>
be that one.  The distance also helps.<br/>
<br/>
The only time I would ever use a Caster Based AoE is.<br/>
1. To pull all the mobs to me so that the rest of my party can run.<br/>
However now I just evac.<br/>
2.  If its a lot of greens and I have a full set of shield, leather, or<br/>
Stone skins on me.<br/>
3.  If I want to lag up the screen for those with High Particle Density. :)<br/>

&gt; 3 groups tell me <br/>
&gt; im intrested<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A few weeks ago they did a test of the PoF on Fennin Ro, not sure if they<br/>
did it on other servers too.  Basically the GMs sent in 30 people into<br/>
fear, all level 46+.  I herd that 4 made it out alive, thanks to a<br/>
successful druid Succor.<br/>
The GMs then turned off the spawn and began to GM ress everyone that died.<br/>
They then tried it with 40 players entering the zone.  I herd it was about<br/>
the same outcome.<br/>
I understand that Verant wanted a place that could only be attempted with a<br/>
large scale event.  However, its a challange to get 2 groups work well<br/>
together, let alone 6 groups.  I believe the problem that most people have<br/>
with the zone is not that its too hard to survive there, but that its too<br/>
hard to even get into the zone before your mobbed to death.<br/>
<br/>
When I hit 46th.  I won&#39;t be going to PoF, unless something has changed.<br/>
