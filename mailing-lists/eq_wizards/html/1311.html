<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-425431973">Root means the NPC you cast it on doesn&#39;t move... of course if it doesn&#39;t <br/>
resist the spell..which happens.  You get this at level 4.<br/>
Enstill means a stronger version of Root, it looks like.  Same <br/>
definition.  You get this one at level 20.  I would venture to guess the <br/>
NPC&#39;s can still resist it if they are able to.<br/>
You can always try to cast when you are getting bashed...sometimes you can <br/>
pop your spells off and other times you are interrupted and lose <br/>
concentration and sometimes you get bashed and regain concentration and <br/>
continue casting.  Try to shoot your spells off while the NPC isn&#39;t <br/>
smacking you.. a lot of it is in your timing, unless you have a bunch of <br/>
monsters on you.<br/>

&gt;Dear Valacian,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What exactly is the difference between root and enstill? And can you cast <br/>
&gt;them while getting bashed? Somtimes I can sometimes I cant.<br/>
