<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576063345">Nice!  This is exactly what I&#39;ve been looking for!  Great work.  Now we only<br/>
need to fill in the rest =)  One suggestion is that for the damage category,<br/>
we could fill in the range of damage as it progresses through levels.  They<br/>
become more efficient as you gain levels until they hit their cap.<br/>
