<div id="ygrps-yiv-1562413696">You may be supprised who these high lvls are. Alot of people that I know who<br/>
are in their<br/>
mid-late 20s and 30s, and a few in their late 30s&#39; are actually adults with<br/>
jobs. Many of<br/>
them have a job that allows them to play EQ during work. This one girl I<br/>
know has a job<br/>
as tech support at an ISP. She has 2 computers setup there and she can<br/>
answer most<br/>
of the questions w/o needing to stop playing. She logs in something like 15<br/>
hours of EQ<br/>
per day. Then there is me =). Lvl 29 wizard, 16 yrs old, goes to school has<br/>
a social life<br/>
and trying to get a job .. ahwell.. Not all of the high lvls are teens with<br/>
to much time on<br/>
their hands..<br/>
<br/>
But, now to your question of where to hunt at lvl 12. At lvl 12 I left the<br/>
island of Faydwer,<br/>
well a bit before lvl 12. I got sick of the area, overcroweded and over<br/>
camped. So I moved<br/>
over to Atonica, if my mem serves me correctly, you should be able to solo<br/>
kodiaks, the<br/>
odd wisp and giant scarabs, also darkweed (or is it drake?) snakes. But you<br/>
need to be<br/>
really carefull with those guys, if your root resists you should start to<br/>
run to a zone line<br/>
or they will posion you which can kill you rather quickly. Also, you should<br/>
be able to solo<br/>
the odd trantula, but I find that root dosnt like to hold on these guys that<br/>
well. Also, you<br/>
should be able to solo scarabs. Or, you can try grouping up and go for the<br/>
dervish camps,<br/>
or head down into befallen.<br/>
<br/>
....hope that can help</div>
