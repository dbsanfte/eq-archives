&gt;It&#39;s bad enough that I only have a couple of hours a night to play, but<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Awww, that&#39;s a shame man. :(   Don&#39;t want to stick it out eh?  I can see <br/>
your point though...I was having a period of boring lull between 23 and 25.  <br/>
I was very close to giving up too.  But for some reason, I REALLY REALLY <br/>
want to see what it is like to be 50. :)  Once I discovered Cazic everything <br/>
started picking up again... making almost a whole level a night reminded me <br/>
of the old days. heh<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t found the crowds a big issue lately.  My server Veeshan has <br/>
matured a little bit so there&#39;s not so much fighting for Mobs and treasure.  <br/>
The power-levelers did their thing and are moving on.  When I hopped on <br/>
Quellious the other time it was crazy all over again...100  little elves <br/>
running around killing bats and spiders was a little psycho. :)<br/>
