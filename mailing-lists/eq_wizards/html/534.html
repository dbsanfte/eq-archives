<b>Subject:</b> Mana items... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496764625">What are some mana items I can get for myself at 13th level?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m saving up a bit to get two mana rings, and I&#39;ll be buying a mages +mana<br/>
robe.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What else can I have a shot at getting at my level?  I&#39;m on my way tonight<br/>
to Paw, hoping to get a runed totem staff, and to Qeynos to hopefully get<br/>
some of the special quest belts and boots or whatever that any class can wear.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any leads on other items that someone of my level could<br/>
possibly get?  With a group of 3-4 people?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And lastly, how much of an impact do +mana items have on meditation?  For<br/>
example, if I&#39;m doing good, I may be able to get two rings, a runed totem<br/>
pole and a robe that will give me a total of +16 mana.  Will I notice any<br/>
differnce in my meditation?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Flik</div>
