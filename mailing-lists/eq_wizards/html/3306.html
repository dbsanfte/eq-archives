<div id="ygrps-yiv-625931980">Late last night I finally got the 10th and final rod for the quest.<br/>
Which means tonight I make the trek to Everfrost to get the container.<br/>
Now I have heard that it is easy to fail at combining the rods, so what<br/>
is the best way to succeed?  Should I borrow a friends wisdom items?<br/>
Should I dump more training points into research (is this the right<br/>
skill)?  Any help would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m currently a 40th level human wizard.<br/>
