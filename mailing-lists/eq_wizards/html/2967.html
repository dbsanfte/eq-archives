&gt;Couple of ways to gate into Cazic both with a group and solo....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Group - Cast invisibility on everyone in your group with the exception of<br/>
&gt;you and 1 other who can invis(Enchanter, Magician, Shaman, so on). Have the<br/>
&gt;other person target you and begin casting invis. After he starts his cast,<br/>
&gt;you start your portal. He will invis you and have plenty of time to invis<br/>
&gt;himself before your portal goes off(and you only become visible at the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>start<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;of the cast, not at the end so you are safe). This works because of how<br/>
 </span></blockquote>long<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the portals take to cast.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Solo or Group(if no other invis casters) - Levitate yourself! This will put<br/>
&gt;you far enough away from the mobs at the hallways near the teleporter that<br/>
&gt;they will only attack you if they are wandering inside the room(which has<br/>
&gt;never happened to me and I gate in there all the time). This can also be<br/>
&gt;applied to groups without another invis caster, simply invis everyone and<br/>
&gt;levitate yourself. When you arrive in Cazic invis yourself immediately.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I too was intimidated by the Cazic gate because I had heard horror stories<br/>
&gt;about the place but after a few successful trips in I built my confidence<br/>
 </span></blockquote>up<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;and now use that as my gate if I am going to the Rathe Mountains or Guk or<br/>
&gt;anyplace that my other gates won&#39;t get me closer too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hope this helps.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yours,<br/>
