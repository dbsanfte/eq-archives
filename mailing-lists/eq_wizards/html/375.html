<div id="ygrps-yiv-382729712">I have a web server on a T1 and if people would like, I can set up a public<br/>
newsgroup on it for us.  Would work with any news brower, which most people<br/>
have included in their mail program nowdays.  I like this idea better than<br/>
email or web boards.  You would just set up my server as another news server<br/>
on your client, and as I&#39;m not using it for anything else right now, this<br/>
would be the only newsgroup on it.  Let me know what you think.<br/>

&gt; Hey, can anyone turn this very popular list into a newsgroup? I will<br/>
&gt; still keep reading, but it would be much more comfortable to do it in<br/>
&gt; newsgroup format.<br/>
