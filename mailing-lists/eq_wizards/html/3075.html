<div id="ygrps-yiv-919242054"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Yes. That&#39;s why, when you hear someone with the Scepter of Rahotep, the<br/>
&gt;Scarab Ring, or something like that, you go aaahhh.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;They&#39;re not overpowered (if they were like JBoot, can you HEAR the cries<br/>
&gt;of outrage), but they&#39;re like a badge. If you wield a scepter, wear a<br/>
&gt;ring, then you&#39;re *someone*.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I suppose, to some people you would be someone.  But to me, I just can&#39;t see<br/>
how being lucky enough to find a rare drop makes you someone.  I was lucky<br/>
enough to get a double-bladed bone axe from a wandering npc, an item a lot<br/>
of people have never heard of, but it just doesn&#39;t seem so cool.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know.  I guess with everyone looking like clones, people are desperate to<br/>
look different or be different in some way.  I remember once just walking<br/>
around wearing nothing, just to be different, since my character in his<br/>
&quot;gear&quot; looks like everyone else.  Someone wanted to know where I had died.<br/>
Lol.</div>
