<div id="ygrps-yiv-676096214"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; <br/>
&gt; What exactly is so bad about it? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You answer this question in your own words just a couple sentences away...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You&#39;re just upset<br/>
&gt; that she gets an advantage you didn&#39;t, right? Well, life is tough like<br/>
&gt; that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Damn right I am upset.  I play a limited amount of time and I have to compete with everyone else <br/>
in the game.  At similar levels we should have the same ability to compete.  But with her <br/>
twinking I am at the disadvantage.  While she coasts yet another character to the upper levels <br/>
AT MY EXPENSE!!  Yes I am upset and yes she should be told to play fair like the rest of us are <br/>
forced too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well, life is tough like<br/>
&gt; that. Whether she gets an advantage or not, is none of your business<br/>
&gt; because it doesn&#39;t really affect you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It does affect me.  It makes that many fewer creatures at my level available for me to kill in <br/>
an HONORABLE way.  This makes my job (an already difficult one) even more difficult and that is <br/>
why twinking is the WORST POSSIBLE OFFENSE.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And remember, she had to work her<br/>
&gt; way to level 22 before that as well, so she is only giving her other<br/>
&gt; Char something she rightfully earned.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And just WHAT is your point?  Because she has one character at a high level and can play in <br/>
areas that I cannot she has somehow earned the right to retard my low level characters <br/>
development (see above) making it even more difficult for me to get to my &quot;rightfully earned&quot; <br/>
22nd level.<br/>
<br/>
You are obviously a fool and most likely a twinker. I can only hope you are not on my server.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; The only bother, is pure green jealousy, isn&#39;t it? You&#39;re just upset<br/>
&gt; that she gets an advantage you didn&#39;t, right? Well, life is tough like<br/>
&gt; that. Whether she gets an advantage or not, is none of your business<br/>
&gt; because it doesn&#39;t really affect you. And remember, she had to work her<br/>
&gt; way to level 22 before that as well, so she is only giving her other<br/>
&gt; Char something she rightfully earned.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just concentrate on your own character and stop being a jerk about it.<br/>
