<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852306505">Other than zones with cities in them you can be bound in HighHold Pass and HighHold Keep.  Also a place not many know about is Arena, you can bind others there.  To the best of my knowledge this is the sole place for &quot;good&quot; races to be bound in southern Antonica.  <br/>

p.s.  Arena is accessable from Lake Rathe<br/>

  yes, dark elves can bind in oggok and grobb (and ogres and trolls can go in neriak).  light races should probably steer away from those areas (at least every light race ive seen try to go in has been kos with the exception of an erudite necro in neriak...  until he got to the ghouls in 3rd gate).  light races may be out of luck when trying to bind in locations in southern part of the continent.  i think u can bind in highkeep, but im not sure about that one (ive nvr done it). the next closest place i know of would be freeport or rivervale.<br/>

    Hello all,<br/>
        I an just wondering about the posible locations that we can bind other palyers too. Let me explain. My group all started out in Faydwer. As we moved out of the zones, I was able to bind them inside cities as we went. We are now over in the freeport area and I bind them there, outside the gates, and we have traveled to rivervale, where again, I was able to bind them. Now we want to travel to Grobb or Oggok, and I wonder if there are any &quot;outside city zones&quot; similar to Kelethin that I can bind my friends to. I realize that I can bind myself anywhere, but if my friends have to go inside a city, will they get KOS? Also, how does this work for any DE race that cannot enter rivervale, can they enter grobb or Oggok for binding?<br/>
    Thanks </span></blockquote></div>
