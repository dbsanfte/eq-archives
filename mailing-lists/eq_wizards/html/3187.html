&gt; &gt; Fighting red legionnaires, Im useful because I can shoot &#39;em down<br/>
&gt; &gt; fast, but against the more normal stream of blues and (gak) greens my<br/>
&gt; &gt; groups like to pull in... I am always medding, they are almost never<br/>
&gt; &gt; hit enough to show on their health bar, and swinging constantly.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Does this get any better?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not really...if your fighting a steady stream of blues your not going to<br/>
&gt; have the mana to keep up with the fighters...in that kinda situation your<br/>
&gt; best use is to sit back and let a blast on the tougher ones to soften them<br/>
&gt; up and wait for when the crap hits the fan and you get a bad pull...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutly, as a wizard, you are the groups panic button.  Fighting a steady<br/>
stream of blues, a group that includes a cleric will almost have no use for<br/>
us until the puller yells,  &quot;Oh Shit, I pulled something big guys, get<br/>
ready&quot;  That is when we shine.  With our burns, nobody can save the situation<br/>
faster than a wizard.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Really a lot of our uses involve this &quot;Oh Shit!&quot; kinda situation...it&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; often seem like your just sitting there sucking Xp and not really adding<br/>
&gt; to anything in the group, till you get a bad pull, in which case your<br/>
&gt; ability to dish out obscene amounts of damage quickly really comes in<br/>
&gt; handy, the trick is doing it without pissing off the critter too<br/>
&gt; much...(though in situations like that you&#39;ll probibly spend a little bit<br/>
&gt; of time with an almost dead critter whacking on you...just rember to make<br/>
&gt; them totally dead really quick ;) )<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hehe, wrote my comment before reading your next comment,  I guess we agree<br/>
:)  One more point is that many classes get a version of root.  If you are<br/>
going to burn the mob into oblivion make sure they know to use it.</div>
