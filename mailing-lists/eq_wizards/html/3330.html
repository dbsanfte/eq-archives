<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hey, any of you other Veeshan wizzies up for maybe finishing some quests <br/>
&gt; together sometime?  maybe this weekend?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As nice as friends and guilds are...I often find everybody is out for their <br/>
&gt; own class-specific stuff.  Would be fun to get a bunch of spell-casters <br/>
&gt; going around town to get some stuff for ourselves.  Nuke-fest!  I&#39;m out to <br/>
&gt; try to for anything from the jboots, oracle robes, acumen mask, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is there a quest for the Oracle Robe?  I&#39;ve been searching and searching for info <br/>
on one as I really don&#39;t want to have to kill the Oracle to get one and buying <br/>
one is out of the question for me given the status of my bank account.<br/>
<br/>
Wishing y&#39;all were on Cazic and I&#39;d be up for questing with you.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>
