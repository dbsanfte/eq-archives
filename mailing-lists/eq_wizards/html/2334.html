This was one thing wich we discused some time ago if i dont forget and i<br/>
can say that best mode to control advance of your skill is to look at your<br/>
attack value wich will change as you use your new weapon. ATTENTION as from<br/>
a bug you will not recive a message !! i have go from a 20 in piercing to<br/>
32 without message then i got 3 messages and then again nothing for some<br/>
time. I all time attack with my dagger any blu wich my group is fighting or<br/>
i join a fights against a blue MOBS in any case if you dont use spells<br/>
there is no danger of stealing any kill and are very rare monsters at last<br/>
at 18 lv wich will turn on wiz wich hit for a 3 dmg but they exist so be<br/>
carefull.<br/>

&gt;I had the same problem your having bringing up two handed blunt, i put 14 <br/>
&gt;points into it and i was having trouble bringing it up but i started <br/>
&gt;fighting in groups and sonce the group was tough enough i didn&#39;t need to <br/>
&gt;bomb the monster so i&#39;d join in the fighting with them and slowly but surely <br/>
&gt;it started going up and after a couple of points into it it should rise <br/>
&gt;pretty easily just be patient with it.<br/>
&gt;Hope this helps<br/>

&gt;&gt;I was lucky enough recently to acquire a runed totem staff. Unfortunately<br/>
&gt;&gt;as I had never used a staff before my skill was at &quot;awful&quot; level. No matter<br/>
&gt;&gt;how much I use it I can not seem to get my 2H blunt skill up. And I am<br/>
&gt;&gt;fighting blues or higher with it. I poured a bunch of practice points into<br/>
&gt;&gt;2H blunt, so now it is at &quot;very bad&quot; level, and I do more damage with it,<br/>
&gt;&gt;but still have never gotten a message saying my skill has gone up. I did<br/>
&gt;&gt;get a message about my offense skill going up, but that&#39;s it. Is there some<br/>
&gt;&gt;trick to this?<br/>
