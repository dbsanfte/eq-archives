<div id="ygrps-yiv-587068597"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; The only solution is, of course, to make the item really more difficult.<br/>
&gt; Forget quests: quests aren&#39;t intrinsically more difficult than slaying mob X;<br/>
&gt; once a quest is &quot;solved&quot;, in 1 week, everyone knows how to do it. Witness the<br/>
&gt; Glowing Stein debacle - the hard part was solving the quest. Once the first<br/>
&gt; stein was obtained, hundreds followed on all servers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One can increase the difficulty to get an item by:<br/>
&gt;         - raising the level needed to get it (which puts all rare items at the<br/>
&gt;                 level 50, everything before is chaff)<br/>
&gt;         - raising the difficulty of the location (which, once a group gets down<br/>
&gt;                 the unvarying routine down pat, stops being true)<br/>
&gt;         - raising the difficulty of finding the item (which is the case with<br/>
&gt;                 mega-rare spawns. How many players do you know with a Scarab Ring?)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is one other solution that to me is a lot more in keeping with the<br/>
AD&D style that I think people are used to - randomization.  You are<br/>
right tho that virtually all quests are breaks down to kill X and give<br/>
its head/heart/tongue/whatever to NPC Y.  But randomizing would make<br/>
them more quest-like.  Easier to explain in an example:<br/>
<br/>
Everyone knows who to talk to to start the glowing stein.  Instead of<br/>
his fixed dialog though, imagine if he says I need a rare and exotic<br/>
drink. You say &quot;I would like to help you&quot;.  He says &quot;Here is a recipe<br/>
book.  Find the ingredients listed here and return them in the book to<br/>
me.&quot;  Each item would have one more set of fields that should be<br/>
randomly generated every time you get the quest given to you.  Maybe<br/>
make it from a more appropriate list, you might not need a gargoyle eye<br/>
for a level 10 quest, but you get the idea.  Then you keep this book<br/>
with you, refer back every few play sessions, seeing what you need. <br/>
Maybe you need to figure out where to get an item even! (ack- a real<br/>
quest!)  THEN - continue this.  You return the book.  You get the item<br/>
&quot;The Glowing Stein&quot;.  Except that its is +5 to +10 int, and +5 to +10<br/>
dex - maybe you get lucky and get the ultra rare +10 +10 stein.  Voila -<br/>
you have a dynamic quest that no web page is going to spoil, and<br/>
everyone is NOT alike!  <br/>
<br/>
Lastly, to address the twinking problem:  Maybe the stein instead of<br/>
giving +10 int would give (+2 times level/10).  Therefore, your level 50<br/>
wizard has a +10 int stein, but his twinked level 2 wizard has the same<br/>
stein at +0 int!  Easily explained that with wisdom of levels you gain<br/>
the ability to use a sword better (damage =level, or something similar),<br/>
gain more power from the gem, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Just my few coppers worth.  Unfortuntaly, it is probably too late for<br/>
this version, but that would all make nice additions to the expansion!<br/>
