<b>Subject:</b> Anyone know the answer to this? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1687552294">I&#39;ve been in Qeynos the last couple of days collecting bearskin and<br/>
wolfskin boots and belts.<br/>
<br/>
However, Chandra and Baobob refuse to make bearskin and wolfskin cloaks<br/>
unless I help their familiy in West Karanas.<br/>
<br/>
I found their familiy, but none seemed to need anyhelp, except for a<br/>
farmhand that was bit by a wolf and needed a potion from the Temple of Life.<br/>
<br/>
No-one in the temple seemed to know anything about a potion of life, and<br/>
others wouldn&#39;t even deal with me, because I&#39;m an atheist gnome wizard.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And so my question is:<br/>
<br/>
Is this the quest that is needed to convince Chandra and Baobob to make the<br/>
Bearskin and wolfskin cloaks?<br/>
<br/>
And if it is, how can I complete the quest?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If that isn&#39;t the proper quest, could you point me in the direction of the<br/>
quest that is the right one.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Flik</div>
