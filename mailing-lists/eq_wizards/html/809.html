Subject: [eq_wizards] 2-Handed Staff Skill<br/>

<br/>
When I started, I was using a one-handed staff and my skill rose<br/>
relatively quickly to about 25-30.  I then switched to 2-Handed<br/>
staff to raise that skill, but it has NEVER gone up (while raising<br/>
from 6th level to 10th).  I tried seeding the skill with a few<br/>
training points, and it still has NEVER gone up.  Does the game<br/>
have an idea of a primary weapon or something?  Or have I<br/>
just been unlucky on raising the skill?<br/>
<br/>
                                                            Thanks,<br/>
