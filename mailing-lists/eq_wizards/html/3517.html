&gt; I once watched a lvl 50 Wizard Gate in, pull the Oracle around the<br/>
&gt; hill and burn him dead with one Ice comet. Guardian never budged.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heh.. so all I have to do is find a level 50 wizard or a high level druid <br/>
who&#39;s willing to take the faction hit.. or pay 1000 plat.. LOL I have <br/>
about 100 plat in the bank which is probably as high as my bank <br/>
account ever is.  Bottom line for me is that unless they fix the <br/>
quest for the robe it&#39;s unlikely that I&#39;ll ever get one.  Tho truthfully <br/>
I&#39;m having so little luck getting groups at 22 that I&#39;m not playin my <br/>
wiz very much these days.  I actually got tossed out of a group I <br/>
was invited to when the warrior discovered (uhhh how could anyone <br/>
NOT know this) that I couldn&#39;t buff or heal him.<br/>
