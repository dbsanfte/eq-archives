<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-941167500">Every one says powergaming and roleplaying as it where two different things.<br/>
I thought Power gaming was a sort of Role Playing as you play a role even<br/>
when you are powergaming. When I play i take blues and black to get good xp.<br/>
I dont go around killing green stuff to get the time going so I after youre<br/>
fashion call a roleplaying. I lvl about 1lvl a week. And are happy with<br/>
that. And of course I get the best weapon i can get at my lvl.<br/>
<br/>
So can anyone, if I am wrong in my understanding of powergaming, explain me<br/>
what is powergaming and why that is not a way of Roleplaying as i think it<br/>
is.  And what is wrong with it. If people has much freetime and use it to<br/>
play, it should not be called powergameing. As I have seen it been called in<br/>
earlier posts.<br/>
<br/>
Please dont flame me about this as I dont know. And just seeks understanding<br/>
<br/>
