<b>Subject:</b> Th Petition <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1204761808">I would like to thank everyone for their comments and inputs to the<br/>
petition.  We seem to have reached a majority of people agreeing on it.<br/>
I realize that many people would like to have things added to it, but my<br/>
fear is that the longer it gets, the less we will agree on it.  Also, I<br/>
intentionally left out specific examples for the sake of brevity</div>
