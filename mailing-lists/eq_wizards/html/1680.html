<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206104077">Hmm i use a runed totem staf after a lv 12 im on 14 now and like it hiting<br/>
for some 19 damage i use it on blue monsters some times if i see they need<br/>
a one or two more hits. So i can get 2 blues before i need to med. I also<br/>
found that a elephants dont have magic resistance and you can take a white<br/>
calf in south caranas easy! <br/>
<br/>
in group play as fight start i join with a staff until fighters dont build<br/>
a hate against them and then i move to distance and start rooting or nuking<br/>
if necesary. I look all time at health if fighters bar if it dont go down i<br/>
only use root when monster is to start running.<br/>

&gt;It all comes down to playing style...but I&#39;ve been solely relying upon <br/>
&gt;spells for fighting.  I haven&#39;t used or used very little melee since level <br/>
&gt;12.  Although admittedly, melee was VERY useful during the 8-12lvl stages <br/>
&gt;where you needed the extra dmg to finish the creatures off.  Since 12, if <br/>
&gt;you are lucky enough to find a regular group, you can begin your role as a <br/>
&gt;pure nuker...cast/med/cast/med.  I have met many a high level Wizard who <br/>
&gt;have gotten rid of staffs/daggers altogether in favor of mana or <br/>
&gt;intelligence enhancing items (idols, tomes, wands, etc)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In a group, and believe me, you WILL probably have to group at higher <br/>
&gt;levels, I find that your value to the group is more in your ability to <br/>
&gt;strike from a distance rather than risking your neck near a <br/>
&gt;creature..especially since it&#39;s pissed off at the 117 damage spell you just <br/>
&gt;casted 2 seconds ago.  :)<br/>

&gt;&gt;Can anyone confirm this and/or give suggestions on how at this point<br/>
&gt;&gt;(9th) I can improve my 1H fighting skills?<br/>
