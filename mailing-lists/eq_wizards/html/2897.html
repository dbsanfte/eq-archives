Go to the gypsy camp in the middle of North Karana and talk to Mysteria<br/>
(something like that anyways).  She will tell you she is the keeper of the<br/>
Concordance of Research (which is equivilent to the lexicon, but for<br/>
research).  Give her 2 lightstones (seperate).  One for the Research Runes<br/>
vol 1 and one for Research Runes vol 2.  These tell you how to research.<br/>
Then give her a greater lightstone to receive the Concordance of Research.<br/>
<br/>
Note, as of this moment (unless they just fixed it) research practice does<br/>
not work.  The recipies are incorrect or something.<br/>
