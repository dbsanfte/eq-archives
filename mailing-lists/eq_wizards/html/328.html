<div id="ygrps-yiv-874413586"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; These spells teleport the caster only to those specified locations, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; believe that they take you to those triangular pillar formations that<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; located in the various zones but only being 15 means I have never tested<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ah!  So that&#39;s what those things are for!  I saw one of them in the<br/>
&gt; Karanas somewhere, and of course there&#39;s one across the bridge on<br/>
&gt; Erud.  It would make a lot of sense if they are portals for<br/>
&gt; teleportation.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s also one in Greater Faydark, I think just east of Kelethin...  when<br/>
I accidentally found it, there was about 5 or 6 other people around, but I<br/>
never really got the chance to ask what the &quot;towers&quot; were for, because an<br/>
orc came up from behind me and hacked me to pieces (I was a Lv2 High Elf<br/>
Wizard at the time).. :)<br/>
