<div id="ygrps-yiv-643627605">With all the changes to Mages, Enchanters and Necros does anyone know of any<br/>
changes for Wizards coming up?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I mean Enchanters seem to be ruling the game now, with all the Enchanter<br/>
only quests and new abilities they are the most powerful class in the game.<br/>
At this rate they may have to change the name of this game to<br/>
&quot;EnchanterQuest&quot;. Now I know they added the Tarton&#39;s Wheel quest for us<br/>
wizards but that isn&#39;t going to help me until I get closer to 49th and can<br/>
actually use the runes.<br/>
