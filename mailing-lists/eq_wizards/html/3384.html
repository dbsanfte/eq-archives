<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Blade trap?  I saw that &quot;decoration&quot; and didn&#39;t even realize it might be a<br/>
&gt;trap.  So I walked right into it.  And nothing happened at all.  In fact,<br/>
&gt;until someone else mentioned the word trap in-game, I didn&#39;t even think <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;was what it might be.  The next time I was there, I stood under it, and<br/>
&gt;still, no effect.  I never take damage from it.  Has anyone out there ever<br/>
&gt;been damaged by it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know...that&#39;s what I was thinking.  I&#39;ve only been to Sol once...that <br/>
time I encountered the blade but nothing happened to me.  My buddies say it <br/>
hasn&#39;t ever hurt anybody but they don&#39;t take chances and time it anyway just <br/>
in case.  :)<br/>
