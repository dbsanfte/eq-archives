<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006832046">Kakarot asked:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What is the next logical step beyond a cracked staff?  I am a lvl 3 wizard<br/>
&gt; (just started TZ) and am only familiar with the 2H blunt.  What should I<br/>
&gt; go for after the cracked?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The cracked staff is 1h blunt.  My suggestion is to pick up a worn great staff <br/>
and work on your 2h blunt and get a Giant Snake Fang (can usually pick one <br/>
up for around 1p) and work on piercing.  Switch off among these various <br/>
weapons and keep all 3 of them maxxed.  It will come in VERY handy later.<br/>
