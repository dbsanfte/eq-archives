<div id="ygrps-yiv-1167006040">16th is the correct level for Invisibility. Although it only costs 4 gold<br/>
because it is a 2nd rank Enchanter spell.<br/>

Subject: [eq_wizards] What level for Invisibility?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi all, this is my first posting to this mail list, but i have read all the<br/>
archives.<br/>
Great info by the way, much better stuff here than other lists I have read..<br/>
<br/>
To my point...� At exactly what level do we Wizards have access to the<br/>
Invisibility Spell?<br/>
<br/>
I have seen some postings which say 8th, but I am fairly sure every time I<br/>
have seen �<br/>
it it says 16th level required !?!<br/>
<br/>
Just confused is all because I am sure it said Level:16 on the spell... �<br/>
Maybe I was looking at another Classes version of the spell???��<br/>
�<br/>
Please help a befuddled Apprentice...I am desperately trying to get from<br/>
Qeynos to<br/>
Freeport to group with some RL friends and have already died trying to get<br/>
there...<br/>
<br/>
Awaiting your collective wisdom with baited breath....�<br/>

P.S. - Does anyone on E&#39;ci regularly make the trip from Qeynos to Freeport?�<br/>
If so, please mention and I can keep an eye out for you and maybe tag<br/>
along?�</div>
