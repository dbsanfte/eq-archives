&gt; Another MUCH missed int item that you can do at level 12 is the golden<br/>
&gt; stud earring.  This will be your first &quot;lesson&quot; in camping probably, but<br/>
&gt; is a good one. Again, Graffe&#39;s page is the best, but the gist is you<br/>
&gt; kill a mob in Qeynos (Cubert, named baby gelationous cube - about 80<br/>
&gt; hp&#39;s), get an item, and trade it in for a +3 int earring.  I did that a<br/>
&gt; BUNCH of times, finally got my two, and thats no small int bonus for<br/>
&gt; such a low level quest!  And the best part is, they are like backup cash<br/>
&gt; - if you are hitting a spell level, and need 30 plat fast...<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had the funniest experience with these things. Most people did not<br/>
know about cubert (neither did I) and the most common way to get them<br/>
was camp the gnoll high shamans in Lake Rathe. So, anyway, I never<br/>
camped mine. I bought mine for cheap somewhere in my teens (trade was<br/>
chaotic and uneven back then. Ahh the good days) and I sold them for<br/>
100pp one and for 175, I think, the other. People had no idea what they<br/>
are worth and how to get them.<br/>
