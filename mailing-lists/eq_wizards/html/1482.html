<div id="ygrps-yiv-754717177">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
Quick question for ya all.<br/>
<br/>
I was in Unrest and someone was selling some blood-stained gloves for 40<br/>
plat. He said they were great for mages but before I could get the stats on<br/>
the gloves my wonderous ISP gave me a swift to the arse and when I returned<br/>
the fellow was gone. Anyone out there able to tell me what the stats on the<br/>
gloves are? And are they worth the 40 plat? Seems pretty high for some golves.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for you time,<br/>
<br/>
