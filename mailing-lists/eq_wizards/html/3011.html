<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660786696">Another good idea to me would be to change the spawn points every once<br/>
in a while.  Sure that might take some time to change, but that is the<br/>
reason we are paying them 10 bucks a month.  And does anyone know how<br/>
this expansion pack is going to work...Is it set up so you HAVE to buy<br/>
it????</div>
