<div id="ygrps-yiv-247413375">I think there are a lot of things that are &quot;illegal&quot; that aren&#39;t documented<br/>
as such.  It almost seems, sometimes, these things are made up by the all<br/>
powerful, as they go along.  Who knows.  Maybe that person who was suspended<br/>
for 30 days might like that information to argue her case with the powers<br/>
that be.  Hope she is reading this.  I also noted that some things I have<br/>
been told are no-no&#39;s lately are to be found absolutely NO WHERE in the faq<br/>
on the official site.. go figure.<br/>

&gt;Where does it say twinking is illegal? Anyone know? I read the Rules of<br/>
&gt;Conduct and the Game Faq and there is nothing there banning the<br/>
&gt;ownership of high-level items by low-level characters. Just wanted to<br/>
&gt;let people know so that recent posts dont scare people who have high<br/>
&gt;level characters sharing the wealth with them.<br/>
