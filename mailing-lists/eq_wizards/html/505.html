<div id="ygrps-yiv-335901692">I agree with you guys.<br/>
<br/>
The only other suggestion I&#39;d like to add to the shock vs. bolt discussion, is that sometimes the high damage in one shot is worth it.   When I&#39;m in a group, I usually hang back and move into a position where none of my friends are in my line of sight between the enemy and I.  I wait, and maybe will cast a shock or two.  Then when he gets down to about where I&#39;d kill him in one shot, I&#39;ll bolt him.  That one shot kill keeps him from running away.  But other than that, I totally agree with you that the shock line of spells is much more effecient overall.<br/>

&gt; That is a GREAT  point as well as the fact that using a Line of sight spell<br/>
&gt; while solo&#39;ing can be bad and the shock casts a ton faster.  Also,  it is my<br/>
&gt; experience that you get more reliable results from the shock spells  where I<br/>
&gt; have spent 85 mana to do 6dmg with the Bolt of lightning  ;p<br/>

&gt; Shock of Ice.  Firebolt does more dmg per cast, but shock of Ice has a<br/>
&gt; better mana to dmg ratio.  So if you ever have to use all your mana trying<br/>
&gt; to kill something, you will do more dmg with Shock of Cast than with<br/>
&gt; Firebolt.<br/>
