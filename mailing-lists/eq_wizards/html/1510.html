<div id="ygrps-yiv-1968433989">According to Rivi�re St�phane:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you know what s the purpose of the dexterity ?? I get a cape ac 8 plus 5<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dexterity is your chance to score in melee/ranged attack fight. For us,<br/>
it is borderline useless. The cape is ok, but only for its AC factor, or<br/>
if you intend to duel casters.<br/>
<br/>
Items of importance for us:<br/>
	+X vs something (for anyone in fact)<br/>
	+X INT<br/>
	+X MANA<br/>
	+X AGI (for anyone in fact)<br/>
		(agility is the skill to avoid being hit)<br/>
<br/>
eventually +X STR, if you want to carry more loot. But I know I&#39;d trade<br/>
instantaneously the Cutthroat ring (+ to DEX) for any MANA +X ring, even<br/>
a lowly +5 mana. Agility is good to have, because it means you might be<br/>
able to Shadow Step/Gate when mobs have decided to hold their nightly<br/>
meeting around your cooling body, and insist to complete your preparation.<br/>
<br/>
(alas those enchanter types make +5 mana rings that cost way more than the<br/>
 cutthroat ring. Insane: DEX increase should be so much more valuable than<br/>
 straight mana increases)<br/>
<br/>
+ to CHA is a little useful to get those extra silver when selling.<br/>
+ to WIS is rumored to be useful to get better chances of success in skills<br/>
	use (???)<br/>
+ to DEX and STA is useless, it helps in melee combat and nowhere else.<br/>
