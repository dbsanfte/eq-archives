<b>Subject:</b> Re: Hunting in Antonica <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-718748538">I&#39;m a level 7 wizard who also abondoned Faydwer for more fertile hunting<br/>
grounds.  With 1600 people online over 35% were in 4 zones of our small<br/>
isle.  I found the desert of northern Ro to be fairly profitable, and<br/>
someone there is always looking for wizards to group with.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;  Hail, I just moved from Faydwer to Antonica and was wondering what a<br/>
&gt; level 6 wizard could hunt? It would also be nice to know what to hunt<br/>
&gt; a couple monsters after level 6 too. All help appreciated,<br/>
&gt; thanks.Lott P.S. I think I can manage finding zones anywhere in the<br/>
&gt; area, so don&#39;t feel obliged to describe how to reach the location. </span></blockquote></div>
