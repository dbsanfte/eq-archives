&gt; 70pp?!?!?  How long have you been saving money?  And you are a wizard?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Course I&#39;m a Wizard...just made level 14 today I hope I keep it for<br/>
awhile.... I haven&#39;t really been saving money. I got all my cloth armor off<br/>
of Orcs so I didn&#39;t have to spend any there. I helped outfit a Druid friend<br/>
3 weeks ago(patch and some snakeskin) And just today I bought some Netted<br/>
and Woven(cost me 6pp total) and I have just over 80pp as of today. My<br/>
suggestions: loot everything up to about level 8. Then know what crits carry<br/>
what... In a period of an hour I got 5 greater lightstones from wisps. I<br/>
know to look for them at night and you can tell which ones they have...this<br/>
is important since at levels 9 and 10 you will be almost dead and OOM pretty<br/>
much when you kill a wisp. So you have to make every potential kill worth<br/>
your downtime. I also suggest that you do not stay in one place...Camping<br/>
does not make cash for anyone except in dungeons and I rarely go into the<br/>
dungeons yet.....All the Crits that move around are good to hunt. Wisps have<br/>
up to 4 gold..Evil Eyes have up to 4pp. With a party taking turns on looting<br/>
Evil Eyes each person should get about 3 loots an hour, that&#39;s a huge<br/>
profit. Explore...I&#39;ve been almost everywhere and I don&#39;t get to play all<br/>
that much... It&#39;s out there....<br/>
