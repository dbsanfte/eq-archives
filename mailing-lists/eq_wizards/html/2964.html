&gt; I&#39;m going to answer several posts at one time here to conserve your<br/>
&gt; bandwidth. :)  I hope you can follow:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Fair enough.  Just for the record though, I followed the<br/>
levitate-then-teleport directions several times now without a problem.  The<br/>
suggestion to have another mage invis you while you teleport is friggin<br/>
clever though.  My hat is off to whomever thought of that one.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>AE spells may get better as time goes on.  Dunno.  What I do know is that at<br/>
lvl 31 I don&#39;t keep them memorized all the time, and when I do, I use them<br/>
infrequently.  Say, 5 or 6 times an evening.  You have to let the situation<br/>
create itself and not try to force it.  Last night, for instance, I was down<br/>
in the king room in runnyeye (Borxx hunting) where most of the stuff is<br/>
green.  The room usually isn&#39;t that big of a deal, but sometimes 5 or 6 mobs<br/>
pop at once (or wander through).  I only cast the AE spell about . . . oh .<br/>
. . a dozen times.  But each time I hit for over 300hps total.  Once or<br/>
twice in the 400 range.  Which is pretty good mana efficiency for a spell<br/>
that only costs about 135 to cast.  Oh, and I never once pulled a mob to me<br/>
(not that it would have mattered much in this case).<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, the AE spells are a good suplement, but they will never be as<br/>
generally useful as your primary DD lines.  I only advocate AE spells<br/>
because most wizards fall into the trap of assuming they are useless.  They<br/>
are not.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I go through 10 to 20 bloodstones a night.  I personally find that<br/>
retrieving my corpse even once is more frustrating than the 10pp it costs<br/>
for my daily habit.  Be careful casting it though in the middle of a fight.<br/>
Mobs hate it.    :)<br/>
