&gt; I have something i want to try some time.  I want to put an item on a bat<br/>
&gt; and then tell all the newbies, ro go find it.  Who ever brings me the item<br/>
&gt; will get a reward.  Myabe a tentacle whip for the fighter typs or my water<br/>
&gt; crystal staff for the casters.  Ot could be fun.  The other night I was<br/>
&gt; bored and was going through teh Najena dungeon arming the skels with all the<br/>
&gt; old rusty weapond I had found earler.  I even gave one a tentacle whip to<br/>
&gt; see if hed use it.. He did and it looked cool.  I killed that one to get my<br/>
&gt; whip back<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve done this before with my Enchanter.  It&#39;s loads of fun.  I used to put a<br/>
stone and a gold bar on a mob, and then combine them for who ever brings them<br/>
back.  My only suggestion would be to put an odd (but common) item on a newbie<br/>
critter and state the ground rules up front (ie Nobody over Level 4 can<br/>
particpate) that way a wandering level 20 won&#39;t nuke everything in sight, spoil<br/>
your fun, and sell the tenticle whip.</div>
