<div id="ygrps-yiv-765698874">Well I just turned 12th this past weekend and I bought Halo of Light and Bind Affinity in Felwithe.   I did NOT see shock of lighting in Flewithe ANYWHERE, but I know for a fact you can buy it in FREEPORT on the 3rd (top?) floor of the mages guild.   At least that is what a 15th lvl wizard friend of mine told me.<br/>
  So I am going to freeport tonight.  :-)  see ya there!</div>
