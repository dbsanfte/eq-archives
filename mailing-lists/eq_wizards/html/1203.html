<div id="ygrps-yiv-204359870"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I would like to inquire as to your preferences of melee<br/>
&gt; weapon.  I am a<br/>
&gt; level 9 right now and am at the point where I am thinking<br/>
&gt; about seeking a<br/>
&gt; magical weapon.  I am sure at higher levels I won&#39;t even<br/>
&gt; want to get NEAR<br/>
&gt; the monster I am fighting to melee, but at this point I can<br/>
&gt; still get some<br/>
&gt; decent damage and save mana finishing off creatures with melee.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Learn from my mistake.  I concentrated on piercing upto level 14 and<br/>
maxed out the skill.  With a Giant Snake Fang it works very well.<br/>
Once you advance, however, you will start encountering people with the<br/>
beautiful Runed Totem Staff, which (from memory) is 8dmg, 47 delay,<br/>
+5HP and +5 mana, AND allows you to fight magical creatures.  It&#39;s a<br/>
2h blunt weapon.  I had neglected 2H upto then and am STILL trying to<br/>
get it maxed.<br/>
So my advice is, get a nice worn Greater Staff (or another decent<br/>
beginner staff) and use that until you can afford a Runed Totem Staff.<br/>
The Runed will cost you between 20 and 30pp (usually) and is superior<br/>
to almost anything else out there.<br/>
