<div id="ygrps-yiv-1283977733">According to Rich Mulawa:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have a 9th level wizard that has been using 2H blunt for her entire <br/>
&gt; life.  I would like to try some 1H weapons to free a hand for useful <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>1 ) pick piercing a the second proficiency. There are much nicer weapons<br/>
	available for casters in piercing than in 1h blunt. Slashing is<br/>
	out of the question :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Can anyone confirm this and/or give suggestions on how at this point <br/>
&gt; (9th) I can improve my 1H fighting skills?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As suggested everywhere, practice while grouped. When the monster is<br/>
engaged, jump on it and whack whack... Just back away when casting becomes<br/>
necessary and then finish it. It usually keeps my offense and defense maxed,<br/>
and when I decided to pick piercing back at 8th, the piercing had time to<br/>
increase.<br/>
