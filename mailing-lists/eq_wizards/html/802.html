<div id="ygrps-yiv-773110201">Someone said you have to put a practice point into a language before being <br/>
able to learn it.. not necessarily! I managed to go from 0 skill in Dwarvish <br/>
to Excellent after 40 minutes of on-again off-again spamming at the Kaladim <br/>
Docks. The trick is this: you won&#39;t see a skill for Dwarvish or be able to <br/>
select it as a language until the next time you zone. After you zone, the <br/>
lang(s). will be in your list.<br/>
