<div id="ygrps-yiv-623785626">I believe that we are the most strategic class in the game.<br/>
I listed the strategies by orientation sub-divided by level ranges.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PART 1.<br/>
Mixed Group Strategies.<br/>
You have all heard, &quot;Wait Until 50% damage.&quot; There is a little more to our<br/>
class than that.<br/>
<br/>
Universal Levels<br/>
1) I see many wizards cast Root spells while the melee is going on. Do you<br/>
see anything wrong with this? He&#39;s not going anywhere, save your mana for<br/>
better things.<br/>
2) If you have a weapon, a little melee can go a long way. It definitely<br/>
won&#39;t be much, but that 40-50 points that you do before you begin your<br/>
casting, could be the difference. Especially, if you&#39;re fighting multiple<br/>
mobs. I&#39;m sure you understand.<br/>
3) I experience serious lag when it comes to the mob&#39;s health bar. I<br/>
actually learn how much hps a mob has and have it written down, then I watch<br/>
the tanks damage and have a good idea what the other classes are doing as<br/>
far as damage goes as well. So as soon as 60% gets around I know it<br/>
immediately (I&#39;ll talk about the 60% soon). Whether your group admits it or<br/>
not, we are the generals of the group. We have to know what the other<br/>
classes are doing and what they are capable of and what that mob is capable<br/>
of. Don&#39;t be afraid to take notes on mobs. Ask your group members what they<br/>
do and if their spells have a side-effect damage and how much. I have all<br/>
kinds of crap about my computer when I play, I have a sheet for every zone I<br/>
have visited. (It doesn&#39;t feel right to give away all the mob info, and it&#39;s<br/>
not that hard to get anyway.)<br/>
4) 50-shmifty. That isn&#39;t entirely accurate. Keep a mental account of who<br/>
attacked the mob, and who has done the most damage, and how fast they damage<br/>
the mob. If the aggressor is the one who has done the most melee damage<br/>
you&#39;re safe to cast at 60%.  If the aggressor is the one who has done the<br/>
most melee and can get 3 melee hits fairly readily, you&#39;re casting mark will<br/>
be greatly increased to about 70%. By the time that you&#39;re with warriors<br/>
that get 3 hits readily your casting times will be long enough for you to<br/>
cast around this mark. You will be attacked sometimes with this, so if there<br/>
is no hurry, it is cool to wait.<br/>
These strategies are very aggressive. To me, items and knowledge is what<br/>
makes up this game. EVERY item that is worth getting is camped. And we all<br/>
know that no one thinks about anyone but themselves when that rare mob<br/>
spawns. WE ARE THEY KEY TO GETTING THAT MOB. We must do the most damage<br/>
(duh). If we get attacked, we are not doing the most damage. I wrote these<br/>
previous strategies for these situations. If you&#39;re grouped just for exp.<br/>
and fun, it isn&#39;t as important to be this aggressive. But it is always great<br/>
practice.<br/>
*Note* These strategies have made me somewhat known. I always get asked to<br/>
group in HighHold and the like, even when I&#39;m just passing through. If<br/>
you&#39;re having problems find groups, these strategies will help fix that.<br/>
<br/>
Low Levels (1-15)<br/>
There really isn&#39;t a whole lot to cover here that I didn&#39;t already. Low<br/>
level guys are given more room to be impatient. If you&#39;re grouped and the<br/>
mob comes after you, you can root it and back off. Soon the mob will we more<br/>
worried with the guy putting a sword in his head than you.<br/>
<br/>
High Levels (30+)<br/>
1) I use my stun spell right away if it&#39;s white or lower. Yellows I stun if<br/>
I am only going to fight a total of 3 mobs before I can meditate. Red&#39;s,<br/>
hehe, this can be fun. I cast one stun on the red if there will be no more<br/>
reds. They resist it often and if it&#39;s going to be a long battle, any mana<br/>
is precious.<br/>
Your warriors will love that spell though they probably won&#39;t tell you. It<br/>
isn&#39;t a flashy spell that we&#39;re used to but if that mob can hit for 40dmg, 6<br/>
seconds of no hits is heavenly to your tanks and the people who have to heal<br/>
them.<br/>
I only cast it once, resisted or not, just once.<br/>
2) Aren&#39;t resistances fun? Talk about a pain in the ass. I have found<br/>
something to do when we are totally resisted. Cast cancel magic on the mob.<br/>
Very many high level mobs can cast spells, even though you might not know<br/>
it. Cast it once, suddenly the mob stops to recast its buffs. That is what I<br/>
like to call an impromptu stun. I found some mobs that I thought had no<br/>
magical abilities actually do, once their buffs are gone. For some stupid<br/>
reason, they will stop melee to cast.<br/>
Hey, I do what I can... when I can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PART 2. Wizard-only groups.<br/>
The best tag-team you ever seen.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how many of you have tried this, so I will talk as though this<br/>
is a new idea. I am not insulting your intelligence.<br/>
This grouping style gets some serious results but only in open areas. If you<br/>
can find a room that matches my dimensions, go for it.<br/>
These strategies are formations, not really spells. So there is no level<br/>
range for this.<br/>
It is very important that everyone uses the same spell. It is almost as<br/>
important that everyone be the same level. Just don&#39;t attempt this with<br/>
someone who is high enough to use a different set of spells.<br/>
To explain distances and areas, I will use the screen. So be in 1st person<br/>
perspective until you get the hang of it.<br/>
Most Important. I only recommend 1 mob at a time, unless you get really<br/>
advanced skill in the 5-6 wizard grouping.<br/>
I will use groupmembers A, B, C, etc. A is always the puller. For Advanced<br/>
grouping, the last member would be the second puller.<br/>
<br/>
Duo-Wizards or the &#39;I&#39; formation<br/>
This can be used on anything that is the lowest red and lower.<br/>
A goes and gets a mob while B follows him, keeping A in the middle of the<br/>
screen. A finds a mob turns on auto-attack and melees, while B casts a spell<br/>
(shock spell, bolts will be obstructed). Once the spell hits, A turns off<br/>
auto-attack and retreats by walking backwards, while B turns on auto-attack<br/>
and advances. The mob will then decide that B looks like a better choice for<br/>
a meal. Once A has B in the middle of the screen the process continues.<br/>
Repeat as desired.<br/>
If the mob likes someone, have the other person cast spells until the mob<br/>
comes after him. Then return to the normal process.<br/>
<br/>
* The following is strategies that closely resemble a game of &quot;Hot Potato&quot; *<br/>
3 Wizards or the Power Triangle<br/>
A, B, and C run around together until they find a mob. Once someone finds<br/>
something B and C form a line and face each other keeping the other in the<br/>
upper 1/4 of their view screen. A casts and once the spell is completed,<br/>
runs to a point that puts B and C at opposite ends of the screen. Once the<br/>
mob joins up with A and the two are meleeing, B casts the spell. Once the<br/>
mob runs to B and they are meleeing, C casts. Get the picture? It&#39;s fun<br/>
watching the mob run in circles until its dead.<br/>
<br/>
4, 5, and 6 wizards.<br/>
This is the same as the 3 strategy just use Box, Pentagon, and Hexagon<br/>
formations.<br/>
<br/>
* Relates to 3+ groups * If a mob, for whatever reason, sticks to a caster<br/>
have the person who would be next in line root or enstill it (whatever your<br/>
group decides) then the following person cast damage at it and so on. If<br/>
you&#39;re only in a 3 group, skip the person who was stuck with the mob for a<br/>
rotation as well.<br/>
<br/>
The most important thing in the Part 2 strategies is to stay calm. These<br/>
strategies look great on paper, they work trust me, but the real key is<br/>
knowing what to do when something goes wrong. The true strategy lies in<br/>
staying calm and figuring out very quickly how to remedy what went wrong...<br/>
something I am still working on.<br/>
Whatever action you decide to use to fix the problem make sure its the<br/>
caster that is after the guy getting hit that makes the action. Confusion is<br/>
the worst thing in these strategies.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps you learn more about your class. If you have anything to<br/>
add or if there is something I could&#39;ve stated better, please share it.<br/>
I am happy I could help.<br/>
If there is anyone on Karana that is fairly high, I am looking for a few<br/>
items, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck guys,<br/>
