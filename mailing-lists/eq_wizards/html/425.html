<div id="ygrps-yiv-1414185325">I&#39;m a 12th (almost 13th WhoooHooo!) Gnome wizard and I would like to do<br/>
what all Gnomes do best and that is tinker.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else done any tinkering?  What did you make?  Was it hard to<br/>
make, was it useful, were you able to sell it for profit?  Where did you<br/>
get the parts... how did you figure out how to make it?  etc... etc... <br/>
