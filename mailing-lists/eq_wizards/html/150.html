&gt;I am a devouted Wizard.. Don&#39;t get me wrong , but as a reply to Greg<br/>

&gt;I would say:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;All caster class can do as much damage as a wizard until lev 15 at least (I<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I offer up this information from the EQ newsgroups most controversial<br/>
poster, but I believe the information is as good as it gets. I&#39;d like<br/>
to add the questions though that are the other casting classes DD<br/>
spells as mana efficient as the Wizard? I always seem to be able to<br/>
cast many more spells than they can... <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s Anj&#39;s take on the Wiz hope it helps some of you:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The Wizard class in EQ is a hard sell to anyone until<br/>
&gt;they get around level 25 or so. Then you start to really<br/>
&gt;become one of the finest classes to play in EQ. As you<br/>
&gt;level and progress towards that level, you will begin to<br/>
&gt;get a sense of what is possible.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;First, your abjuration, evocation, etc. skills are second to<br/>
&gt;no other class, including Magicians. Your channeling will<br/>
&gt;progress to the point where you cast nearly instantly. The<br/>
&gt;Magician will NEVER get that fast.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, you will use less mana per dmg point than a Magician<br/>
&gt;or any other magic user, and hit with casts for more dmg points<br/>
&gt;as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In the mid- to high twenties you will start to get good, for a pure<br/>
&gt;caster, armor and melee weapons, though melee is only a hobby<br/>
&gt;to your profession of nuclear destruction. You will constantly <br/>
&gt;irritate the walkers, as you will come to call them, by instantly<br/>
&gt;flicking invisible, or across the field in a Shadow Step random<br/>
&gt;port that takes 1 second to cast, or to any of the world&#39;s major<br/>
&gt;zones with but a cast.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sure, you won&#39;t be able to summon food or drink, but I bet the<br/>
&gt;group&#39;s Cleric will give you all you want, since you will be the one<br/>
&gt;protecting her on the back row while she concentrates on the <br/>
&gt;tide of battle and the front row&#39;s health. In fact, you won&#39;t be a <br/>
&gt;good Wizard if you participate in most battles. Your job will be to<br/>
&gt;conserve precious mana for the important casts. The Griffin is<br/>
&gt;about dead but flying out of reach back to 3 other Griffins to get<br/>
&gt;help. CRAAAACCCCKKKKKKK BOOOOOOOMMMMMMM goes<br/>
&gt;the Wizard and the Griff drops without getting away. The Warriors<br/>
&gt;are really glad you&#39;d saved your mana for that big cast.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What I&#39;m saying is the Wiz becomes the nobility of the spell casters.<br/>
&gt;You are an Erudite Wizard, the most awesome of the Wizards. You<br/>
&gt;probably have, what, 140 intelligence? Mana in the 400 range ? One<br/>
&gt;day you will cast Force Bolts over and over in rapid fire and use almost<br/>
&gt;no mana ! Let that goal motivate you !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You will be able to group teleport, a complement to the Cleric&#39;s<br/>
&gt;high level group invulnerability when it becomes necessary to<br/>
&gt;remove the entire group from a disaster in the making. Assume<br/>
&gt;the red dragon is pulverizing your 6 members and you know <br/>
&gt;you will all die. The Cleric steps back, shouts &quot;QUIT FIGHTING&quot;,<br/>
&gt;casts her group divine aura spell, and now the dragon can&#39;t hurt<br/>
&gt;anyone anymore for 30 seconds. The Wiz jumps up, and starts<br/>
&gt;a group teleport spell to, say, Greater Faydark Gate. When the<br/>
&gt;gate holds, the invulnerable spell fades, but you are gone from <br/>
&gt;the dragon&#39;s grasp anyway. See the potential ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Nothing packs the punch of a high level Wizard. The ONLY solo<br/>
&gt;kill of a Giant with witnesses and screenshots was a Wizard as<br/>
&gt;far as I know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
