<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291783646">About that research not raising..I read this on the Mytherian Tower<br/>
research site. Remember how you could only put ONE point in at lvl 16 well<br/>
once you hit lvl 20 (something to do with that spell circle) you can then<br/>
pump many more points into it from your guildmaster. And then each level<br/>
thereafter. My guess would be you will get no increase until this magical<br/>
level.<br/>

&gt; Well, I made level 16 last night so I decided to try research for the<br/>
&gt; first time.  I had been collecting runes for a while, so I had a sizable<br/>
&gt; collection in the bank.  Just thought I would share the results.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Project Lightning - I had enough runes to attempt this spell twice.  The<br/>
&gt; first attempt failed, the second one succeeded!  My first spell!  Ok, 1<br/>
&gt; out of 2 is not bad.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Pillar of Fire - Well, I only had one rune of nagafen, so I could only<br/>
&gt; attempt this one once.  It failed.  Now at 1 of 3 attempts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Identify - Now I had heard this spell was useless, but I figured I still<br/>
&gt; wanted to play with research.  I had enough runes to attempt this spell<br/>
&gt; 4 times.  I had 3 failures and a success on the fourth try.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Total success rate:  2 out of 7 tries.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure if the research skill ever goes up, mine did not.  Does the<br/>
&gt; skill raise?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                                                 See you all onlinge,<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;                                                         16th Level<br/>
