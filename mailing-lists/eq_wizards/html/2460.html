<b>Subject:</b> JewelCrafter&#39;s Jewellery and what they are worth. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-198793932">I really appreciate &quot;Wizard&#39;s&quot; attempt to show us what we will look like<br/>
when we are 50.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is important to look at what jewelcrafters have to offer.<br/>
( I am only including what is important to us Wizards)<br/>
<br/>
(All of this is enchanted)<br/>
<br/>
StarRoseQuartz (INT) - Silver = +2 Ring - Cost = 1p5g5s<br/>
			     Electrum = +2 Necklace - Cost = 3p7g5s<br/>
			     Gold = +4 Necklace - Cost = 12p5g5s<br/>
			     Platinum = +4 Ring - Cost = 111p5g5s<br/>
  Jade (Mana/HP/AC)  - Silver = +5/+5/+1 Ring - Cost = 4p1g8s<br/>
                       Electrum = +10/+10/+2 Bracelet - Cost = 6p3g8s<br/>
                       Gold = +15/+15/+3 Bracelet - Cost = 14p6g8s<br/>
                       Platinum = +20/+20/+4 Ring - Cost = 113p6g8s<br/>
 Sapphire (STR/INT)  - Silver = +4/+4 Necklace - Cost = 111p5g<br/>
                       Electrum = +4/+2 Earring - Cost = 113p7g<br/>
                       Gold =  +2/+4 Earring - Cost = 122p<br/>
                       Platinum = +7/+7 Necklace - Cost 221p<br/>
( The cost for Sapphire is derived from the merchants&#39; prices for the jewel.<br/>
Of course, it is far cheaper to find them.)<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to let everyone know what the wholesale cost of these articles<br/>
are.</div>
