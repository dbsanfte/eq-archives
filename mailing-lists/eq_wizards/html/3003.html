<div id="ygrps-yiv-275039152">I have a problems with expresing god with enlish as im italian :) but i see<br/>
that you have seen some wrong points in my post i wished not to talk about<br/>
twinking but i used twinking to show that items have havy influence on<br/>
combat abilitys of mele classes, and much lesser impact on casting class.<br/>
So this was only whan example of what impact have high lv items.<br/>
<br/>
This influence creates superflue some caster clases in group as mele and<br/>
wisdom based casters with more aviably powerfull items get much stronger<br/>
then similar lv casters wich in conseguance of this are not so necesary in<br/>
groups. <br/>
<br/>
If a fighter start to hit for 160 dmg in turn against my 170 spell i think<br/>
he will go alone with cleric and will not need caster to finish a runner!<br/>
You as a caster will get in group only if you have some friends or are not<br/>
in for exp, wich many people will say is not important BUT... <br/>
<br/>
Already noe is a problem to group with any group wich have more then 3 lv<br/>
over you as they will probably fight something what hit resistance barier<br/>
!! i wish to note that you can group with 6 8 lv diference and still get<br/>
exp but you as alwas resisted to things for them white will not be much useful.<br/>

&gt;According to Wizard:<br/>
&gt;&gt; I realy only can see that you are in bad mode maybe you can think a bit<br/>
&gt;&gt; before replying, and if you dont have to say anything useful take a break.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Only useful was that you say about your warrior at 3 lv but other things<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, I apologise if I seem a little harsh, but the gist of the argument is<br/>
&gt;usually the same: unless you are in a competition with other players by<br/>
&gt;the game &quot;physics&quot;, you are only in competition in your own mind. That&#39;s<br/>
&gt;not a competition one &quot;wins&quot;. You do not get brownie points by being<br/>
&gt;able to take a mob N levels above your normal and expected target, except<br/>
&gt;if you are in a race to level. EQ is not a race. I laugh at people that<br/>
&gt;strut and show off their rubicite and barbed leather whip at level 3, as<br/>
&gt;if that was somehow an &quot;achivement&quot;. It may be, for you. Not for me,<br/>
&gt;and there&#39;s no &quot;objective&quot; (within the game context) measure that says so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are three kind of imbalances that &quot;require&quot; correction:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;An imbalance that prevents you from adventuring and getting in a group<br/>
&gt;(&quot;we can&#39;t solo&quot; is not an imbalance; EQ&#39;s target is groups, not solo)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;An imbalanbce that prevents you from leveling and getting in a rgoup<br/>
&gt;with people you want to group with.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;An imbalance that make a class so unplayable or so easy that people<br/>
&gt;will avoid that class or rush to that class.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The whole twinking issue does not really fall into these categories. It<br/>
&gt;might, marginally, be relevant to 2; if you begin a twinked wizard in<br/>
&gt;order to level with a twinked warrior friend, you&#39;d level slower...<br/>
&gt;if you both solo of course.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; are realy dont help any discusion and your tone is realy arogant.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Again, I apologise, but after a while, one gets tired of the &quot;grass is<br/>
&gt;greener on the other side&quot; recurring arguments. Here, and in other<br/>
&gt;classes lists.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The twink problem is a non-problem. Or would you expect a warrior to<br/>
&gt;require as few equipment, compared to a wizard of the same level, to<br/>
&gt;achieve the same efficiency? After all, the warrior does not have to<br/>
&gt;spend all that plat on our spells (and us wizards get off lightly in<br/>
&gt;that domain, compared to some other casting classes). Where else do<br/>
&gt;you expect him to spend plat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The only difference is, we cannot twink a wizard with our previously<br/>
&gt;known spells. Alas.<br/>
