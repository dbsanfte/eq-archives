<div id="ygrps-yiv-97668377"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I wish I knew!  I am lvl six and find myself getting killed<br/>
&gt; a lot by lions<br/>
&gt; and even wolves sometimes.  If I don&#39;t time it right, if<br/>
&gt; root doesn&#39;t take,<br/>
&gt; or if I get a train I am dead.  Please let me know what<br/>
&gt; your thoughts are<br/>
&gt; and/or how you made it throught 6 to 7.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First of all, if those are the lions and wolves in West Karanas, that<br/>
might be a little too tough for you at that level.  In a group it<br/>
might be possible, but alone I would leave the adult lions alone.<br/>
Secondly, a good way to get white and yellow mobs without too much<br/>
risk is to play near a guard tower or zone border.  That way you can<br/>
run for safety if things get too hairy (or if Root fails).<br/>
