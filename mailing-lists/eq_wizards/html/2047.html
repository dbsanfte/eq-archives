<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-553649852">Well, I made level 16 last night so I decided to try research for the<br/>
first time.  I had been collecting runes for a while, so I had a sizable<br/>
collection in the bank.  Just thought I would share the results.<br/>
<br/>
Project Lightning - I had enough runes to attempt this spell twice.  The<br/>
first attempt failed, the second one succeeded!  My first spell!  Ok, 1<br/>
out of 2 is not bad.<br/>
<br/>
Pillar of Fire - Well, I only had one rune of nagafen, so I could only<br/>
attempt this one once.  It failed.  Now at 1 of 3 attempts.<br/>
<br/>
Identify - Now I had heard this spell was useless, but I figured I still<br/>
wanted to play with research.  I had enough runes to attempt this spell<br/>
4 times.  I had 3 failures and a success on the fourth try.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Total success rate:  2 out of 7 tries.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if the research skill ever goes up, mine did not.  Does the<br/>
skill raise?<br/>
<br/>
                                                See you all onlinge,<br/>
<br/>
