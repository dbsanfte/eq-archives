<div id="ygrps-yiv-210566415">Wow what a long thread.  I haven&#39;t found many runes either.  I <br/>
found one WAY back at the beginning and hadn&#39;t a clue one what it was <br/>
for.  Of course after I accidentally sold it in a pack to a vendor I found <br/>
out ... oh well...it was one I wish I had now.  Isn&#39;t that the way it <br/>
always runs?<br/>
         What I do to acquire runes is this, when grouped with people first <br/>
thing, I state I would appreciate if runes are found people let me have the <br/>
opportunity to purchase them or they share and I will likewise share any <br/>
items I get for loot that they want.  I can&#39;t use the big bronze swords and <br/>
other warrior/larger class type items..so we do a straight across trade or <br/>
I pay a plat or something for the rune, so they get something and feel good <br/>
about it too.  It is far less than I would pay at a vendor and its <br/>
generally more than they would get were they to sell to a vendor.  It works <br/>
out well...everyone ends up happy in the end, and most times we get good <br/>
exp too :)<br/>
         I do have one question...this may seem obvious for some, but where <br/>
do I find the tome to combine the spell components?   I hail from Neriak <br/>
and I have probably just missed it.  I would appreciate if anyone knows <br/>
where to find this item, please post for the dork here so I can start my <br/>
spell creation...hopefully...all the comments about the slow skill raising <br/>
that goes on makes me leery but I have to try it anyway :)<br/>

&gt;I have only found about 2 runes, I am level 23...  so you aren&#39;t unlucky,<br/>
&gt;just aren&#39;t many out there...  I have also found a lot of pages and words,<br/>
