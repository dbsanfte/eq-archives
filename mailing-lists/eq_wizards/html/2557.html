<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947801123">we are usually one rank ahead of the rest of the classes as far as dd goes.<br/>
the druids lvl 29 dd spell does about the same dmg as our lvl 20 and 24<br/>
spells (force/frost shock).  the enchanters lvl 24 spell does less than our<br/>
lvl 20 spell.  and also keep in mind that other classes dmg/mana ratio is<br/>
not near as efficient as the wizards.  the wizards spells can also be cast<br/>
much quicker :)  i can only speak of other classes up to about lvl 29,<br/>
because i havent grouped with anybody higher, or havent had first hand<br/>
knowledge of higher lvl spells.  with that being said, i dont think that a<br/>
magician gets a spell that does 950 dmg.  i think most of the classes dd<br/>
spells max out at around 500 to 550 at lvl 49 (which is a little lower than<br/>
what our lvl 44 dd spells do).  please correct me if i&#39;m wrong tho :)<br/>

ps. pets are highly overrated at higher lvls because of the grouping<br/>
requirements and the limited hunting areas...  and in a big group in a<br/>
dungeon, u pretty much put the pets back in ur spell books :)<br/>

&gt;I know that the purpose of the wizard class is to do heavy damage quickly.<br/>
&gt;A friend of mine was telling me that mages do almost the same damage plus<br/>
&gt;they have a pet to fight for them.  He does close dmg to me now at lvl 20.<br/>
&gt;He says at lvl 49 mages do lava bolt which does 950 whereas ice comet does<br/>
&gt;1100.  That is almost the same damage as the wizard.  So it seems to me<br/>
&gt;that there isn&#39;t much of a use to be a wizard if you can be a mage and do<br/>
&gt;almost the same amount of direct damage plus you have a pet.  So anyone<br/>
&gt;tell me something good about the wiz class to make it worth playing them to<br/>
&gt;high levels?<br/>
