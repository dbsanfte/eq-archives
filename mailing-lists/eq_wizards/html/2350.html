<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526075669">We are in complete agreement here, but it has only been 3 months since the game was<br/>
released.  You know as well as I do that it will be quite some time before they iron out<br/>
some of the more nasty bugs.  I personally don&#39;t think its too wrong for them to ask you to<br/>
stop doing something that they consider an exploit.  Just my opinion, nothing more.  Since<br/>
this is getting way off topic I&#39;ll stop responding to this thread now before it gets way<br/>
out of hand.<br/>

&gt; to come fix it some time? Ever see a car that only turns left with a promise to come fix<br/>
&gt; it some time? No. This happens only in computer software, especially high profile games.<br/>
