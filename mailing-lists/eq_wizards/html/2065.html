&lt;&lt;Maybe it&#39;s just a quirk of my character&#39;s nature - but if I&#39;m grouped,<br/>
there is never mana left for an emergency Gate.  I can&#39;t bring myself to<br/>
Gate-out on my Tanks - even in the most hopeless of situations, so we all<br/>
die together.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I play my shadow knight and my group is deep in befallen on the 3rd <br/>
floor and all the sudden I get hit by 6 greater skeletons, 3 necro thero, 2 <br/>
ice bones, 3 ghouls etc etc, I see that as the party leader this train is <br/>
going to run over our asses.  So I yell RUN and stand my ground to the death. <br/>
 If my wizards did not take the time to gate out I would be pissed.  I am <br/>
willing to die so that you might escape to have everyone die is a waste.  The <br/>
rule of thumb should be based on your group.  If you are all friends and work <br/>
well together then you should know when to gate and when not to.  If you gate <br/>
and your leader hasn&#39;t given the run command then your are a coward.  Every <br/>
party needs a leader, usually a paladin or tank is best for this position.  <br/>
Since they know how much they can take.  As long as magic users keep everyone <br/>
informed on mana with &quot;LOM or OOM OOM&quot; then the group should work out fine.  <br/>
So basically I think you should Gate only when you get the command in battle, <br/>
or your leader is dead and the rest are running.</div>
