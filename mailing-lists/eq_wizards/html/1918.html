&gt; &gt;&gt;don&#39;t. As I said, life is tough like that. EQ doesn&#39;t stand for equal,<br/>

If you (or anyone else) claim that all characters on Norrath at the same<br/>
level should be equal, please prove it.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, there is no indication that it should be so.<br/>

What I was trying to say was that it&#39;s a judgment call.  The original<br/>
speaker said that all characters at the same level should have the same<br/>
chance of competing.  You said that life is not like that.  My response was<br/>
that EQ doesn&#39;t have to be like life.  That is perfectly logical.  I don&#39;t<br/>
think your analogy denies the validity of the speaker&#39;s claim.<br/>
<br/>
You are trying to say that such a claim needs proof.  I say, no it doesn&#39;t.<br/>
I can just as well say that you need to prove that character&#39;s at the same<br/>
level SHOULDN&#39;T have the same chance of competing.  And if you can&#39;t, then<br/>
there is no indication that it should be so.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t a question of proof.  This is a judgment call.  To me, this means<br/>
that there is no basis for judgment without the designers&#39; input.  If THEY<br/>
wanted the characters to have the same chance of competing, then so be it.<br/>
If they didn&#39;t, so be it.  There is no proof here one way or the other.<br/>
Only opinion.</div>
