<b>Subject:</b> Re: Stein of Moggok Bug <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1345193090">I know there was a bug along these lines, but Verant<br/>
claimed they had it fixed. Basically, if you were<br/>
charmed, non-weapons you had equipped in your primary<br/>
hand would, at times, mutate like this. If you managed<br/>
to escape, you could prove it had happened due to a<br/>
bug, since you&#39;d have something un-equippable (like,<br/>
say, an Emerald) equipped.<br/>
<br/>
If this was recent (i.e. past couple of weeks), I&#39;d<br/>
definitely /bug it.<br/>
