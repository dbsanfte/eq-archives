<div id="ygrps-yiv-603126157">You need to take it to the warriors guild in Kaladim.  You also must improve<br/>
your faction with the dwarves for them to even consider you worthy to<br/>
complete the quest.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Hey as a wizard I have always run from Corflunk, but last night I saw him<br/>
coming down the path at me and I was all alone, but I said &quot;What the hell I<br/>
am 12th now!&quot;<br/>
and I kicked his tail.   Even melee!! Like 3 shock of lighnting and a few<br/>
staff blows and DEAD ogre.  hehe he hardly touched me!   Anyway where do I<br/>
need to go now that I have his head?   I mean where do I get the quest?<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks<br/>
 <br/>
P.S.  I love Shock of lightning!</div>
