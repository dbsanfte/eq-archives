<div id="ygrps-yiv-1878480566">Has anyone had any luck with the gnome wizard spare telescope lens quest?<br/>
�<br/>
I have talked to all 4 of the people. 2 say they have none at this time, the<br/>
other 2 send you on subquests.<br/>
�<br/>
The subquests aren&#39;t too much problem, as I know where to find the dark elf<br/>
that has the lens I need and the other is simply a matter of freeing the<br/>
right slave (I think... it may be more complicated than that, but I haven&#39;t<br/>
tried it yet)<br/>
�<br/>
My question is how do you get the other 2 to give you the lens? Other than<br/>
&quot;come back in a few weeks&quot; I haven&#39;t been able to get anything out of them.</div>
