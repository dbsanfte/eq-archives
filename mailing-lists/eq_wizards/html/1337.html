 </span></blockquote>True... but to be honest it is hard to find a group and get the rythm down<br/>
unless you have HOURS of contigous play time.  ( a little solo is not a bad<br/>
thing, and i never expect lots of exp from solo.  I would just like to do it<br/>
when I have to be without being afraid of my shadow)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Very true in a group I never feel weak. (except for med time)  It is just<br/>
hard watching others pass me by in levels because we are Wizards and then I<br/>
can&#39;t even solo to catch up.<br/>
