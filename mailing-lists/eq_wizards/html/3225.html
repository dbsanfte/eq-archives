<div id="ygrps-yiv-99039149">1) Cubert doesn&#39;t spawn all the time<br/>
2) He doesn&#39;t always carry the quest item<br/>
3) When you bring the item to the NPC..he doesn&#39;t always give you the<br/>
earring.<br/>
<br/>
How irritating is that?  Is this supposed to be fun? ;)<br/>

Yep, this is similar to camping the Journeyman&#39;s Boots.  The NPC doesnt<br/>
always spawn and when she does, she doesn&#39;t always have the boots.  In my<br/>
opinion, it would be better for us all if this wasn&#39;t the case.  Not<br/>
everyone has 18 to 20 hours to spend online in one room hoping to get the<br/>
item they want.  This is of course complicated by things like going linkdead<br/>
and possibly loosing your place in line.</div>
