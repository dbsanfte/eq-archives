<div id="ygrps-yiv-112088368">I like it!  And say &quot;hey&quot; sometime to me and I will gladly group with <br/>
you.  I play Veeshan as well as a DE Wiz and will shortly hit level 15 and <br/>
hopefully 16 this weekend...can you say &quot;new spells&quot; - finally!  My name as <br/>
my wizard is Alaia.  I am currently working Oasis and pulling my exp. up <br/>
there quite nicely.  That is if the Sand Giants don&#39;t stomp me first!  So, <br/>
give a /tell sometime if you are on with your wiz and want a group to hang <br/>
with, I will gladly drag you in and get you some good exp. too.<br/>

&gt;Hi Robert and evryone else<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I can understand your frustration and i have been there to, want to know <br/>
&gt;what i did ?. I started an Dwarf Paladin couse i want to be able to have <br/>
&gt;magic, i playd him almost 20 hours and got him up to lv 10.<br/>
&gt;I think that Paladin�s are a great class but when i came back to my Wizard <br/>
&gt;again and evrything was fun again, i got him leveld u from 16 to 19 and <br/>
&gt;now that feeling comes over me again.<br/>
&gt;I  have so hard finding any XP by myself or find a group to get XP in, i <br/>
&gt;have been to unrest but i dont like that place. Either your in a strong <br/>
&gt;group there and you don get much in XP or you are in a group around the <br/>
&gt;same level so you have to zone sometimes with the result it takes ages to <br/>
&gt;regroup and get back to the killing of undeads.<br/>
&gt;I have been Lv 19 so long now i cant take much more of this so i will play <br/>
&gt;my Paladin for a while i think and wait for the feeling for my litle gnome <br/>
&gt;wizard to get back, it always does so i�m not worried about that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hmmmm that was not what i intended to write in the first place :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Wizards are fun to play!!!!<br/>

&gt; &gt;Well, I&#39;m finally going to break down and seriously play a spellcasting<br/>
&gt; &gt;class.  Of course due to the raw power of the class, as well as the<br/>
&gt; &gt;versatility of teleportation, Wizards are my first choice.  I realize that<br/>
&gt; &gt;people have most likely time and again requested spell lists, but here I <br/>
&gt; am,<br/>
&gt; &gt;brand spanking new to the list.  I was wondering if perhaps some nice soul<br/>
&gt; &gt;out there might be able to send me a complete list.  I&#39;ve checked EQLizer,<br/>
&gt; &gt;EQVault, and EQstratics and none of them have every spell, thanks in <br/>
&gt; advance<br/>
&gt; &gt;everyone.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;----------------------------<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;m a 14th level wizard on E&#39;Ci. David, if I may be honest here, I would<br/>
&gt; &gt;like to suggest that if you want to have fun playing a spellcaster, pick<br/>
&gt; &gt;about anything other than Wizard. Enchanters get pets and can make magical<br/>
&gt; &gt;items. If I were to start over and pick a pure mage class, that would be <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt;one I&#39;d go with.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;*ducks flameage*<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&lt;rant mode&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Let me explain - Verant hasn&#39;t implemented specialization skills or the<br/>
&gt; &gt;alternate planes, we have almost nothing for armor or hitpoints, our melee<br/>
&gt; &gt;skills are pathetic and our powers don&#39;t become greater than other classes<br/>
&gt; &gt;until 40-somethingth level. Plus, the single greatest way of leveling up -<br/>
&gt; &gt;killing har red mobs - is unavailable to us, because our spells are often<br/>
&gt; &gt;resisted completely by these creatures. So, instead of grouping with<br/>
&gt; &gt;powerful warriors to beat up on mobs that will actually give EVERYONE in <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt;group decent experience, we&#39;re relegated to trying to solo weak blues or<br/>
&gt; &gt;fight white and yellow creatures in a group for pitiful experience because<br/>
&gt; &gt;WE CAN&#39;T TOUCH HARD MOBS LIKE EVERY OTHER CLASS CAN!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve watched every group I&#39;ve run with pass me up in level. I&#39;ve watched<br/>
&gt; &gt;characters started while I was at level 12 PASS ME at level 13. It&#39;s not as<br/>
&gt; &gt;though I never play, it&#39;s just that I CANNOT GAIN MORE THAN HALF A BUBBLE<br/>
&gt; &gt;EXP PER HOUR, on average. That&#39;s powergaming, soloing in the Karanas vs.<br/>
&gt; &gt;blue beetles and the occasional white/yellow.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Needless to say, I&#39;m very frustrated in playing this class right now. The<br/>
&gt; &gt;only reason I remain a Wizard is stubbornness. Everyone says it gets better<br/>
&gt; &gt;at higher levels, but the fact of the matter is that we&#39;ll always be a<br/>
&gt; &gt;second-rate class unless Verant fixes specialization, plane travel and<br/>
&gt; &gt;spell-resistances of higher-level mobs.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&lt;/rant mode&gt;<br/>
