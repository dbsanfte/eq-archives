<b>Subject:</b> PvP BIND AFFINITY y/n?? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-943851540">I wish UO had not poisoned my mind so much against PvP, but it was just<br/>
heinous.  Most UO PKers didn&#39;t even kill you in character, it was like &quot;HE<br/>
*&*$^&$  YOU ARE DEAD F*&%ER YOU SUCK blah blah blah&quot;<br/>
<br/>
   And what if someone (not you Iggie) was just being a jerk and decided to<br/>
bind you somewhere that you didn&#39;t want bound???<br/>
For now I am happy w/ the way they have it, and I think the PvP server and<br/>
arena etc. .  .   are proof that they are not allienating you.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!     I hope you find what you are looking for.  :-)<br/>

&gt;     Whoa. Hold on there, Iggie didn&#39;t say YOU, he said that there are a<br/>
lot<br/>
&gt; of +pvp players that are jerks. There are also a ton of -pvp players that<br/>
&gt; are jerks as well. I&#39;ll tell you about Elyas the loser Paladin on Solusek<br/>
Ro<br/>
&gt; sometime. Enabling +pvp or -pvp is a choice you make, and because Verant<br/>
has<br/>
&gt; decided to offer you this choice, it is also up to them to protect players<br/>
&gt; that don&#39;t share a +pvp view. They&#39;ve given you &#39;free zones&#39; where<br/>
even -pvp<br/>
&gt; players are fair game, they&#39;ve given you an entire +pvp server. I don&#39;t<br/>
see<br/>
&gt; what more they can offer? Are thee bugs, yes that&#39;s true, but I think that<br/>
&gt; fixing global bugs that affect everyone will be more of a priority than<br/>
bugs<br/>
&gt; that affect a single class. So you have restrictions that I do not have as<br/>
&gt; a -pvp wizard. It was your choice, so live with it. Learn to get around<br/>
it,<br/>
&gt; and I&#39;m sure that you&#39;ll have a much better experience for it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     You also have to remember that it&#39;s THEIR world  you&#39;re in, so you<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; to conform to them, they don&#39;t have to conform to you, even though a lot<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; player suggestions have been implemented. I&#39;m still waiting for a patch<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; will save the choice of how I view servers. Why would anyone want to view<br/>
by<br/>
&gt; number of players once you&#39;ve created and levelled your characters is a<br/>
&gt; mystery to me. : )<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Try and remember that there&#39;s nothing that they&#39;ve done is to be<br/>
&gt; intentionally harmful to the -pvp class, but given a choice the majority<br/>
has<br/>
&gt; to rule, and that majority is -pvp. Their priorities concerning +pvp will<br/>
&gt; always come first. However, non combat spells you should be able to cast<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; others. Bind Affinity, O&#39;Keils radiation, Invisibility, great spells, and<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m behind you 110% in that you should be able to use them on others. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; sure they&#39;ll change it in the future, but how long depends on how hard it<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; to code.<br/>

&gt; &gt;There you have it, even players say &quot;screw you, +PvP people.  You aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;worthy of a good game experience.&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; Actually I don&#39;t believe it was done to make PVP players harder but to<br/>
&gt; &gt;protect<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; those who choose not to PVP.  I can understand why you say these things<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; make your lives harder tho.  However, I have to say that I support<br/>
Verant<br/>
&gt; &gt;on this<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; one.. there are just too many jerks out there who give PVP a bad name<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; their antics.<br/>
