<div id="ygrps-yiv-2091574293">Hello all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading the discussion on shadow step & gate over the past few<br/>
digests and thought I&#39;d comment on this.  First, if you&#39;re gonna assign<br/>
shadow step to a quick-key, BE CAREFUL... more than once I&#39;ve hit it<br/>
accidentally and ended up in a bad bad bad situation.  Oh, and for those<br/>
of you who haven&#39;t had the chance to experience it.. YES shadow step WILL<br/>
teleport you out over open water and dump you in the ocean.  My last<br/>
experience with this sent me a good 50 or 60 yards out into the ocean, and<br/>
to make matters worse, it placed me on a SEA FLOOR.  Talk about a panic<br/>
attack, you wouldn&#39;t believe how DEEP the ocean is in some places!  I<br/>
didn&#39;t think I was gonna make it to the surface for a while there.<br/>
Needless to say, accidental ocean teleports have dumped me into icky<br/>
confrontations with sharks as well, not too much fun at early levels.<br/>
<br/>
As for shadow step & gate combos.  I typically have had zero success with<br/>
this, although last night my group of 5 got split up and hammered by a<br/>
bunch of bandits, and with 2 remaining comrades down to less than one<br/>
bubble each, I decided it was time to exit stage left... hit the shadow<br/>
step, got interrupted, hit it again and managed to cast.. bandits followed<br/>
and whooped on me some more, got another shadow step off, this time it<br/>
seems i only held the attention of the magic-user bandits, so I was able<br/>
to kick off a Gate before anything else could interrupt me.  Needless to<br/>
say, I was outta breath.  :)  Shadow step is SO unpredictable that it<br/>
really doesn&#39;t make all the great of an escape tool.. ESPECIALLY if you<br/>
are in an area where you don&#39;t know your way around.. if you cast and<br/>
fail, especially more than once, your sense of direction and location or<br/>
often screwed and you&#39;ll have a REAL tough time finding your corpse.  (I<br/>
made this mistake while being eaten alive by pirhanas in the river between<br/>
Toxxula Forest and Kerra Isle.  A few shadow steps + that sickening yellow<br/>
fog + endless stretches of water in every direction.. lets just say I was<br/>
thankful for a weird corpse bug that tossed my (invisible to me) corpse on<br/>
the riverbank, so I was able to have someone else loot it for me.<br/>
<br/>
Did I mention I love this game?  :)<br/>
