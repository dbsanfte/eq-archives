<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960815444">I have personally saw it in South Ro, but only once out of many times there.<br/>
I would guess it rotates spawn zones or something strange like that.<br/>
Friends have seen it in OOT, Oasis and others.<br/>

game.  Give me a tell if you see me Askur.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, can anybody here confirm that there IS such a thing as an Ancient<br/>
Cyclops that wanders S. Ro?   Nobody I know has ever seen it.  I went there<br/>
last night and asked around...nobody there knew either.  Trying to find that<br/>
ring off of it for JBoots.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, Shock Spiral of Al&#39;Kabor isn&#39;t bad.  I finally tried some AE<br/>
against those deepwater goblin pets.  113 dmg for all MoBs around me and it<br/>
didn&#39;t seem to ever get interrupted despite getting whacked at from 3 or 4<br/>
Mobs at once.  I like how it kicks back a little too...keeps you out of the<br/>
fray for a while longer.  You guys who use AE might be on to something<br/>
here.....   ;)<br/>
