<b>Subject:</b> A wizards message board? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-85322458">There seems to be enough people to participate in this, would everyone like<br/>
me to setup a wizards message board?  Then all the email boxes can breathe<br/>
easy?  And we can still ask all the questions we want?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It would just be a simple board, using WWWBoard or something like that.<br/>
<br/>
