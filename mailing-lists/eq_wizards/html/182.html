&gt; Hail and well met adventurers, this is Eantos of the Crafter of New Vision<br/>
Guild. As I have seen numerous post I will be covering a few topics in this<br/>
E-mail. First, up the topic of armor.<br/>
&gt; I personaly know of a Quest with Baobob and Chanda Miller infront of<br/>
Surefall glade. To get the great items made by these NPCs all one has to do<br/>
is raise you faction with them a little bit (kill bandits in Karana plains,<br/>
or gnolls in Splitpaw). Then target them and say phrases as &quot;what belt?&quot;,<br/>
&quot;what boots&quot;, and &quot;what cloak&quot;. They&#39;ll be sure to tell you the rest. The<br/>
armor they made is wearable by everyone, and is the same AC as chainmail<br/>
armor. Truely a wizards best friend. The seond topic I would like to address<br/>
is weapons.<br/>
&gt; Personaly I have a great lust for two-handed weapons, and just recently<br/>
last night I found the secret to acquiring one of the most powerfull<br/>
two-handed staffs I have seen around. The name of the staff is the &quot;Runed<br/>
Totem Staff&quot;. This staff usualy has a street price of 35 to 55 plat. To<br/>
acquire this staff, you must  travel to Splitpaw dungeon (in South Karana).<br/>
After you arrive at Splitpaw you must get together a tough group of level<br/>
12s and higher, then travel down into the depths of the dungeon and find a<br/>
NPC named &quot;Shaman Ren Rex&quot;. He puts up a good fight but gives out a staff<br/>
every 10th time he spawns or so. Also I have timed his spawning to<br/>
approximately 17 minutes. So, run around, kill him and come back in 17<br/>
minutes for him later....Well thats all that time I have right now. I&#39;ll be<br/>
back with some more information soon....<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; By the way, stats on Runed Totem Staff, +5 mana, +5 hitpoints, damage of<br/>
9, delay of 37. (better than Great staff that sells in stores for 25 plat)<br/>
