<div id="ygrps-yiv-263734605">Hail and well met adventurers, this is Eantos of the Crafter of New Vision Guild. As I have seen numerous post I will be covering a few topics in this E-mail. First, up the topic of armor.<br/>
I personaly know of a Quest with Baobob and Chanda Miller infront of Surefall glade. To get the great items made by these NPCs all one has to do is raise you faction with them a little bit (kill bandits in Karana plains, or gnolls in Splitpaw). Then target them and say phrases as &quot;what belt?&quot;, &quot;what boots&quot;, and &quot;what cloak&quot;. They&#39;ll be sure to tell you the rest. The armor they made is wearable by everyone, and is the same AC as chainmail armor. Truely a wizards best friend. The seond topic I would like to address is weapons.<br/>
Personaly I have a great lust for two-handed weapons, and just recently last night I found the secret to acquiring one of the most powerfull two-handed staffs I have seen around. The name of the staff is the &quot;Runed Totem Staff&quot;. This staff usualy has a street price of 35 to 55 plat. To acquire this staff, you must  travel to Splitpaw dungeon (in South Karana). After you arrive at Splitpaw you must get together a tough group of level 12s and higher, then travel down into the depths of the dungeon and find a NPC named &quot;Shaman Ren Rex&quot;. He puts up a good fight but gives out a staff every 10th time he spawns or so. Also I have timed his spawning to approximately 17 minutes. So, run around, kill him and come back in 17 minutes for him later....Well thats all that time I have right now. I&#39;ll be back with some more information soon....<br/>

By the way, stats on Runed Totem Staff, +5 mana, +5 hitpoints, damage of 9, delay of 37. (better than Great staff that sells in stores for 25 plat)</div>
