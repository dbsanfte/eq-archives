<div id="ygrps-yiv-2132740494">I&#39;m working on compiling a list of all known Wizard spells, with<br/>
descriptions and preferrably with notations on the researched spells,<br/>
plus the cities where the spells can bought? Most sites that I&#39;ve seen<br/>
only go up to level 29. And I can&#39;t get to Gameznet for some reason...<br/>
<br/>
Basically my goal is to make the most comprehensive list anywhere that<br/>
other Wizards will find useful.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to e-mail me the information directly then that would be<br/>
fine. I&#39;ll make sure to post it as soon as I get enough information.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>
