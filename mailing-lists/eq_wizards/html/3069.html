<div id="ygrps-yiv-362012276">Yeah i see what ya mean, but i dont think Veerant will go that way. better then to tune up our AE spells. Like if we cast it on a tank and say the spells hit 3 MOBs if you do this after a few hits all the ones that the tank dosent hit on will go for you right ! i would like to have it that all the agro goes on the tank, it should realy be this way from the begining i think couse it there opinion it�s the tank who hits them. Just like damage shields!!<br/>
<br/>
And maybe lower the resistance on AE spells, say like 8 or 10 levels above the caster.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Veerant will never aprove of this, this is Enchanters  teritory and the<br/>
&gt; will never. I think that it�s a good ide�or something like it but they just<br/>
&gt; wont.<br/>
&gt; &gt; And yes something has to be done to wizards atraction to groups, most of<br/>
&gt; my life up to lv 25 has been like: Logs on to EQ, any friends on - sometimes<br/>
&gt; yes, but most of my friends are powerleveling so i�m far behind them and<br/>
&gt; cant group, anything to solo and not get killed more then i can bare - NO,<br/>
&gt; ok trying to get a group . NO WAY most of the times, any nice quests to do<br/>
&gt; and get a nice item annd or some nice XP - NO.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well one problem for me is that i cant play on regular basis, my work<br/>
&gt; prevents it so one week i can play evry night and level quite nice about 1<br/>
&gt; level/night or close to it. But that i cant play for a week or 2 and when i<br/>
&gt; come back all those i grouped with are to high again. So i need to find some<br/>
&gt; new friends and convince them of that not all wizards are killstealers and<br/>
&gt; bad ppl.<br/>
&gt; &gt; It gets frustrating over time and now i�m at the point where i rather play<br/>
&gt; something else then EQ, AC or Homeworld mostley.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hmm i bit of a rant there but as you can see, if wizards where more sought<br/>
&gt; after for groups then it would be much easier for all us wizards in Norrath.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh yes, definately.  Grouping is probably the number one problem.  I<br/>
&gt; disagree though about the &quot;Enchanter Territory&quot; bit.  First off, if you look<br/>
&gt; at my original post, you&#39;ll note that the formulation I posted *required* an<br/>
&gt; enchanter to be carried out.  So it enhances both classes.  (Another<br/>
&gt; suggestion I received from a friend was to allow summoned weapons to be<br/>
&gt; similarly &quot;charged,&quot; thus allowing magicians, enchanters, and wizards to all<br/>
&gt; participate in the weapon charging procedure.  And I could give you a half<br/>
&gt; dozen alternate formulations.)  At any rate, I&#39;m not personally attached to<br/>
&gt; the idea, but I&#39;d like to see if others like this one or have alternate<br/>
&gt; strategies in mind.  Wizards need *something* to make them more valuable for<br/>
&gt; grouping as I see it.  The DD and AE spells just don&#39;t cut it.  The desired<br/>
&gt; spell casters are the healers and the buffers.  Healing seems to remote.<br/>
&gt; Buffing in some fashion???  &lt;shrug&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Suggestions anyone?<br/>
