It looks like the situation is pretty bad, and the people at Verant just<br/>
don&#39;t give a damn.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we should do something. Maybe a mass petition or something, because it<br/>
looks like they don&#39;t even understand how the game works, and the difference<br/>
between grouping and soloing. I almost get the feeling they just listened to<br/>
the complaints in beta and gave no thought of their own to the outcome. Then<br/>
when beta ended, we&#39;re screwed.<br/>

What say you, fellow Wizards?<br/>
