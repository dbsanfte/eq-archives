<b>Subject:</b> Giving back to the list(long) - Was  Best wizard equipment ! ! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000092562">Ok I&#39;ve thought about it a bit and decided that this list has been a good<br/>
source of info for me about our class and that I should contribute as well.<br/>
I&#39;ll give you guys the rundown on what I do to level and would appreciate<br/>
any comments or suggestions.  It&#39;s not very hard to describe, but in<br/>
practice there are a number of things that can go wrong and get you killed.<br/>
I have never died while doing this technique but I would suggest you have<br/>
someone watch your back the first few times if you decide you want to try<br/>
it.  After a little while it becomes very easy to do.<br/>
<br/>
Ok we all know that druid&#39;s level very fast because they can kite red mobs<br/>
and taking little to no damage.  They can solo all the way through to 50 no<br/>
problem.  Well a cap has been implemented for the amount of exp that one can<br/>
gain for killing a red mob, so druids although effective aren&#39;t gaining much<br/>
by killing a red versus a yellow or even or blue.<br/>
<br/>
One of my good friends is a halfling druid and i was fortunate enough to<br/>
have Spirit of Wolf at my disposal 90% of the time.  I noticed that as<br/>
wizards we are nearly as good at kiting as druids... find an open area blast<br/>
a mob, run, blast, etc...  He was able to take on reds because DOT&#39;s are<br/>
resisted less than our DD and i would stick to blues through yellows.  Since<br/>
the mobs I would fight were within reasonable range, i could burn fast and<br/>
kill the mob much faster than he could kite the red around.  I was up and<br/>
fighting again in less time then he was.  Both of us were effective but he<br/>
gained exp at a slightly faster rate.<br/>
<br/>
Well around lvl 21/22 i finally found enough runes(grrr always got one but<br/>
not the other component for a spell) to succeed in research.  I researched 2<br/>
level 16 Area Effect spells, Project Lightning(Point Blank Direct Damage)<br/>
and Pillar of Fire(Target Area Effect Direct Damage).  After playing around<br/>
with these spells a bit on some green mobs they seemed to be useless like<br/>
the majority of wizards claim.<br/>
<br/>
After a day or so of these spells not even crossing my mind, I had an idea.<br/>
I told my friend to give me SoW and was off to East Karanas.  I went to an<br/>
open area near the entrance leading to High Pass Hold and saw tons of Crag<br/>
Spiders wandering around.  The following are the steps to power level:<br/>
<br/>
-make sure i know when SoW will wear off or if you have Jboots, kick them in<br/>
<br/>
-give myself full buff especially shielding and resistant skin AND shield<br/>
skin<br/>
<br/>
-arange my spell bar with enstill, a variety of DD spells, Pillar of Fire,<br/>
Shadow Step, Gate<br/>
<br/>
-find a crag spider, run by and pierce him and not stopping<br/>
<br/>
-repeat the above step until 4 and only 4 crag spiders are after me<br/>
<br/>
-run to an open area void of any other mobs as distractions(along a coast is<br/>
always a good stretch)<br/>
<br/>
-This one is very important... you must round them up like cattle so that<br/>
they are all on top of each other, until it looks like there is only one<br/>
spider with 20 legs<br/>
<br/>
-run a good distance away, a count of one one thousand, two one thousand,<br/>
etc... till about 15-17.  DO NOT run too far or else you may get 4 mobs that<br/>
all of a sudden warp right on top of you<br/>
<br/>
-full stop and keep clicking on pillar of fire until you get your cast off<br/>
<br/>
-as soon as the casting time bar is done counting down(not when it shows<br/>
damage done) start running again<br/>
<br/>
-note damage done to each mob and see if any are not taking any damage or<br/>
are not getting hit for full, if only 3 of the 4 show up as having an<br/>
attempt at damage on them, the mobs are not rounded up well enough<br/>
<br/>
-start your count again and repeat the casting cycle until you have 4 dead<br/>
crag spiders and tons of exp<br/>
<br/>
With this technique you will have used full mana but killed 4 mobs that give<br/>
good exp on their own.  No other class that I know of can do this.  After<br/>
seeing me do it, those with AE have tried but they have problems.  Their<br/>
range is not far enough and their casting time is much too long.  4 mobs are<br/>
beating on them before they can get their spell off.<br/>
<br/>
I made 1.5 to 2 bubbles of exp an hour this way.  At mid 20&#39;s, it&#39;s the<br/>
fastest exp I have ever heard of that is consistent and after a little<br/>
practice, easy to do.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of notes.<br/>
<br/>
-Spirit of Wolf is not &quot;required&quot; on slower mobs as strafe running will<br/>
eventually get you far enough to cast but I found that it takes much too<br/>
long to bring the 4 mobs down and its just not worth it.<br/>
<br/>
-Pillar of Fire does 76 damage to each mob for 84 mana.  At 3.6 damage/mana,<br/>
it is incredibly efficient.  If you are going to do this solo, you need at<br/>
the very least to have mana to match the hit points of the highest level mob<br/>
in the train.<br/>
<br/>
-Pillar of Fire requires that the mobs are extremely close together else<br/>
risk the chance that one or more may not be hit which is a huge waste of<br/>
mana.<br/>
<br/>
-You can do this while grouped with others but you must pull all mobs and<br/>
your group cannot attack any of them until you are finished with your full<br/>
burns else the mob turns on them and your cattle round up is screwed up and<br/>
will be very difficult to get back into order<br/>
<br/>
-I have yet to obtain the runes for higher level AE spells but I assume it<br/>
just means it will be easier as the spells get more mana efficient<br/>
<br/>
-Shield Skin will prevent you from taking damage while you pull, Use It<br/>
<br/>
Well I think I&#39;ve covered pretty much everything.  Some of you may call what<br/>
I do boring or powergaming, so be it... when I need to level fast, this is<br/>
what I do.  I have revealed one of the great spots(East Karanas) to use this<br/>
technique.  I&#39;ll leave it to you to find others =) If you don&#39;t have access<br/>
to SoW or JBoots, you are pretty much out of luck but if you do, no one else<br/>
can kill 4 things as fast as a wizard and as you can see AE spells are<br/>
definately not useless, they have their place(hehe maybe not quite what is<br/>
inteneded but in my spell book they have a home).  I believe that Verant<br/>
knows about this technique and are reluctant to improve AE spells in part<br/>
because of it.  As it is, I can kill 4 mobs in the time it takes a druid to<br/>
kite 1.  If you want to see this technique in action, jump on Rallos Zek(the<br/>
only good server, hehe) go to East Karanas and give me a tell, I&#39;ll show<br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really interested in knowing what you guys think.  Is it cheap?  Are we<br/>
overpowered?  I&#39;m actually very surprised no one has posted something like<br/>
this before, or maybe they have and I just wasn&#39;t looking close enough.<br/>
<br/>
I have also found other unique abilities with our class which for the most<br/>
part are just overlooked... but alas that is for another time =)<br/>
<br/>
Hope this info helps,<br/>
