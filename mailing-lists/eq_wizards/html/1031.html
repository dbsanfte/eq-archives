<b>Subject:</b> Re: Recovering corpse on Erudin <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-653367352">Go back to Erudin and get someone to cast Invisibility on you(if you can&#39;t<br/>
do it yet) then get close enough to the house to use the /corpse<br/>
command(this will not end the invisibility). Continue to use the corpse<br/>
command until you are far enough away from your body that you can loot it.<br/>
This is how people retrieve their bodies when they are charmed by Meldrath<br/>
in the Mino caves.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
Yours,<br/>

PS - If this isn&#39;t possible then ask for some older characters to help, most<br/>
are willing if you are nice enough.</div>
