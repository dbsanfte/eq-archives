<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Lim but it is....If you always got the item then you wouldnt have any kinda<br/>
&gt;pride or anything about it and everyone would have one I like to be one of<br/>
&gt;the only people with stuff like our guild we would go and get all the items<br/>
&gt;on server first and we wouild keep them no selling and we kept them as<br/>
&gt;trophys....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I can see your point.  Yet, it still doesn&#39;t make camping any more <br/>
enjoyable does it?  All it does is delay the inevitable.  Assuming the MoB <br/>
dropped your item everytime...your guild would STILL be the first ones to <br/>
get it.  It doesn&#39;t mean you tried any harder...it just meant you didn&#39;t <br/>
have to waste so much time doing it.  How is that a bad thing?  Item Rarity <br/>
should be dependant upon the difficulty in the MoB itself IMHO.  An item can <br/>
even be made rare by making the MoB spawn less often... they DO that <br/>
already...but the frustration is made worse when the item is not on the MoB. <br/>
  It&#39;s like they want to double-up on your tension.  This point is not as <br/>
important...but you gotta remember we are all on paid time.  Verant has no <br/>
problem making us sit for 18hours at a time for an item now do they?  :)<br/>
<br/>
I liked the other post I read earlier that suggested random spawns...if it <br/>
could be designed in such a way that a NPC would spawn *anywhere* in the <br/>
level itself.  Now that&#39;s a fun challenge!  :)<br/>
<br/>
Also, now that the powergamers have gotten all there is to get, your point <br/>
is moot my friend.  I have no desire to be the &quot;first&quot; to get an item...I <br/>
just want it for personal satisfaction.  I killed the Mob...I got my item.  <br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, by the way Askur, the advice to go to Cazic is a good one.  From 24 and <br/>
up....it&#39;s a haven for xp!  And I&#39;m not going to begin to say how much money <br/>
you can get there hehe.   I&#39;ll probably run into you there.<br/>
