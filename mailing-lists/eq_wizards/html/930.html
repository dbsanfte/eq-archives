miss or be blocked and in my opinion that is just too risky.  When you<br/>
first get the level new spells will use too much of your mana for you to<br/>
want to risk any failures.  Save up for a bolt, it will be VERY useful at<br/>
L10 or L11.&lt;&lt;<br/>

I totally agree.  I bought Shock of Ice when a higher level wizard recommended <br/>
that&#39;s what I do.  I&#39;m level 9 currently and others in groups I&quot;ve hunted with have <br/>
been impressed with the spell that does 35 damage in one hit (yeah I know it&#39;s <br/>
not much but I&#39;m still little &lt;G&gt;)...especially spellcasters who aren&#39;t wizards <br/>
and can&#39;t get the spell.  I&#39;m still saving to get the rest of my level 8 spells.. <br/>
including fire bolt.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
