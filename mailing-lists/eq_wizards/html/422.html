<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217794688">Therein lies your problem.  Why is it necessary for you to read all 100+<br/>
messages before class?  Why not just save some for later?  Or, just skim<br/>
through them and nuke the ones you don&#39;t need.<br/>
<br/>
Not only am I on this list, but I&#39;m also on the EQ_Rangers list, the<br/>
EQMagicians list, the EQRogues list, the EQMonks list, and the<br/>
EQNecromancers list (I was somewhat undecided as to which class to play at<br/>
first :) ).  Let me tell you... It&#39;s downright *impossible* for me to read<br/>
all of the messages before I head to work in the morning.  I just let them<br/>
stack up for later reading.  Most of the time (in fact, all of the time) I<br/>
just skim the lists to pick out tidbits of information that I can use.  The<br/>
rest get nuked.<br/>
<br/>
And you don&#39;t really have to worry that this method will make you miss some<br/>
important messages, either.  If you happen to step into the middle of a<br/>
thread, and you&#39;d like to read the prior responses, just check the archive<br/>

&gt; BTW I think a news group version of this list would be a great<br/>
&gt; idea. I like<br/>
&gt; the list alot, but trying to read 100+ messages every morning before I<br/>
&gt; leave for classes kind of sucks.<br/>
