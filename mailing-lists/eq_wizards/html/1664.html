<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725522733">Well.. if you really want to unsubscribe you must go and log-in to the onelist.com site and bring up your account ( email addy and password), it will then list the mailing lists you subscribe to, and just click the word unsubscribe at the end of the list you wish to remove yourself from and that will do it for  you.<br/>

        Thanks Cristie and others for the nice words, but I think I know the problem.  This is my first (and probably last) mailing list and I didn&#39;t realize that they are only for one-shot answers to questions.  Does anyone know of a good forum (or whatever they are online) where I could go to for Everquest spell complaints/suggestions?  Besides having beta tested for UO, playing Everquest and various info searches, I dont really spend any &quot;social&quot; time online and didnt realize that I was breaking Netiquette rules here.<br/>
         <br/>
        Thanks</div>
