<div id="ygrps-yiv-1955237258">Although a bit expensive for some of us I decided to make the sacrifice.  I<br/>
spent 50pp on Dusty Bloodstained Gloves.  The gloves are magical (so mages<br/>
wishing to punch a ghoul can do so in perfect fashion) and offer 2AC and<br/>
more importantly a nice +25 mana bonus!!!  They are wearable by only pure<br/>
casters (MAG, WIZ, NEC, DRU) I do not think clerics can wear them...I may be<br/>
wrong though.<br/>
<br/>
IF you see these...buy them if you can..<br/>
