<div id="ygrps-yiv-1450851371">If you are going to be either human or Erudian you will need sphere of light,<br/>
otherwise save your coppers for a few levels.<br/>
<br/>
When you hit level 4 you need to buy<br/>
1. Shock of fire<br/>
2. Root<br/>
3. Gate<br/>
4. Fade (To Raise Alteration)<br/>
5. O&#39;Kiels Radiation (Cast on Friends not enemies.  You don&#39;t know how many<br/>
people cast it on enemies. This will also help raise Abjuration.  Its hard to<br/>
remember to cast shield until it wears out)<br/>
6. Glimpse or sense magic if you didn&#39;t need to buy sphere of light. (to raise<br/>
Divination)<br/>
<br/>
Put one point into piercing and save the rest of hose skill points for later.<br/>
<br/>
When you figure out how to make a large sum of money post it here, because I<br/>
haven&#39;t figured it out yet, at least not without camping .<br/>
