<div id="ygrps-yiv-787874852">According to Neil Lambert:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; if any of you happened to save the screenshot of EQSS&#39;s June 15th update, i&#39;d really like to have it. it&#39;s a picture of some really cool wizard opening the gate to the plane of hate. it looks like a huge brick wall with a mouth in the middle and a red eye on the top. the mouth has a bluish portal in the middle and it looks damned cool... if anyone has it email me personally<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>AG! The only day I couldn&#39;t get to check the www because I was in the plane, coming<br/>
back from california to france, and I miss the best shot!<br/>
