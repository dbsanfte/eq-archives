<div id="ygrps-yiv-206845305">well, i don&#39;t think i can argue ur points about &quot;role-playing&quot; and how<br/>
things SHOULD be in the real world, because basically, i am more of a<br/>
computer game fanatic than an outright roleplayer (i like to play games that<br/>
pit me against other human, non-predictable players, rather than<br/>
predictable, AI mobs)...  but, what i can say is that a majority of the ppl<br/>
on rallos zek are unhappy with the PC faction system, and it seems that many<br/>
ppl on the non-pvp servers are unhappy as well.  and not necessarily with<br/>
just any faction hits at all, but more or less unhappy with the particular<br/>
PC faction system that verant decided to slip in.  all-in-all, it seems to<br/>
have been a failure (as noted by urself when u said that verant would be<br/>
removing their PC related faction system until they could find an alternate<br/>
way to implement some type of faction system that the customers are happy<br/>
with).<br/>
<br/>
u make some good points, but alas, the PC faction system is now defunct (if<br/>
it is true what u say about verant removing the faction hits).<br/>
<br/>
sinlaru ce`alen<br/>

<br/>
ps. i can have my way without affecting u, because i play on the PvP server,<br/>
and u don&#39;t...  isn&#39;t that why they implemented the PvP server??? :)<br/>

&gt;Merchants of Felwithe?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; actually, it only takes about 3-5 kills to be KOS in ur own home town<br/>
&gt;(tested with 3 different races). i have an ogre shaman friend that killed<br/>
&gt;one dark elf, and can no longer go in the neriak bank because the guard is<br/>
&gt;KOS to him in there now (WOW! 1 kill i asked him...  he said &quot;yep&quot;).<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Alas, the rallos zek server is PVP (PLAYER -VS- PLAYER)...  not race war.<br/>
&gt;many ppl joined the PvP server because there were no restrictions (other<br/>
&gt;than the 4 lvl limit).  now, many ppl are leaving rallos zek because of the<br/>
&gt;restrictions they are putting in...<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; as for u saying that &quot;Each Race should stick together and fight other<br/>
&gt;races not each other&quot;...  that&#39;s ur opinion and ur entitled to that...  but<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t push ur opinions and style of play on others...  many others want to<br/>
&gt;kill everything in site...  even when roleplaying (think of the evil dark<br/>
&gt;elf who doesn&#39;t even like his brethren or the mad ogre who thinks other<br/>
&gt;ogres are traders because they befriend the dark elves).<br/>

&gt;(Folks, please remember to snip out unnecessary text.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sinlaru, the problem here is that whatever style Verant chooses ultimately<br/>
&gt;effects all players.  You can&#39;t have your way without affecting me, and I<br/>
&gt;can&#39;t have mine without affecting you.  Let&#39;s consider your argument:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You speak of role playing mad ogres and anti social elves?  Can we play<br/>
&gt;them?  Certainly.  Should they be tolerated by their own races?  There is<br/>
&gt;nothing even remotely realistic about butchering your own people,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>regardless<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;of alignment, and getting away with it.  So do it and be KOS in your own<br/>
&gt;city.  That&#39;s role-playing.  Anything else is mindless nonsense.  Being<br/>
 </span></blockquote>evil<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;doesn&#39;t mean being stupid.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On a related subject, people have also argued that duels shouldn&#39;t result<br/>
 </span></blockquote>in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;faction hits.  Stop and think for a moment how many societies you can name<br/>
&gt;that smiled on dueling.  In western culture, it has generally been an<br/>
&gt;illegal (but sometimes tolerated) practice limited to aristocracy.  You<br/>
&gt;often risked execution if caught.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What I would agree with you on is that the faction system is far too<br/>
&gt;simplistic.  Dueling ought to raise your faction with the enemies of your<br/>
&gt;antagonist, and with certain others within your own group who favor that<br/>
&gt;sort of behavior.  General militia ought to hate duels, and elite guards<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;some societies) ought to favor it.  But, personally, I think that faction<br/>
&gt;ideally should be an order of magnitude more complex than even this.  Did<br/>
&gt;you power game to level 15 attacking low blues?  Then perhaps you&#39;ve earned<br/>
&gt;the respect of conservative factions, but those who consider themselves<br/>
 </span></blockquote>true<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;warriors ought to scoff at you.  Did you always throw yourself into battle,<br/>
&gt;taking massive damage, on your march up through the levels?  Then maybe you<br/>
&gt;are adored by the plebes and chum with the guards, but the rest of the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>world<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;considers you an idiot.  And, of course, in duels, the assailant ought to<br/>
&gt;incur the brunt of the faction adjustment.  And, also, if no one sees it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;no rumor gets out, it didn&#39;t happen, etc.  Very tricky thing to implement<br/>
&gt;correctly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The ideal is ultimately very simple.  NPC&#39;s should treat you--based on your<br/>
&gt;behavior--just like a PC would of similar station.  Here&#39;s an example for<br/>
&gt;you to chew on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The other day in S. Karanas, a PvP player assisted in an attack on Grimrot.<br/>
&gt;At the end of the fight when everyone was healing, another PvP player came<br/>
&gt;in and attacked, without warning, eventually killing the PvP player.  Many<br/>
&gt;non-PvP players were upset because they couldn&#39;t do anything to help and<br/>
&gt;simply had to watch their comrade die.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You think the PvP assailant lost &quot;faction&quot; with the PCs?  You bet.  Should<br/>
&gt;he therefore have lost it with certain NPCs?  Of course.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are problems with faction right now.  And of course that&#39;s why Verant<br/>
&gt;announced that they had eliminated faction hits on PvP kills as of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yesterday<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and are working on a more elaborate system, including (possibly) an<br/>
&gt;aggressor flag.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The thing you need to keep in mind is that many of us non-PvP players would<br/>
&gt;love to play PvP if the system were set up with realistic consequences.<br/>
&gt;Why?  Because we like to role play and the non-PvP system makes it very<br/>
&gt;difficult to do so under certain situations.  Persistent kill stealing, for<br/>
&gt;instance, and severe twinking of characters (you know, the 4th lvl wizard<br/>
&gt;with observer&#39;s staff and oracle&#39;s robes?) are not things that could<br/>
 </span></blockquote>persist<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;in a realistic gaming environment.  But to argue for a system of no faction<br/>
&gt;hit on PvP kill just encourages the mindless butchering of PCs in the so<br/>
&gt;called name of &quot;role-playing.&quot;  And it is something I will argue against<br/>
&gt;anytime someone advocates it.<br/>
