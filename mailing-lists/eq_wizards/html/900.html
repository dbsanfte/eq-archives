<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038551762">Sounds good!  Can you talk more about specialization . . .<br/>
Does it make your spells take less mana?   and do you specialize in certain<br/>
schools etc ?? ?   like evocation??  (like everyone won&#39;t choose that right<br/>
off the bat at 22)<br/>

&gt; My wizard is a HE with 115 Intel.  I have about 550 mana at level 17<br/>
&gt; (approx..havent measured in a while) with 323 HP (with shielding on) and<br/>
267<br/>
&gt; AC (with Shielding).  I have not had any mana problems when compared to<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; casters in my group (which have significant more intel than I).  They may<br/>
&gt; have about 40 mana more than me, but that is one more spell.  I thought<br/>
&gt; about rerolling but when I look at it, you can find mana altering rings,<br/>
&gt; staffs, robes, headgear, necklaces, etc that when you are done, you can<br/>
well<br/>
&gt; exceed your mana limits.   My altered intelligence is 120.  I have a plus<br/>
3<br/>
&gt; intel helm (Savants cap) and +2 intel ring.  I will have a +20 mana boost<br/>
&gt; when I mount the skull of jhen tra on my totem staff (which also added 5<br/>
&gt; mana to my total).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Point is, play your stats well.  I do not cast like a maniac out there.  I<br/>
&gt; Root my targets for the group, cast a DD spell, then sit and regen mana<br/>
&gt; while the fight is on.  I monitor my groups health.  IF they are having<br/>
&gt; trouble with creature or another one enters the fight I cast and kill the<br/>
&gt; current target and help soften the next.  I then return to meditating.  My<br/>
&gt; mana rarely drops below half.  Just be mana smart.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also at lvl 22 your mana to damage ratio will drop significantly when you<br/>
&gt; start learning your specialization&#39;s.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Its all a matter of preference.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Greetings all. I write this letter to perhaps aid any who have begun<br/>
down<br/>
&gt; &gt; the long path of wizardry.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am Mirrin, high elf wizard, of the new Nife server, formally of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Karana server.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My first wizard was up to level 12 when I re-rolled to the new server. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; did so for several reasons:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; First to increase my intelligence. My first wiz had a 110 INT and my new<br/>
&gt; &gt; wiz a 126 INT.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I can not stress enough how much the extra 16 points have helped my<br/>
&gt; overall<br/>
&gt; &gt; mana. The extra mana has been<br/>
&gt; &gt; incredible. For instance:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; + I now spend more time actually hunting and less time in meditation.<br/>
This<br/>
&gt; &gt; makes your &quot;tank&quot; friends happier because your not always<br/>
&gt; &gt; meditating. Mana management helps here too.<br/>
&gt; &gt; + I now have that extra mana needed to finish off that high level<br/>
&gt; creature.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Nice to pick off that creature thats about to run<br/>
&gt; &gt; to get reinforcements.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Another reason I re-rolled is, as many of you have noticed, our combat<br/>
&gt; &gt; skills tend to raise slowly.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Higher INT will help compensate for this. I have also learned a few<br/>
tricks<br/>
&gt; &gt; along the way. Many of you probably already<br/>
&gt; &gt; know this but I put this here because of an old rule my master taught<br/>
me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Never assume what you know is common<br/>
&gt; &gt; knowledge. Let those who read your words decide that.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; + I have learned that you can raise your Off and Def skills very fast<br/>
&gt; &gt; combating multiple creatures at the same time. Find 2 or 3 that do<br/>
&gt; &gt; very little damage to you and let them smack away at ya. If you do this<br/>
&gt; &gt; every level for a short while It is very easy to keep your<br/>
&gt; &gt; skills high.<br/>
&gt; &gt; + Have a &quot;tank&quot; friend help you keep your OHB and 2HB&lt;one hand blunt and<br/>
&gt; &gt; two hand blunt&gt; skills maxed up. I hunt with a ranger<br/>
&gt; &gt; and he is more then happy to take the damage on a few critters while I<br/>
&gt; &gt; beat on them my a staff. Once you have maxed out your<br/>
&gt; &gt; skills, you then only need repeat this tactic for a short while every<br/>
time<br/>
&gt; &gt; you level. This works well with dagger skills as well. Remember you can<br/>
&gt; &gt; help you &quot;tank&quot; friends with skills too. Like with language skills.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A few tips of the trade:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; + Wizards are the keepers of knowledge. Learn where your &quot;tank&quot; friends<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt; find those magical weapons before they do.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Do some research. There are many on-line resources to find out where<br/>
&gt; &gt; little knick-knacks can be found. If your friends begin<br/>
&gt; &gt; to rely on you for such information then you will indeed become a TRUE<br/>
&gt; &gt; wizard.<br/>
&gt; &gt; + Keep this in mind. It is in your best interest to make sure your<br/>
&quot;tanks&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; can take as much damage as possible. Help<br/>
&gt; &gt; them get that leather tunic they need or the weapon they REALLY want.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Tanks&quot; are very simple to please and it only takes<br/>
&gt; &gt; a minimal amount of effort to make them your &quot;loyal friend&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt; + Take risks! Overhunt when-ever you can! Press your limit and you shall<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; rewarded. Instead of hunting those easy critters<br/>
&gt; &gt; until you reach level 4 go out and hunt... pixies for instance in lesser<br/>
&gt; &gt; feydark. You and a &quot;tank&quot; can get from level 3 to 6 in just a few hours<br/>
&gt; &gt; there. From there press yourself to the huge spiders and then right over<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; CrushBone at level 7 or 8.<br/>
&gt; &gt; + Always, always, always keep an eye on your skills. Once your OHB is<br/>
&gt; maxed<br/>
&gt; &gt; then get that great staff out and get it going.<br/>
&gt; &gt; You need to be able to use many weapons. Don&#39;t want to limit your<br/>
&gt; &gt; effectiveness with any magical item. It would be a shame<br/>
&gt; &gt; to not be able to hold that magic book (+30 mana and +10 Int) because<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; &gt; can only use a 2 handed staff and the book has to be held<br/>
&gt; &gt; in your left hand to get the bonus.<br/>
&gt; &gt; + Lastly, remember we wizards are known for our Intelligence. Play that<br/>
&gt; &gt; way! Write that way! Think that way!<br/>
&gt; &gt; Take great pride in your class!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Be well and remember that the fate of Norrath does indeed lay within the<br/>
&gt; &gt; hands of the wizards. Accept this simple fact.<br/>
