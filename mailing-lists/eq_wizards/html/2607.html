<div id="ygrps-yiv-1317544568">Whoowww !<br/>
<br/>
I was in my solo mode before patch and it was realy risky some time to get<br/>
a mob down i used nearly 4 bubles of mana for any fight. I have int 150 and<br/>
+70 mana in items lv 21. my tactic was Cast titan clash to stum cast a<br/>
force shock to do damage and then ROOT guy. cast flame shock, flame shock<br/>
(root if necesary) force shock, and finish it with a flames. It was dead<br/>
time betwen two force shocks that i have time to cast in midle 2 flame<br/>
shocks and i have to wait a bit before start casting a force shock.<br/>
<br/>
Now I can nearly cast 2 force shocks one after another. i use force, flame<br/>
force now and it is much faster damage delivery !!<br/>
<br/>
Bad thing is that when i soloed this birds a 17 lv enchanter was near me<br/>
and he soloed them too ! ! He used all mana it is true and was with int 165<br/>
and some mana items but i can say he was KILLING same guys as i 21 lv wiz i<br/>
was feel pissed a little.<br/>
<br/>
Any idea how to make my casting serie more eficent in mana or time consuming?<br/>
