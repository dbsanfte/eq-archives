&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have a few questions...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1.  Spell damage seems to be linked to level somehow, anyone<br/>
&gt;have any idea how?  Is it just 1 extra point per level?  Is<br/>
&gt;it spell dependant?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For example, as a fifth level wizard using Shock of Fire, I was<br/>
&gt;consistantly doing 13 points of damage.  After going to 6th<br/>
&gt;level, I am consistantly doing 14 points.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes it does 1 additional damage per lvl but there is a cap. Shock of Fire<br/>
caps at 15 dmg if i remember correctly.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2.  Also, I have been playing around with the spells, and I am having<br/>
&gt;trouble getting O&#39;keils Radiation to work.  How does it work and<br/>
&gt;what is the best way to use it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My opinion is O&#39;keils is really a waste of mana, i bought it for my Wiz<br/>
during P4 (of course it wasn&#39;t working during P4)<br/>
Since then i have seen it cast on others and people have cast it on me.<br/>
It&#39;s like a shielding spell that does damage to <br/>
monsters that are close to you. The problem with it in my opinion is that<br/>
it doesn&#39;t last nearly long enough to make it <br/>
worth casting. Total time it lasts about 30 secs or so.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;tried the guild and can not find it for sale.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not that<br/>
&gt;great<br/>
&gt;of a spell, but I think it&#39;s the only one I don&#39;t have.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No idea .. sorry ;)<br/>
