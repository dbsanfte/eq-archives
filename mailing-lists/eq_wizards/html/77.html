<div id="ygrps-yiv-1078652763">Redefine one of your socials as /loc and drag it as a hot button.  This will<br/>
make it quicker when you are about to die and will help you navigate a lot<br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
AND while you&#39;re at that, bind /corpse to another hot button.  If you find<br/>
your corpse, you can drag it to safety by running and quickly hitting the<br/>
corpse button.  (Now that I have told you this they will probably program<br/>
that out of the game...)<br/>

1. Whenever you are engaged in battle, wether you think you can win<br/>
   or not, always type /loc before or during battle. That way when<br/>
   or if you die you can scroll up in the chat window and get a<br/>
   general idea asto where your corpse is.</div>
