&gt;&gt;These are very good ideas - I like them a lot.  Instead of Haste though,<br/>
&gt;&gt;I&#39;d like to see Shadowstep become a Line-of-sight teleport spell (as<br/>
&gt;&gt;someone on the list suggested earlier), and use that as our<br/>
&gt;&gt;travelling/exploring spell.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I like this also but right now i think about you teleport right near sand<br/>
&gt;giant wich you cannot see as you were to long way from him.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good point.  This would encourage wizards to make smaller hops, rather than<br/>
long hops. <br/>
Smaller hops would cover less territory per casting - mean using more mana<br/>
but with <br/>
relative safty, and longer hops would cover more terratory per casting -<br/>
conserving <br/>
mana but may get you into trouble with the local wildlife.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would fit with our character class too.  Running (even running<br/>
FAST) is just<br/>
so physical.  You get sweaty.  And really, sweat-stained wizard robes would<br/>
look pertty <br/>
disgusting on a high elf  =)   (I&#39;m planning to wash the &quot;dingy white<br/>
robes&quot; as soon as I <br/>
can lay hands on them. =)<br/>
