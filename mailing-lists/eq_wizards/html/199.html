<div id="ygrps-yiv-1540643185">Ah.   Is that what you guys are arguing about?  =)  If you root something..  then walk near it.. it hits you?  hahaha   <br/>
<br/>
Yeah, just because its rooted, doesn&#39;t mean it cant hit ya.  You have to stay out of its range still.  In fact, I&#39;ve had lots of times where I root something at the start of a battle, we move in, the warriors start melee, I cast spells, its still winning, and we all have to back off.  The thing stayed rooted.  Of course there are always times when root wears off, and it begins running again, but in any case, hitting it, doesn&#39;t cancel the rooted effect.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Darish (from Crushbone) is a good example of this.  I&#39;ve rooted him, we tried to kill him, but he was too much for us.  So we left him there, rooted.  While we went for the zone.  I burned the rest of my mana into him while he was stuck there, just out of spite, and he stayed rooted.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; Yes but you have to be careful with Root and a tank.  If you root a <br/>
&gt; &gt; mob and<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone attackes it (like a warrior) and Hits, it nullifies the root <br/>
&gt; &gt; effect.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Nah. Just because something is Rooted doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t whack you if<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re in its range. =) I&#39;ve Rooted something, run out of mana, moved in<br/>
&gt; close to finish it off (dumb move) and still ran away without pursuit<br/>
&gt; after it smacked me around a bit too much.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On a different tack, I&#39;ve discovered my lifelong ambition by running<br/>
&gt; around blowing beasties up with Shock of Fire. =) Root, pull back... BAM!<br/>
&gt; BAM! BAM! Heheh.<br/>
