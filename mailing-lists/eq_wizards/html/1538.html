<b>Subject:</b> Pixies <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-821405030">I have recently heard from another young Wizard that<br/>
Pixies should not be killed by us. She claimed that<br/>
some of the higher level spells can be purchased only<br/>
from Pixies. Since I have killed a fair share of Pixie<br/>
Tricksters and Pranksters (both of whom lower faction<br/>
standing with Pixie) as part of a Ranger Quest, I<br/>
wanted to know if any of the more senior Wizards in<br/>
this group could comment on this concern?<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to find out if there are any Wizards<br/>
here from Rodcet Nife - most of the posts seem to come<br/>
from the &#39;elder&#39; servers. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
