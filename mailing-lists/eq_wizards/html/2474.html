<div id="ygrps-yiv-382621401">According to Tom Bratina:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; update... i just read a post on stratics that says u can lose faction on all<br/>
&gt; of the servers by killing other PC&#39;s (ie. duels).  it says after 5-7 PC<br/>
&gt; kills, their faction standing went from indifferent to dubious.  A few more,<br/>
&gt; and they will be KOS (threatingly is after dubious, and they will attack if<br/>
&gt; conned threatingly).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. I do expect this to disappear, since a few PC festivals and other dueling<br/>
events have already been cancelled, since the participants definitively do<br/>
*not* want faction hits, and I can understand this. Verant will not implement<br/>
something that would hamper socialisation.<br/>
