<div id="ygrps-yiv-1024916481">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
Just got lvl 20 the other day and am wondering about Specialization.  I<br/>
dumped as many points as I could into &quot;Specialization:Evocation&quot;, but have<br/>
absolutely no clue as to how it&#39;s supposed to work.  What does it do?  Does<br/>
it improve with use?  What exactly needs to be used to improve it?  etc...<br/>
<br/>
On another note, when I got to lvl 16, I dumped a point into Research.  Then<br/>
at lvl 20 I dumped a bunch more points into research.  I just tried<br/>
researching a lvl 16 spell (pillar of fire, I believe) at lvl 20, and failed<br/>
miserably.  How exactly do you practice this skill without needing a MASSIVE<br/>
collection of Runes?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
