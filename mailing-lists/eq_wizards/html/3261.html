<div id="ygrps-yiv-1495200216">I have a v.90 but the lines are so bad here that I cannot get a v.90<br/>
connection,  If I lived 5 or 6 miles from here I could..On a plus note i was<br/>
able to get into the game for a while last night and today.  Killed Broon a<br/>
few times for a little payback.  Scared some lower level hi elf in an oracle<br/>
robe...she was right next to me when I cast my first spell and I was<br/>
invisable when I did it.  She got even more scared when he charged me cause<br/>
he was heading right at her hehehe.  Just wonder how someone lower than 26<br/>
got an oracle robe?  I want one</div>
