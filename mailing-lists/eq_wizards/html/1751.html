 </span></blockquote>You have missed the fact that not everyone participates in contests, or<br/>
lotteries, or dueling.  So SOME people&#39;s fun would be lessened, but not<br/>
everyone&#39;s.  And booty could still be sold, just not used until it was time.<br/>
This idea has worked fine in MUDs and no one complained about a loss of fun.<br/>

&gt; Haha, I can see the message now:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;You are not experienced enough to put on this ring&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; or would it be:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Other adventurers would be jealous if you had this, so you better not<br/>
&gt; wear it&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; or better yet:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;You have been twinked. Please report to the nearest Big Brother station<br/>
&gt; to have your gear stripped from you and burned. Have a nice day.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then people couldn&#39;t win cool stuff in contests, win the lottery and buy<br/>
&gt; a neat high level weapon, duel a higher level character and grab some<br/>

&gt; &gt; Okay I have to comment, I have been Idle too long....<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If they had put in the mud&#39;s little trick of level based equip then<br/>
there<br/>
&gt; &gt; would never be any twinking...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; IE you cant put on that +25 mana ring till your 20th level....<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; simple and perfect... problem solved...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; ps this has been in muds for DECADES (no I&#39;m not exagerating this)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Rutree<br/>
