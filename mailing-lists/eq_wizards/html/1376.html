<div id="ygrps-yiv-748058863">At 16th, you get the spell Shock of Flames, which does 104 dmg.  It can be<br/>
found in Freeport, Qeynos, and Ak&#39;Anon.<br/>
<br/>
At 20th lvl, you get Force Shock, which does 171 dmg.  The only thing about<br/>
this spell, is that is gets resisted alot.  I&#39;m 22nd lvl now and have found<br/>
it easier to use this spell, but at 20th, I hardly ever used it because it<br/>
was so unpredictable on whether it would be resisted or not.  I used Flame<br/>
Shock instead which did 110 dmg by this time.  Plus its very mana efficent.<br/>
<br/>
Now, you&#39;ve probably seen some of my posts where I defend the wizard class,<br/>
but here is where I have to disagree with 989.  At lvl 24 you get another DD<br/>
spell.  It only does 168 dmg.  Granted, it is hardly ever resisted, like<br/>
Force Shock was, but come on, at least they could have upped the dmg to over<br/>
200.  This has been my only true gripe with the wizard class.  At lvl 29,<br/>
you get a DD spell which does 270, at least that&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard,<br/>
obviously at 22nd, I can&#39;t confirm that.<br/>
<br/>
So, although I was a little upset at the lack of power spells at 24th, 168<br/>
dmg is still nothing to sneeze at, especially when you don&#39;t have to worry<br/>
about it being resisted.  Plus, it is also very mana efficient.<br/>
Hope that helps ya out ;)<br/>

&gt; Well I have a question . . . what kind of dmg do we do at 20th?  I am 14th<br/>
&gt; now and am becoming disenchanted w/ the wizard class, tell me some of the<br/>
&gt; great things about being 20th please.   :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My short term goal is 16th of course and I already have bought 4 spells<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; they are in bank.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.S.  Where can I find Shock of Flame?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
