<div id="ygrps-yiv-1931358476">I see where your coming from on making a wizard &quot;different&quot;.  Wizards are 99% <br/>
direct damage.  It does get boring after awhile, med. nuke nuke, med. repeat <br/>
as necessary. <br/>
While a necromancer has a pet, mage gets a pet, enchanter gets a ton of <br/>
spells and each class can use some direct damage.  Shamans and druids... well <br/>
they are just great and have a ton of diversity.  However we are wizards and <br/>
the exact opposite of warriors.  Warriors do nothing but bash in close combat <br/>
and they are damn good at it.  Wizards do nothing but destroy with magic and <br/>
they are damn good at that.  We are the only class that can teleport to other <br/>
planes &quot;although secret entrances do exist for the people that don&#39;t want to <br/>
find a wizard&quot;.  Our travel spells are very nice as are our area affect <br/>
spells at high levels with a party.  You pay a price with power and that <br/>
price is a lack of diversity I think.  Truely no one can come close to the <br/>
damage a wizard can do in less then 5 seconds.  Truely a sight to see when a <br/>
20th leve MOB is beating on your level 8 party and you can&#39;t hit it, then a <br/>
36th level wizard walks by we yelled for help, he casts one spell and the MOB <br/>
dies like that.  <br/>
<br/>
Diversity Suggestions..<br/>
Wizard Only Special Robes and more graphics for them.  I must say the ones <br/>
they have now are great, but more couldn&#39;t help.  Again more quests and fix <br/>
the broken ones, this is everquest after all.<br/>
<br/>
I for one belive in the power of the wizard and I do know that brad and <br/>
verant have absolutely no intent of changing them.  I quote &quot;Wizards are by <br/>
far the most balanced casting class and to change anything to them now would <br/>
destroy 1 years worth of game balancing&quot;.  <br/>
