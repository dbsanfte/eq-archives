<div id="ygrps-yiv-802302381">I probably will get flamed for this for sure, but who cares.<br/>
<br/>
I made it all the way to lvl 12 as an erudite wizard.   I found that leveling<br/>
was very slow indeed and it was getting really boring camping with my groups<br/>
till the sun comes up.   However, i was on a few days ago in the morning and my<br/>
regular group wasn&#39;t on.  I shouted for about 30 min and no one wanted to join<br/>
up with me for bandit hunting.  Out of boredom, i went down to the bandit camps<br/>
to see if i can find a group there(West karanas on top of Hill).  I found this<br/>
group of 6 there camping the bandits so i just sat around shouting for groups<br/>
once again. But while those guys were fighting the bandits, i thought, hey might<br/>
as well try to see if i can kill one solo, if i can&#39;t, then they will probably<br/>
help me anyways.  I attacked one bandit and killedh im in 3 shots with Shock of<br/>
Lightning.  and WOW ! so much XP !!!   so i just kept going.  I got around 10-15<br/>
pp in 30 min and gained 1 bubble of xp. normall i gain 1 bubble in 6-8 hours of<br/>
playing.   FINALLY ! i found how to have fun with my wizard and not be the lamer<br/>
that spent all his time trying to group and get shitty XP cuz of the split<br/>
between members !!   who cares if they think i am a kill stealer, its not like<br/>
they can do anything about it HAHAHA.  too bad for them that they wont group<br/>
with me.  I also found some wizards are really stupid, the group  of 6 i was<br/>
stealing from had a lvl 14 wizard and a lvl 11 wizard. and none of them could<br/>
stop me from stealing. its odd but true... ppl just don&#39;t think.. oh well.. i<br/>
hope you all try to just have fun and not give a shit what other ppl think for<br/>
once.   then you might find why Varent say we are a balanced race, i personally<br/>
think we were made to give grief to others heehhe.. j/k   I personally think we<br/>
should be changed to Erudite Magical Theives hehe..</div>
