<div id="ygrps-yiv-1704650574">I would love to hear some of your stragites, good post by the way, and<br/>
thank you for getting this 17th level wizards hopes up ( I was starting to<br/>
get very discouraged)<br/>

&gt;I read a lot about the problems with wizards which made me look into the<br/>
&gt;problems that other classes have.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Verant has decided to allow other classes to deal almost the same amount of<br/>
&gt;damage as we do, this is obvious. (But that Magician 950 damage spell does<br/>
&gt;not exist, everyone does in the 500 mark at level 50 with ours doing 625,<br/>
&gt;Ice Comet is an enormous feat to obtain; its difficulty to get is equal to<br/>
&gt;its damage of 1100. So be prepared to not have it for quite awhile after 50)<br/>
&gt;Though they stated that wizards are the biggest damage dealers they actually<br/>
&gt;took a different angle.<br/>
&gt;Our damage spells have THE BEST mana efficiency in the game PERIOD. So we<br/>
&gt;aren&#39;t the biggest damage dealers, just the most productive damage dealers<br/>
&gt;and now those spells are quicker... enjoy that. This does result in bigger<br/>
&gt;damage because we would have an extra spell or two when compared to other<br/>
&gt;classes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve talked to many high levels and they are worried about the resistance<br/>
&gt;that our spells have, I just read a complaint about Lady Vox, but know that<br/>
&gt;Verant is still working on Lady Vox (apparently she is bugged somewhat).<br/>
&gt;As far as resistance go, I am undecided on my standpoint. Part of me wants<br/>
&gt;the resistance system changed to a system that allows more 25%,50%, etc.<br/>
&gt;damage than full resistances. (This comes from the fact that we are resisted<br/>
&gt;like everyone else, but unlike everyone else, when our damage spells are<br/>
&gt;resisted, we have nothing else to do to help the group.) I group with<br/>
&gt;friends a lot but when I don&#39;t group with friends and get resisted enough I<br/>
&gt;get kicked out of the group, very disappointing. The other side of me says,<br/>
&gt;&quot;Deal with it.&quot; Play it out and just have fun. If this mailing list is going<br/>
&gt;to attempt to get something changed, this is where it is. Look at it from<br/>
&gt;the balance and programming angle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;All other classes have their ups and downs too.<br/>
&gt;I read many class &lt;x&gt; can do more damage than we can in situation &lt;y&gt;. But<br/>
&gt;if you looked into these raves like I have you will find that the statement<br/>
&gt;is true, but class &lt;x&gt; cannot maintain the punishment that we can over a<br/>
&gt;period of time measured by multiple battles, not one. And five levels later<br/>
&gt;this situation is no longer valid either.<br/>
&gt;I was actually believing all these raves that Druids rule and stuff like<br/>
&gt;that until I looked into it. How long do you think Verant will allow kiting<br/>
&gt;to continue? Oh, and, If you can get yourself a pair of JBoots you can kite<br/>
&gt;multiple reds at one time! Using those &quot;worthless&quot; AE spells. (By the way:<br/>
&gt;although dungeons only make up 10% of the total zones, they make up over 50%<br/>
&gt;of the high level goodies that are throughout Norrath, can you guess whose<br/>
&gt;has a bunch of spells that don&#39;t work in dungeons?) *Little Tip* Only duel<br/>
&gt;Druids in dungeons, hehe. I hope this shows you that every class had pros<br/>
&gt;and cons, and every class has a level area that is very strong/weak.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I want to assure you mid-teen level guys that it does get better later on.<br/>
&gt;Now I am not saying that resistance are less and other classes are left in<br/>
<br/>
&gt;the dust. I am just saying that spells do much more damage for much less<br/>
&gt;mana. After the whole level 20-23 episode where you use you level 16-19<br/>
&gt;spells you will use your new spells just like you did before.<br/>
&gt;Verant made wizards HARD at lower levels to make up for a much easier time<br/>
&gt;at level 50+. Notice the &#39;+&#39;. Major recommendation for wizards, buy that<br/>
&gt;expansion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have never had a problem with my playing style and my class, except for<br/>
&gt;the multiple resistances. I am leveling with everyone else that I am<br/>
&gt;constant contact with so there is not much of a problem. Start looking into<br/>
&gt;strategy instead of boom, boom, boom. From all that I seen Wizards are the<br/>
&gt;most strategic class to play, if you don&#39;t like strategy and really aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt;into role-playing a wizard, you will have a good amount of frustration.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This has been my 2 cents in the matter I will not continue &quot;Wizards suck<br/>
&gt;&lt;insert class here&gt;s rule!&quot; threads.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;PS. IF you guys want to see some nice Wizards strategies, just say so. I<br/>
&gt;will place another long post with strategies.<br/>
