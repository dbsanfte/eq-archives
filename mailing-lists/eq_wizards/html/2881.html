<div id="ygrps-yiv-357517882">I beleive I went to worn great staff next.  Then Great Staff  Fine Steel<br/>
Ruined Totem Staff.  Also when i was in the 8 to 15 range, I likd my giant<br/>
snake fang.  It was a pretty good piercing weapon.  I have also seen wizzies<br/>
with suriken but have nevr tried to use the throwing skill much.<br/>
<br/>
On a different note, find someone to summong bandages for you and leant bind<br/>
wounds.   Store bought bandages can be expensive but this skill will dave<br/>
your life and give you something useful to do when you have no mana and your<br/>
part y is low on health.  I have used the skill while my group is fighting<br/>
to help keep a tank going.  Also sevelope your sense direction and fishing<br/>
skill/  My experience has shown me begging t be downright useless so dont<br/>
waste time doiong it.<br/>
<br/>
In closing, It is a big game with lot&#39;s of options and things to try.  Be<br/>
creative and unique.<br/>
