&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ok..  my comments.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t think that we should necessarily know when a root spell is running<br/>
&gt;out.  Although it is our spell and we may know everything about it, we do<br/>
&gt;not know everything about the monster we are casting it on.  We don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt;what kind of resistances he has, we don&#39;t know how much willpower or mental<br/>
&gt;strength he has, etc.  Because of this, I think it makes sense that we not<br/>
&gt;know exactly how long it will last.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>why? we are wizards ! we feel a magic, we feel a spells wich we cast, we<br/>
know what resistence was in moment of casting and we can know when it will<br/>
finish.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Some notes on Shadow step and Fade:  1.  Fade sucks.  I can only hope that<br/>
&gt;others have had better luck with it than I, but Fade has never put me more<br/>
&gt;than 5 feet from where I was when casted in combat.  Casted out of combat it<br/>
&gt;usually takes me a good distance, but in combat it has never been useful.<br/>
&gt;Shadow step is a lot better.  It takes you a much farther distance and seems<br/>
&gt;to work in combat better as well.  I have found (can anyone confirm this)<br/>
&gt;that fade and shadow step *usually* will teleport you more or less in the<br/>
&gt;direction that you are facing, but will sometimes be to one side or the<br/>
&gt;other.  I have almost never seen a time when they will teleport you behind<br/>
&gt;where you already are.  I keep shadow step and gate memorized right next to<br/>
&gt;each other most of the time, but in a dungeon shadow step loses its<br/>
&gt;usefullness and i will replace it with something else.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Shadow spell prefer to kake you in lower ground if it is on your back you<br/>
can go directly after monster once i finished long way back and i see my<br/>
bubbles go around and monster turn and run in my direction ehehehhe.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;O&#39;keils radiation does pretty much suck.  I don&#39;t understand why it was<br/>
&gt;given to us because we don&#39;t (to my knowledge) get any other damage shields,<br/>
&gt;so it is not like a series of spells or anything like it should be.  I still<br/>
&gt;use it a little at level 10 (and I think it does 3 damage now, not 2) to<br/>
&gt;help our tank out a little, but I think by level 12 or 16 it will be out of<br/>
&gt;my repertoire.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used it a lot on low levels as soon as i get it it is 2 damage but in<br/>
fight at this levels i got 8 to 10 hits and this is 16 to 20 damage and it<br/>
is not bad. cast it on fighter wich fight 2 monsters and you get 40 damage<br/>
!! it is not that much as a druid 5 dmg shield but it helps to show our<br/>
utility to warriors when we realy are weak as i see a wizard start to be<br/>
useful at 12 lv with 78 dmg spell.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I wish we did get more buffs for groups (that are in line with the wizard<br/>
&gt;theme), such as raising magic resistance or a better damage shield (I<br/>
&gt;remember some MUDs that had a sweet high level wiz spell called fireshield<br/>
&gt;that would do THE AMOUNT of damage inflicted on the player back to the mob<br/>
&gt;with each hit.  Probably a bit overpowered for EQ though :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i dont ask for better buffs lets star in line with verant idea, wizards are<br/>
not buffers but travel or spy masters i wish to have a invisible spy pet :)<br/>
or some sort of loww range teleport with better accuracy then shadow step<br/>
eheheheh.<br/>
