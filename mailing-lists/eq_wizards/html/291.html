<div id="ygrps-yiv-171919279"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I think that the wizard becomes much more powerful at higher levels.<br/>
&gt; Up until level 8 you&#39;re very weak.  After that it gets a little<br/>
&gt; better, and at level 12 you really start to become impressive.  My<br/>
&gt; advice is to stick with it, continue to grow and explore.  At level 12<br/>
&gt; you get &quot;Bind Affinity&quot;, which makes travelling around a lot easier.<br/>
&gt; You will get high damage spells which cast faster and easier as you<br/>
&gt; advance.  As soon as you pass that mark, you&#39;ll be able to deal<br/>
&gt; 300-400 hitpoints of damage in a few seconds.  At level 20 you&#39;ll be<br/>
&gt; able to teleport to certain locations, and if I am not mistaken,<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ll be able to gate your party members.<br/>
&gt; Stick with the wizard for now.  Before you know it, you will have a<br/>
&gt; very powerful character that many people will want to have in their<br/>
&gt; party.<br/>
