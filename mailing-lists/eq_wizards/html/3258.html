<div id="ygrps-yiv-1911615265">&quot;Usual symptom: if you are on a UUNET server (old servers), try a CERFnet<br/>
server (a recent one). If you can get in, then you have &quot;transient&quot;<br/>
connectivity block. Sweat it &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Nope I don&#39;t think that is it.  There have been no banners or anything,  I<br/>
use Cazic Thule server and so far it&#39;s been pretty reliable.and crowded.  I<br/>
am begining to think the problem may be either my modem or my ISP  I have a<br/>
winmodem and i understand from some recent articals that they aren&#39;t really<br/>
very good and use some of the cpu to process the data comming in ans<br/>
therefor slow my system down.</div>
