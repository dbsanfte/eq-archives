<div id="ygrps-yiv-815522025"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Just wondering who&#39;s on Solusek Ro, and where you&#39;re based.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m 14th Wizard and have just moved my base of operations to Kaladim<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am a Level 10, almost 11, Wizard, Erudite.  Name&#39;s Aznyin.  I mainly<br/>
live in Queynos now, but as soon as the magical level 12 comes along I<br/>
plan to make a world trip with some friends, binding myself to other<br/>
cities as I pass them.  First stop will probably be Rivervale.  I plan<br/>
to make it there by this weekend.<br/>
