<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571770232">Another MUCH missed int item that you can do at level 12 is the golden<br/>
stud earring.  This will be your first &quot;lesson&quot; in camping probably, but<br/>
is a good one. Again, Graffe&#39;s page is the best, but the gist is you<br/>
kill a mob in Qeynos (Cubert, named baby gelationous cube - about 80<br/>
hp&#39;s), get an item, and trade it in for a +3 int earring.  I did that a<br/>
BUNCH of times, finally got my two, and thats no small int bonus for<br/>
such a low level quest!  And the best part is, they are like backup cash<br/>
- if you are hitting a spell level, and need 30 plat fast...<br/>
