&gt; around me killing snakes and bats was people with full banded mail all lv 1<br/>
&gt; or 2 i have seen in 6 hours more then 10 full armored people. And i dont<br/>
&gt; have any problem about it! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you enjoy screwing yourself thats fine with me too.  But I dont need to take and extra 6 <br/>
months to make moderately high level because I have to compete with cheating twinks.<br/>
<br/>
If they did not compete with me for creatures at my level I would not give a rats ass.  But they <br/>
do compete for creatures at my level and make it more difficult for me and you to level.  If you <br/>
enjoy running around and killing snakes and bats and rats for a real time year of your life <br/>
thats great but dont screw me with your liberal ill thought ideas.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If they transfered items from their high lv caracters or if guild give it<br/>
&gt; to them its ok for me i go around killing my bats and snakes and they do it<br/>
&gt; in same way without skills they must work much things a same way as you do<br/>
&gt; a little bit easier but they alredy worked for it.<br/>
&gt; I played a long time a everquest creating some middle lv caracter and i<br/>
&gt; know  how dificult it is to start it all over if you have find that your<br/>
&gt; caracter is not what you wish and you decite to start new class.<br/>
&gt; Im shure that a people wich complain are ones wich have enugh money and<br/>
&gt; free time to play as long as they wish, ohers wich cannot support to pay a<br/>
&gt; 10 $ a month and 1 $ a hour (as connection rates to internet go in europe)<br/>
&gt; i aprove fully to transfer their items to new started caracter. If this is<br/>
&gt; possible to do in game then its ok to do if you wish to pay 100 $ a month<br/>
&gt; so that you can have a payed gm controling every transaction in game then<br/>
&gt; its ok for you send email to Sony saying that you are ready to pay 100 $ a<br/>
&gt; month to play a game where every move will be GM controled so wou can be<br/>
&gt; shure that every caracter is not twinked ;-), They willl accept this idea<br/>
&gt; gladly as soon they start reciving your bucks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; About guild camping im strongly against it i support idea that if person<br/>
&gt; wich killes a monster is more then 5 lv higher then loot will be only<br/>
&gt; normal one and for special items only a 1/3 of normal chance or not at all<br/>
&gt; so higer lv players wishing one item must buy it from a low lv players. it<br/>
&gt; will be a nice push to player interaction.<br/>
