I guess this is a more general type type of question, but since there are so<br/>
many nice items Wizards can get at Guk I will go ahead answer the question.<br/>
<br/>
Swamp<br/>
Netted armor can easily be acquired just outside Guk in the swamp, there is<br/>
a small island right at the entrance to Guk where you will see a lot of<br/>
Frogloks running around.  Just start taking them out.  You should get a<br/>
piece of Netted every 15 - 20 Frogs or so.  The only danger is the<br/>
occasional wandering Troll NPC/Jojoguna (sp?) just keep an eye out, and if<br/>
you get into trouble run into Guk.  Also you can get Woven off the<br/>
occasional Froglok Forager&#39;s.  Forager&#39;s tend to hang out near the old<br/>
abandoned tower.<br/>
<br/>
UpperGuk<br/>
UpperGuk is a 10 - 30 level dungeon.  The very first part of the dungeon<br/>
(The area before the bridge/tunnel with the water in it) is very easy.<br/>
Although this is a small portion of the dungeon.  Part of the area after the<br/>
bridge you probably can take as well depending upon how well your group<br/>
works together.  One thing try not to let the Frogs run away from you.  This<br/>
can easily start train which could annihilate you, and all of the other<br/>
unfortunate souls in the area.  Just Root&#39;em nukem or do whatever you do<br/>
best to keep them from running. Also pay attention to whats going on around<br/>
you. I have seen some nasty trains at Guk.  As far as Frog you get Woven<br/>
armor off Sentries, Sentinels, Guards, Tuk Warriors, Apprentices, Neophytes,<br/>
Novices, Witchdoctors, and Tuk Shamans.  Might have missed one or two but<br/>
that is the majority of the Frogs that give out Woven.  Mesh is dropped by<br/>
Gaz&#39;s and higher.  There are also a few special Frogs in the area that carry<br/>
their own unique items.  You need to gain at least another 5 levels before<br/>
you can even start to thing of tackling them though.  Guk can be a really<br/>
nice to place to go if you have group that works very well together.  Solo<br/>
it is almost sucidial especially on the 2nd level of uppper Guk.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun in Guk</div>
