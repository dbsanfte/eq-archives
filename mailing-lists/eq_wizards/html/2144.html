&gt;If I find myself in an unfamiliar group I kinda play it by ear.  It&#39;s a lot <br/>
&gt;different playing against orcs in Oasis & CB versus training Dry Bone Skels <br/>
&gt;in Unrest.  Main thing I found helpful is to call out who you&#39;re assisting <br/>
&gt;in a fight so that everybody can zero in on one creature at a time.  /ASSIST <br/>
&gt;is our friend. :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll have to remember /ASSIST.  I got whacked last might (again =).  My<br/>
companion and I were jumped by three cents, and we pretty much just took<br/>
whichever happened to be closest to us.  If mana had held out, we would<br/>
have made quick work of them, but such is life.  Thinking back on it now,<br/>
maybe it would have been better if we&#39;d both focused on the same one until<br/>
it dropped, then regroup on the next one.  <br/>
<br/>
Hypothetical situation:<br/>
What happens if you&#39;re in a train situation, a party of 6 players being<br/>
chased by 15+ critters and the party decides to scatter?  If everyone stays<br/>
together you end up with one group of players leading one group of<br/>
critters, but if they scatter...  <br/>
<br/>
Does the train follow one poor bastard?  Does the train split up to follow<br/>
each individual?  Does creature intelligence play a part in this?  I&#39;m very<br/>
curious about this, as it may change the survival rate of the group<br/>
drastically.  If no one has tried it, I&#39;ll try to test it out with a group<br/>
and a truckload of greens outside Felwithe or something.<br/>
