<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609246565">1)	You get the Runed Totem Staff off of Rex, the gnoll shaman, in Split<br/>
Paw, more commonly known as Paw.<br/>
2)	I am not sure about where you get them but as far as I have heard no<br/>
one knows how to mount them anyway.<br/>
3)	Yes there are plenty of magic rings out there. You can either find<br/>
them off of certain creatures or get a high level enchanter to make them for<br/>
you.<br/>
4)	Don&#39;t worry about cooking, you can eat the fish that you catch<br/>
without doing anything to them. However, if you sell them fish for 2 Silver<br/>
3 Copper, or whatever you get for them, you can almost afford to buy 1 food<br/>
and 1 water for the same price so it is more economical to sell them.<br/>
<br/>
