<br/>
If I may comment - I don&#39;t believe that us discussing what &#39;would be nice&#39; for Wizard spells really helps us be Wizards.  I really believe that if we continue to complain or comment on the apparent lack of spells/problems with spells that we have, we are not going to achieve what I believe this mailing list was setup for.  This list is to share information between all Wizards within Norrath !  We are going to lose potential and current subscribers (me and I&#39;m sure others), thus losing valuable shared information because of our ranting and raving about our class.  Remember, Verant is probably not reading this forum..<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion:  Let&#39;s talk about ideas and share information that will help each other play the class that we chose to play.<br/>
<br/>
So far, the most useful thing I have read (besides Spoiler information) is the &#39;bug&#39; that allows our Eye of Zoom to unlock doors.  I think that&#39;s great !!<br/>
