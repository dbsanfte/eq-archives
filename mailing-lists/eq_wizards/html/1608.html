<div id="ygrps-yiv-473879277">i hope you guys understand that just about all of the high level wizards don&#39;t even HAVE weapons. i would much rather have 2 shimmering orbs than a staff i barely hit with, but that&#39;s at high level, now i&#39;m very much content with my newly bought Runed Totem staff.<br/>

oh and about the making money issue: sometimes your lucky. I was at the dervish camp in Northern Ro on Fennin Ro and for some reason for about 6 turns every derv that was on my turn had a BRONZE weapon! i got 3 bronze rapiers! (3pp per rapier) i made 30pp in two hours !</div>
