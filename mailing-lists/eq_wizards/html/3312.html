 </span></blockquote>) and I had no problems combining. I also had no problems combining the<br/>
Jeweled Skull back when I did. I am fairly certain that for quests, it<br/>
will always work. Have you ever heard of someone failing to combine a<br/>
quest item?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Combining the rods used to be dependent on your research skill but I believe<br/>
this was changed because of the amount of complaints. I know many, many<br/>
people who continue to do the quest for the experience and they never fail<br/>
to combine them anymore.<br/>
