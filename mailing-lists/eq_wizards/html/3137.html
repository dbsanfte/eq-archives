<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101418927">Actually Sol A (Solusek Eye) you can start out in the low 20s.  I&#39;v found<br/>
stuff that still gives me exp at level 35 in Sol A, but it sure isn&#39;t much<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;when it happens.  If your going to solo there, best be level, oh say, 50.<br/>
&gt;I don;t believe there to be a way to safely solo in Sol and still get exp<br/>
&gt;at any level.  Most of the place was green to me even at 33 (when I first<br/>
&gt;went there).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Eeeeesh!  :(  Thanks for the tips...I guess I&#39;ll avoid the area for a bit.  <br/>
Yeah, I usually don&#39;t like going solo either...but there are sometimes those <br/>
nights when nobody wants to group and I go off on exploration journeys. :)  <br/>
Perma is another place I wanted to venture...but it sounds like the goblins <br/>
there are no fun too. ;)<br/>
