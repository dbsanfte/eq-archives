<b>Subject:</b> Woven Or Netted Armor For A Wizard? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1557305864">I am currently a level 10 High Elf Wizard, and I have a Sr. Apprentice robe along with a full set of cloth armor. I would like to get either a full set of the woven or the netted armor next, as an upgrade from the cloth that I have now. I would like to know which of the two types would be best to get next. Also, what are the stats compared to the cloth armor? Any help would be appreciated!<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Kelill</div>
