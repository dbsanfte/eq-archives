&gt; #1 Its Meldreth, He is a level 53 Necro and he charmed you<br/>
&gt; #2 Wisdom is the stat used to counteract charms<br/>
&gt; #3 Mages can bind anywhere (I think) non mages can only be bound to<br/>
cities.<br/>
&gt; Evil races can only be bound to evil cities, and good races to to good<br/>
cities<br/>
&gt; #4 Faction does affect who a MOB will attack, along with Damage, Taunts,<br/>
Heals,<br/>
&gt; Buffs, Etc<br/>

&gt; &gt; This is a long e-mail because I didn&#39;t want to send a bunch of e-mails.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Please do read the whole e-mail though.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sad Story:<br/>
&gt; &gt; My formerly 12th level wizard went into the Minotaur cave in the<br/>
Steamfont<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mountains.  We decided to explore.  THIS WAS A VERY BAD IDEA.  Some type<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; mind warp to over me and I ran right to Meridith (or whatever his name<br/>
is)<br/>
&gt; &gt; and 3 minotaur guards.  But I did not die.  I got stuck in a wall and<br/>
could<br/>
&gt; &gt; not run out or gate out.  I filed a petition and while I was waiting I<br/>
tried<br/>
&gt; &gt; to fill out a bug report.  But that crashed the game -- power off.  When<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt; log back on I drop right in front of Meridith and the guards (BAM, BAM,<br/>
&gt; &gt; DEAD).  Probably would have had better luck from a guard.  Anyway after<br/>
3<br/>
&gt; &gt; more deaths and some help from an enchanter&#39;s invisibility, my friend<br/>
and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; got our stuff back -- the other members of the party ran.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Question 1:<br/>
&gt; &gt; Has anybody killed this guy and what level were you, etc. etc.?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Question 2:<br/>
&gt; &gt; Is magic resistance used to resist the mind warp?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Question 3:<br/>
&gt; &gt; When I was still 12th level I cast Bind on myself and my friend.  I got<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt; message that I feel bound to the area (or something like that).  My<br/>
friend<br/>
&gt; &gt; did not.  I cast it on him 4 times and he did not get that message.  I<br/>
tried<br/>
&gt; &gt; to cast it by the gnome city if that matters.  The only message that I<br/>
got<br/>
&gt; &gt; was that I had started to cast a spell.  When we died, I appeared near<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; gnome city and he had a much longer walk.  It appears that the bind did<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; &gt; work for him.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Another Story:<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have mostly been fighting in Crushbone, so my standing with the orcs<br/>
&gt; &gt; really sucks.  Sometimes a legionaire or slaver will attack me without<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; &gt; attacking them and the &quot;tanks&quot; have been totally unable to pull them off<br/>
&gt; &gt; while I am standing and trying to move away.  I don&#39;t think that the<br/>
&quot;tanks&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; are at the top of the orcs most wanted list like I am.  If it matters, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; helped kill Crush with a large party.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Question 4:<br/>
&gt; &gt; Has anybody else experienced this?  Any ideas?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; ****Spoiler****<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have figured out what to do with some of the shackle keys that you get<br/>
off<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the slavers in CrushBone.  Each number corresponds to a specific<br/>
race/sex<br/>
&gt; &gt; combination.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Here are the combinations that I know:<br/>
&gt; &gt; Male Dwarf 16<br/>
&gt; &gt; Female Dwarf 17<br/>
&gt; &gt; Male Wood Elf 18<br/>
&gt; &gt; Female Wood Elf 19<br/>
&gt; &gt; Male High Elf 20<br/>
&gt; &gt; Female High Elf 21<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Question 5:<br/>
&gt; &gt; What do the other keys do?  So far I know that I have also gotten<br/>
shackle<br/>
&gt; &gt; keys #15, 23 and 24.  I have not seen any halflings or gnomes, but have<br/>
&gt; &gt; heard reports of them.  If you know who to give these keys to or where<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; other slaves might be (I have not gone in the castle), please reply to<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; group with the answer.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Laugh<br/>
&gt; &gt; Has anybody noticed that it is empOREr cruch and not empEROr crush.  The<br/>
&gt; &gt; stupid orcs hail empOREr crush to.  I turned that in as a bug.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
