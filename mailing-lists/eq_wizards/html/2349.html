&gt; Two things.<br/>
&gt; First, you will never have a project of this magnitude without having some bugs<br/>
&gt; making it to release undiscovered.  Software is inherently buggy, its a fact of<br/>
&gt; life, get used to it, you will see it happen more and more.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Being a software designer, I tend to notice that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Second, they have stated that people found exploiting a bug will be warned.  If they<br/>
&gt; continue to exploit the bug, then they will be punished.  Its painfully obvious why<br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t list bugs.  They don&#39;t want to be forced into policing them 24/7.  If you<br/>
&gt; stumble onto something that is a blatent bug, report it so that it gets fixed, and<br/>
&gt; move on.  If you find something that could go either way, enjoy it until a GM/Guide<br/>
&gt; tells you to stop.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thing is, they released buggy software. I paid good money for it, and keep paying every<br/>
month.<br/>
<br/>
They should take care of it. Their game. My money. Their problem, not mine. As a<br/>
consumer, I shouldn&#39;t even have to think about these things. What happens is that the<br/>
game designers are aware as to how much the gaming public is involved in the process of<br/>
making designing games, so the EXPLOIT us.<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever seen a TV released that only shows prime number channels, with a promise<br/>
to come fix it some time? Ever seen a stove that only heats to 50 degrees with a promise<br/>
to come fix it some time? Ever see a car that only turns left with a promise to come fix<br/>
it some time? No. This happens only in computer software, especially high profile games.<br/>
