<div id="ygrps-yiv-741123326">Where did everyone go?  hehe.  Is there another Wizard list more active than <br/>
this one?  :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, taking my time trying to solve quests lately so my power-leveling <br/>
brethren are passing me by (again...on their second characters hehe) .  Got <br/>
the Staff of Observers yesterday which is pretty cool.  How do we get the <br/>
Sentinel spell to work on the staff...we just right-click on the staff <br/>
before medding?  To bad I really don&#39;t have a need for this staff right <br/>
now...Staff of Writhing and Stein of Mogguk is better for me.  But I wanna <br/>
play around with it before I use it for trade or something. :)<br/>
