&gt; &gt;&gt;Yes, I totally agree with you.  Who&#39;s NOT going to camp for things like<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;JBoots?  :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Me. I have roughly 2-3 hours a night to play (on good days) and I am not<br/>
&gt; &gt;willing to waste a weekend camping in a computer game. I am sure many<br/>
&gt; feel the same way.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yeah, I&#39;ve never camped for anything myself too for about the same reasons.<br/>
&gt; But that&#39;s not the point...wouldn&#39;t you find things more fun if you COULD<br/>
&gt; legitimately get cool items *without* camping?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sure I would. But I just don&#39;t see that happening. <br/>
<br/>
Actually, I&#39;m seriously considering quitting EQ and selling my account.<br/>
It&#39;s bad enough that I only have a couple of hours a night to play, but<br/>
half of that has to be spent half-soloing while trying to get a group in<br/>
this overcrowded world, and the other half some monotone pulling and<br/>
killing and then dying by someone elses train and losing twice the exp I<br/>
spent the night getting.<br/>
<br/>
Just not worth it.<br/>
<br/>
And anyways, I already got a $300 offer on my 26 Wizard :)<br/>
