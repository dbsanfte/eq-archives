Wizards need revision and we on a wizard mailing list have find some<br/>
interesting spell changes to ask for: <br/>
<br/>
 Summon - Teleports group member inside the zone to your location<br/>
 Phase - Teleports yourself to location of other group member inside zone<br/>
 Tap Afinity - Teleport group member to their own bind spot<br/>
 Haste - Increases movement rate for self only.<br/>
 Group Gate - Slow casting spell which teleports group to your bind spot,<br/>
 doesn&#92;&#39;t leave anyone behind<br/>
 Retreat - Evacuate version of group gate<br/>
 Meditation skill max for level for wizard (Level +1) * 7<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We also hope very much in future implementation of<br/>
<br/>
- Specialization skill with some real advantages to our class<br/>
<br/>
- resolving a problem of high resistence of DD spells at lv 20 resisted by<br/>
(greens and blues )and other ( if this is becouse of stun effect we wish<br/>
one spell without this efect at same level)<br/>
<br/>
- resolving a balance problem of other magic users classes be able to<br/>
attack directly (necromancer, lifetap pets) or indirectly (enchanters and<br/>
magicians pets, buffs ect) a much higer lv MOBs NP 19 lv against 35 lv sand<br/>
giant when our spells are 100% resisted if a monster is 6+ lv. <br/>
<br/>
- beter use of time when meditating (acces to main chat server in separate<br/>
window) <br/>
<br/>
- we wish real official feedback on planed changes or problems wich you<br/>
have with balance in game on official page wich exixt but its never updated<br/>
!! (look at quake they write all what is in work in one public letter .PLAN<br/>
and they are leader on mercat you dont need to hide all in fear of<br/>
concurents will hit your weak point they will find and try in any case )<br/>
<br/>
