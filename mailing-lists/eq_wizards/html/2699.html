<div id="ygrps-yiv-1057912257">Hi all guys,<br/>
it seems that OR we are all on hollidays OR we know all about wizzard :). I<br/>
don t receive more then 1 list all 2 days now :(<br/>
Come an guys, we need to wake up ! :)<br/>
On another point, i just read the new patch message.. Damn.... From the<br/>
begining, nothing as been change for the wizzards... They just change during<br/>
the patch , the casting time . I have tested BEFORE and after : no change<br/>
(that a clock can see, so it s surely a change of let s say 0,001 second or<br/>
something like that.In other words : nothing.<br/>
All patch just power up the race... Now the druid dot spel are fast like<br/>
hell, necro same. And us ?? From the beginning, we have major bug who are<br/>
not resolved and they do nothing for us...<br/>
Force shock is bugged cause he is resisted too much (and i am ok that he get<br/>
resisted so much IF he stun like he must do). The enstill spel doesn&#39;t work<br/>
(i have tested with root : root is 10 times more effective). I am a playing<br/>
a shaman and i think i will stop my wizzard... We have nothing funny : we<br/>
just level and wait for what ? Our dd spel nothing more, no buf, no pet, no<br/>
life tap, no shield,no dot, no sow, nothing cool except some gate spel...<br/>
That s so boring.. For solo from level 8 to 50 you root nuke nuke root nuke<br/>
nuke dead... Wow that s pretty funny :( :( :(.<br/>
What about our ae spel ? and pe spel ?? Did someone here use them ????<br/>
NOBODY...<br/>
<br/>
So guys, we were talking some weeks ago to petition.. Nothing has be done or<br/>
you just don t send the letter ???<br/>
<br/>
See you on karana<br/>
yakos level 25 wizzard AND dabou level 13 shaman<br/>
(playtime for wizzard : 20 days, for shaman , 2 days....)</div>
