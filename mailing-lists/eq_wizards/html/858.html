<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490965905">Sorry, I know this has been discussed before, but I will soon be level 8<br/>
and want to purchase just one new spell, saving up for level 12 spells.<br/>
What is the best DD spell? Was planning on Fire Bolt, but would Shock of<br/>
Ice be better? I heard it had a better damage per mana ratio, but does Fire<br/>
Bolt have better range? Thanks for any info.<br/>
