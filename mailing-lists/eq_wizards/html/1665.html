     The wonderfull world of twinking. In a way I dont care if people do this, I have seen lvl 15 in oracle robes which are found of of lvl 40ish mobs I think. But, what I dont like is how guilds &quot;take over&quot; an item spawn site to supply all of their lower lvls with items takeing away the chacne that others have to get the items.</div>
