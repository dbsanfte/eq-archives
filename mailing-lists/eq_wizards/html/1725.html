&gt;&gt; &gt; You&#39;re just upset<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; that she gets an advantage you didn&#39;t, right? Well, life is tough like<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; that.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Damn right I am upset.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Awww.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;  I play a limited amount of time and I have to compete with everyone else<br/>
&gt;&gt; in the game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Newsflash: no you don&#39;t. If you want to compete, fire up Half Life and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>compete for frags. There&#39;s<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;competition. EQ is not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;  At similar levels we should have the same ability to compete.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Says who? Do you have the same starting point in life as the rich kid<br/>
 </span></blockquote>across the street? No, you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;don&#39;t. As I said, life is tough like that. EQ doesn&#39;t stand for equal,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>buddy.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;  But with her<br/>
&gt;&gt; twinking I am at the disadvantage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;No! You are where you would be anyway. She has some advantage, but it&#39;s not<br/>
 </span></blockquote>an advantage OVER YOU.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Unless you are playing on Rallos Zek or +pvp you are very misguided as to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the true nature of EQ.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;  While she coasts yet another character to the upper levels<br/>
&gt;&gt; AT MY EXPENSE!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How exactly is it at your expense?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;  Yes I am upset and yes she should be told to play fair like the rest of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>us are<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; forced too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yeah, it&#39;s time for a new order! A revolution! Kind of like 1917, right?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Red Norrath&quot; does have a sound to it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Well, life is tough like<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; that. Whether she gets an advantage or not, is none of your business<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; because it doesn&#39;t really affect you.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; It does affect me.  It makes that many fewer creatures at my level<br/>
 </span></blockquote>available for me to kill in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; an HONORABLE way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Oh, come on! Are you saying you&#39;re having difficulty to find kills because<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of twinkers? The % of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;twinkers in the game is probably 5-10 MAX. Norrath is crowded, no doubt,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but don&#39;t blame twinkers<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;for hunting hardships.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;  This makes my job (an already difficult one) even more difficult and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; why twinking is the WORST POSSIBLE OFFENSE.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Uh, no. Don&#39;t you find kill stealing or Guild camping worse? Man, it looks<br/>
 </span></blockquote>like you&#39;re really fired<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;up about this, eh?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Listen, if you&#39;re on Solusek Ro, I might help you out, you know? Would<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; And remember, she had to work her<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; way to level 22 before that as well, so she is only giving her other<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Char something she rightfully earned.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; And just WHAT is your point?  Because she has one character at a high<br/>
 </span></blockquote>level and can play in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; areas that I cannot she has somehow earned the right to retard my low<br/>
 </span></blockquote>level characters<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; 22nd level.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As I said, the twinker&#39;s affect on hunting is negligible, at best. Can you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>prove the contrary?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; You are obviously a fool<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Obviously. I bow before your superior intellect, mighty one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; and most likely a twinker. I can only hope you are not on my server.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hah. I&#39;m level 13, and I have 60pp in the bank. All rightfully earned. I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>can hardly play enough with<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;one character, let alone two or more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ever hear the phrase &quot;I might disagree with your opinion, but I&#39;ll fight to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the death to let you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;voice it&quot;? Well this is the same. I might frown upon twinkers, but I&#39;ll do<br/>
