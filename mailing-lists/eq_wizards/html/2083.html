<div id="ygrps-yiv-1816978683">Oh yeah, almost forgot, to let you guys know, Familiars are a dumb idea,<br/>
I mean HELLO, its a SUMMONED THING. If you all want to summon go play a<br/>
Magician or crap, cmon, whats wrong with you ppl? We are WIZARDS! We<br/>
dont NEED anything else than what we have, also, on the subject of<br/>
grafix, yes, we have crappy grafix, thats really the only thing that is<br/>
kinda messed about a wizard, that and our spells not counting as &quot;dmg&quot;<br/>
that shows to other ppl :(<br/>
Well, I hope noone tries to do anything about familiars, this is why...<br/>
First, we ask Verant for stuff we know we wont get, like Familiars(wtf?<br/>
a SUMMON? for a WIZARD?) and crap. What do you think there gonna do if<br/>
we ever get a good idea? maybe they will look it over until another<br/>
class gets something fixed/boosted because all our comments up till then<br/>
would have been just dreams!(Remember the Boy who cried Wolf!?)<br/>
