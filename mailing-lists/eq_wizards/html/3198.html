&gt; &gt; Not really...if your fighting a steady stream of<br/>
&gt; blues your not going to<br/>
&gt; &gt; have the mana to keep up with the fighters...in<br/>
&gt; that kinda situation your<br/>
&gt; &gt; best use is to sit back and let a blast on the<br/>
&gt; tougher ones to soften them<br/>
&gt; &gt; up and wait for when the crap hits the fan and you<br/>
&gt; get a bad pull...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Absolutly, as a wizard, you are the groups panic<br/>
&gt; button.  Fighting a steady<br/>
&gt; stream of blues, a group that includes a cleric will<br/>
&gt; almost have no use for<br/>
&gt; us until the puller yells,  &quot;Oh Shit, I pulled<br/>
&gt; something big guys, get<br/>
&gt; ready&quot;  That is when we shine.  With our burns,<br/>
&gt; nobody can save the situation<br/>
&gt; faster than a wizard.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I disagree.  That&#39;s the situation where an Enchanter<br/>
really shines.  Wizards can help, but not as well. <br/>
Our best bet in that situation is Evac.<br/>

&gt; Hehe, wrote my comment before reading your next<br/>
&gt; comment,  I guess we agree<br/>
&gt; :)  One more point is that many classes get a<br/>
&gt; version of root.  If you are<br/>
&gt; going to burn the mob into oblivion make sure they<br/>
&gt; know to use it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re grouped with a Druid or Ranger, just forget<br/>
Root. Have them use Snare.  It&#39;s resisted much less,<br/>
and works a lot better.<br/>
<br/>
Enstill is good for crowd control, but, again,<br/>
Enchanters are much better at this than we.<br/>
<br/>
At least, it did up until a couple of months ago.  I<br/>
haven&#39;t grouped with either of those classes in a<br/>
really long while.<br/>
