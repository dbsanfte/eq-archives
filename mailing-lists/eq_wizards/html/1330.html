<div id="ygrps-yiv-2034053513">Well I have a question . . . what kind of dmg do we do at 20th?  I am 14th<br/>
now and am becoming disenchanted w/ the wizard class, tell me some of the<br/>
great things about being 20th please.   :-)<br/>
<br/>
My short term goal is 16th of course and I already have bought 4 spells and<br/>
they are in bank.<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  Where can I find Shock of Flame?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

It was hard to get to level 22.  We are doing the best/hardest damage at<br/>
level 20 and beyond.  I&#39;m glad I had to work my ass off in order to get to<br/>
level 20 as it was certainly an accomplishment.. I&#39;m also glad that it was<br/>
difficult so that there isn&#39;t a zillion Wizard&#39;s in the game.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very happy with the way the Wizard class has been made.  Sitting on your<br/>
ass is part of being a Wizard...  All the other points you made about a<br/>
Wizard IS part of being a Wizard...  Specialization will make certain spell<br/>
types more mana effecient (depending on what you put practice into).<br/>
