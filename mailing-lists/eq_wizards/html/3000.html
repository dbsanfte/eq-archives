&gt; Dear Vincent,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I realy only can see that you are in bad mode maybe you can think a bit<br/>
&gt; before replying, and if you dont have to say anything useful take a break.<br/>
&gt; Only useful was that you say about your warrior at 3 lv but other things<br/>
&gt; are realy dont help any discusion and your tone is realy arogant.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, I found Vincent&#39;s article to be interesting. He sure had a lot<br/>
more insight and understanding of the game than you. All you ever post<br/>
is how Wizards suck compared to other classes, and use out of whack<br/>
examples (like the warrior hitting for 70). Sure, some complaints are<br/>
justified, but you make it a regularity to reiterate the same things<br/>
over and over at set intervals.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t be going this hard on you would you have not attacked Vincent<br/>
for no apparent reason. But I do mean what I say. To use your own words,<br/>
Vincent&#39;s post was a lot more &quot;useful&quot; than yours.<br/>
