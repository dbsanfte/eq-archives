&gt; well, i don&#39;t think i can argue ur points about &quot;role-playing&quot; and how<br/>
&gt; things SHOULD be in the real world, because basically, i am more of a<br/>
&gt; computer game fanatic than an outright roleplayer (i like to play games<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think they have a right to be unhappy.  Verant took the system, which was<br/>
bad to begin with, and made it equally bad or worse, IMO.  And there&#39;s also<br/>
the issue that people don&#39;t like the rules of the universe getting changed<br/>
on them all of the time, regardless of the potential for improvement.  I<br/>
totally appreciate their frustration.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think it works out this simply.  My choice to not play on Rallos Zek<br/>
stems entirely from Verant&#39;s original implementation of PvP (i.e. no faction<br/>
hit) which you approve of.  So, yes, it already affected me.  I wanted to<br/>
play there, but chose not to deal with all of the non-role-playing types who<br/>
saw EQ as just massively multiplayer deathmatch Quake.  If Verant ever<br/>
modifies the rules on Rallos Zek to even remotely approximate a realistic<br/>
faction system, I&#39;ll be there in a heartbeat.<br/>
