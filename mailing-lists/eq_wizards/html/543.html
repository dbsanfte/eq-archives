<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336133367">I have done some experimenting with S.Step and distances and this is what I<br/>
have found.  You can only go as far as you can see in a flat line.  In<br/>
otherwords, if you are in a dungeon, or in a valley, you will no no further<br/>
than you can see, or somewhere else in the bottom of the valley.  If you are<br/>
standing on a hill peak though, or on a high flat spot in the middle of the<br/>
desert where you can see for a long distance, you will go MUCH further.<br/>
Take this into account when fighting something and you need to make a get<br/>
away.  The more of an open area you are in, or on higher ground, you will go<br/>
a much further distance, on average.<br/>
The problem is S.Step (and Fade for that matter) will not move you through<br/>
walls, of even move you to a higher elevation.  When you fade, you will get<br/>
moved to another spot of either the same elevation, or lower elevation, but<br/>
never higher.  This should help in having better success.<br/>
