<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1721404090">Well everyone knows that ice comet does 1100 damage or so its been said.<br/>
But what is the most powerful DD spell before ice comet?<br/>
<br/>
And is it only me are there certain spells (3rd circle column of frost comes<br/>
to mind) that when you cast them there is NO animation for?  When I was a<br/>
ranger I noticed this with invoke lightning as well.  You would cast and see<br/>
the monsters get hit for damage yet no animation.  Pretty sucky if you ask<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
So far the coolest animation I think we have on any spell throught the 3rd<br/>
circle is the measly little 1st circle spell, numbing cold.  The ring of<br/>
frost around the opponents slowly rising up into the air is way cool.  Our<br/>
rain spells look incredibly gay.  Shock of Lightning looks like a million<br/>
other spells including shock of blades (magician) and all the cleric spells<br/>
(strike, furor, smite).  I am big time in favor of seeing more unique<br/>
animations for spells.  Some might just call it eye candy and who cares, but<br/>
I think it add a lot to the RP aspects.  Unique looks for spells is what<br/>
makes them what they are, and what gives the caster that mysterious and<br/>
powerful air.<br/>

I think we have to quest to cast Ice comet. I mean you can cast it once then<br/>
you have to do a quest to cast it once more. Its a rumor so correct me if<br/>
anybody knows<br/>
