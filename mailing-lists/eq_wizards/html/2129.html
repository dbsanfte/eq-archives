&quot; wish I was a druid &quot;.. but then a few days later I am havign fun with my<br/>
wizard<br/>
yet again. But, I have 2 ideas, one is wizard-specific, other could apply<br/>
to ALL <br/>
class&#39;s.<br/>
  <br/>
First, idea #1 - a new wizard skill : Concentration<br/>
  <br/>
This skill would have a few effects. But in general this would<br/>
  <br/>
- a skill that can be used once every few seconds,<br/>
- When this skill is successfully used. It could have 1 of 2 effects (<br/>
comement on which one you would rather have )<br/>
  <br/>
a) Reduce the ammount of mana used by certian % depending on skill<br/>
b) Increase the ammount of damage that is dealt by a % depending on skill<br/>
or<br/>
c) Both A & B<br/>
  <br/>
.. Comments on which would be better BUT STILL KEEP BALANCE would be nice.<br/>
Sure, option C would be nice, but we need to keep in mind balance.<br/>
  <br/>
Also, should this increase the casting time? reduce it? how often should<br/>
this be able to be used?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
How about c) being Casting time?  If the concentration check is good the<br/>
spell goes off faster; if it flops, the spell takes longer to get off.<br/>
