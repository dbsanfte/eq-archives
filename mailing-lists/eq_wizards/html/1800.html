<div id="ygrps-yiv-450667038">Is there anybody on Veeshan that has the time to train me on languages?  I&#39;d <br/>
be willing to pay...although I am by no means rich. :P<br/>
Other then that, we can trade languages if I have something you don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, what are some of the required &quot;magic&quot; languages anyway?  It&#39;s <br/>
not only Old Erudian is it?  I&#39;ve only got Elvish and Gnome up to Excellent. <br/>
  Some of the others I only have average.  Funny how I picked up gnoll, <br/>
orcish, and others somewhere along the way.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Glad the twinky thread is over ;)<br/>
