This is my best tip so far...If you are in Najena and hunting Tenetacled<br/>
Terrors, root them at extream range.  You will know you are far enough<br/>
becuse you will have a hard time seeing your target.  Once rooted, move back<br/>
a lil farther and start nuking away.  Our casting range is nearly twice<br/>
theirs so if root/enstil holds, you wont even get a scratch.  This works for<br/>
levles 24 and up.  If root fails, remeber the way to zone and dont get lost<br/>
hehehe</div>
