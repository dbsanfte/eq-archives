<div id="ygrps-yiv-653603886">Get a runed totem staff. You can buy one from players for 20-30 pp or<br/>
camp out in Infected Paw to get one. Shaman Ren Rex there has it. It<br/>
gives you mana and allows you to hit magic creatures. A savant cap may<br/>
also be a good thing (about same price) depending on how you want to<br/>
play. It gives you +3 int/wiz to give you more mana. =)<br/>

&gt; If this question isn&#39;t appropriate for this list, let me apologize in<br/>
&gt; advance.... I don&#39;t see many questions like it....<br/>
&gt; Anyway,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m a lvl 12 Gnome wizard, have cloth armor, worn great staff, Sr.<br/>
&gt; Apprentice Robe and pretty much all the spells that I want (that I can buy).<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve got 25 plat or so in the bank and don&#39;t know what to spend it<br/>
&gt; on....invest in better armor? better staff? magic items? if so, what? don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know what&#39;s smartest. Would very much appreciate any advice anyone can give<br/>
&gt; me that wish&#39;s they&#39;d bought or didn&#39;t buy at my level. Thanx for any help<br/>
&gt; you can give me.<br/>
