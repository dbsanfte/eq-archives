<div id="ygrps-yiv-1407907891">Recieved this form another mailing list, thought it may be useful.<br/>

I too noticed that the Rune of Velious seemed to be an<br/>
odd rune, that was not used in any spell creation.<br/>
Many of us have been aware the Fire Spiral of Al&#39;Kabor<br/>
requires 2 runes, Nagafen and Al&#39;Kabor, and that this<br/>
spell is bugged with research, and fails to combine.<br/>
Well, I decided to take a chance, and combined the<br/>
Al&#39;Kabor with Velious. Bingo, I&#39;m now the proud owner<br/>
of the Fire Spiral of Al&#39;Kabor spell. :)<br/>
<br/>
I also had Energy Storm fail last night, didn&#39;t<br/>
combine properly. I used the last of the runes needed,<br/>
or I would have tried switching Velious into that mix<br/>
too.<br/>

I&#39;m still willing to send the spell list to anyone who wishes it, just<br/>
send me an E-Mail to the above address.  I&#39;m currently working on<br/>
putting it in other formats like PDF. (I HATE Frame Maker).  I&#39;ve gotten<br/>
very little in the way of updates, and would appreciate any help you<br/>
could provide.  So if you are waiting for friends, take a moment to<br/>
visit the wizard merchants and jot down the available spells, or time<br/>
the casting time of a few and post the info.  Thanx.<br/>
<br/>
The Petition has not made much headway, I&#39;ve sent it to EQ-Vault, and<br/>
Stratistics, but they have not posted it in the news section.  Keep at<br/>
them and please send them a copy if you are serious about it.  No<br/>
feedback from Verant either.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
