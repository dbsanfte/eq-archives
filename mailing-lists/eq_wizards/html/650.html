<div id="ygrps-yiv-1293378144">Yes, I get that often when fighting hand to hand and casting :)<br/>
The problem I see with getting attacked on the boat on the trip to Erudin<br/>
is that it&#39;s supposed to be safe, but you&#39;re still attacked, and by<br/>
underwater creatures while on deck, of all things.<br/>
I mean, getting killed by a shark while standing on the deck should not be<br/>
possible. This makes the whole trip from Queynos to Erudin a pain.<br/>

&gt; at that.  It happens to me all the time, while gating.. </span></blockquote></div>
