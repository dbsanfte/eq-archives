&lt;snip example of how red creatures resist our spells&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not all red creatures. I&#39;m level 13 and I was in befallen yesterday. I was<br/>
able to help with elf skeletons and ghouls with no problems, usually even doing<br/>
full damage. Dvinn is level 24 (I think) and that&#39;s 8 levels more than you. You<br/>
will always get resisted with such a high difference.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, it&#39;s Emperor Crush&#39;s castle. Dvinn is an ambassador, although I don&#39;t know<br/>
of who. The Dervishes, maybe? Maybe he&#39;s Dorn&#39;s older brother?<br/>
