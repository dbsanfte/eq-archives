<b>Subject:</b> ** SPOILER **  Help with Human Wiz Quests <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-126709276">I have found 2 different quests which I am having problems with.<br/>
<br/>
1.  Find Lydl Mastat outside of Freeport and get the locked book from<br/>
him.<br/>
I have tried to find him out both gates, in North Ro, and in East<br/>
Commanlands<br/>
and can&#39;t find him.  Where is he?  Does he only appear at certain<br/>
times?  I<br/>
have looked MANY times and can&#39;t find him.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Get the locked strongbox back.  I have found that the box is on an<br/>
island<br/>
which is straight out from the docks.  Is it possible to swim there or<br/>
do I need<br/>
a boat?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
