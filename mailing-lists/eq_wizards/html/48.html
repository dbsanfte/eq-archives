<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121166082">Hail and well met fellow Wizards of Norrath. This is Eantos the humble<br/>
leader of The Crafters of the New Vision on the Fennin Ro server. I would<br/>
just like to take this chance to intrudce myself. I am quite a avid fan of<br/>
research, and have scoured the lands in search of rare tomes. If anyone know<br/>
of certain vendors or adventurers that have these items, please contact me.<br/>
My e-mail address is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:williamb@...">williamb@...</a><br/>
Also, if anyone is interested in joing a guild check out<br/>

Fair well fellow adventurers, jouryney not alone for the lands of Norrath<br/>
are not kind to wandering wizards.<br/>
