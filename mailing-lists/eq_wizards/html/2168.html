<div id="ygrps-yiv-331416404">Hehe.  Yup, although it won&#39;t ruin my gaming experience to keep things as <br/>
they are...I think we are all missing out on one of the fun things about the <br/>
game: *looking cool* ;)   I was a little dissapointed (? sorry my spelling <br/>
is bad because I play too much :)  that the one of the strongest robes we <br/>
have to look forward to is that fluffy Observer robe that looks as if it was <br/>
out of the closet of Liberace.  yuck!<br/>
<br/>
Closest thing to being visually cool I&#39;ve seen is this Wizard I saw last <br/>
night carrying a pulsing rod (forget what it was called).  His wrist kept <br/>
pulsing with a luminescent light...neat!<br/>

&gt;leggings, skull of jen tra, different daggers and staff types (no new<br/>
&gt;graphics for them...warrior classes see differences in every<br/>
&gt;weapon..just about).<br/>
