&gt;&gt; Hi all guys,<br/>
&gt;&gt; it seems that OR we are all on hollidays OR we know all about wizzard :). I<br/>
&gt;&gt; don t receive more then 1 list all 2 days now :(<br/>
&gt;&gt; Come an guys, we need to wake up ! :)<br/>
&gt;&gt; On another point, i just read the new patch message.. Damn.... From the<br/>
&gt;&gt; begining, nothing as been change for the wizzards... They just change during<br/>
&gt;&gt; the patch , the casting time . I have tested BEFORE and after : no change<br/>
&gt;&gt; (that a clock can see, so it s surely a change of let s say 0,001 second or<br/>
&gt;&gt; something like that.In other words : nothing.<br/>
&gt;&gt; All patch just power up the race... Now the druid dot spel are fast like<br/>
&gt;&gt; hell, necro same. And us ?? From the beginning, we have major bug who are<br/>
&gt;&gt; not resolved and they do nothing for us...<br/>
&gt;&gt; Force shock is bugged cause he is resisted too much (and i am ok that he get<br/>
&gt;&gt; resisted so much IF he stun like he must do). The enstill spel doesn&#39;t work<br/>
&gt;&gt; (i have tested with root : root is 10 times more effective). I am a playing<br/>
&gt;&gt; a shaman and i think i will stop my wizzard... We have nothing funny : we<br/>
&gt;&gt; just level and wait for what ? Our dd spel nothing more, no buf, no pet, no<br/>
&gt;&gt; life tap, no shield,no dot, no sow, nothing cool except some gate spel...<br/>
&gt;&gt; That s so boring..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s boring, reading the same damn whining post over and over<br/>
&gt;and *over* again!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Even if I agreed with you I would have the good taste to STOP THE WHINING,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s obvious by now that posting it here does nothing for you. Just spawns <br/>
&gt;these<br/>
&gt;useless debates. You don&#39;t like wizards? Fine, don&#39;t play them, but do you<br/>
&gt;really think everyone needs to hear the same complaints for the 20th time?<br/>
<br/>

Maybe if you think, you will see that if so many people wining there is<br/>
something wrong? If we dont talk here about our problems i dont know where<br/>
we can tak if you send mail to verant only reply is that eventualy sombody<br/>
send your email to xxxx department. If you dont like this messages simply<br/>
dont read them i like to hear all problems whot other wizards have or think<br/>
to have.<br/>
