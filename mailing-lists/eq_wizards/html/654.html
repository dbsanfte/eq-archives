<div id="ygrps-yiv-129112748">Err.... not to be a party pooper, but ever seen Jaws? They can explain shark attacks any way they want. But probably the most glaring example of this is the inn just off the road in Western Karanas near the border to Northern Karanas. Was messing around with 2 other fellows looking for grizzlies back when I was 10th lvl. We stopped in the inn to resupply when a lioness strolls through the wall in the corner and starts to maul me. Then a lion started mauling another person so we finished off the lioness and proceeded to kill the lion. Suddenly I saw the text a hill giant hits Kebik for 90 pts of damage....a hill giant bashes Kebik for 50 pts of damage...dead. Then this guy starts in on me. hits me twice and I&#39;m still running, opened the door....he misses me...Take 5 steps and then I see the LOADING PLEASE WAIT..<br/>
<br/>
Me dead. Alright, I can understand a hill giant ripping off a roof and beating the crap out of us. That&#39;s acceptable...sort of...but the lions walking through the wall is just wrong. Am I making a point here? No. Probably not. I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is, yes there&#39;s glitches and bugs. I knew everything would not be totally worked out, because there&#39;s always new things that crop up and they&#39;ll eventually be worked out. I&#39;d still rather play with all the bugs and all, than not play is what it boils down to.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, while I&#39;m on the subject I&#39;ll plug myself.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone interested in joining a guild? If you&#39;re on Solusek Ro and are interested please /tell me or reply to this post via email to me. Don&#39;t post a reply because I&#39;m sure that will piss off a ton of people. We&#39;ve got basically 2 rules.<br/>
<br/>
1. Be helpful to other EQ players (rpging, and evil vs good issues aside I really can&#39;t think of any reason to be a prick to anyone lvls 1-7, we were all newbies once, and there&#39;s more coming. Unless they&#39;re complete losers, ummmm Hamblen a 3rd dwarf comes to mind.)<br/>
<br/>
2. No whining. This means no bitching and griping about graphic glitches, unfair monster tactics etc... /petition it, and move on.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s about it. See ya&#39;s !!<br/>
