<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710031309">Hi,<br/>
for me what you just explain is a big bug.. If you can go in a safe zone<br/>
WITHOUT zoning then it s because there is some kind of bug... Cause the<br/>
developpers have done all they can to avoid that : monster can hit you from<br/>
behind walls right ? Developpers have done this to avoid a &quot;safe zone&quot; in<br/>
dungeon..... So sorry to say you that, but you use an exploit :)<br/>
<br/>
Oh and yes who is ortallius ? and what is the loot ? <br/>
<br/>
on a other hand, for playing now my wizzard at a mid level (i am currenttly<br/>
21) and some other chars to low twenty (shaman)  , i must agree that wizzard<br/>
are a weak classe.. Not the weakest one in my mind but really a weak race (i<br/>
mean solo AND groupe). Have you ever played a druid ??? just test it....<br/>
They get the same DD as we have but with 5 level of difference... OH... at<br/>
level 21 i only use ligthening bolt never force shock ( a level 16 spel and<br/>
i will do it till 24...)..... but i have fun playing my wizzard cause they<br/>
are hard to keep alive, really hard :) . It s why i like them not cause of<br/>
the power (they don t have power:) ).<br/>
<br/>

p.s. i would appreciate if you DON T give the exact location of this hill<br/>
thanks (i don t know)<br/>
<br/>
re..ps cool petition :)<br/>

There are still many exploits in the game that they just don&#39;t have time to<br/>
fix.  So they are still in the game, and you can still get banned for using<br/>
them....  Believe me, i reported the one in Lavastorm the third day it was<br/>
released (along with tons of other ppl), yet they still have not fixed it<br/>
(all that happens is a GM comes around once a day or so and warns everybody<br/>
not to use it).<br/>
<br/>
But, i may be incorrect about &quot;the hill&quot; in South Ro.  the area in South Ro<br/>
that was originally mentioned may NOT be an exploit.  I spent some time this<br/>
morning killing Ortallius using &quot;the hill&quot; and it didn&#39;t seem like the<br/>
&quot;real&quot; exploits i&#39;ve seen in places like Lavastorm.  Ortallius could still<br/>
hit me, but if i ran up far enough on the hill, he could no longer hit me.<br/>
But he didn&#39;t just stand there and let me pound on him from a distance<br/>
either. As soon as I got to the area where he could no longer follow, he<br/>
would turn and run, not giving me enough time to cast on him from the safe<br/>
area.  So I would have to run back down the hill until he came after me<br/>
again, giving me just enough time to cast on him (but he would still tag me<br/>
as i finished my casting).  I guess it works just like a zone, without<br/>
actually having to zone.  I used it this morning, and was able to kill<br/>
Ortallius about 6 or 7 times this morning with a partner, but we probably<br/>
would NOT have been able to kill him without the help of the hill (at least<br/>
not without dieing once or twice, as he conned red a few times).  So, to<br/>
each his own, but I think I&#39;ll stay away from it just to be on the safe<br/>
side.<br/>
<br/>
But I did see some bright spots, as he didn&#39;t resist a single flame shock<br/>
(he was 2 or 3 lvls higher then me).  He did resist enstill every time, and<br/>
force shock about 75% of the time except when my enchanter friend cast<br/>
tashan...  And then my force shock went through for full dmg every time (has<br/>
anyone ever noticed that when force shock is not resisted, it goes for full<br/>
dmg every time???).  I wish they would give us tashan or something similiar.<br/>
What a great spell.<br/>
