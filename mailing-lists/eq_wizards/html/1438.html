&gt;Dear Gregory,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You hit he nail on the head, how many times have we seen a /shout for a<br/>
&gt;wizard..never. Verant need to do something about the mages, enchanters and<br/>
&gt;wizards. I think Ken has a point, combine the lot into one.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that a wizard is most hindered one i dont know if on realy high lvs<br/>
40 + you have advantages for your weeknes with wich we start but other<br/>
magic classes are much stronger at early levels like until 20.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&gt;them it sounded a great idea, I thought it was at the time too. But, the<br/>
&gt;reality is quite different, unfortunately.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The main problem is that our class in not ovious time saver as i can say a<br/>
cleric saves downtime by faster healing, a bard also can do it a druid not<br/>
only this but can make for faster onland travel and is strong at DD and<br/>
majority of players is not near lv where wizard start to be useful as lv<br/>
when you have group travel. Only solution for this is some type of skill<br/>
advancment where you can choose at a creation of caracter some skills wich<br/>
will you develop throu play like AC but this is to be seen as it is<br/>
implemented. But i like to see this idea also only we must admit that<br/>
classes are not finalized until now, lets say magicians pets after 20 lv<br/>
where out of game research comes a little time ago, specizlization on wich<br/>
we look as last chance to save a gameplay for us is not implemented yet.<br/>
there is much to see and maybe it will look as good as it is in<br/>
introduction book :-) <br/>
<br/>
The class solution against skill solutions can be made better, now there<br/>
are many many holes in sistem wich will need a time to get closed only is a<br/>
problem to see how many people will wait until then? <br/>

&gt;&gt; I was attracted to playing a wizard by the way the class was described in<br/>
&gt;&gt; the game&#39;s manual, but if I had to do it over again (and I won&#39;t because I<br/>
&gt;&gt; have already put a lot of time into my character, and want to play with my<br/>
&gt;&gt; friends who are of the same level as I), I would pick a druid or shaman<br/>
&gt;&gt; type character. They have great spells, which can also be cast on other<br/>
&gt;&gt; party members, and aren&#39;t so weak in weapons and AC as wizards are. I hate<br/>
&gt;&gt; it when I tell my friends about the spells I can get, only to find out they<br/>
&gt;&gt; can be cast only on myself (shielding, resistant skin, etc.) My ranger<br/>
&gt;&gt; friend casts Skin like Wood on my all the time, I have nothing to<br/>
&gt;&gt; reciprocate. I think wizards as a class are short changed, and have never<br/>
&gt;&gt; seen anyone do a /shout looking for a wizard to join with them as they do<br/>
&gt;&gt; for rangers, shamans, bards, etc. Just my 2 cents.<br/>
