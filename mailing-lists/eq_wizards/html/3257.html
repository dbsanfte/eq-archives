<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604121766">According to Bob:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t know what happened but I cant seem to get into the game anymore.<br/>
&gt; After I select my guy, I hit enter world and then after about a minute, I<br/>
&gt; get the &#39;Server not responding&quot; message.  I have reinstalled and repatched<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds like you&#39;re on the bad side of the Internet (all is relative, as<br/>
someone more famous than I said once).<br/>
<br/>
It happened twice for me since I got EQ. Both times, there was a banner<br/>
on the login server saying that either CERF.net had router problem, or<br/>
Earthlink &quot;customers&quot; had too. (I am not an earthlink customer, but somehow<br/>
my connectivity goes thru them when reaching CERF).<br/>
<br/>
Usual symptom: if you are on a UUNET server (old servers), try a CERFnet<br/>
server (a recent one). If you can get in, then you have &quot;transient&quot;<br/>
connectivity block. Sweat it out :(<br/>
<br/>
(my symptoms are usually: can&#39;t log in Tunare or Quellious. Click on Bertox,<br/>
 and I get in. I then switch off the computer and head to bed :)<br/>
