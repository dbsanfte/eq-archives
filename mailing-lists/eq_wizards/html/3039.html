<b>Subject:</b> Druids != Tanks <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-377858793"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; C: If you ment to mean that we should have more mana<br/>
&gt; than Druids, I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; see why.  Try playing one.  Once you get past the<br/>
&gt; 20s your pretty much a<br/>
&gt; mana only person.  Sure you can take a few extra<br/>
&gt; hits (like 2 or 3) and<br/>
&gt; maybe you can do a bit more damage in melee but its<br/>
&gt; not that much.  Not to<br/>
&gt; bash on Druids as I said earlier I like that class<br/>
&gt; but when stuff his<br/>
&gt; hitting for 50 to 70 damage with multiple attacks<br/>
&gt; Druid&#39;s don&#39;t last too long.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just a note: A good friend with whom I work plays a druid. At level 31,<br/>
he&#39;s still meleeing/nuking blues and blacks to death. For a yellow,<br/>
he&#39;ll usually kite it through one DoT, and then nuke/melee it. For reds<br/>
up to the Resist cap, he just kites them.<br/>
<br/>
True, he&#39;s nowhere near as good a tank as, say, an equivelant level<br/>
ranger. But that&#39;s still a lot less fragile than my lvl 20 wizard (who<br/>
started out 9 levels ahead...sigh) has ever seen.<br/>
<br/>
(Note on my note: no opinion here, just a clarification)<br/>
