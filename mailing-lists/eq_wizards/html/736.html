<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728346465">Hail and well met fellow Wizards,<br/>
This is Eantos, Guildmaster for the Crafter of the New Vision. I was just curious if anyone has a Excellent rating in the following languages:<br/>
1) Old Erudian<br/>
2) Lizardman<br/>
3) Gnoll<br/>
4) Any other languages that can not be acquired without putting practices into them. (For Example I already know Barbarian, Erudian, Elvish etc)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone here has these languages at Excellent rating, and plays on the Fennin Ro server please contact me so we can maybe exchange languages, or let me purchase your wisdom. My e-mail address is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:williamb@...">williamb@...</a><br/>
Additionaly if anyone is interested in joining The Crafters of the New Vision please check out our webpage at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ucsub.colorado.edu/~williamb">http://ucsub.colorado.edu/~williamb</a><br/>
Journey well, and stay close to the path for many a wizard has lost his/her life to the great monsters of Norrath.....<br/>
