<div id="ygrps-yiv-146345835">I didn&#39;t use Bind wound until about lvl 19, I spent about 10pp and filled a<br/>
backpack full of bandages.  Bind wound has Saved my life more that I can<br/>
imagine.  This is the way it works:  Bind wound will heal you or another<br/>
player up to 50% of their health.  I have mastered the skill (took me about<br/>
4 lvls fighting the Aviak Guards in Lake Rathe).  I can do about a quarter<br/>
to half a bub of health per bandage depending on who I am healing.  Of<br/>
course those warriros will take a few more bandages but us wizes I get close<br/>
to a half a bub of hp healed per wrap.  Hope this helps.<br/>

&gt; es you will have to put some points into the bind<br/>
&gt; wound skill.  One or two is enough.  At first you wont<br/>
&gt; see much healing done per bandage but as your skill<br/>
&gt; increase, you will heal more damage and use fewer<br/>
&gt; bandages.  I&#39;m not sure where the amount healed per<br/>
&gt; bandage tops out, I have heard 25 poits per bandage<br/>
&gt; but I dont know that for sure.  They are kind of<br/>
&gt; expensive to buy at ove 5 sp each and I generally buy<br/>
&gt; them 30 at a time.  If you are poor, try to find a<br/>
&gt; cleric or mage and get them to summon some for you.  I<br/>
&gt; go around healing eveyone that will let me.  It&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; good way to make friends and to increase my skill.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s at 44 now and has a long way to go to max<br/>
&gt; out..I&#39;m almost lvl 14 now.<br/>
