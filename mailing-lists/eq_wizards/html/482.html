<div id="ygrps-yiv-478043669">Well, you&#39;re really in the wrong area to buy Runed Staves.  Crushbone is<br/>
about as far away from the staves as you can get ;)  I&#39;m not saying no one<br/>
ever sells them there, but if you were to relocated closer to Qeynos, you&#39;d<br/>
probably have more luck as the staves are found in that neck of the woods<br/>
and are usually sold in that area.  Good Luck ;)<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m desperately looking for a Runed Totem Staff.  I know there out there,<br/>
&gt; but I&#39;ve been trying to find someone willing to sell for the last 3 days<br/>
&gt; with no luck.  If you have one and you want to sell it, give me a /tell.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; have been hanging out in Crushbone on the Povar Server from midnight to 5<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; 6:00 am PST.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
