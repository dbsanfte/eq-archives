<br/>
there are a couple that i know of, these are in CB.<br/>
<br/>
1) Prayer Cloth of Tunare (it&#39;s a shoulder pad that Wiz&#39;s CAN wear. AC 3 +3<br/>
Wisdom)-<br/>
<br/>
Here are some keys to solving this quest. The main NPC&#39;s you need to talk to<br/>
are the Dwarven Smith and the Elven Priest in the Slaver<br/>
Shack (West Side of CB)<br/>
Items you&#39;ll need are the Magic Ringmail Tunic (From Emperor Crush) and the<br/>
Bracers of Battle (From Orc Warlord)<br/>
Start by talking to the Dwarven Smith and use some key words like Emperor,<br/>
Taskmaster, Warlord etc.. <br/>
<br/>
2) Screaming Mace (don&#39;t think Wiz&#39;s can use this but i&#39;ve seen it sell for<br/>
over 100P)<br/>
<br/>
This is a continuation of Quest 1 above. Once you get the Prayer Cloth make<br/>
note of what the Elven Priest says to you. You will have to<br/>
give up the Prayer Cloth to get the Screaming Mace though :)<br/>
<br/>
good luck.<br/>

&gt; Hello all.  As welcomes seem to be the order of the day, I will add mine =<br/>
&gt; to the list.  I am Shadowwalker, High Elf Wizard on the Karana server, =<br/>
&gt; currently at level 11.  I have been spending time around the Steamfont =<br/>
&gt; Mino cave with my guild, though we recently went exploring a bit in =<br/>
&gt; Dagnot&#39;s Cauldron, which is intimidating to say the least.  Really neat =<br/>
&gt; looking though.  We also spend time in Butcherblock and Lesser Faydark =<br/>
&gt; occationally as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do have a question in case someone here knows.  Does anyone know of =<br/>
&gt; quests in Faydwer that can be taken on, besides the wolf pelt one?<br/>
