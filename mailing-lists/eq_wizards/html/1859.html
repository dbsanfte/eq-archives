I agree, shouting is not the way to get a group...  Three main reasons:<br/>
1) A LOT of people turn off shouts and OOCs altogether<br/>
2) A LOT of people just ignore them or don&#39;t take the time to consider them<br/>
seriously.<br/>
3) You can target individuals who match your level and a complimentary<br/>
skillset.  They are much more likely to read a Tell and take the time to<br/>
consider your request more seriously...  I exclusively use Tells now and<br/>
have acceptable success rate.<br/>
<br/>
I also think HOW you ask is very important.  Being friendly with at least a<br/>
&quot;Hail &lt;PC Name&gt;!&quot;  and other friendly roleplaying-like comments is much more<br/>
likely to get you a group than &quot;Need a wizard?&quot;, &quot;Wanna group?&quot;, and other<br/>
curt requests.<br/>
<br/>
ON LARGE GROUPS AND EXP<br/>
I disagree with those who say you MUST go after whites and up with a 5-6<br/>
member group...  The best three hour exp gains I ever achieved were only<br/>
fighting blues.  If blues are abundant in your hunting grounds, you can keep<br/>
them coming (Ranger or two) with ZERO downtime for the group.  Constant<br/>
pulls of even blues will net you incredible exp gains, have done it several<br/>
times in outdoor zones in the Karanas with large groups and a Ranger.  I<br/>
always shake my head at people in game who say &quot;we like small groups, better<br/>
exp&quot; in such areas.  (abundant prey is key here obviously)<br/>
<br/>
I love to both group and solo, I think you should experience the best of<br/>
both styles, give it a try.<br/>
Give me a tell if you want to group sometime ))<br/>

I find this almost unbelievable.  Not only do I not have problems grouping, <br/>
but when I join a party it usually move up to higher level creatures.  We <br/>
are not useless or unappreciated on the Bristlebane server at least.  <br/>
Perhaps you live in a heathen land (grin).<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I never shout for grouping.  I do a /who 14 (one level below me)<br/>
<br/>
and ask individually.  I have never needed to ask more than 3 people before <br/>
grouping.<br/>

&gt;As far as I can tell the wizard is pretty much useless and I have put him <br/>
&gt;on the side because I can&#39;t solo (tried<br/>
&gt;many a time) and I can&#39;t find a party that wants me.<br/>
