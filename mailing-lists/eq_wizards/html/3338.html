<div id="ygrps-yiv-824453676">Well, to help you out the robes are obtained by killing the Oracle. He&#39;s on an island straight ahead and to the right of the sisters island if you&#39;re facing the ocean on the dock.<br/>
<br/>
However, his 40th lvl paladin buddy might have something to say about you beating on his pal. Take a group to whomp on them. P.S. this is the same island with the goblins.<br/>
