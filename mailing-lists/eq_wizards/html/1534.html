<b>Subject:</b> Idea for language class... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335405915">I think the language class should be held on the boat that goes from<br/>
Faydwer to Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
Classes on the boat could have lots of advantages:<br/>
<br/>
*  People can wait at the docks and hop on or hop off as needed.<br/>
*  Convientent for people already traveling between Fawdwer and Freeport<br/>
*  No spells<br/>
*  Plenty of fishing available<br/>
*  Boat zones periodically so skills can be checked<br/>
*  A wide variety of people ride the boat, so it may be possible to pick up<br/>
other languages that you didn&#39;t plan on.<br/>
<br/>
* And lastly, I think its just a really novel idea!  :)<br/>
