<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;NO NO NO....it would be pointless you want items rare it will make economy<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see it my friend.  Making everyone sit for hours at end for an item <br/>
seems like the wrong approach if all they want to do is drive up the <br/>
economy.  I know this isn&#39;t a single-player game, but it&#39;s based on the same <br/>
model....I&#39;d be pissed off as hell if I killed a level boss only to find out <br/>
it didn&#39;t carry what I wanted and I got nothing out of it.<br/>
<br/>
Can you give me an example of how I wouldn&#39;t like it?  ;)<br/>
