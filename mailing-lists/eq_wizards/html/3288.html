<div id="ygrps-yiv-1925539359">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Just discovered that Elven Wine gives a small mana regen boost. My alcohol tolerance is so low though I take an INT hit when I use it, so I only do it when mana is really low, so by time I am FM my INT has recovered too. Never thought I would be using alcohol like warriors do for STR boost, so neglected to build alcohol tolerance. But now it is in upper 20&#39;s and INT hit is not as bad, and recovers faster. Anyway, it is like a poor cousin to Clarity, but helps a bit when you are soloing and want mana back ASAP.<br/>
