<div id="ygrps-yiv-721056922">Ah...neat, something I&#39;ve never tried in all my young Wizard&#39;s life.  How <br/>
does the bind wound skill work?  I think I tried it once some levels back <br/>
but it didn&#39;t work so I gave up. ;)  A assume I should pump in a couple <br/>
points into the skill to get it started?  About how much healing does it <br/>
accomplish per try?  Time for me to buy a handful of bandages and try again <br/>
I guess...<br/>
<br/>
Hey, another question I have for everybody out of curiosity:  now that <br/>
specialization has kicked in...what does everybody have in mind for that?  I <br/>
would think it the most popular approach to specialize in nuking <br/>
abilities...but would any of you have the need to specialize in something <br/>
else and why? ;)<br/>

it<br/>
has saved me and others countless times.  It also saves your healers a &gt;lot <br/>
of<br/>
mana if everyone is at 50% health before the healer finsihes the job.  &gt;Well<br/>
these are my thoughts, i may bot be the most pwerful wizard in Norrath, &gt;but <br/>
I am<br/>
wel thought of and I can live withthat.<br/>
