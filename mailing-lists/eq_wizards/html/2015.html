&gt;I have an idea. All the other spellcasting classes have pets (including<br/>
&gt;hybrids with their charms). Instead of getting a pet, since we are so<br/>
&gt;mana dependent ( and the other classes have pets which do WAY more for<br/>
&gt;the mana then we can do with DD over time) we get a familiar.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A familiar is similar to a pet ( a MOB that would follow us ) but it<br/>
&gt;wouldn&#39;t be for battle. It would act as a mana battery increasing our<br/>
&gt;total mana. It would cast a lot more mana to cast than it gives us. If<br/>
&gt;it dies, we lose the amount of mana that it gives us and maybe damage us<br/>
&gt;a bit. It will not attack or defend. It will attract the frenzy of<br/>
&gt;intelligent MOBs but it will also turn invisible with us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It could be a small cat, dog, skunk, whatever (random?) and we would get<br/>
&gt;maybe 3 or 4 throughout our ranks that have increasing amount of mana.<br/>
&gt;This would offset a lot of our complaints on being a unique class, being<br/>
&gt;able to compete, etc. Plus it would be fun! Wizards throughout lore have<br/>
&gt;used familiars to aid them in their studies. Since we rely ENTIRELY on<br/>
&gt;our mana to survive (unlike others who have permanent pet to aid) this<br/>
&gt;would help us get that extra root off and run, or that last blast to get<br/>
&gt;the 2nd blue.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What do you think? I know it&#39;s unlikely it will happen, but it sure<br/>
&gt;sounds like a good idea :) And it would make us unique and it would<br/>
&gt;enhance our artillerly challenged butts :P<br/>

&gt;&gt; The rumor is that bloodstone rings double the healing rate for Warriors and<br/>
&gt;&gt; warriors only, since they are the PURE melee class... Well we are the PURE<br/>
&gt;&gt; magic class. We&#39;re the only ones that basically have no melee skills or no<br/>
&gt;&gt; pet to melee for us. Maybe a faster mana regen could be put in, but I like<br/>
&gt;&gt; the meditation idea better.<br/>
