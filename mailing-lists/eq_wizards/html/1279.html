<div id="ygrps-yiv-565701026">I am posting this to both newsletters because I have seen this question pop up <br/>
on both.  The first issue I will discuss is Languages.<br/>
<br/>
As far as I have ever seen, I have never bot a skill raised from speaking the <br/>
native tounge to an NPC.  I have found that no matter what language I &#92;&#39;hail&#92;&#39; <br/>
them in they always respond in Common.  I think this because I understand <br/>
everything that they say, if it was a language that I am awful in wouldn&#92;&#39;t I<br/>
not <br/>
understand??  Also wouldn&#92;&#39;t this become an exploit?? Imaging all of us wizards <br/>
in the store by the bank in Felwithe, just saying &#92;&#39;Hail&#92;&#39; over and over again <br/>
in say Elder Elvish, to get the NPC to spam us.  Would drive everyone nuts, and <br/>
probably crash the zone.  So I am unsure as to if listening to an NPC would <br/>
really work.  Also has anyone actually seen the &#92;&#39;your language skill increase&#92;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
after spaming the NPC and the whole zone for that matter.  I am very good at <br/>
languages and have in my time learned Old Erudian, Elder Elvish, Elvish, Tier <br/>
Dal, Barbarian, Halfling, Dwarvish, and Gnoll.  Never once have I got a increase<br/>
<br/>
from a NPC.  Please clarify this issue for me please, would love to learn more <br/>
and faster of course.<br/>
<br/>
Now there seems to be some questions here on the skills of melee.  I don&#92;&#39;t <br/>
claim to know the calculations, but I know how to max them all.  I started with <br/>
the dagger of course, got it up to 22 or so, then got my hand to hand up to <br/>
about 18 for the heck of it.  I then got staffs, first a one handed that is up <br/>
to about 25 or so, this was my travel, backup weapon which was lost when a <br/>
skeleton took a dislike to me in lesserfaydarke (was bound to qeynos) Now my <br/>
main stay weapon is a 2h staff.  I have that skill up to about 38 right now.  I <br/>
got a giant snake fang the other day fighting in Paw.  Before that I had decided<br/>
<br/>
to increase my piercing and had a summonded dagger.  It took well over 45min and<br/>
<br/>
aobut 300 melee swings of the peircing weapon before I saw a single advancement,<br/>
<br/>
then it flew up to 31 or so.  For ahwile I though maybe it was never going to <br/>
raise but my perseverance paid off and it did, so I am going to try and max my <br/>
pierce, find a 1h blunt and max that.  Then go back to my favorite 2h staff.  So<br/>
<br/>
all it takes for you skills is patience.  Yes if you haven&#92;&#39;t used it in a great<br/>
<br/>
time it takes alot of use before you start to see skill in it again, kind of <br/>
like skiing or biking, hehe.<br/>
