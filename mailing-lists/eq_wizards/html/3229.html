<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145718759">Hi all, <br/>
<br/>
Just turned 29 and was so looking forward to using Bonds of Force spell to &quot;kite&quot; mobs (well, blast and run anyway), but I am getting a lot of resists with blue griffenes,and when it is not resisted it only seems to hold few seconds, unlike druids or rangers low level snare spell which lasts a long time.  Can anyone else with more experience with this spell give any advice? Thanks.<br/>
