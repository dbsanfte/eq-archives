<div id="ygrps-yiv-267735383">Well I guess it&#39;s time i should introduce myself. My char name is Saleen, i&#39;m<br/>
currently a Lvl 16 High Elf Wiz <br/>
on the Xegony server. I run this list and the EQ_Xegony list. <br/>
<br/>
As most of you know by now this list is NOT moderated.<br/>
So a couple of things i would like to ask of the community when posting to this<br/>
list. <br/>
<br/>
1) Please keep the language clean.<br/>
2) NO question is a dumb question so please don&#39;t flame or harrass people that<br/>
ask questions which you might feel is stupid.<br/>
3) Some people consider posting information about Quest&#39;s , unique items etc..<br/>
to be Spoilers. So to respect the rights of those<br/>
people, if you should send in anything that is or may be considered a Spoiler<br/>
please add **Spoiler** to the subject so that anyone<br/>
who doesn&#39;t want to read information on Spoilers can just delete the mail. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s pretty much it. Have fun and let me know if there is anything i can do<br/>
to help you enjoy your stay more in this community.<br/>

&gt; Hello all.  As welcomes seem to be the order of the day, I will add mine =<br/>
&gt; to the list.  I am Shadowwalker, High Elf Wizard on the Karana server, =<br/>
&gt; currently at level 11.  I have been spending time around the Steamfont =<br/>
&gt; Mino cave with my guild, though we recently went exploring a bit in =<br/>
&gt; Dagnot&#39;s Cauldron, which is intimidating to say the least.  Really neat =<br/>
&gt; looking though.  We also spend time in Butcherblock and Lesser Faydark =<br/>
&gt; occationally as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do have a question in case someone here knows.  Does anyone know of =<br/>
&gt; quests in Faydwer that can be taken on, besides the wolf pelt one?<br/>
