<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266457148">Hi all, I&#39;ve got a few questions about some sights I&#39;ve seen in the<br/>
Butchersblock zone on Faydwer.  Hopefully some of you may know the stories<br/>
behind these places.<br/>
<br/>
- There&#39;s a giant chessboard where undead chess pieces spawn.   Anyone know<br/>
the story/history behind this?  <br/>
<br/>
- This zone has a golden tower out in the middle of nowhere.  You can go<br/>
into it, but there&#39;s nothing there (at least nothing when I went into it).<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if anything spawns here or not.<br/>
<br/>
- There&#39;s a place there called the Orc Totem, a large totem pole in a<br/>
fairly small valley.  Orc Oracles and Ceturions spawn there regularly.<br/>
I&#39;ve been told that this is where D&#39;Vinn trained the orcs in the arcane<br/>
arts.  The hole in this story is D&#39;Vinn.  He&#39;s a rogue, not a mage - what<br/>
would he know about trainning people in the arcane arts?  <br/>
<br/>
- There is the ruins of a temple or something (a whole bunch of columns,<br/>
standing and fallen) where skeletons spawn.  There&#39;s a merchant there that<br/>
sells Druid spells.  What&#39;s the story behind the temple; when did it fall<br/>
and who did it fall to?<br/>
<br/>
- There are two Orge NPC wandering around Butchers Block, Corflunk and<br/>
Zachume(sp?).  The Ogre lands are in the southern part of Antione.  What<br/>
are these two doing here in Butchersblock?  Zachume(sp?) seems to be a<br/>
druid or something - a possible connection with the temple ruins mentioned<br/>
above?<br/>
<br/>
- A friend of mine found a huge stone face carved into the wall of a<br/>
shallow cave way out in the middle of nowhere.  She was alone and because<br/>
it was so isolated and such a long walk, she didn&#39;t stick around to see if<br/>
anything spawned there.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There is either a great story here or evidence of programmers dropping<br/>
acid. =)<br/>
