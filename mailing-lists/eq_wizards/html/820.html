<div id="ygrps-yiv-544421735">Gack, thanks.  I looked all over the Main spell shop.  I guess its possible<br/>
that I missed them.  Looks like I am headed back to Ak.  Well I&#39;m almost<br/>
16th (half way through 15th) so i guess I will wait till then.<br/>
<br/>
If they were in another part of the city please let me know so I don&#39;t have<br/>
to go all over the place.  Double thanks.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Does anyone know if I can buy a new set of Wizard&#39;s Robes in Freeport?<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;I&#39;m in Rivervale now, and none of the shops seems to be selling robes.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;I know I can find them in Erudin, but that&#39;s a long trip, and I think<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Freeport is just a bit closer.  I don&#39;t care about the color (although<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;I prefer the red ones from Erudin).  I just need robes that will fit<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;an Erudite.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Aznyin<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Level 12 Erudite Wizard<br/>

&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Yes you can get robes in Freeport.  They sell two types one is Jr.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Apprentice Robes and the other are Sr. Apprentice robes.  I think the Sr<br/>
&gt;&gt; ones cost just under 5 plat but have an AC of 6 and also give some mana.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Not much but something is better than nothing.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; The kicker of it is that I am a GNOME.  I have been to every city.  Even<br/>
&gt;&gt; the Troll and oger city with other characters.  There re NO Gnome sized<br/>
&gt;&gt; robes.  Not even in Ak&#39;Akanon.  I lost my guild robe when I was first<br/>
&gt;&gt; starting out.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Granted my Cloth Tunic has a better AC but I still would like to have a<br/>
&gt;&gt; robe, even if its just for show.  Has anyone found a Gnome Sized Robe.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Actually I think they sell one for Magicians Only in Freeport that a Gnome<br/>
&gt;&gt; could wear, but that kind a leaves my Wizard out of the picture......<br/>
