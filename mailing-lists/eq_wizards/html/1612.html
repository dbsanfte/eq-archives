<div id="ygrps-yiv-283626834">According to Rich Mulawa:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; camper .... err seller).  I have seen simple pieces of netted at <br/>
&gt; starting prices of 30pp!  As for the majority which are never <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s pure insanity. At 8th, I was able to make a run to Innothule.<br/>
I made 3 runs overall, and died once entering South Ro... and never in<br/>
Innothule proper, to grab netted. Played 5-6 hours there total, and<br/>
came back with about 20 pieces of netted, including 5 shirts (yikes),<br/>
1 pair of gloves, sleeves, caps, girth (belt), and so on.<br/>
<br/>
While I was there, I also acted as tourist guide to all the 15+ levels<br/>
chars that came in, saw me meditating at the entrance of the zone and<br/>
asked &quot;do you know where Guk is?&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Note that netted, except pants, and shirt, is useless for elven<br/>
wizards: it&#39;s the same AC and weight as small cloth, which they can<br/>
wear (ok, it has &#39;magic item&#39; stamped on it). Good for humans and<br/>
erudite tough. Gloves is another matter: it is absolutely necessary<br/>
for monks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey, that&#39;s me!<br/>
Unless you are powergaming and twinking, I wouldn&#39;t expect you to have<br/>
much more than that at that level. The only magical items I have beside<br/>
one woven pants I got are a pair of dervish rings, since those can be<br/>
gotten at bargain prices in North Ro (1pp for a pair is the max I&#39;ve<br/>
seen).<br/>
