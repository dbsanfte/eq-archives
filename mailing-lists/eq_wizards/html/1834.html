<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030152530">I agree thet our spells need a lower resistance against reds, but i dont<br/>

higer reds and us nuking after this? maybe this was idea of vereant crew,<br/>

&gt;Don&#39;t mean to bash you, but this is *not* a solution.  I am at level 16 and<br/>
&gt;I notice that the higher I get, the less and less well I fare in melee.  I<br/>
&gt;have a runed totem staff as well and I can hit ok against blue creatures,<br/>
&gt;but against a red where my spells are being resisted I can barely even<br/>
&gt;scratch the mob in melee.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ok, had to start a new paragraph for my rant...  Verant is speaking out of<br/>
&gt;both sides of their mouth.  On one side they encourage us to group saying<br/>
&gt;that our root doesn&#39;t need to be reliable because we should be grouping.<br/>
&gt;But then when we go and form a group that is strong enough to take on reds<br/>
&gt;(and lets face it any full group of 6 players can EASILY take on reds that<br/>
&gt;will resist offensive spells) we wizards are about as useful as a toddler<br/>
&gt;with a stick.  At level 16 my only real capability was to free those who<br/>
&gt;were rooted and couldnt back off with my cancel magic spell (which almost<br/>
&gt;every other magic using class has as well, BTW).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I TOTALLY sympathize with the orignator of this thread.  I was in unrest<br/>
&gt;last night in a large group and we fought lots of reds that my spells had no<br/>
&gt;effect on.  It is the worst feeling to just sit there useless and watch your<br/>
&gt;group getting beat on.  I could cast cancel magic (which was only needed on<br/>
&gt;1 occasion in 3 hours) and my o&#39;keils radiation (the damage shield I got at<br/>
&gt;level 4 which does a measly 2 damage).  With my runed totem staff I could<br/>
&gt;barely scratch any creature that could resist my spells, so I was basically<br/>
&gt;just there sucking xp.  Sure against the few evens and blues we faught I was<br/>
&gt;wonderful, but in a group of 6 people you will have to fight blues and evens<br/>
&gt;all day long to get decent xp.  Big groups are *supposed* to go after hard<br/>
&gt;creatures, yet in these cases the wizard becomes the most useless class<br/>
&gt;while EVERY (and I do mean EVERY) other class can still be VERY useful!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now I won&#39;t just cite a problem but also suggest a solution.  The solution<br/>
&gt;is either to give us weak spells that cannot be resisted (the necros already<br/>
&gt;have one it&#39;s the lifetap series), make our DD spells less resisted, but do<br/>
&gt;less damage against higher level creatures, or even better still give us<br/>
&gt;some utility spells (buffs?  damage shields?  spheres of protection?) that<br/>
&gt;can be cast on party members.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s not hard for anyone who groups in big groups to see that wizards become<br/>
&gt;the most useless member.  It&#39;s no wonder it takes hours to find a group<br/>
&gt;because a cleric, druid, bard, ranger, warrior, rogue, paladin, magician,<br/>
&gt;enchanter, necromancer, or shaman (gee thats every single class isnt it?) is<br/>
&gt;more useful than a wizard when fighting tough monsters in a large group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Am I just not seeing something right here?  Does verant want me to go back<br/>
&gt;to soloing?  I am very confused here maybe someone else can shed some light<br/>
&gt;on this but it sounds like when we do what Verant wants we Wizards get the<br/>
&gt;short end of the stick.<br/>

&gt;All I can offer you now, is get a Runed Totem Staff and whack away. I<br/>
&gt;usually do a good 16-19 dmg at level 13. My miss to hit ratio is bad, of<br/>
&gt;course, so this is not as good as it sounds.<br/>
