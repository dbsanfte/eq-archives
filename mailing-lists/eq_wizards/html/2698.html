<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838369822">no, ur not dreaming...  at least it&#39;s not a unique dream :)<br/>
<br/>
I wish they would add more robes for lvl 10-25 (some cool ones specific to<br/>
wizards or caster only...  and not the thurm/goss robes... those suck) and<br/>
add more magical armor (not jewelery, but legs, arms, feet, hands, cape,<br/>
etc...) for casting classes only between lvl 10-25.  whether they&#39;re found<br/>
on NPC&#39;s, through quests, named mobs, etc...  just give us something to look<br/>
for other than woven.  sure, once we all hit 30+, we can start questing for<br/>
some of those cool and rare items we see selling on ebay for gobs of cash,<br/>
but until then, we don&#39;t really have much to look forward to.  here is a<br/>
list of INT/Mana items that i have obtained from lvl 15 to about lvl 22...<br/>
none through quests though.<br/>
<br/>
RTS (2h staff, +5 Mana +5 HP)<br/>
Golden Ear Stud x2 (+3 INT)<br/>
Polished Bone Hoop (+10 Mana)<br/>
Black Iron Medallion (+3 INT +3 WIS)<br/>
Gold Star Necklace (+4 INT -- Jeweler)<br/>
Ruby Pendant (+1 INT)<br/>
Ivory Bracelet (+20 Mana +3 AGI)<br/>
Jade Electrum Bracelet (+10 Mana +10 HP -- Jeweler)<br/>
Savants Cap (+3 INT +3 WIS)<br/>
Star Rose Engagement Ring x2 (+2 INT -- Jeweler)<br/>
Skull of J`hen Tra (+20 Mana +3 Sv Magic)<br/>

&gt;Is it just me or is this list slowing down lately?  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In the interest of getting some discussion going again, anybody know any<br/>
&gt;good mid-level quests suitable for 20ish Wizards?  Things have been slowing<br/>
&gt;down for good &#39;ol LimDul lately and I&#39;m looking around for something else<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sometimes I wish Verant had more items for us to find...we all know the<br/>
&gt;items everyone wants (ie.  Observer Robe/Staff, Shimmering Orb, etc)  Too<br/>
&gt;bad there weren&#39;t enough variety of items so that we don&#39;t have to all camp<br/>
&gt;for the same things.  Imagine if there were several different varieties of<br/>
&gt;Observer robes or Different colors of Orbs? Maybe just adjust the stats<br/>

&gt;to keep butting heads looking for the same things....only to find you look<br/>
&gt;like everyone else once you get it.  :(  I would think the above types of<br/>
&gt;changes wouldn&#39;t drastically be difficult under the current game<br/>
&gt;engine...nor would they ruin game balance...or would they?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I can see their rationale in limiting &quot;rare&quot; items to only 1 NPC.  But<br/>
&gt;placed in the perspective of 1500 on a server, that poor NPC is typically<br/>
&gt;going to be camped by everyone who wants that item.  It would be nice to<br/>
&gt;provide other items that one might choose that would work in lieu of<br/>
