<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648310390">Flowing black robes are kinda tough to get.  You have to go into the dungeon Najena in Lavastorm and kill Najena herself to get one.  I don&#39;t know if there are any other places to acquire them in Norrath because I haven&#39;t been everywhere yet.  Myself, being a 14th level wiz, am unable to compete in the dungeon too far from the first room.  There are greater skels, ogre guards/officers/captains and tentacle terrors, black widows, earth/mist ele&#39;s and such.  You would need a good sized (4 maybe 5) group of folks your level and above.  By the time you hit level 25-28 I think its pretty easy going from what I can see, but you would still need back up since we are melee-free pretty much at that point.  The robe is random on Najena from what I understand as well.  And there are 3 (? correct me if I&#39;m wrong) NPCs back there.. Najena, Drezla and one other..... that is if you get that far.  Might be fun to try.. but bind yourself outside the dungeon zone so you don&#39;t have to run a zillion miles to get back if Najena is the only place to get this item.<br/>

    I wonder how fast I&#39;d get banned if I setup my email to forward my emails from this mailing list to Verant. : )<br/>

    Now, so this isn&#39;t just a useless one line post. Anyone know just how hard it is to obtain flowing black robes? <br/>
