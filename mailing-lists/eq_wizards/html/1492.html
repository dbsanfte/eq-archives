<div id="ygrps-yiv-396724121"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Can any of my elder brethren tell me if Bind Affinity will<br/>
&gt; work in any<br/>
&gt; zone, or only in major cities? I am level 11 now and hope<br/>
&gt; to be binding<br/>
&gt; soon.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can bind yourself anywhere, city or not.  Other people you can<br/>
only bind to city areas.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, can anyone tell me where I can find Eye of Zomm<br/>
&gt; in Qeynos? I<br/>
&gt; just want to increase my conjuration skill, which is at<br/>
&gt; &quot;awful&quot; level.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t purchased this spell, as it seems completely useless except<br/>
for increasing Conjuration.   My guess is that you will find it in the<br/>
Guild of mages OR in the Temple of Life.  If not there, take the boat<br/>
to Erudin, it should be available in the Library or one of the<br/>
spellcasters&#39; towers.<br/>
