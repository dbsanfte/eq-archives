<div id="ygrps-yiv-1134936801">I have tried to get bear hide belt and boots from Chandra Miller twice, but<br/>
she just takes my money and bear pelts, and says something like &quot;Oh thank<br/>
you, but I still need the other thing&quot;. Has anyone gotten the boots and<br/>
belt from her (I already have a polar bear cloak so don&#39;t need the bear<br/>
hide cloak)? Talking to her is not the problem, she tells me what she needs<br/>
to make the stuff. Thanks.<br/>
