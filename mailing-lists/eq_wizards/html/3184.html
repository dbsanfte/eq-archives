 </span></blockquote>Not really...if your fighting a steady stream of blues your not going to<br/>
have the mana to keep up with the fighters...in that kinda situation your<br/>
best use is to sit back and let a blast on the tougher ones to soften them<br/>
up and wait for when the crap hits the fan and you get a bad pull...<br/>
<br/>
Really a lot of our uses involve this &quot;Oh Shit!&quot; kinda situation...it&#39;ll<br/>
often seem like your just sitting there sucking Xp and not really adding<br/>
to anything in the group, till you get a bad pull, in which case your<br/>
ability to dish out obscene amounts of damage quickly really comes in<br/>
handy, the trick is doing it without pissing off the critter too<br/>
much...(though in situations like that you&#39;ll probibly spend a little bit<br/>
of time with an almost dead critter whacking on you...just rember to make<br/>
them totally dead really quick ;) )<br/>
