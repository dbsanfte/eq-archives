<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979360460">Powergaming is just what it looks like.  Power gamers are people who are <br/>
only concerned with getting the higher level and the goodies and money etc <br/>
etc...  Role players, however, are the folks who immerse themselves in <br/>
their character and become them.  They will speak in a different fashion <br/>
than you do just to someone you are talking to.  They speak as if they are <br/>
the character and they behave accordingly.  Some may choose to be evil, <br/>
some may choose to be virtuous and good.  Some may become the outcast good <br/>
character of their evil race who does kind deeds to try to change the views <br/>
others have of their race.  Some may choose to not group or speak to evil <br/>
characters if they are good, and play as if they are very biased to the <br/>
race or class the other person is.  It is all in how they want to pretend <br/>
the character they are lives the life they give them in the game.<br/>
I&#39;m sure that sounds confusing as all get out, but hopefully it is a little <br/>
insightful.  From what you said, I don&#39;t consider you a role player.  I <br/>
consider you someone in between to be honest.  You aren&#39;t just in the game <br/>
for a level, and you aren&#39;t really playing your character as if you are a <br/>
medieval person in a magical world either.. at least from what I could <br/>
tell.  You are just there having fun.  Which is really what its all <br/>
about.  Some want to power game through the levels because the challenge of <br/>
hitting 50 is there for them and they want to get there first or close to <br/>
it.  Some prefer to play the character according to who/what they <br/>
are.  Some just want to have fun and enjoy things.  Its all good any way <br/>
you look at it.  :)<br/>

&gt;Every one says powergaming and roleplaying as it where two different things.<br/>
&gt;I thought Power gaming was a sort of Role Playing as you play a role even<br/>
&gt;when you are powergaming. When I play i take blues and black to get good xp.<br/>
&gt;I dont go around killing green stuff to get the time going so I after youre<br/>
&gt;fashion call a roleplaying. I lvl about 1lvl a week. And are happy with<br/>
&gt;that. And of course I get the best weapon i can get at my lvl.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So can anyone, if I am wrong in my understanding of powergaming, explain me<br/>
&gt;what is powergaming and why that is not a way of Roleplaying as i think it<br/>
&gt;is.  And what is wrong with it. If people has much freetime and use it to<br/>
&gt;play, it should not be called powergameing. As I have seen it been called in<br/>
&gt;earlier posts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Please dont flame me about this as I dont know. And just seeks understanding<br/>
