<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Actually this is a forum that I don&#39;t see very 
active, but subscribe to it for some reason.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The eq_wizard forum is for the game called 
EverQuest.&nbsp; Actually you could create a hated wizard in that and play 
around and make a journal of his adventures, but since it is EQ not sure what 
the copyright infringment would be, they seem fairly over protective of their 
copyright and ideas even though most of it is taken from one place or 
another.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Here are a few other links to the game, in case you 
want to look at it for ideas and such:</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Their is also another game called &quot;Dark Ages of 
Camolot&quot; (DAOC)&nbsp;that might interest you, think their wizards are a treated 
differently.&nbsp; Their are 2 different styles of games it seem PvE (Player vs 
Enviorment) and PvP (Player vs Player).&nbsp; EverQuest is PvE (known as Blue 
Servers also), although some servers are set up as PvP.&nbsp; DAOC is designed a 
little differently.&nbsp; It has been called RvR (Realm vs Realm).&nbsp; 
Basiclly you can&#39;t attack anyone (player) that is from your realm, if they are 
from a different realm you can attack them and gain points for your 
side.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Anyway, the above sites also have some links to 
DAOC as well.&nbsp;I am not sure if this is what you were looking for, but both 
games would allow you to &quot;play&quot; a wizard.</font></div>

  <div><br></div><font face="arial,helvetica"><font size="2">Hello my name is Debra. 
  &nbsp;I joined this list and a few others to learn some things about wizards. 
  &nbsp;I am writing a book and one of the main characters is a wizard. &nbsp;He 
  has been an outcast for his whole life. &nbsp;Deceived by those whom he 
  trusted and locked away in a frozen state for centuries. &nbsp;I want to try 
  to find an attitude for him. &nbsp;So I thought I would spend some time 
  finding out what a wizardly attitude really is before I go making up some 
  stereotypical one. <br>I will probably lurk for a while and then ask questions 
  when something strikes me as curious. &nbsp;I hope no one minds. <br>Debra
