<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943033036">With the high intelligence of a wizard it is very easy to max out all three<br/>
(pierce, 1&2H Blunt).  At the start of a new level I start off with my great<br/>
staff, then I move on to my trusty cracked staff, and I finish off the level<br/>
with my snake fang.  During level 4 and 5 I tried to work on my hand2hand, but<br/>
alas I am not a monk.  Also something I&#39;ve noticed, you can improve on your<br/>
throwing skills by attacking &quot;con green&quot; mobs.  The simple reason I go through<br/>
all of this is because sooner or later Verant will probably introduce new<br/>
weapons to the game, and whatever skill it uses, I want to be ready.<br/>
