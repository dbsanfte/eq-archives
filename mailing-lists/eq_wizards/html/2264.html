<b>Subject:</b> Re: Wizards are fun - don&#39;t ruin it for everyone <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2047533754">i thought this for a while too but now i am a semi-KSer. please, let me<br/>
explain: i spent most of my wizards life trying to keep order at the camps.<br/>
Me being a wizard threatened people by saying that if they stole, i could<br/>
easily steal every kill from them from then on, and it worked... for a<br/>
while. I have tried very hard lately to keep order at camps and nothing<br/>
works. so I gave up. I count the number of people in the camp and wait for<br/>
that many dervs to spawn, then i take the next one... regardless of who&#39;s<br/>
&quot;turn&quot; it is. I figure that i have to be at the end of the rotation so<br/>
everyone there has already had a turn when i go and the person that whines<br/>
to me was on his/her second turn. I guess you can call it killstealing, but<br/>
not many get  mad because i&#39;m not just stealing everything when i have the<br/>
mana... but that&#39;s what i do now... i am moving to a new server soon and i<br/>
am seriously thinking of just going out and stealing everything i can for<br/>
the hell of it. but i don&#39;t think i&#39;ll do it because i&#39;m a nice guy and that<br/>
sucks for everyone else<br/>

&gt;Kill stealing is not the way to make friends for personal or the class as a<br/>
&gt;whole.  It might serve the purpose of the person at the time, but rest<br/>
&gt;assured, those groups/people you steal kills from WILL remember your name<br/>
&gt;and later on down the road when you can&#39;t cast/melee your ass out of a<br/>
&gt;tight spot, if those folks are around they will more than likely just sit<br/>
&gt;and watch you get the crap beat out of you til you die and laugh their<br/>
&gt;heads off.  Sad people think this is okay.  I get more exp working with a<br/>
&gt;group of 6 than I do alone by far.  The bonus for a full group helps a lot<br/>
&gt;and if you find the right spots (not telling mine), you will get more than<br/>
&gt;enough cash and goodies to go around.  We normally have a pile of bodies to<br/>
&gt;loot and everyone goes away with their pockets full and their exp bumping<br/>
&gt;up nicely...AND a good feeling.<br/>
