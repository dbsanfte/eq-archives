I&#39;m finding it really lacking.<br/>

&gt;So my question is simple: has anyone found any armor anywhere for wizards<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that is better than normal Cloth? I&#39;m looking for stuff that can be worn by<br/>
a High Elf, but I&#39;m sure there are other classes around that are interested<br/>
as well... <br/>

&gt;Anyone know any other good tricks to improving armor class for wizards?<br/>
