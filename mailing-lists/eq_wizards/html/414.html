<b>Subject:</b> Re: Whether to Repond to whole list or individual <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032680330">I, too, like reading the responses.  What would help tho is if those who reply <br/>
would (as I have done here) retitle the subject line to reflect what you&#39;re talking <br/>
about AND delete everything but your reply... in other words DO NOT include <br/>
original text in the reply.  (I use Pegasus Mail and there is a box I can uncheck <br/>
that says &quot;include original text in reply&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
I have received much valuable information from this list and extend a general <br/>
thanks to those who have provided it.<br/>
