&gt;where did you find the spell?  what component does it need?<br/>
&gt;and i&#39;d assume it would take you to the normal zone.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m just curious here.  I&#39;d probably never think of doing anything like<br/>
&gt;&gt; this unless I knew the location was totally safe.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Does anyone know roughly where in PoF the wizard gate spell takes you to?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>oops my bad, its Alter Plane of Hate that I have.  But since there is no<br/>
plane of Hate yet I guess no one knows where it takes you to. :)<br/>
