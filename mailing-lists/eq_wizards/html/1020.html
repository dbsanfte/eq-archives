good is a PB area effect spell?  It is tough enough having every monster<br/>
in an area attack you when you area effect spell them at range... much<br/>
less at PB. Will some one give me some insight into this spell and others<br/>
like it (PB area damage)?&lt;&lt;<br/>

I&#39;ve used this spell a bit when fighting gob warriors with another player.  I was <br/>
working on my staff skill at the time so I WAS close to the crits and they were <br/>
being inconsiderate enough to spawn 3 at a time.  It did between 8 and 23 pts <br/>
damage to all 3 crits.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll use it very much.. but until I can afford to <br/>
buy the rest of my level 8 spells I have a slot open for it so it&#39;s there.  It is sort <br/>
of spectacular graphically tho &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
