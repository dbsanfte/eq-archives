&gt; Just curious,  what&#39;s everyone&#39;s magic resist at?  Mine is somewhere like<br/>
&gt; 45-49 with my own buffs.  With a cleric or bard, I&#39;ve seen it somewhere in<br/>
&gt; the high 80s.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anybody know a more consistent way to keep this higher?  I wish we had a<br/>
&gt; personal buff to boost this up more...you&#39;d figure a master of magic would<br/>
&gt; have more resistance in this area?  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I got that Thex dagger thingie that boosts SV disease up +50.  That&#39;s nice<br/>
&gt; but I wish there was something like that for magic resist.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Best thing you can do is whack the king in Sol B (Crown is +20 magic resist)<br/>
add that to a glowing black stone (+10) a  Platinum Wolf&#39;s Eye Agate Neckless<br/>
(+9) a pair of Gold WEA bracers (+7ea) and a pair of Platinum Jacinth Rings<br/>
(+10ea)  That will give you a total of +73 sv vs Magic, before buffs, but<br/>
that will probably sacrifice most of your Intellegence items.  I hope this<br/>
helps.  By the way, did you do the Thex dagger quest alone, or with a<br/>
friend?  What level do you recommend?<br/>
<br/>
