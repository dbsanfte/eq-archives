<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621942068">Your friend should never have tried Unrest at lvl 10.  From lvl 12 on is a<br/>
good time to start.  As I mentioned in an earlier post, only myself and a<br/>
cleric friend went there at lvl 12 and gained 4 lvls in 2 days.  Just stay<br/>
in the courtyard and kill Death Beetles, Tormented Dead, Greater Skeletons,<br/>
Jack o Laterns, and the occasional Ghoul, if your friend has any magical<br/>
attacks.  Also, don&#39;t be afraid when you con the Death Beetles and they turn<br/>
out to be blue, that you waited too long.  For some reason, the Death<br/>
Beetles give out excellent xp and I was still gaining decent xp off of them<br/>
at lvl 16.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, Unrest is a great place to revist once you hit 20th or so.<br/>
The house has mobs anywhere from 18th lvl up to 36th lvl.  Again, great xp<br/>
and awesome loot, they drop fine steel weapons, bloodstained armor, and<br/>
bronze plate mail.  So for any of you that have reached the higher lvls and<br/>
are looking for a place to hunt, Unrest is better than most ;)<br/>

&gt; Well, on someone&#39;s advice, forget whom it was, but I made the trip to<br/>
&gt; Kaladim to plumb the depths of Unrest. I&#39;m 14th level and just coming into<br/>
&gt; my power right now. Right now the rest of the people in my group are<br/>
between<br/>
&gt; 3-5 levels below me. So I figure I&#39;ll just solo and get xps slower, but<br/>
also<br/>
&gt; not hinder their progress either. Where should I go? I&#39;ve gone to the<br/>
&gt; chessboard and killed pawns, bishops and their annoying pets, as well as<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; odd King that shows up. A dwarven friend of mine was telling me how his 6<br/>
&gt; member lvl 10 party was completely wiped out in Unrest down to the last<br/>
man.<br/>
&gt; I made the following conclusions:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; a. Unrest is nasty<br/>
&gt; b. My dwarven friend&#39;s party is stupid for not running from something they<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t win<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I can admire going out gloriously next to your comrade, but not when death<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t permanent.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, question, if I take my group into unrest what should I be looking to<br/>
&gt; kill? Is there somwhere else that is nearby that I should go instead? My<br/>
&gt; dwarf friend said to hit the steamfonts, suggestions?<br/>
