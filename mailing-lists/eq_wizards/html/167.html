<div id="ygrps-yiv-1745860615">My suggestion is to try to carefully go after orc pawns in Greater Faydark.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a good, little known area right outside the port in the Butcherblock<br/>
Mountains.  Zone to BB, hook a right at the crossroads, and follow that path all the<br/>
way past Kaladim til you get to the last guard fort before the port (If you hit a<br/>
little henge stone, you&#39;ve gone too far).  At the fort, go left.  You&#39;ll come to a group<br/>
of about 6 stones, with two dwarf NPC&#39;s.  This area is rife with large skunks, goblin<br/>
grunts, and rock spiderlings.  There are even a few Krag chicks, which give great<br/>
exp (for level 5, anyway).  Make sure you con the chicks 1st, some of them are toughies.<br/>
When you load up on the loot, you can run right to the port.  There&#39;s a high elf merchant<br/>
inside and to the right.<br/>
<br/>
When you hit six, you&#39;ll have graduated from this area, except for the chicks.  But<br/>
for 5, it&#39;s a good area for the solo wiz.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>
