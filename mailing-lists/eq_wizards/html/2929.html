<div id="ygrps-yiv-188479729">A viewer sent me this reply he received from GZ concerning the balance issues<br/>
with the classes, Wizards in particular. I apologize to the submitter for<br/>
taking so long to post this, but I wished to get GZ&#39;s permission to do so. So,<br/>
here it is in all its glory.... please take all discussion to the Rant message<br/>
board. Thanks!<br/>

: &quot;I honestly feel that most spell casting classes are pretty well balanced.<br/>
Wizards complain a lot that they don&#39;t have the versatility at higher levels -<br/>
but I also get an equal number of e-mails from Druids, saying that they wish<br/>
that they were more specialized. They feel that people would rather have a<br/>
Wizard then them - since a Wiz can do more damage, and a Cleric is better at<br/>
healing. At this point, I feel that most magic classes are very well balanced -<br/>
we won&#39;t be changing much in the future with what spells / the power of spells<br/>
that the casting classes get. Most people won&#39;t be happy with this - they feel<br/>
that their particular class is underpowered. But for every class we tweak,<br/>
other classes feel that they are now worse (we up the Wizard damage, give them<br/>
new spells, then Druids feel that they are no longer needed. We let Wizards<br/>
have DoTs, and then Necros and Shamans say they aren&#39;t needed, etc.). We are in<br/>
a pretty good balance state right now... Geoffrey C. Zatkin&quot;<br/>

I think that it is imposible to belive he compares us a hardest class to play<br/>
at low lv, at middle lv and only at high lv we get a normal play what other<br/>
classes have from start with a druids wich realy have a easiest life at start<br/>
of all clases, normal middle lv wich they can KITE all time, and normal at<br/>
higer lv.<br/>

2 message is from a EQcasters<br/>

ï¿½       I also put this to him about Wizards: Wizards don&#39;t really seem to be<br/>
the ultimate damage dealers they should be. They just chew through the mana too<br/>
fast for the damage they do. The other classes can do the equivalent damage<br/>
with maybe a few hundred more mana spent all up. A lot of wizards feel that at<br/>
high levels they don&#39;t have the pure blasting power they imagined a level 50<br/>
should have. <br/>
<br/>
His response: Wizards are the ultimate damage dealers for damage done in a<br/>
short<br/>
period of time. In this area, they have no rivals - hands down. Ice Comet cast<br/>
twice does more damage in 13 seconds that most other casters can do in twice<br/>
the amount of time. Is this useful in all situations? No. Does this mean that<br/>
the Wizard class is uniquely qualified to save the party when the situation<br/>
gets bad? Yes<br/>
 <br/>
* belish comment * <br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind this comment on wizards is focusing on Level 49 and 50 Wizards.<br/>
The fact that Ice Comet is unbeatable is all good and well, but with Plane of<br/>
Fear now almost impossible I don&#39;t know how sustainable it is, since getting<br/>
the spell is now a major hurdle<br/>

*my coment* <br/>
<br/>
Yes only if i dont miss lord nagafen is a 63 lv guy so if 50 lv * 1.2 is 60<br/>
wizard cant scrach him as it will resist all he is over a balance resistance<br/>
table . Chasic thule is now over this lv also eheheh so my friends what we can<br/>
do? <br/>
<br/>
PETITION ALL<br/>
<br/>
1. lower resistance or 2 different DD spels for lv so we have ammo for our<br/>
spells if a mob resist one we can have other to use. ( it can be done easily in<br/>
place of one of two lines of AE spells.<br/>
<br/>
2. on partial resists used only partial mana !!<br/>
<br/>
3. We cant have more mana as there is danger that we will Kill steall more then<br/>
give us a faster mana regeneration !! If monks have his primary skills 7 * lv<br/>
cap we can have same for meditation !! Warrior is our exact oposit and they<br/>
have big hit points now they have also criticals and we need to get lower<br/>
resistence and also faster mana regeneration to compensate what we are without<br/>
pets, buffs.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all coment welcome<br/>
