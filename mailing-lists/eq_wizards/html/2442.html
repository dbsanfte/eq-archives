<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640018362">no, i guess it&#39;s u who doesn&#39;t understand, because it DOES matter which<br/>
server ur on. on tunare, ur right, they cant do %$#! about ur &quot;ks&quot;...  they<br/>
just have to sit back and maybe hope to train something on u.  but on RZ,<br/>
i&#39;ll just turn around and burn ya down while ur stealing my kill :) it&#39;s<br/>
called a PvP server.  you&#39;d be zoning more than fighting with that kill<br/>
stealing *%#$ pal (on RZ, our friends list consist of ppl we hunt, or ppl<br/>
who are hunting us :)<br/>
<br/>
And I nvr said &quot;ks&quot; wouldn&#39;t work at lvl 25. I said melee (that&#39;s what i<br/>
meant by &quot;ur little trick&quot;... the one where one wizard casts, and one wizard<br/>
melees) won&#39;t work at lvl 25. now, go back to ur kill stealing and paltry<br/>
melee, and dont listen to what a few higher lvl (at least higher than u) ppl<br/>
have to say about melee (which is what got this thread all started).<br/>

<br/>
ps. an advanced sorry to anybody that reads this that is offended by this<br/>
crap i wrote... my original post was to try to explain nicely that 1.) kill<br/>
stealing on RZ is not an issue, and 2.) melee at lvl 20+ is suicide for a<br/>
wizard.<br/>
