 </span></blockquote>Thats a crock.  It gets resisted all the time.  One of an Enchanters biggest<br/>
drawbacks is their resistability.  Imagine, every single spell is magic based, and<br/>
is therefore about as reliable as root.  Of course, they get tashen(i) to make up<br/>
for this, but that spell benifits all in a group, not just the Enchanters.  On a<br/>
side note, Tashen(i) does not have a savings throw, and will not be resisted by<br/>
either Resistance or level limitations.  Perhaps this was the spell he used on th<br/>
HG.  Other enchanters spells are capped the same as a wizards.</div>
