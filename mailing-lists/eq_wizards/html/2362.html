Let&#39;s take this email as a request. Anyone with anything remotely usefull<br/>
about Wizards, <br/>
quests, armor, items, jewelry, good zones, where to hunt what, how to do what<br/>
anything at all that you feel would help others send it to me and i&#39;ll put<br/>
together <br/>
some sort of FAQ or maybe even slap it up on a website, depending on how much<br/>
info i get. <br/>

&gt;I&#39;ve noticed an alarmingly low amount of information about wizards out<br/>
&gt;there (on the net and such). There are several websites dedicated to<br/>
&gt;many of the other classes from warriors to rogues and druids to<br/>
&gt;necromancers. We need a place for wizards. Hehe, not that I have the<br/>
&gt;time or energy to do this, but I have enough to recognize the need!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any ideas on what to do? Rather than having all the same questions asked<br/>
&gt;here over and over again we can have a central repository of information<br/>
&gt;(faq?). Like for instance, strategies at certain levels, where to hunt,<br/>
&gt;spell combinations, class combinations, etc. Let me know if anyone is<br/>
&gt;interested maybe we can make something work :)<br/>
