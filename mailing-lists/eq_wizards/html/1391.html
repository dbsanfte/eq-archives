&gt;Here is you reality of life.  You are a WIZARD!  You have chosen this life<br/>
&gt;because you seek to be the knowledge keeper of this land.  You should seek<br/>
&gt;to gain the knowledge of where items are and how to get them.  You are not <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;solo machine.  You are meticulous, thinking.  Not a tank that jumps into<br/>
&gt;battle and gets his head bashed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Seek a tank to stay close to you.  He/she is your armor.  The tank is what<br/>
&gt;keeps you back to from the blows.  let him take the blows and with YOUR<br/>
&gt;power he will not take the massive damage.  Tell me what 12th level warrior<br/>
&gt;is going to do 72 hps of damage at once or 30 hps to multiple targets.  <br/>
&gt;NONE<br/>
&gt;will.   Yes we have no armor but that is because you are not suppose to be<br/>
&gt;in there hand to hand.  That is not becoming of us to be hand to handing it<br/>
&gt;with some stupid Creature.  Let the tank get dirty.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you are a wizard act as one.  You are the thinker of this world.  You <br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt;the keeper of knowledge in this world.<br/>
