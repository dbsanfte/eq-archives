<div id="ygrps-yiv-1730136462">this is not a reply to any specific *exploit* msg posted (i quit reading<br/>
them after the first couple as i&#39;m not too interested in that type of<br/>
gameplay... no offense intended).  if anybody remembers me talking about the<br/>
*so called* exploit in south ro near the hill a couple of weeks ago, it has<br/>
been confirmed.  i used it for about 5 kills a few weeks ago, and decided it<br/>
was a little too easy, and was a bannable offense (although i don&#39;t think i<br/>
went as far as to say it was an exploit, because it didn&#39;t *feel* like an<br/>
exploit).  my friend, however, did not come to the same conclusion, and<br/>
continued to use it.  well, mr. GM made a visit to her this past weekend,<br/>
and promptly told her that it WAS an exploit, and that her account would be<br/>
terminated if caught near the exploit area again fighting another monster.<br/>
he also told her that this warning was not only for that specific exploit,<br/>
but if he caught her char doing anything similiar to that in any other zone,<br/>
that her account would be terminated (so basically, the warning was not<br/>
specific to the exploit, but, rather specific to ANY exploit).  One chance<br/>
and then ur outa here!  but to each his/her own :)<br/>
<br/>
just a heads up that Verant is actively aware of many exploits, and if you<br/>
get caught, you can be banned.<br/>
