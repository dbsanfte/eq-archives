<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434197038">5 seconds isn&#39;t enough... wait until your tanks do almost as much if not<br/>
more dmg as the spell you just cast... then cast again.. i can usually cast,<br/>
meditate half the mana just used, then cast again and i&#39;m still very useful<br/>
to my party and i&#39;m 17th level<br/>

&gt;&gt; You won&#39;t see any major difference in dmg until lvl 29+... then we begin<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;&gt; shine.  And another thing, you DO NOT use your most power spell as soon<br/>

&gt;I am not using my most powerful spell as soon as I got It I&#39;m level 13<br/>
&gt;now...  next?  Oh and I know all the tricks to wait and such... but you<br/>

&gt;if the Mob runs...  believe me I know most of the tricks... chuckle.  So<br/>
&gt;even though our only benefit is that we are damage doers we have to wait<br/>
&gt;till 29th?<br/>
