<div id="ygrps-yiv-663501129">At level 30, my Inferno Shock is doing 240, and my Thunder Strike is doing<br/>
250, and knocking the target backwards like those tentacle terrors used to<br/>
do to me.  The thing Verant means when they say wizards are DD masters also<br/>
includes our casting and recovery time.  Inferno Shock recovers quickly--<br/>
not only will you do more damage per spell than your cleric friend, you will<br/>
do it a lot faster, too.  On top of that, beginning at 29, you will be able<br/>
to portal people around the world.  I have heard many, many people express a<br/>
desire for that ability.  I think the classes are pretty well unique as far<br/>
as their powers, so that how you like to play and what you like to do<br/>
influences people&#39;s conclusions about which classes suck more than the<br/>
native abilities of each class.<br/>

&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I thought wizards were supposed to be masters of DD spells. I was with a<br/>
&gt; level 29 cleric recently, and he has a spell (wrath) which was doing 198<br/>
&gt; damage to my 178. Granted, I am level 27, but was still kind of shocked.<br/>
It<br/>
&gt; was only a two level difference, and he had a better DD spell, and could<br/>
&gt; melee too. And buff. And heal. I know at 29 I will get Inferno Shock, but<br/>
&gt; this just makes my think that we should be doing more damage, or have<br/>
faster<br/>
&gt; mana regen, or SOMETHING. Just another example of how Verant has made the<br/>
&gt; wizard class suck.<br/>
