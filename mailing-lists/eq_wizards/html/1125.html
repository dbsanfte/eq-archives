<div id="ygrps-yiv-1996421028">Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
I have heard about this &quot;Root and Shoot&quot; strategy and I am greatly curious <br/>
about what it is.  I have all the RANK 2 spells except Glimpse and I need a <br/>
good way to kill things as I am getting nowhere towards my next level (Level <br/>
7).  I currently reside in Qeynos (Human), and I am looking for some way to <br/>
get to Level 7 without getting slain by Holly Crosstree or whatever her name <br/>
is.<br/>
<br/>
I am also looking to learn some new languages but it&#39;s hard to do as I have <br/>
none to trade in return.<br/>
<br/>
So, for those of you are confused, what is thr &quot;Root and Shoot&quot; strategy?<br/>
<br/>
(The strategy I use sometimes is to cast Root then Icestrike, back away, and <br/>
watch the enemy get pelted, then finish them with my staff when Icestrike or <br/>
Root ends.)<br/>
