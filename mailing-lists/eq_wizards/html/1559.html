&gt;<br/>
&gt; Guys, I just had to share this with everyone.  I know it&#39;s WAY off topic,<br/>
&gt; but this thing has potential.  I received this Email a while ago and have<br/>
&gt; since gone through with the process; my name is the one at the<br/>
&gt; bottom as of<br/>
&gt; now.  Here is the Email:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This letter is about an opportunity to make an incredible amount<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; Money (CASH!!!) in a very short time.  The cost is only $6.00!<br/>
&gt; This is<br/>
&gt; my ninth day at this, and so far I have received $121 (in<br/>
&gt; $1Bills)...so<br/>
&gt; guess this is starting to work already! $121 doesn&#39;t  sound like<br/>
&gt; much,<br/>
&gt; but this is the most money that I have ever made at one of these<br/>
&gt; programs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Give it a try! I hope we all make lots of money!!! All I did was<br/>
&gt; follow<br/>
&gt; the instructions in the letter that I received below, and sent<br/>
&gt; out some<br/>
&gt; e-mail to people that responded to my ads.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A few weeks ago I received a letter from an attorney that said: I<br/>
&gt; am a<br/>
&gt; retired attorney, and about two years ago a man came to me with a<br/>
&gt; letter. The letter he brought to me is the same letter before you<br/>
&gt; now.<br/>
&gt; He asked me to verify that this letter was legal. I told him that<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; would review it and get back to him. When I first read the<br/>
&gt; letter, I<br/>
&gt; thought it was some off the wall idea to make money. A week later<br/>
&gt; I met<br/>
&gt; again with my client to discuss the issue. I told him that the<br/>
&gt; letter<br/>
&gt; originally brought to me was not 100% legal. I advised him to<br/>
&gt; make a<br/>
&gt; small change in the letter and it will be all right. I was<br/>
&gt; curious about<br/>
&gt; the letter, so he told me how it worked. I thought it was along<br/>
&gt; shot, so<br/>
&gt; I decided against participating. Before my client left, I asked<br/>
&gt; him to<br/>
&gt; keep me updated as to his results. About two months later he<br/>
&gt; called me<br/>
&gt; to tell me that he had received more than $8OO,OOO.OO in cash!! I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; believe him so he asked me to try the plan and see for myself. I<br/>
&gt; thought<br/>
&gt; about it for a few days and decided that there was not much to<br/>
&gt; lose. I<br/>
&gt; followed the instructions exactly and mailed out 200 letters.<br/>
&gt; Sure<br/>
&gt; enough the money started coming in! It came slowly at first, but<br/>
&gt; after<br/>
&gt; three weeks I was getting more than I could open in a day.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After three months the money stopped coming. I kept a precise<br/>
&gt; record of<br/>
&gt; my earnings and at the end it totaled $868,439.00. I earn a good<br/>
&gt; living<br/>
&gt; as a attorney, but as anyone in the legal profession will tell<br/>
&gt; you,<br/>
&gt; there is a lot of stress that comes with the territory. I decided<br/>
&gt; if<br/>
&gt; things worked out, I would retire from practice and play golf.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This time I sent out 500 letters. Well, three months later, I had<br/>
&gt; totaled $2,344,178.00. I met my old client for lunch to find out<br/>
&gt; exactly<br/>
&gt; how it works. He told me that there were a few similar letters<br/>
&gt; going<br/>
&gt; around. What made this one different is the fact that there were<br/>
&gt; six<br/>
&gt; names on the letter, not three like most others. That fact alone<br/>
&gt; resulted in more returns. The other factor was the advice I gave<br/>
&gt; him in<br/>
&gt; making sure the whole thing was perfectly legal, since no one<br/>
&gt; wants to<br/>
&gt; risk doing anything illegal. I bet now you are curious abou what<br/>
&gt; little<br/>
&gt; changes I told him to make.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well if you send a letter like this one out, to be legal, you<br/>
&gt; must sell<br/>
&gt; something if you expect to receive a dollar. I told him that<br/>
&gt; anyone<br/>
&gt; sending a dollar must receive something in RETURN. So when you<br/>
&gt; send a<br/>
&gt; dollar to each of the six names on the list, you must include a<br/>
&gt; slip of<br/>
&gt; paper saying, {&quot;Please put me on your mailing list and notify me<br/>
&gt; of other exciting opportunities&quot;} and include your<br/>
&gt; name, mailing address and e-mail address. (This is the key to the<br/>
&gt; program.} The item you will receive for your dollar is THIS<br/>
&gt; letter and<br/>
&gt; the right to earn thousands. Follow the simple<br/>
&gt; instructions EXACTLY, and in less than three months you should<br/>
&gt; receive<br/>
&gt; MORE THAN $8OO,OOO.OO IN COLD HARD CASH!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) IMMEDIATELY send $1.00 (or equivalent other currency) to each<br/>
&gt; of the<br/>
&gt; six people listed below. THE SOONER YOU SEND THE &quot;$1.00 LETTERS&quot;<br/>
&gt; THE<br/>
&gt; SOONER YOU CAN START GETTING A RETURN! =&gt; Wrap the dollar in a<br/>
&gt; note<br/>
&gt; saying &quot;Please add me to your mailing list and notify me of other<br/>
&gt; exciting opportunities&quot;. Include YOUR<br/>
&gt; NAME, MAILING ADDRESS AND E-MAIL ADDRESS.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ***REMEMBER, if you don&#39;t ask for the service, USE OF THIS LETTER<br/>
&gt;   WILL BE ILLEGAL FOR YOU.<br/>
