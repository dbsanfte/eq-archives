<div id="ygrps-yiv-1111571315">Just wondering what lvl you are?  I found that until lvl 8 the wizard is<br/>
very weak, and once he hits 12 he becomes incredible powerful.  At lvl 14, I<br/>
would chose my magic over weak mage or necro magic any day.  As you get<br/>
higher in lvls getting money becomes much easier.  I&#39;m still almost always<br/>
broke, while my warrior friends run around with 50 pp on them, but I never<br/>
have problems making enough to buy the spells (hence why I am always broke).<br/>
If you&#39;re below the lvls I mentioned then I would suggest just hanging in<br/>
there until you reach them, you will be amazed by the leap in power the<br/>
wizard takes.<br/>

&gt;Just wondering how other people feel about our Wizard class. It seems to me<br/>
&gt;that we are short-changed compared to magicians and necromancers, whose<br/>
&gt;spells seem a lot better, and can have &quot;pets&quot; fight for them. It&#39;s also<br/>
&gt;hard to make signifant amounts of money to buy spells. I still like the<br/>
&gt;game, just wondered if anyone else felt the same way.<br/>
