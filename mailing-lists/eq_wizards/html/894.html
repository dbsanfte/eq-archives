You won&#39;t have to listen to this.  At level 12 no class can do the dmg you<br/>
do with one spell.  (don&#39;t forget your shaman friend was lvl 14)  Though you<br/>
do more dmg than other classes at 12, you don&#39;t do alot more.  But, as you<br/>
go up in lvls the between what you can do and what other classes can do gets<br/>
bigger and bigger.<br/>

&gt;Sorry this is so long.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m a level 11 wizard about to turn 12.  Well my friend is a shaman who<br/>
 </span></blockquote>just<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;turned 14. Well he just brought<br/>
&gt;his new damage spell and he said it does 77 damage, to which i replied kewl<br/>
&gt;my next spell does that amount<br/>
&gt;too. That was a mistake he started laughing and saying things like &quot;why<br/>
&gt;would anyone want to play the wizard<br/>
&gt;when they can play the shaman&quot;.  &quot;the shaman can stand toe to toe like the<br/>
&gt;warrior and do the same damage<br/>
&gt;as the wizard, Ha HA HA HA .....&quot; . Then he went on saying crap like now he<br/>
&gt;knows the shaman is the best<br/>
&gt;class in the game. All he could talk about before was the sow spell, and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>now<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;it is he does the same damage<br/>
&gt;as the wizard.  My question is this, i thought i picked the wizard so i<br/>
&gt;would not have to hear stuff like this?<br/>
&gt;I thought level 12 was when the wizard started to leave other mage class<br/>
&gt;behind.  Know i have to hear alot<br/>
&gt;aggraviating crap from this shaman, laughing at the wizard class. Dam that<br/>
&gt;is going to suck.  Someone<br/>
&gt;please tell me there is hope out there as far as the damage spells go.<br/>
