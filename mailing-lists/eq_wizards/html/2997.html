&gt;&gt;Yes, I totally agree with you.  Who&#39;s NOT going to camp for things like<br/>
&gt;&gt;JBoots?  :)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Me. I have roughly 2-3 hours a night to play (on good days) and I am not<br/>
&gt;willing to waste a weekend camping in a computer game. I am sure many<br/>
 </span></blockquote>feel the same way.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I&#39;ve never camped for anything myself too for about the same reasons.  <br/>
But that&#39;s not the point...wouldn&#39;t you find things more fun if you COULD <br/>
legitimately get cool items *without* camping?  Say with a good solid quest <br/>
like somebody suggested?  It would not only break up the monotony of killing <br/>
MobS for only xp...but now everyone has an equal opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe making desired items quest dependant makes sense... it may make things <br/>
less desirable for those who&#39;ve already got the item.  Hehe..well, maybe <br/>
not.  HEY!  Maybe if they made it so you could only do a quest ONCE!  Let&#39;s <br/>
say if your character picked up a G Stein, you  could never go back and do <br/>
it again!  Crazy?<br/>
