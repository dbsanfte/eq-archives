<div id="ygrps-yiv-2067842835">Let&#39;s just clear this up once and for all.  I have been trying to decide<br/>
what class/race I like the best for a long, long time.  Right now I have a<br/>
lvl 13 BAR/warrior, lvl 12 ERU/wizard, and lvl 18 TSK, and guess what, i&#39;m<br/>
making a lvl 1 halfling rouge and he&#39;s gonna have a combine spear or rapier<br/>
(have&#39;nt decided yet) and full banded mail, from lvl 1...you know<br/>
why?...because i&#39;ve put too much freaking work into my characters to just<br/>
throw it all away, i&#39;m trying to maximize my enjoyment of the game, and to<br/>
do that, I must A: not feel that all of my work since this game came out is<br/>
for nothing, B: find the class/race that i really love to play...in the<br/>
words of Owen Heart: THAT&#39;S THE BOTTEM LINE (wait he did&#39;nt say that did<br/>
he?...oh well, he&#39;s dead anyway)</div>
