<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1021471095">I say to hell with cast and wait.  just team up with another wizard and one<br/>
tank.  get tank to start it off.  and you blast while other wiz cast root.  the<br/>
mob wil surely go for ONE of you.  at this time, if you get hit, the other wiz<br/>
stand max distance from u and blast while u melee the mob.  the mob will<br/>
eventually leave u and go for the other guy, and then u blast while the mob is<br/>
running to him and he root the mob again, if root is resisted, doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>
ur blast will kill mob anyways.<br/>
<br/>
Even better if you can find 2 other wiz to group with you.  3 wizzies kick so<br/>
much ass. to hell with those worthless tanks.  one of you root to start and<br/>
others blast to start.   one of u wil get tagged.  others blast , mob will<br/>
switch targets, others keep blasting. mob will run around doing dick all while<br/>
everyone blast from a triangle position max distance.   mob will be dead<br/>
quickly.   get the person who the mob is running to to root,  if root is<br/>
resisted, another guy from other position to root.  if its red and root just get<br/>
resisted all the time. forget it. just keep blasting hehe..<br/>
<br/>
i killed night stalker in east karanas who is red to me this way and i was only<br/>
lvl 13 at the time.  and night stalker resist root every time but shock of<br/>
lightning can still hit for 31 dmg.  This strategy also worked at lvl 8 for me<br/>
killing wisp, grizzlies.  and also ghouls are lvl 12.</div>
