<div id="ygrps-yiv-727653428">Levitate is not an enchanter only spell, my friend.  If the spell is in your <br/>
circle, you can scribe it.  You can purchase the spell from a vendor, <br/>
research the spell yourself, or have someone with more skill, research the <br/>
skill for you then give you the researched spell to scribe in your spellbook. <br/>
 You can also use those extra runes you have to practice and then either sell <br/>
or give away to younger characters the spells you successfully research.  <br/>
<br/>
While visiting Halas, I successfully researched the Levitate spell several <br/>
times and gave them to shaman friends of mine.  They were thrilled since that <br/>
spell is a Level 16 spell, I believe, for them, and costs a few plat at that <br/>
level.  I then turned around after finding out how expensive Root was for a <br/>
shaman to purchase (I think I was told 8 plat...don&#39;t really remember now) <br/>
and gated back to Felwithe and spent 4 gold and some odd coins each on 10 <br/>
root spells and handed them out to shamans who gave me sow :).  I NEVER have <br/>
to worry about being SoW&#39;d while in Halas or Permafrost now.  A little <br/>
kindness and thoughtfulness towards others can go a long way and many people <br/>
do NOT forget things like that.<br/>
<br/>
I then turned around and made friends with several older wizards who did the <br/>
same thing for me in return.  They would sit in front of the bank, using up <br/>
surplus runes to practice researching spells and then give them to me.  I <br/>
banked some for when I am older and can scribe them :), and gave away a few <br/>
that I already had to those who would be needing them.  <br/>
<br/>
With the cost of upper level spells and with some of our spells being <br/>
RESEARCH ONLY, it really helps when we help each other out and then pass on <br/>
that good will to another wizard, enchanter, magician, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
If you are not sure what classes can use the same spells that you do, <br/>
remember to right click on the spell and it will tell you.  Many of our <br/>
spells are shared with other classes&#39; circles.  And I really kind of like it <br/>
that way....<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts....<br/>
