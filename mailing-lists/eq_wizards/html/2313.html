green, 1-3 levels below will con blue, equals will con white/black, 1-3 above<br/>
are yellow, and 4+ are red.  The text associated with the con will give the<br/>
relative difficulty with the fight although they are still a bit misleading<br/>
and to general for my taste.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; You know, this is kind of disturbing.  If level 30+ blue creatures can kick<br/>
&gt; the stuffin&#39; out of you almost every time... why do they still con blue?<br/>
&gt; Shouldn&#39;t they be conned yellow or red?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Are the con colors a straight, level-wise calculation (L15 vs L15 =<br/>
&gt; white/black),<br/>
&gt; or a probability of success calculation (L15 vs L15, but the player is low<br/>
&gt; on HP = yellow)?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Of course, I&#39;ll not see level 30+ critters as anything but red for a long<br/>
&gt; long time.  =)<br/>
