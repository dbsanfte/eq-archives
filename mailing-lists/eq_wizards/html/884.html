<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-40876072">To answer your question about mana this is the one and only answer for ya.  This is<br/>
an RPG.  In other words pretend it&#39;s your life.  You ARE this wizard and in real<br/>
life you wouldn&#39;t be saying OH Hold Up &lt;insert name here&gt; I only have 10 mana left.<br/>
<br/>
You just wouldn&#39;t say that you dont have a clue how much mana you have you&#39;d just<br/>
say &quot;wait a second I am feeling exhausted I need to regen some mana&quot;<br/>
But I do believe it&#39;s unfair that they get to see their HP I personally think they<br/>
should take hp numbers out also.  Because this game is not meant to be numerical<br/>
thus the reason why they didnt include Mana # stam # exp # or skills #<br/>
you just wouldnt know that you could only run 15 more feet youd know your tired and<br/>
have jkust a lil bit left in ya or how much exp you needed to become better youd<br/>
learn from doing it not saying oh i need to change the oil in my car 3 more times<br/>
to be a MASTER oil changer<br/>
I hope this has enlightened you Please respond back. I love to hear others<br/>
opinions.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
