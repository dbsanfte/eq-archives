<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879770170">On lvl 8 i purchased every spell available for that lvl, with 63 plat in the<br/>
bank from my other character whom i gave up on i could afford it.  The<br/>
essential spells are lesser shielding, shadow step (if you ever plan on<br/>
running) and either Fire bolt or ice shock, or both.  Bolts, in case you<br/>
don&#39;t know, must be fired in a straight line with no obstructions, shocks<br/>
hit something within a certain range no matter where it is, even behind you.<br/>
On lvl 8 shock of ice should do 34 damage compared to fire bolt at 44.<br/>
