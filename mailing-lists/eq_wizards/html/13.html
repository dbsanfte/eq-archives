<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010577500">By rank three I am assuming that you mean lvl 8.  That is one of the best<br/>
lvls for spells  you will definitely need the following:<br/>
Shock of ice (34dmg for 30 mana), Fire Bolt(45dmg for 40 mana)  be careful<br/>
with the fire bolt as it requires a direct line of sight to hit, lesser<br/>
shielding is a must as we are very vulnerable and this will be your shield<br/>
until lvl 16, resistant skin is good against rat plague disease and spider<br/>
poison.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helped<br/>

	Greetings and Good day.<br/>
<br/>
	I am Gaedin, a 5th level High Elf Wizard on Veeshan who spends his<br/>
days <br/>
	wandering around Kelethin sniping at Orc Centurions.  I do actually<br/>
have a <br/>
	question.  Could one of you 8+ levelers out there tell me which Rank<br/>
3 <br/>
	scrolls are worth buying?  <br/>
<br/>
	Many Thanks and drop me a line sometime if you want to go hunting...<br/>
<br/>
