<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with this.  Something needs to be said, and doing it as one voice<br/>
would be more effective.<br/>
The things I have liked the most, and that are still inline with what a<br/>
wizard is are the following:<br/>
<br/>
Sood spell ideas:<br/>
Summon - Teleports group member inside the zone to your location<br/>
Phase - Teleports yourself to location of other group member inside zone<br/>
Tap Afinity - Teleport group member to their own bind spot<br/>
Haste - Increases movement rate for self only.<br/>
Group Gate - Slow casting spell which teleports group to your bind spot,<br/>
doesn&#39;t leave anyone behind<br/>
Retreat - Evacuate version of group gate<br/>
<br/>
Also, I think the most important fix that needs to addressed is finishing<br/>
the specialization skills.  I see these as an inportant part to making the<br/>
wizard what they should be, but as yet are still missing.<br/>
