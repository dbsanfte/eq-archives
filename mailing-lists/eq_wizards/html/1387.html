<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369763354">Well I have played a Magician, Necromancer,  Monk, and now a wizard.  I<br/>
would have to agree 100% with what you are saying.  Either speed up the<br/>
regen on the mana,  or make the mana to dammage ratio higher, one of the<br/>
two must be done.<br/>

Hmm what do you think how many blue can solo a expert magician at lv 22<br/>
without<br/>
need to med and he can survive 3 blues in same time if he sacrifices a<br/>
pet and<br/>
sometimes also win. (not to mention some other magic users)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My comment wich i post under other tread i repeat it so to try to<br/>
explain it<br/>
better and not to multyoly treads on same subject.<br/>
<br/>
In my first post i don&#39;t explained it good so i try to explain it<br/>
better. <br/>
I like to play a wizard as i play wizards in all games for more than 12<br/>
years now, but if we talk about balancing all magic users to same lv<br/>
then i<br/>
see some problems with� a wizard class, i wish to see your comments on<br/>
this<br/>
and other ideas to make a game more playable without throwing a balance<br/>
out<br/>
or tring to make a overpowerfull class.<br/>
<br/>
First positive things<br/>
<br/>
-� wizards are great for plane(after 34+ lv), group travel (druid is<br/>
best<br/>
in individual and nearly as good in group)<br/>
-� wizards are best in DD damage spells (but not in damage to mana ratio<br/>
DOT)<br/>
-� wizards spells are less resisted and it damage at last for one part<br/>
moust other class spells are resisted full<br/>
-� wizard is fastest to deal a massive damage in shortest time (but a<br/>
price?)<br/>
<br/>
Negativ things<br/>
<br/>
- Wizards have lowest defence, hit points and ac of all classes (lowest<br/>
combat survivel)<br/>
- wizard spells do massive damage but also use masive mana but when<br/>
wizard<br/>
uses it mana it is useless. Fighting is not a wizard strong side, wizard<br/>
dont have pets, dont have buffs, dont heal, they dont run well.<br/>
- Wizards risks very very much in combat agains only 2 blues<br/>
<br/>
First i don&#39;t wish to say that a wizard is not good or playable class it<br/>
is<br/>
nice but it is also a class with most downtime of all clases so as a<br/>
result<br/>
a 2 equaly expert people playing sametime will never get equal play<br/>
time,<br/>
wizard will most time be in his book. Why this hmm lets see<br/>
<br/>
All other Magic users have better mana usage then wizard, why pet is a<br/>
best<br/>
mana use it damages, it defend, it tount and it never expires until it<br/>
dies<br/>
( i personaly dont like this pets i wish to have a cat or dog od mouse<br/>
:-)<br/>
not for combat but as familiar ) . Buffs as result do more damage and<br/>
DOT<br/>
spells are much more mana efficent then our DD spells. <br/>
<br/>
So what can be done to make a wizard a time efficent to play as other<br/>
classes are. I suggest a faster mana recovering ratio not too much but a<br/>
1.3 or 1.2 faster times can help and its easy to implement one number<br/>
change in formula and go go go.<br/>
<br/>
Here i dont put in effect of specialization as for now it is not in game<br/>
(<br/>
long beta ) and i dont know if in later levels exist any only wizard<br/>
mana<br/>
regeneration booster but i heared of &quot;mana stone&quot; but noone knows what<br/>
it<br/>
is and when you find it. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks all for reading and as i live in italy my english is not maxed<br/>
yet,<br/>
but i please you to join a discussion and to not take to hard my<br/>
spelling<br/>
mistakes. <br/>
