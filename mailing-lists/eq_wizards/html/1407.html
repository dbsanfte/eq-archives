<b>Subject:</b> Where to hunt? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-580372739">Hi all<br/>
<br/>
    I am a fresh 16th level wizard currently bound in the Qeynos area, I was wondering where the best solo/group hunting grounds are?  So far 16 seems to be a &quot;tweener&quot; level, too high for some places and too low for others. I don&#39;t really care where the areas are. (willing to relocate : ) )  I&#39;m just looking for a place my group can fight, that has decent soloing near by.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
