<div id="ygrps-yiv-781856962">Actually, I believe Force Shock is counted as a Magic Attack, therefore uses <br/>
magic resistance to add up if it&#39;s resisted or not. Now take into effect <br/>
that almost all mobs have a higher resistance to magic than anything else <br/>
yeah it will be resisted more often. Try using a fire spell, or ice.<br/>

&gt;I just reached lvl 20, got all my spells, and I guess am a little<br/>
&gt;dissapointed. I do enjoy blasting for 170 points of damage, but it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;almost as if Verant has made these new spells EASIER to resist. For<br/>
&gt;instance, I fight Orcs in oasis. Low blue orcs and they are resisting my<br/>
&gt;new shock spell. They NEVER resist my 16th level lightning bolt. You<br/>
&gt;would think that a higher level spell would be as or harder to resist.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Another example is enstill. This ONLY works on greens. There is no blue,<br/>
&gt;white, yellow, red that I have found that is successfully enstilled. In<br/>
&gt;fact, when I fight the 20th level orcs that con black to me, they always<br/>
&gt;resist. Yet root works on them about 25% of the time. I was hoping that<br/>
&gt;when I got enstill it would be easier to solo because it is more<br/>
&gt;powerful, alas it isn&#39;t so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am heading to Lake Rathe now and hopefully my spells work better<br/>
&gt;there. If not, mayhaps we should petition to get this change. I mean<br/>
&gt;come on, I am about as useful as a 16th level wizard against red if<br/>
&gt;BLUES resist my new 20th level spells. While monsters are getting<br/>
&gt;progressively better I seem to be getting progressively incapable to<br/>
&gt;handle them.<br/>
