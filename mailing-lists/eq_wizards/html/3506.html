<b>Subject:</b> RE:ice comet scroll and Places for exp <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-108134724">As far as ice comet is concerned ... i put all 5 training points<br/>
into research every level since 16 keeping it maxed and succedded on the<br/>
1st 9/9 attempts of lvl 49 spells, the runes of BOTH frost and astral<br/>
can be found on the Dino in oot im 100% sure, but i do believe that any<br/>
49+ MoB has a chance of dropping lvl 49+ runes, words etc...(plus the<br/>
dino drops diamonds/blk sapphires/jacinth, as do all 50+ mobs)<br/>
<br/>
Kronon: 2 words for where to get experience at higher lvls without<br/>
killing guards ... Seafury Cyclopses ... these guys are so plentiful<br/>
that their isle can support at least 5 groups comfortably with each<br/>
group pulling nonstop one after the next, all of these one-eyes are lvl<br/>
39-42 or so making them good exp all the way up to 50 ... they hit about<br/>
the same as regular cyclopses, the only difference being that they hve<br/>
about 5000 hp&#39;s... their isle is located at about 1900, -6600 (next to<br/>
the isle that spawns the aincent cyclops)...However, be warned: also on<br/>
this isle is a lvl 45 cyclops named Quag Maelstrom, HE hits like a<br/>
mother and has LOTS of hp&#39;s, not to mention a nasty mana sink spell that<br/>
will drain you to oom very fast if he lays his mitts on you, that being<br/>
said he can easily be taken down by a competent group 45+ (he can be<br/>
killed by a group of 40+, but they better know what they are doing) ...<br/>
killing him however is terribly inefficient and not worth the time spent<br/>
per exp gained...he drops nothing of note  and will respawn quickly, so<br/>
its not like if u kill him you puller wont have to deal with him again<br/>
soon.<br/>
