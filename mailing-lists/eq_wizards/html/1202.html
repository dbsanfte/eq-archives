<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900612354"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I guess it is just based on your roleplaying style, but<br/>
&gt; even if I have no<br/>
&gt; money and still have spells to buy, I would not ask for or<br/>
&gt; accept any sort<br/>
&gt; of payment for using my talents.  Does anyone else agree<br/>
&gt; with me or do you<br/>
&gt; all think that you SHOULD rightfully earn a profit from<br/>
&gt; using your skills?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that there&#39;s nothing wrong with thrying to make some money off<br/>
your talents... I don&#39;t put anything in the trade skills so I rely on<br/>
wizardry for money ... Most of it comes from loot, but I will<br/>
occasionally try and make some money by binding people.<br/>
I usually only charge 5gp per bind.  And I always do it for free if<br/>
the person can&#39;t pay or just died... I like to help, but I also need<br/>
to make some money.<br/>
