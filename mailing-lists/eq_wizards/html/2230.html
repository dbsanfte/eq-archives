<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281278791">I&#39;m sorry but since I use aol for mail and stuff, my old mail gets deleted <br/>
fairly quickly and I cannot go back and look for the two sites I need: the <br/>
research spoiler sight, and the sight that has the wizard spell list that the <br/>
person sent to this list. Thanks for your help, Lott.</div>
