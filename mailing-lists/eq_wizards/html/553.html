<div id="ygrps-yiv-564886848">I know I can&#39;t use a bow.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I am trying to assemble the Trueshot Bow.  I need Treant Shards.<br/>
Jyle Windshot in the Inn in Freeport will give them to me in exchange for a<br/>
Faydark Champions Tunic (and two gp...).  I cannot find the tunic.  No<br/>
woodelf ranger that I have talked to has even heard of the tunic.  And<br/>
before they shut my server down today, you could not find it in Faydark<br/>
Champions in the wood elf city.<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody know where I can find Treant Shards (in the wild...) OR knows<br/>
where I can find the above mentioned tunic.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in Advance<br/>
