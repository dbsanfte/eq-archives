<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600903384">Hey there.. funny I should read this email now.. I just finished a treck into the beginnings of najena.  Let me ask you, I went in with a party of a lvl 16 ShadowKnight, lvl 16 cleric, lvl 16 enchanter (with lvl 16 pet), and 2 lvl 14 wizards.  We destroyed the ogres and the two skeles and I wanted to try the tentacle terrors.. but a few had to leave so we didn&#39;t.  How tough are they? think we would have had a chance?<br/>

    Actually, Sense Summon will come in very handy as you advance in levels and start hitting some of the dungeons.  Najena is a prime example as there are Elementals all over the place there.  Elementals are considered summoned creatures and so the spell will point out the nearest one to you, giving you an idea of what&#39;s ahead and how powerful they are.  It isn&#39;t until you hit 18th or higher that the true beauty of this spell is realized.<br/>

        Sense summoned is pretty useless as a spell, but think of it as a trainer, its not too costly mana wise and it&#39;s one of the few divination spells you get early on so just cast a few bars of mana and max out your div whenever you have the time, im sure theres a useful divination spell eventually<br/>
