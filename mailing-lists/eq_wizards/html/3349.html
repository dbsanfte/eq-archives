<br/>
Can&#39;t really say since I&#39;ve never fought in Toxx.  However, some guards in <br/>
certain newbie zones are better than others.  Other&#39;s might have different <br/>
suggestions but here&#39;s what I think of the zones I&#39;ve been in:<br/>
<br/>
Felwithe guards -- fairly reliable.  Good reaction time.  They&#39;ll pretty <br/>
much take care of anything that gets in the vicinity<br/>
<br/>
Kelethin guards -- slow pokes.  They can usually be caught sleeping near the <br/>
lifts and you can sometimes die unwittingly if you don&#39;t leave yourself <br/>
enough HP to wait for the guards to wake up. :)  Sometimes, they sleepwalk <br/>
away from their spots and end up clear across other parts of the zone on <br/>
their own agendas.<br/>
<br/>
Steamfont guards -- good reaction time, but they&#39;re relatively weaker than <br/>
some of the MoBs you might encounter in the area.  If you hear &quot;Hero&quot; you <br/>
should basically zone out. :)  Weak little stinky gnomes...OOPS!  Did I just <br/>
say that out loud?  heh<br/>
<br/>
ButcherBlock guards -- strong and fast.  Fairly reliable.  Don&#39;t mistake <br/>
that lady smith near the first house for a guard like I did when I was a <br/>
newbie.  Corflunk the Ogre nailed me right at her feet. :P<br/>
<br/>
Freeport guards -- slow reaction times, but not as bad as Kelethin.  Faction <br/>
might affect the way they help you here since some of them are corrupt.  <br/>
They do not help you against those irritating...err...I forget what they&#39;re <br/>
called...beggers or something.  I don&#39;t think they help you against Dorn the <br/>
Dark Elf NPC either.  Somebody else here might know...<br/>
<br/>
Queynos guards -- pretty reliable.  I haven&#39;t had any problems with their <br/>
help there.  You might want to head here since there is more stuff to kill <br/>
than Toxx.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s as much as I know.  Good luck in your travels!<br/>
