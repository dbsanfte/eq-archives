&gt; At that level your best bet for fast advancing is one other person. The two<br/>
&gt; of you together can take yellow mobs, have no problems and still gain<br/>
&gt; quickly. I hunted with an equal level magician(my best friend in RL) from<br/>
&gt; about 6th-12th. From there we hooked up with some other friends and now I<br/>
&gt; have a full group that I hunt with constantly(we are all 16th now). I know<br/>
&gt; that you can group with 5 or 6 others and hunt but until you make 10th and<br/>
&gt; higher you really don&#39;t need the full group, just get one other person that<br/>
&gt; understands your style and the two of you will do fine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As far as what to fight well you have a couple of options if you want to<br/>
&gt; stay on Faydwer. With a group you can enter Crushbone and take the<br/>
&gt; centurions there, just beware of Crush&#39;s train and move if you hear anyone<br/>
&gt; shouting about it. Solo, or with the one other person, you can stick to the<br/>
&gt; Orc Camp and kill the cents and oracles that spawn there(some will still be<br/>
&gt; white and yellow to you). Lesser Faydark is an option if you don&#39;t mind<br/>
&gt; killing pixies, the tower there is usually empty of other players and you<br/>
&gt; can still gain from the pranksters. If none of those options are appealing<br/>
&gt; then there is always Butcherblock. Head over there with your group and take<br/>
&gt; Dwarf Skel&#39;s(only spawn at night), Giant Bat&#39;s, Roaming Goblins and Spiders.<br/>
&gt; If you prefer to camp then there are numerous goblin camps dotting the<br/>
&gt; landscape although beware of the goblin wizards and shamans as they are<br/>
&gt; probably too tough for you at 7th.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope this helps.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yours,<br/>
