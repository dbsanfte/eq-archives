<div id="ygrps-yiv-1472247253">More power to any of you cheaters/exploiters out there, if any of you want<br/>
to trade exploit information, my email address is here.  I play a druid, and<br/>
whomever said we only do 96 at lvl 22, is wrong, we do 97 so ha...we can<br/>
anything we want except druids, bears and wolves, and wizards are only good<br/>
for 2 things, stealing kills, and root and shoot...that&#39;s it, nothing else,<br/>
period, end of story...that&#39;s why i went to druid...kiting is a little<br/>
better, not much, but a little.  Once again, i know about 8 exploit areas,<br/>
good from lvl 9 to 25...any info on others will be rewarded...and the GM&#39;s<br/>
can blow me, they really, really can.</div>
