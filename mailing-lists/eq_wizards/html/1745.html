<div id="ygrps-yiv-1708669388">uhhh who said i was reporting you? maybe the proper words would be it&#39;s<br/>
obvious that you SUPPORT twinking sorry. but it seems that if you made<br/>
another character you would most likely twink...<br/>

&gt;&gt; qenelin you&#39;re obviously a twinker now. sorry but it&#39;s damned clear<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Oh yeah? Can you please clear up that leap of logic?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Oh yes, please report me to a GM, you snitch, and see how they laugh at<br/>
&gt;you after they check and see I only have one character.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The closest to twinking I ever came was giving a few plat to some of my<br/>
&gt;low level friends. Once.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But thanks for the clarification. In this day and age of personal<br/>
&gt;uncertainty and insecurity, it&#39;s good to know that I&#39;m, obviously, a<br/>
&gt;twinker and nothing else.<br/>
