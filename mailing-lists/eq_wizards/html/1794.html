<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563040067">According to mstokes:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I haven&#39;t really noticed any change with roots, as a matter of fact I<br/>
&gt; rooted a /con white tarantula long enough this morning to unload all of my<br/>
&gt; mana and get the kill without getting a scratch.  One thing I have noticed<br/>
&gt; is that everything happens in batches.  I&#39;ll go 20 minutes without a<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My stance on this is that they probably changed their random number<br/>
generators. I get more &quot;consistent&quot; fizzles and partial resists these days.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; same type of mob.  Another example is that my skills won&#39;t increases and<br/>
&gt; then I&#39;ll get 2 skill increases back to back.5)  One other thing to keep in<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They increase pretty regularly for me. I always get 2 increase in meditation<br/>
on the next meditation after a level increase, and typically maximise<br/>
chanelling and meditation within 15mn of my next level... unless I die first :)<br/>
Offense and defense get maxed during the level, but I&#39;m falling behind<br/>
in the weapon-specific skills :(<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think you can advance you throwing skills on /con greens. Can anyone<br/>
&gt; confirm or deny this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can confirm. My monk friend got twice combat skills increases on green<br/>
monsters, and no experience from these (as opposed from the rare green<br/>
monster that still yields experience).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Very good tip, and its true.  I&#39;ve checked it out myself<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Got killed by Lord Shin Ree yesterday. Lost 1/3rd of bubble. I had<br/>
regagned it when three blue Orc centurions jumped me (at 1 pixel of 11th<br/>
level). I had a little over a half bubble to regain that time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve purchased some netted the other day (cape, pants, shawl) and<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t see any weight or AC advantage over cloth.  Is there any<br/>
&gt; &gt; benefit to netted and, if not, what should I be buying?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s lighter, and its free.  Also you can sell the gloves to monks for a<br/>
&gt; hefty profit.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends. If you are able to wear small size, it&#39;s the same weight. Pants<br/>
are lighter, most aren&#39;t (shameless plug: go check my EQ treasure chest<br/>
at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.frmug.org/eqchest/,">http://www.frmug.org/eqchest/,</a> which lists all one can use and usually<br/>
where to find it). For a human or erudite caster however, they&#39;re uselful.<br/>
Not worth risking one&#39;s life for them, but nice.<br/>
