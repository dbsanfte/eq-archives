&gt; More power to any of you cheaters/exploiters out there, if any of you want<br/>
&gt; to trade exploit information, my email address is here.  I play a druid, and<br/>
&gt; whomever said we only do 96 at lvl 22, is wrong, we do 97 so ha...we can<br/>
&gt; anything we want except druids, bears and wolves, and wizards are only good<br/>
&gt; for 2 things, stealing kills, and root and shoot...that&#39;s it, nothing else,<br/>
&gt; period, end of story...that&#39;s why i went to druid...kiting is a little<br/>
&gt; better, not much, but a little.  Once again, i know about 8 exploit areas,<br/>
&gt; good from lvl 9 to 25...any info on others will be rewarded...and the GM&#39;s<br/>
&gt; can blow me, they really, really can.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just wanted to clarify that I have never used an exploit in my EQ life<br/>
and I am not planning to do so in the future. I was just against the<br/>
idea. But then I realized that ignorant idiots like the above poster<br/>
think they have an ally in me, and that really made me sick.<br/>
<br/>
HTH, HAND.<br/>
