<div id="ygrps-yiv-1465033593">I have shieldskin and love it.  I am wondering how long it lasts.  From my<br/>
research I think it lasts for X number of hitpoints damage or X number of<br/>
hits from the MOB.<br/>
<br/>
I attack yellow Scythe Beetles with my sheildskin on and perform the ever<br/>
popular CAST, RUN, CAST technique till my mana is gone.  Normally a yellow<br/>
creature will retain a small amount of their hitpoints left so I must melee<br/>
it.  The beetles hit damn hard (26-40 points) on about half their hits.<br/>
This can spell disaster for all your hard work to bring it down.  I swing<br/>
away and when the beetle strikes me, my magical shield absorbs the ALL the<br/>
damage..but for a limited time..normally enough for me to kill the creature.<br/>
<br/>
Again, anyone know how many hits I can absorb before the shield wears off?<br/>
