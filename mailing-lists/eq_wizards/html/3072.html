You are the second one telling me to go to Casic so ill better head over there then. dont know if i dare to try the gate there tho, even if there has been some good advice on how to go there the best way without geting killed. My play style is that i dont run around blindly in a new zone not knowing where itï¿½s safe to meditate best place to hunt etc. Know any good URL for a map over Casic and our drop spot over there ?<br/>

&gt; &gt;Lim but it is....If you always got the item then you wouldnt have any kinda<br/>
&gt; &gt;pride or anything about it and everyone would have one I like to be one of<br/>
&gt; &gt;the only people with stuff like our guild we would go and get all the items<br/>
&gt; &gt;on server first and we wouild keep them no selling and we kept them as<br/>
&gt; &gt;trophys....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, I can see your point.  Yet, it still doesn&#39;t make camping any more <br/>
&gt; enjoyable does it?  All it does is delay the inevitable.  Assuming the MoB <br/>
&gt; dropped your item everytime...your guild would STILL be the first ones to <br/>
&gt; get it.  It doesn&#39;t mean you tried any harder...it just meant you didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; have to waste so much time doing it.  How is that a bad thing?  Item Rarity <br/>
&gt; should be dependant upon the difficulty in the MoB itself IMHO.  An item can <br/>
&gt; even be made rare by making the MoB spawn less often... they DO that <br/>
&gt; already...but the frustration is made worse when the item is not on the MoB. <br/>
&gt;   It&#39;s like they want to double-up on your tension.  This point is not as <br/>
&gt; important...but you gotta remember we are all on paid time.  Verant has no <br/>
&gt; problem making us sit for 18hours at a time for an item now do they?  :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I liked the other post I read earlier that suggested random spawns...if it <br/>
&gt; could be designed in such a way that a NPC would spawn *anywhere* in the <br/>
&gt; level itself.  Now that&#39;s a fun challenge!  :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, now that the powergamers have gotten all there is to get, your point <br/>
&gt; is moot my friend.  I have no desire to be the &quot;first&quot; to get an item...I <br/>
&gt; just want it for personal satisfaction.  I killed the Mob...I got my item.  <br/>
&gt; :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, by the way Askur, the advice to go to Cazic is a good one.  From 24 and <br/>
&gt; up....it&#39;s a haven for xp!  And I&#39;m not going to begin to say how much money <br/>
&gt; you can get there hehe.   I&#39;ll probably run into you there.<br/>
