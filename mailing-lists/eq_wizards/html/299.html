<b>Subject:</b> Re: Mana management? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021860655">Michael&#39;s commentary is good stuff!  As a wizard, mana management is the<br/>
most important skill you&#39;ll ever learn.  Its the kind of thing that<br/>
can&#39;t be quantified by stats or skill levels.  The added advantage of<br/>
using Mana wisely, is that when your party really needs the help(like<br/>
say a creature attacks the party while they rest), you&#39;ll be there to<br/>
pull their fat out of the fryer.  Trust me, if you learn this skill,<br/>
people will remember and they will be clamoring to get you into their<br/>
party.<br/>

&gt; I hang back, watch everyones health.  Once the enemy has some noticeable damage..  I hit him once twice with shock.  Then hang back again.  If I&#39;m FM I hit him twice with shock again.  If we&#39;re in a relatively safe place, I&#39;ll actually sit and start medding.  I try not to let my mana go below 60%.  So I never burn on a creature that we&#39;re obviously going to kill anyway.  Unless:  Someone is about to die, the creature can only be hit by magical weapons or spells, or the creature resists my root spell and is running away.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope that helps.<br/>

&gt; &gt; In groups, whats a typical strategy for managing mana?  At 12th level, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; guesstimate I have about 360-370 mana, almost enough for 6 lightning shock<br/>
&gt; &gt; spells, but I don&#39;t want to waste it all on just one kill, and yet I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; feel very comforatable sitting around doing nothing.<br/>
