<div id="ygrps-yiv-153293848">Blade trap?  I saw that &quot;decoration&quot; and didn&#39;t even realize it might be a<br/>
trap.  So I walked right into it.  And nothing happened at all.  In fact,<br/>
until someone else mentioned the word trap in-game, I didn&#39;t even think that<br/>
was what it might be.  The next time I was there, I stood under it, and<br/>
still, no effect.  I never take damage from it.  Has anyone out there ever<br/>
been damaged by it?<br/>

&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     List sems to be dieing down so I thought I&#39;d share my experience with<br/>
&gt; lava.<br/>
&gt; I was in soulsek A and trying to go through the window instead of taking a<br/>
&gt; chance with the swinging blade trap.  I was also invisable at the time.<br/>
&gt; Well I got stuck in the window.  Suddenly I popped out and fell backwards<br/>
&gt; into the lava pool.  At the time I had major shield, Leather Skin and<br/>
&gt; Elemntal Protextion on me.  At first I nearly paniced but then I started<br/>
&gt; banging my 6 key. It was my hot key for gate.  The whole time I was<br/>
thinking<br/>
&gt; that this was the end, and I&#39;d never get my corps back. After two tries, I<br/>
&gt; got a gate off.  When I materialized at m bind point, I had 22 hp left.<br/>
&gt; From what I hear, I can  consider myself extreamly lucky to have lived.  I<br/>
&gt; think I would have been a lot luckier if I had not fell in at all.<br/>
