<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327372734">I&#39;ve seen a guild on the innoruuk server called &quot;The Higher Order of the Arcane Arts&quot; os somehting similar to that, If anyone on this list knows anyhting about this guild i would love for them to send me an e-mail to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:audiocow@...">audiocow@...</a> because i am interested in the guild. Or you could just send a e-mail to the list and i could read it or whatever you wish.</div>
