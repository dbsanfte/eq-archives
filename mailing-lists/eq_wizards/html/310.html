<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892136254">What good does the research skill have?  I&#39;ve heard that I could research<br/>
spells myself instead of buying them, but that it would cost more than<br/>
simply purchasing the spell.  Are there spells that can only be found by<br/>
research? (I&#39;m assuming this is the case...)  Does anyone have any insights<br/>
that they could share?  Thanks...<br/>
