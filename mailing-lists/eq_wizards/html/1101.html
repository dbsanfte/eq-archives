<div id="ygrps-yiv-176283311">Not always true.. I&#39;ve hit creature that conned red for my lvl 21 group mate<br/>
while I was lvl 19.  Which means the creature was probably 24 (that<br/>
right?)..  But I&#39;ve also fought an NPC who is lvl 24 and have never come<br/>
close to doing dmg to him.  So while lvl is the most important, it&#39;s not<br/>
always the only factor.<br/>
