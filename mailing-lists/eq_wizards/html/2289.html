<div id="ygrps-yiv-12110886">This whole discussion from your excuse ridden POV is just hilarious. Well<br/>
heads up buddy when I group I usually direct the group from the rear-vantage<br/>
point and I go out of my way to kill whiners like you. Oh, what you say? On<br/>
a non-pvp server? You bet and anyone can do it(the train idea is only 1<br/>
way....).<br/>
<br/>
Apparently you&#39;ve already wrecked your reputation enuff that you may never<br/>
find a group. I can&#39;t count the times I&#39;ve started a group or been asked to<br/>
group EVERY time I&#39;m in the game. As it has been said on this list more<br/>
times than I can count: Shouting is not the best way to find a group or form<br/>
a group. You apparently aren&#39;t trying hard enuff, don&#39;t care, lack social<br/>
graces, or are just a loser(pick one).<br/>
<br/>
I can solo thru lvl 25 with rarely a problem if I had trouble finding a<br/>
group. I suggest you find one of these spots and get to whatever level you<br/>
can cause you won&#39;t be able to get the full enjoyment out of the game being<br/>
an ass. Good luck with your 25th lvl solo character. After the ignorance<br/>
you&#39;ve shown in your letters I&#39;m not even gonna tell you how to turn your<br/>
reputation around. Start a new character....this ones going nowhere...<br/>
