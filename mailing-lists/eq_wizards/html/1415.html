<div id="ygrps-yiv-574232183">According to Jay Hollums:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; give them nice damage margins to all the other classes from the get go.  I<br/>
&gt; personally know that a 8th level mage, vs. a 8th level wiz is no contest..<br/>
&gt; the mage has a pet and spells...  Now you are saying that the mage doesn&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, if you let him cast. We&#39;re talking about organised duels, right?<br/>
No pets summoned before the duel begins is the rule.<br/>
<br/>
When preparing for such a duel, whip out your trusty old tarnished dagger<br/>
(the weapon you&#39;re likely to have at that level) with 22 speed.<br/>
<br/>
When you get the signal, JUMP the mage. And don&#39;t let him cast. If he casts,<br/>
you&#39;re not fighting one to one, you&#39;re fighting to one to two, and you lost.<br/>
<br/>
Against any spell caster, the strategy for a spell caster isn&#39;t &quot;root and<br/>
nuke&quot;, it&#39;s jump on him and hit fast... while trying to get your spells<br/>
in. If the mage uses a staff or slow weapon, he&#39;s dead: he won&#39;t interrupt<br/>
you often enough.<br/>
<br/>
If you intend to participate in duels, your most important investment is getting<br/>
a weapon with the shortest speed factor. I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a combine<br/>
or fine steel dagger, but a steel dagger (speed 20) is a good weapon. You don&#39;t<br/>
want to do damage, you just want to interrupt the opponent&#39; spells. Against<br/>
a melee fighter, the weapon is irrelevant anyway, root and nuke, and don&#39;t<br/>
move near him.<br/>
