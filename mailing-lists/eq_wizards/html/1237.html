Haven&#39;t heard whether it is magical or not, if so, it is easily THE best<br/>
weapon in game for mage classes because of its stats AND it frees up your<br/>
other hand.   I have heard where to get it but have forgotten, sorry.  But<br/>
what I do remember is that it is designed to be tough to get until you are<br/>
Lvl 40+.  Better make interim weapon plans if you are still in the teens<br/>
like me ))  <br/>

<br/>
		Piercing is the way to go.  I am an advocate of it because<br/>
of the Pugius, the <br/>
		fanged skull stilleto, and the certain skull that was talked<br/>
about so many <br/>
		times prior.  With a Pugius right now at lvl 13, and the<br/>
skull, life is much <br/>
		easier.  Plus 20 mana is better than the runed staff can<br/>
provide, and the <br/>
		Pugius attacks much, much quicker.  I am still looking for a<br/>
fanged skull <br/>
		stilleto (anyone know where to get them), but once I have<br/>
found one, life <br/>
		will be much easier.<br/>
