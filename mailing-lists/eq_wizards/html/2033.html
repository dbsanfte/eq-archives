<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631812016">Here is a great little write-up on familiars.  It describes many types of<br/>
them, but the one that would probably fit us best in EQ would be the<br/>
companion familiar, functioning as either a sense familiar, magic familiar,<br/>
or power familiar.  Read the write-up for some good explanations and let me<br/>
know what you think.  I honestly doubt that Verant would give us anything<br/>
like this, because they probably think that we are perfectly balanced<br/>
already, and even the idea to have a familiar that does nothing would not<br/>
appeal to them because they would have to create the art and animation for<br/>
somethat that is useless except for stylistic purposes.  Anyway, we can<br/>
dream can&#39;t we, and maybe if we make a good enough case they will consider<br/>
it.<br/>

I think this would be the COOLEST idea!  Hell even if the familiar did<br/>
absolutely NOTHING for us at all and cost 200 mana to cast I would still use<br/>
it!  As many people have stated we really dont have anything that makes us<br/>
unique.  We just have the best offensive DD spells and that&#39;s it (which in<br/>
some cases does not even make us very useful).  A familiar would be a nicer<br/>
stylistic sign that we are wizards and not just some bozo in a bath robe.<br/>
It would be the coolest thing to have a little black cat at your heels all<br/>
the time even if they didnt act as a mana battery.  Anyway... I am rambling<br/>
I will probably feedback this idea cause its so darn cool.<br/>

I have an idea. All the other spellcasting classes have pets (including<br/>
hybrids with their charms). Instead of getting a pet, since we are so<br/>
mana dependent ( and the other classes have pets which do WAY more for<br/>
the mana then we can do with DD over time) we get a familiar.<br/>
<br/>
A familiar is similar to a pet ( a MOB that would follow us ) but it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be for battle. It would act as a mana battery increasing our<br/>
total mana. It would cast a lot more mana to cast than it gives us. If<br/>
it dies, we lose the amount of mana that it gives us and maybe damage us<br/>
a bit. It will not attack or defend. It will attract the frenzy of<br/>
intelligent MOBs but it will also turn invisible with us.<br/>
<br/>
It could be a small cat, dog, skunk, whatever (random?) and we would get<br/>
maybe 3 or 4 throughout our ranks that have increasing amount of mana.<br/>
This would offset a lot of our complaints on being a unique class, being<br/>
able to compete, etc. Plus it would be fun! Wizards throughout lore have<br/>
used familiars to aid them in their studies. Since we rely ENTIRELY on<br/>
our mana to survive (unlike others who have permanent pet to aid) this<br/>
would help us get that extra root off and run, or that last blast to get<br/>
the 2nd blue.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think? I know it&#39;s unlikely it will happen, but it sure<br/>
sounds like a good idea :) And it would make us unique and it would<br/>
enhance our artillerly challenged butts :P<br/>
