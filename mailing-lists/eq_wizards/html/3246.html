<div id="ygrps-yiv-321134982">what&#39;s simpler and quicker to do is just to target yourself and cast root<br/>
over and over again to get the alteration skill up. I also read on graffe&#39;s<br/>
site: www.graffe.com. That roots power was dramatically decreased since it<br/>
was too powerful in group situations. After hunting with 2 wizards and an sk<br/>
I have found this to be true, we can take 3 guys on just by rooting two and<br/>
then blasting the other before the other 2 become free.<br/>

&gt;Phaedra, Do not despair, I have no clue why we get root at lvl 4 because<br/>
&gt;was useless to me until ablut lvl 12, i had all of the same probs as u r<br/>
&gt;having with it, wouldnt stick, eats WAAAY too much mana however, at lvl<br/>
&gt;12 or so it will start to actually stick and become a little more mana<br/>
&gt;efficient.  Beleive me, root WILL become your lead-off spell or you will<br/>
&gt;die very often, and without it you can forget about soloingWe cannot<br/>
&gt;kite, so we must root.  Hang in there, it DOES get better, Much better!<br/>
