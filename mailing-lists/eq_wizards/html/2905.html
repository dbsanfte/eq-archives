&gt; &gt; Haha I got mine for free :P.......From my guild I gave them a fbr I got from<br/>
&gt; &gt; najena when we were camping jboots<br/>

&gt; Well, be prepared for when Verant yanks the quest quickly because it&#39;s too<br/>
&gt; easy (specially if, as Allakhazam says, a level 12 enchanter can do it).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think Allakahzam got some misinformation.  I have heard of many people who<br/>
completed this quest (From brewers list, we learned long before others)  The only<br/>
successes so far have been from 20+ Enchanters (Illusion Ogre, Benevolence) and<br/>
very well factioned Ogres (Who purchased the ingridents from others).  You need<br/>
to have Clurg above indifferent to get the item.  The Euridin ingredient also<br/>
requires good Eurdite faction to complete that subquest.   I also know<br/>
non-enchanter Dark elves and Druids in Wolf form who /conned indifferent to<br/>
Clurg, but were still refused the reward.</div>
