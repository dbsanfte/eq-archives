<div id="ygrps-yiv-26712255">Exactly.  Timing is everything.  If you get in a group that is unfamiliar <br/>
with Wizards, they sometimes panic when you hold back on spells.  But this <br/>
is what you HAVE to do... better to stay alive to help out then to die and <br/>
risk the possibility of having the whole group die.  Just let them know in <br/>
advance about your strategy.<br/>
It&#39;s gotten to the point now in my group that they all know exactly when I <br/>
need to cast...the tanks have no problem taking some hits for me.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I spent some time in Beholders for the first time yesterday killing <br/>
evil eyes!  If you haven&#39;t tried it (level 16-19) you&#39;ll love it.  Basically <br/>
no melee combat for the eyeballs...just a lot of spellslinging.  Nice change <br/>
of pace!  Only thing to watch out for is when they charm your tank..so have <br/>
root ready.  If you blast away fast enough, you can interrupt their spells.  <br/>
Xp came real fast there!  (I finally made 20! whoohooo!  Now I need a last <br/>
name like LimDul the Loudmouth or something ;)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, about a previous post about how 30+ creatures con: yeah, it&#39;s not a <br/>
science.  Blue creatures will become increasingly hard to solo, for tanks or <br/>
casters alike...based primarily in their relation to your level rather then <br/>
their ability to kick your @$$. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I partnered up with a Druid in Beholders.  At 22, his most efficient spell <br/>
only did 96.  At 19, my most efficient shock spell did 108.  He was a nice <br/>
complement to my spells because of his SOWs.  Druids are cool...but I&#39;d <br/>
personally hate to not be able to kill animals. ;)<br/>

it is much easier and you have a lot less down time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;As for the Druid, I don&#39;t know their spells that well. But I do know that<br/>
&gt;Druids are mainly for outdoors, so my thought is, can she do that kind of<br/>
&gt;damage in a dungeon? Or is that spell an outdoor spell only?<br/>
