<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185921881">Thanks for the inputs. I have spoke with Tech Supt and they seem to agree.<br/>
I hope to at least get a Ressurection out of this.  I dont mind the death<br/>
really, just wish it would be posted somewhere what the limitations of the<br/>
software is currently.  Then these great mysteries would not kill us all the<br/>
time...or cost us many plat on training and spells that dont work.  Or<br/>
trying to buy two identical spells and spending 6 plat each on them to find<br/>
out you can only get one scroll at a time...yes, the NPC merchant takes your<br/>
money but only gives one scroll.<br/>

I agree with you.  You should be able to cast spells on a docked boat.<br/>
Maybe they dont want the extra animation lagging the boat ride up?  *shrugs*<br/>
But, yeah, I think we should at least be able to cast Gate while on a docked<br/>
boat...<br/>
