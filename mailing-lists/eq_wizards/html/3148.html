<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047730477">Thanks for the solo tips everyone.  Believe me, I don&#39;t like soloing<br/>
any more than you do...darn boring.  But some nights are just <br/>
unavoidable...especially on Veeshan when there are certain hours when<br/>
it&#39;s mostly inhabited by players from Japan. :)  Hard to get a group<br/>
going when it&#39;s in another language. heh.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ve been able to find a pretty good spot lately for xp in Cazic.  <br/>
It seems to be a good spot for a small group because it avoids the bulk of <br/>
the trains.  Some of you might know the area that looks like a big crater?  <br/>
I think the crater area itself had about 4 or 5 spawn points...plus it has 2 <br/>
corridors on either end where and experienced tank can pull from.  With a <br/>
group with 1 Wizard, 1 Cleric and a couple of tanks...you may never need to <br/>
run once during your whole time there.  I think this area maybe good from <br/>
levels 24-30.  A couple mobs are still red to me at 27.  Extra challenge <br/>
comes from the MoB healers who make it extra tough to kill any of the <br/>
creatures when they are around...best to switch targets and nuke the hell <br/>
outta them.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Boy I can&#39;t wait till 29 when we can hit for....241 or something?  Whoohooo!<br/>
