<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314796149"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Another MUCH missed int item that you can do at level 12 is the golden<br/>
&gt;stud earring.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hehe. Yeah, I just went back and got those recently.  I was essentially a <br/>
rat exterminator for a couple days.  :)  The thing that&#39;s irritating about <br/>
this quest is that you have to wait for 3 random things:<br/>
<br/>
1) Cubert doesn&#39;t spawn all the time<br/>
2) He doesn&#39;t always carry the quest item<br/>
3) When you bring the item to the NPC..he doesn&#39;t always give you the <br/>
earring.<br/>
<br/>
How irritating is that?  Is this supposed to be fun? ;)<br/>
