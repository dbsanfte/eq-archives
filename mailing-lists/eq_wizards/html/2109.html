at what we do. i totally understand the force shock thing (either take away<br/>
the stun, or do less dmg... i like the taking away the stun). but you guys<br/>
are asking way too much. the reason enstill doesn&#39;t work well is they want<br/>
to encourage grouping! but i <br/>

They want to encourage grouping so they cripple one of our spells?   Can&#39;t<br/>
wait see how well this strategy works.  =)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

way too much way too early. sorry to say this but they still need a lot of<br/>
kinks to be worked out before they even START adding new spells. and expect<br/>
an obscene amount of new spells in the expansion. from what i saw when i<br/>
went to Verant. Geoffrey has a lotta time on his hands and way back on may<br/>
6th he said he was already working on the new spells for the expansion. not<br/>
to mention completely overhauling the enchanter spells and *gasp* some of<br/>
the wizard spells! so just hang in there. don&#39;t petition because it&#39;s<br/>
pointless. wait a while and if nothing good comes around. THEN petition. if<br/>
they see a petition, turn it down, then see the same one in a couple<br/>
months, they&#39;re not going to take it seriously! so just wait.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
It may be pointless, it may do no good whatsoever but it does serve a<br/>
purpose.  Even if everything we suggest gets shot down, it still lets them<br/>
know that we are not satisfied with the thing the way they are.  <br/>
<br/>
I know the guys are working hard to get the expansion pack out the door but<br/>
with all the patches and fixes coming out for the other magic-using classes<br/>
it does seems like the Wizard-class is getting ignored.  And we don&#39;t like<br/>
that.  So we protest and petition.  <br/>
<br/>
What else can we do?  If you&#39;ve got some advise on what I can do to help<br/>
with the improvement of my character class, I will gladly listen and<br/>
participate.  But if the best you&#39;ve got is, &quot;Sit back and wait.<br/>
Quietly.&quot;, I can&#39;t do do that.  It might be sound advise, but I like to<br/>
think this group might in some way influence changes to our class.  <br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, does anyone know how many people are members of this<br/>
group?  I don&#39;t, and I&#39;m curious.  If we were to all agree on something<br/>
(okay, granted - that&#39;s a BIG &quot;if&quot; =), would we be a loud enough voice to<br/>
affect a major change to be put in place?  <br/>
