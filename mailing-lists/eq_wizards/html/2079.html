<div id="ygrps-yiv-419088306">i liked this list at the start but now it&#39;s all just whining about what we don&#39;t have and that&#39;s sad. i&#39;m sure i will be angry at lvl 20 but that won&#39;t get me down. just play the wizard how he/she is, or get a new class. as you guys learned the hard way, they&#39;re not gonna do the stuff you want. the only good idea i heard was the familiar thing. but the rest was just stupid (excluding the problems with force shock). cmon guys i think what you all need to do is go and play a new class and see what you like more.. (i just made a halfling rogue Dukkan on fenro and it was a fun change of pace! got him up to lvl 5 real quick cuz it&#39;s fun). besides that it&#39;s cool to have a character that can where almost anything.<br/>
