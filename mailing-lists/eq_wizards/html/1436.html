<b>Subject:</b> Back, and interesting run in with Bronxx <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-326349626">Well, finally back from vacation, and good to see you all here. : ) Missed you guys.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, thought I&#39;d point out a known bug that could end up with you waiting for a couple of hours for a GM. Just so you&#39;re aware of it.<br/>
<br/>
In Runnyeye, people like to congregate near the zone to Gorge and pull goblins guards, elites, etc... If you get in trouble, the zone is right there. No troubles. Well, I&#39;m sure some of us here have encountered the unique eye, Bronxx or something like that. He&#39;s a named eye, and unfortunately turned his gaze on me. I was running for the zone when WHAM, go hit with a force shock. I run, and turn a corner and it&#39;s a dead end. Blank stone no where to run. The force shock had thrown me past the zone point and into the dead end. I run back, and try to zone again, but got hit with another force shock before I had time to turn around and try to zone again. Me dead. Trying to recover my body didn&#39;t work because I&#39;d zone. Now, after typing in /who all gm and finding no one on, a cold ball of lead materialised in my stomach. <br/>
<br/>
To make matters short, I got my corpse back now, I&#39;m back on, and happy to see everyone again. Say, shouldn&#39;t a bunch of us meet in irc or something and come up with a faq for us wizards? I know there&#39;s a ton of things that people ask all the time, and we should go over past digests and see what to put in. Just my 2ï¿½...<br/>
