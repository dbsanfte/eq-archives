<div id="ygrps-yiv-372155313">I think that here must be diferent group tactics what you need to use in<br/>
base of wizard lv.<br/>
<br/>
Im now 15 lv. and i use many diferent tactics in base of other group<br/>
membewrs, if we are group of casters highest lv will ROOT target ( be<br/>
careful that a other lower lv not try to root as they will make all further<br/>
savings at base of last root casted !! So if higest lv cast root all other<br/>
lower lv can concentrate on firing spells, as soon as monster moves again<br/>
you must cast root again by your highest caracter and he have a ruole to<br/>
kill a beast with last shot. It is important that a rooter is free of<br/>
monsters as life of others depend on his ability to root.<br/>
<br/>
All for now next tactic soon <br/>
