<div id="ygrps-yiv-399187765">Dear eq friends!<br/>
<br/>
When i started a game it was very vell balanced and i can say there were<br/>
many people trying all classes and it was funny, but as game advance new<br/>
specialized tactics come out and in many times Verant is a last one to see<br/>
exploit and not a first one as it have to be. Now i have seen that at 5<br/>
newer servers first to reach a higest lv are druids !! at valos zek pvp<br/>
server it is a same reason is of course kiting and dot spells wich they<br/>
have. This is something wrong !<br/>
<br/>
Second thing i noted was farming of glowing stain wich we have seen in last<br/>
2 weeks from nowere to see there are now nearly every higer lv caster have<br/>
one! It is funny for my glowing black stone wich was a hard to get item is<br/>
now nearly underpowered item :) This was stoped unfortunatly to late and<br/>
now we wich dont get a stain will never get it.<br/>
<br/>
Now i start to see one other problem.<br/>
<br/>
Powerfull items are comming from higer lv players wich give or sell or<br/>
twinkle lower lv when they get mre powerful items. This items make item<br/>
dipendent mele class out of any balance on lower lvs!!  Spell casters are<br/>
particulary sensibile to this as they are not item dependent for their<br/>
power but it dependens on spells, mana to damage ratio, mana to healing ..<br/>
protection ratio wich is all hardcoded to level. <br/>
<br/>
So what hapends .. to make example i spend some time building a wizard and<br/>
a warrior to 6 lv and i twinked them with items to make a probe.<br/>
<br/>
Warrior with nearly full large bronze and fine stell sword .. Wizard with<br/>
full woven, rts skull, +10 mana earings ect.. Normaly warrior dies on 3<br/>
high blues 100% on this lv .... wizard dont have mana to kill 2 high blue .. <br/>
<br/>
My warrior take against 8 !!! BLUES and survived .... so he realy have been<br/>
affecter imensly... Wizard tryed against same 2 blues and he died in same<br/>
mode as before.<br/>
<br/>
Counting im only a 27 lv so i can twinkle my guys only a little :)) one 50<br/>
lv guy can make this diference much much higer.<br/>
<br/>
Same effect i have seen in mistmore .. grouping with many people i have<br/>
seen what diference can make overpowered items... warrior hitting for 70 a<br/>
hit it is 140 - 160 counting a bash ... without mana use a turn!!  <br/>
<br/>
Wizard at 27 lv can do only 178 damage and he will be out Of mana in 6 - 7<br/>
hits a warrior can go without end and with god items he will alos need less<br/>
cleric healing!<br/>
<br/>
Wisdom classes normaly are more item dipendent so they are affected a bit<br/>
less then INT based so called pure caster. This effect is mostly visible on<br/>
my old server fenin ro where are many high lv people producting one sea of<br/>
overpowered items !<br/>
<br/>
I dont know what effect this items have on higer lv casters but as i heared<br/>
some opinions...<br/>
<br/>
a. new items for mele class help them strike faster and for more damage<br/>
(stronger weapons) take less damage and recover hits faster (rubicite<br/>
breastplate with rubicite effect !) !! Items for mana users only gives more<br/>
mana... wich in end mean more meditation and looking in stupid book (verant<br/>
guys will you finaly do something here), casters dont get faster mana<br/>
regenaration items, less resists items, more damage for their spells items<br/>
!!!! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I see this as a very big problem wich will get worse as time pass if<br/>
something is not done. What are yours opinion on this are there any<br/>
possible solution wich you see for this?<br/>
