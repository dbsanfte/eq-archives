Greetings!<br/>
<br/>
I were not fortunate enough to take part of the Everquest beta, but<br/>
now, at last, I am a regular player of EQ. However, I read many<br/>
reports from beta testers, guides and other people before setting out<br/>
on the path of the wizard and have a question relating to that.<br/>
<br/>
What confuses me, now after playing the game myself, are all the tips<br/>
in various &quot;wizard guides&quot; about the importance of avoiding hits as a<br/>
wizard. That it is important is obvious, but how should one manage<br/>
it?<br/>
<br/>
I decided to &quot;solo&quot; the first five levels in order to learn the game.<br/>
My experience from that time is that it is almost impossible to avoid<br/>
being hit during combat. Now at level seven I mostly team up with a<br/>
necromancer friend of mine and it is much easier avoiding getting<br/>
hit.<br/>
<br/>
What do the guides mean? Are the advice for higher levels where one<br/>
have access to &quot;killed on impact&quot; spells or am I missing something<br/>
obvious? What can one do except running away when trying to avoid<br/>
hits? Is it the &quot;mini teleportation spells&quot; that are referred to or<br/>
what? Please enlighten me so that I can continue my hitherto very<br/>
rewarding and highly enjoying career as a wizard!<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
<br/>
Zachris, dark elf wizard of Bertoxxulous<br/>
