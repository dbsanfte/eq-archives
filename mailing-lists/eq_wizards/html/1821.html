<div id="ygrps-yiv-1023241894">All I have been hearing from a lot of people are whines about the wizard<br/>
class.  Well I am a 24th level Wizard who has been solo-ing since lvl 16.  I<br/>
thought to get exp I had to be grouped, that I could not solo anything.<br/>
Well granted that was the case sometimes, but I Learned to adapt to the<br/>
environment I fought in.  Like fighting YK&#39;s in West Commonlands, which then<br/>
turned into fight Kodiaks in WC.  From there I went to the Oasis and fought<br/>
Caimans, crocks, and Deep Water crocks and Caimans.  Know your limits<br/>
people, our class was not meant to jump into a fight and melee the monster,<br/>
we were meant to stand back and blast them out of existence.  If you have<br/>
not seen on any of the messages before our melee skills are only (lvl +1) *<br/>
3 which is quite low for any class.  Maybe this should be a hint to you as<br/>
not to try and jump into a fight.  If you are in a group that is fighting<br/>
RED mobs and your spells are being resisted then I say you shouldn&#39;t be in<br/>
that group to begin with.  Those mobs are 5+ levels above you and your<br/>
skills as a WIZARD can not help.  Go back to that spot after a few more<br/>
levels and try again, don&#39;t whine that you couldn&#39;t do anything to help.<br/>
<br/>
I have my share of deaths, and until I found Lake Rathe at Level 19 I was<br/>
getting waxed by Sand Giants in Oasis of Marr because people were training<br/>
them left and right down the beach for fun.  At Level 24 I am still solo-ing<br/>
most the time I am on in South Karana fighting Centaur Archers or Avaik<br/>
Harriers.  I die everyone in a while because my timing may be off, or a blue<br/>
mob resists 3 of my spells which leave me with no mana and about 1/4 of his<br/>
health.  Sure I would love to be able to jump in there and melee it.  And<br/>
for those times I have to I use O&#39;Kiels Radiation which gives me a little<br/>
extra punch to the mob.  I rarely fight White or Yellow mobs unless I am<br/>
grouped.<br/>
<br/>
Whining that Veriant did us wrong or that we are weak is not the correct<br/>
thing to do.  The best thing I see is make the best of wheat we have and<br/>
that is our power and knowledge of how to use it wisely, not foolishly.<br/>
