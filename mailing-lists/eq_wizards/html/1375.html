<div id="ygrps-yiv-1615017642">At 14th lvl, you and your friends might want to think about heading to<br/>
Unrest.  Its great xp and good loot.  Just stay out of the house and only<br/>
hunt in the courtyard as the house is the home to some fairly high lvl<br/>
critters.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, I don&#39;t believe wizards should solo past 5th lvl.  Your<br/>
chances of dying increase dramatically when soloing.  Having said that, we<br/>
all know that we will solo on occasion.  It is definitely easier to solo in<br/>
the early lvls than it is the higher lvls.  I currently solo every know and<br/>
then in the Cauldron and if I&#39;m not careful, those gobbies will hit me for<br/>
40-50 dmg a pop.  At that rate, it doesn&#39;t take long to die.  But if you<br/>
strategize carefully and leave yourself a way to escape if things go bad,<br/>
there&#39;s no lvl that you can&#39;t solo.  But, it does get harder the higher you<br/>
get, because the rate of dmg increase for the mobs is far greater than the<br/>
rate of HP and AC increase that you get.  Wizards are meant to group, not<br/>
solo.  I have died more times soloing than I ever did with a group.<br/>

&gt; Well your words have inspired me to stick w/ it until 16th  . . .<br/>
&gt; I am in a lull at lvl 14, any suggestions on places to hunt that are good<br/>
&gt; eps for my lvl?   I have 2 tanks (ranger and paladin both 16th) I am<br/>
always<br/>
&gt; w/  . . .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was 8th when the 16th lvl Paladin started and he is 16th now and I am<br/>
8th!<br/>
&gt; grrrrrrrr   I think Early lvls is just hard as a wizard.    I am confused<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; one point.    I hear 1/2 the people saying we SOLO BETTER at high lvls and<br/>
&gt; 1/2 the people saying we can ONLY solo at low lvls.    Any high lvl<br/>
wizards<br/>
&gt; out there have any thought on this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
