<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970980411">Okay, this is Alhassim signing off...<br/>
<br/>
After reading the last couple of subtle brush off posts regarding &quot;lets work with what we have ..etc&quot;  I will no longer be posting to this list. (And the villagers rejoice..)<br/>
<br/>
I still find it unbelievable at how complacent you &quot;seekers of knowledge&quot; are and at how many of the repetitive posts on this list concern &quot;where can I find this spell or item&quot; when the reader could just go back and read the archive to find his/her answer.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my hats off to the people who suggested the Teleport Others/Tap Affinity type spells, that was the only thing I read that was worthwhile on this list.<br/>
<br/>
Bye</div>
