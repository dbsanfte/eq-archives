<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833712142">For me it is just a fun spell to play with. Also handy in scouting out areas, and luring monsters. I have used my eye to lure monsters out of various locations to my group without acutally putting my body into direct danger. The one bitch of this spell is that the duration is short, you cant cancle the spell, and you need to constnatly &#39;pump&#39; the spell (re-casting over and over) to get any good distance out of it. And even when pumping it isnt that long.. <br/>
<br/>
I wish the spell lasted for ever or untill canceled or hit by another monster. It would make it much more usefull. <br/>
