<div id="ygrps-yiv-534694359">You can sometimes find them on merchants too.  I&#39;ve seen them on Felwithe <br/>
merchants all the way to merchants in Halas.  I usually grab them when I can <br/>
since I understand these are random turnouts too.  They range up to 4pp a <br/>
piece usually.  Expensive yes....but not so costly as you start fighting <br/>
creatures that drop plat.<br/>
<br/>
Other things I have found useful to get runes.  (I would assume most of you <br/>
do this already):<br/>
<br/>
-- trade the words or pages you find for runes.<br/>
-- inform your party members that you are looking for runes.  I&#39;m always <br/>
surprised how many non-casters are unaware what those little black things <br/>
are for. :)  I always get the &quot;oh..you WANT these?  here!&quot;<br/>
