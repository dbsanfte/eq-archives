<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569596431">Ok, get ready to feel the burn.  &quot;Solric begins to cast a spell...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry but the description on onelist.com says:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Eq_wizards [English] [For People Over 13] Similar lists <br/>
&gt;Forum for Wizards within the lands of Norrath <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Does it say Forum for those who only want to discuss how to play the wizards<br/>
and not for those who want to note the problems they see in the class and<br/>
ideas for new spells?  Didn&#39;t think so.  This is the forum for us wizards.<br/>
Everything and anything about us.  If you want to only see posts that are<br/>
about playing the game, then read the subjects and delete (that little key<br/>
below INSERT and to the left of END) the ones that talk about other things.<br/>
Or go and create your own forum with a more narrow scope, but this forum is<br/>
for everything about wizards so deal with it or unsubscribe.<br/>

P.S.  I am really not a mean person I just felt like going off.  I know I<br/>
could have said it in a nicer way so please flame me back to make me feel<br/>
better about myself :)<br/>

You are very perceptive Valacian and, at least to me, make a lot of sense.<br/>
I have stated before, several times, that I am very happy with the wizard<br/>
class as it stands.  Some ppl don&#39;t agree. Very well, as Valacian suggested,<br/>
lets get by this and focus on what we CAN do.  Lets unlock the mysteries of<br/>
the wizard class as it stands now, not what it could be or what it should<br/>
be.  That&#39;s what the /feedback feature is for in the game.<br/>
<br/>
If we wish to continue to argue the different aspects of the wizard class,<br/>
then maybe we should make a new email list for that specific focus.  Don&#39;t<br/>
get me wrong, I like a good debate as much as the next person, but I think<br/>
Valacian is right, we have the potential of scaring ppl away, of doing the<br/>
opposite of what this list was created for.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Valacian for the reality check.<br/>

&gt; I can feel the wrath now...  but I am ready for the comments.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I may comment - I don&#39;t believe that us discussing what &#39;would be nice&#39;<br/>
for Wizard spells really helps us be Wizards.  I really believe that if we<br/>
continue to complain or comment on the apparent lack of spells/problems with<br/>
spells that we have, we are not going to achieve what I believe this mailing<br/>
list was setup for.  This list is to share information between all Wizards<br/>
within Norrath !  We are going to lose potential and current subscribers (me<br/>
and I&#39;m sure others), thus losing valuable shared information because of our<br/>
ranting and raving about our class.  Remember, Verant is probably not<br/>
reading this forum..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My suggestion:  Let&#39;s talk about ideas and share information that will<br/>
help each other play the class that we chose to play.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So far, the most useful thing I have read (besides Spoiler information) is<br/>
the &#39;bug&#39; that allows our Eye of Zoom to unlock doors.  I think that&#39;s great<br/>
!!<br/>
