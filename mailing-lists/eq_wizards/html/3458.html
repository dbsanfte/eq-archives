&gt;&gt;now<br/>
&gt;&gt;have all of them maxed. :)  I love it.<br/>

&gt;You got them *all* maxed?  Impressive!  I&#39;ve only mastered all the research <br/>
&gt;languages including such things as elder dragon and erudian.  But I&#39;m in no <br/>
&gt;way inclined to go through the trouble of getting some of the evil race <br/>
&gt;languages up like Orcs and Gnoll languages. :P<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually I got to excelent in all the languages a while back, it wasn&#39;t<br/>
being bored.  It was in the hopes that verant would put in quest that<br/>
required you to speak to the NPC is a specific language to be able to<br/>
converse with them.  Wishful thinking on my part. But it would give those<br/>
languages a use. :)<br/>
