<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603539646">actually, if you read my post, i stated clearly that it MAY or MAY NOT be an<br/>
exploit (read both my first and my second post). The final decision is up to<br/>
Verant on whether or not it is an exploit or not.  My opinion on the matter<br/>
is that it is NOT like the many exploits that I have seen in the game, and<br/>
that I would NOT recommend using this spot, because if it is an exploit, you<br/>
can get banned for it (although Verant will warn you first, or so i&#39;m told).<br/>
I have seen Verant warn ppl about several exploits (and ban ppl for using<br/>
them), but have never seen them warn anybody about &quot;the hill&quot; in South Ro.<br/>
But on the other hand, every time I killed Ortallius, my health, as well as<br/>
my partners, was well below half (usually when using an exploit in the game,<br/>
your health is not even touched as the monster CANNOT hit you while you are<br/>
casting).<br/>
<br/>
Ortallius is a lvl 23-26 orc that gives absolutley no loot except for a few<br/>
coins.  He spawns very quickly (about once every 10 minutes).<br/>

&gt;Hi,<br/>
&gt;for me what you just explain is a big bug.. If you can go in a safe zone<br/>
&gt;WITHOUT zoning then it s because there is some kind of bug... Cause the<br/>
&gt;developpers have done all they can to avoid that : monster can hit you from<br/>
&gt;behind walls right ? Developpers have done this to avoid a &quot;safe zone&quot; in<br/>
&gt;dungeon..... So sorry to say you that, but you use an exploit :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Oh and yes who is ortallius ? and what is the loot ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;on a other hand, for playing now my wizzard at a mid level (i am currenttly<br/>
&gt;21) and some other chars to low twenty (shaman)  , i must agree that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>wizzard<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;are a weak classe.. Not the weakest one in my mind but really a weak race<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(i<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;mean solo AND groupe). Have you ever played a druid ??? just test it....<br/>
&gt;They get the same DD as we have but with 5 level of difference... OH... at<br/>
&gt;level 21 i only use ligthening bolt never force shock ( a level 16 spel and<br/>
&gt;i will do it till 24...)..... but i have fun playing my wizzard cause they<br/>
&gt;are hard to keep alive, really hard :) . It s why i like them not cause of<br/>
&gt;the power (they don t have power:) ).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;yakos<br/>
&gt;level 21 wizzard karana<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;p.s. i would appreciate if you DON T give the exact location of this hill<br/>
&gt;thanks (i don t know)<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;There are still many exploits in the game that they just don&#39;t have time to<br/>
&gt;fix.  So they are still in the game, and you can still get banned for using<br/>
&gt;them....  Believe me, i reported the one in Lavastorm the third day it was<br/>
&gt;released (along with tons of other ppl), yet they still have not fixed it<br/>
&gt;(all that happens is a GM comes around once a day or so and warns everybody<br/>
&gt;not to use it).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But, i may be incorrect about &quot;the hill&quot; in South Ro.  the area in South Ro<br/>
&gt;that was originally mentioned may NOT be an exploit.  I spent some time<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;morning killing Ortallius using &quot;the hill&quot; and it didn&#39;t seem like the<br/>
&gt;&quot;real&quot; exploits i&#39;ve seen in places like Lavastorm.  Ortallius could still<br/>
&gt;hit me, but if i ran up far enough on the hill, he could no longer hit me.<br/>
&gt;But he didn&#39;t just stand there and let me pound on him from a distance<br/>
&gt;either. As soon as I got to the area where he could no longer follow, he<br/>
&gt;would turn and run, not giving me enough time to cast on him from the safe<br/>
&gt;area.  So I would have to run back down the hill until he came after me<br/>
&gt;again, giving me just enough time to cast on him (but he would still tag me<br/>
&gt;as i finished my casting).  I guess it works just like a zone, without<br/>
&gt;actually having to zone.  I used it this morning, and was able to kill<br/>
&gt;Ortallius about 6 or 7 times this morning with a partner, but we probably<br/>
&gt;would NOT have been able to kill him without the help of the hill (at least<br/>
&gt;not without dieing once or twice, as he conned red a few times).  So, to<br/>
&gt;each his own, but I think I&#39;ll stay away from it just to be on the safe<br/>
&gt;side.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But I did see some bright spots, as he didn&#39;t resist a single flame shock<br/>
&gt;(he was 2 or 3 lvls higher then me).  He did resist enstill every time, and<br/>
&gt;force shock about 75% of the time except when my enchanter friend cast<br/>
&gt;tashan...  And then my force shock went through for full dmg every time<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(has<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;anyone ever noticed that when force shock is not resisted, it goes for full<br/>
&gt;dmg every time???).  I wish they would give us tashan or something<br/>
 </span></blockquote>similiar.<br/>
