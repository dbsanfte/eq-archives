<div id="ygrps-yiv-358037101">One very anoying thing what i have seen is that a you are not in<br/>
possibility to see active spells on other players or mobs. This creates<br/>
serious problem to recast SOW, Armours or other buffs and also can be<br/>
interesting to see what buffs have some particular mob.<br/>
<br/>
One solution to this problem can be introduction of new spell &quot;Detect<br/>
magic&quot; wich when is active gives possibility to see active spells on other<br/>
PC and NPC. It can give on left part of screen same list of spell icons<br/>
what you have on right side for spells active on yourself this dont look as<br/>
too hard to program and all grafic alredy exist for it. <br/>
<br/>
If there are some possibilitys here can be introdced some variants like<br/>
possibility to see only enchantments cast by ourselves or enchantments of<br/>
our lv or lower in complexity of spells.<br/>
<br/>
Icons start flashing if they are to vanish as some armours do now but also<br/>
for debuffs or root, enstill what you casted on MOB.<br/>
<br/>
Also this can be made so that you can select one of detected spells and<br/>
cast a &quot; Dispell magic&quot; only on selected spell !!<br/>
<br/>
This is my little 2 cents in our effort to make a EQ better (its already<br/>
best but can alwas make better :-) )<br/>
