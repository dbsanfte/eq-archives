<b>Subject:</b> Mana questions <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-196662107">First of all, how do I find out how much mana I have? Also, when I have<br/>
a magical item telling me I get +1 mana, does that mean just a +1 to my<br/>
&lt;insert number here&gt; mana? Or does it mean an increase in regeneration?<br/>
<br/>
I also have only 102 i intelligence, as I had no idea what does what<br/>
when I created the character. I had a general idea, but not specifics<br/>
(thanks Verant for such great documentation). Anyway, I used the points<br/>
to invest in other things, and I find I can hold my own against a blue<br/>
or black orc centurion at my level 8, even when I run OOM and we come to<br/>
blows (well, I come to blows, he was already at blows). It&#39;s obvious to<br/>
me that later, my only weapon will be my spells, and I will maybe be<br/>
able to cast one less DD than someone who invested it all in<br/>
Intelligence, but that really doesn&#39;t discourage me. reasons are, that<br/>
later you have to travel in a party anyway, and no one will notice how<br/>
many DD&#39;s I cast. If things come to such extreme when another one DD<br/>
cast is the difference between life and death, it means we&#39;re attacking<br/>
too strong creatures anyway.<br/>
<br/>
So, to all those that are worried, don&#39;t. You will have easier times in<br/>
melee early on, and you won&#39;t be THAT much weaker later on.<br/>
