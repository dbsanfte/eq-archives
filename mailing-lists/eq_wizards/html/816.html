<b>Subject:</b> Runes..  what to do with them? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-658007743">I&#39;m guessing at level 16 or so...    I can buy a book at my guild..  and after learning that language I read it, and it will tell me exactly what I need to do to get those spells..  right?   like combine the rune, a word of power, and some components, to make a particular spell?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help.<br/>
