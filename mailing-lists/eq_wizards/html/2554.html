<div id="ygrps-yiv-161956862">I was wondering if anyone could tell me the usefulness of this spell.  It<br/>
does about 30 dmg and a 2 second stun.  But for the mana used it seems like<br/>
a waste where as you could just do a dd spell instead since the 2 second<br/>
stun doesn&#39;t seem to help that much.  Thanks.</div>
