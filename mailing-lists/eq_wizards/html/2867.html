<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756073581">I am new at  researching, and got the book from the gypsy woman in North<br/>
Karana for giving her a greater lightstone. Is this the book you put runes<br/>
into? I heard that the book you purchase is called a lexicon, but this book<br/>
has a different name. I am level 22 and have failed repeatedly at making<br/>
level 16 spells. Thanks for any info.<br/>
