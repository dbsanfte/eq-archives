<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389100342">Well, actually that is impossible.  When you&#39;re in a group everybody in the<br/>
group will have their bar move the exact same amount.  The difference is<br/>
that for the bar to move that much for the higher lvl characters they need<br/>
more exp.  That&#39;s how the steal xp from the lower guys in a group.  Btw, I&#39;m<br/>
not accusing everyone in your group of lying.  But sometimes it can be very<br/>
hard to track your xp bar precisely.. it&#39;s very possible the differences in<br/>
exp bar movement everyone saw happened because of a little impreciseness,<br/>
some rounding, ect, ect...<br/>
Another reason why groups are worth it because of solo, is that you don&#39;t<br/>
have as much downtime.. you can fight, fight.. rest a bit fight... and so<br/>
on.. whereas soloing sometimes your downtime won&#39;t be big, and others it<br/>
will be intermanibly long.<br/>

&gt;Am I the only one with the impression that we&#39;re getting screwed when it<br/>
&gt;comes to diving up the exp while grouped? I was in a party that ranged from<br/>
&gt;level 9 to 12 while I was level 10. Everyone talked about the &#39;great exp&#39;<br/>
&gt;they got, while I was thinking &quot;Man they must never get any Exp&quot;. I asked<br/>
&gt;about what everyone got after a big fight and the results went something<br/>
&gt;like this:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Level 9 got almost a 1/3rd of a bubble<br/>
&gt;level 10-12 got close to 1/2 a bubble<br/>
&gt;Poor old Cinius the only Wizard in the party saving everyones ass had to<br/>
&gt;wait til the next fight to notice a combined total from both fights of 1/4<br/>
&gt;of a bubble. Is it like this for anyone else? Hell I get 1/4 of a bubble<br/>
&gt;when killing a yellow on my own. In my opinion that makes it worth the risk<br/>
&gt;of getting killed by the yellows(happens maybe once out of every 7-10<br/>
&gt;kills).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;my apologies for the last double mail...had browser problems.<br/>
