<div id="ygrps-yiv-334133384">Someone once posted that runed totem staves could be found in the Lake Rathe zone,as well as in Paw. Can anyone confirm that runed totem staves are in the Lake Rathe zone? If so, I assume they are at the gnoll skeleton camp.  Am I right?<br/>
<br/>
Also, are the gnoll embalmbers with the skull of Jhen Tra located at the camp by the S Karanas/Lake Rathe zone?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any assistance.<br/>
