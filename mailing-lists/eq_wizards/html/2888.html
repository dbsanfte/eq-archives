 </span></blockquote>For one handed blunt after the cracked staff for a pure caster, the next<br/>
best thing is a Staff.  Basically the non cracked version of what you<br/>
already have.  I don&#39;t recall ever getting one in the form of loot from a<br/>
mob, so you may have to buy one if you want this.<br/>
Once you get into the upper 20s you can get some of the Magical staves.<br/>
Unless you can afford to buy them off others.<br/>

In Beholder, aka gorge of king xorbb.  There is an evil eye that spawns<br/>
very rarely.  His name is .....  King Xorbb.  He almost alway has the Slime<br/>
Crystal Staff on him.  He was blue to me at 26th  I resisted all of his<br/>
charms  and 2 of his 3 force shocks but between the pet and the chasm mino<br/>
that he appeared to call over, I had to zone with him at 1/3 health<br/>
<br/>
In Lake of Rathe there is a froglok named Webclaw, if you camp at the base<br/>
of the flame he walks by there as he makes his rounds of the zone.  He<br/>
carries the water crystal staff.  He was red to me at level 26 but I<br/>
believe he was blue to the level 36 warrior that helped me get it.<br/>
<br/>
There is one other staff the Fire Crystal Staff, but I can&#39;t remember off<br/>
the top of my head who has it and where.<br/>
<br/>
All three staves are Magic Lore items, with damage ratios of 5 damage 28<br/>
delay.  This is the same ratio as a non-magic, non-cracked staff.  Their<br/>
only bonus is that they have a first level spell effect.<br/>
Slime Crystal Staff casts Sickening<br/>
Water Crystal Staff casts Shalow Breath<br/>
Fire Crystal Staff casts Shock of Fire.<br/>
<br/>
From 1st hand experience the Shallow Breath does a max of 5 damage non<br/>
melee.  It goes off about 0-3 times in a fight, depending on how much melee<br/>
I actually do.  However my 99 dex may help it work more often.<br/>
<br/>
Ok well there are alot of other magical staves, but basically what I was<br/>
saying is that unless you can get an Orb of Tishan or a Staff of Writhing.<br/>
Most aren&#39;t any better than the non-cracked staff as far as damage goes.<br/>
