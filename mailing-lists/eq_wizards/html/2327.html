<div id="ygrps-yiv-620838537">I have just reached lvl 16 and now have the task of getting runes to make my spells. I gather I need to learn other languages to read the books, I sat talking to another player to learn gnomish and over an hour it increased about 7 times. Is there some special way of learning this better or is there a list that contains the rune combinations as finding someone to talk to for hours is very hard.<br/>
