<div id="ygrps-yiv-1408148715">According to shypht:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (B) Make all of the &quot;Main Spells&quot; buyable. So for<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - Wizards : Direct damage, Gates<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All (almost) can be purchased in Felwithe. Including all evacuate, gates<br/>
and so on, right up to level 49. I suspect Erudin has also a large selection,<br/>
if you can find the right merchant. The only one I haven&#39;t found are the<br/>
extra planar spells.<br/>
<br/>
I do have to disagree with you. So far, research is mostly a way of avoiding<br/>
the necessity to buy your spells. In other words, a way of role-playing a<br/>
tiny smidgeon more (&quot;The wizard Ultannis had to spend long time to find out<br/>
how to cast force&quot;). Not good, of course, since only you knows that you<br/>
really did find the spell on your own, when you could simply buy it at the<br/>
store next door.<br/>
<br/>
There are very very few spells that cannot be found somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Wizard (A) May have a fast casting inferno shock that is less manna<br/>
&gt; efficent, but he can pop them off faster then wizard (B), whos inferno shock<br/>
&gt; does more damage but takes alot longer to cast.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now *THAT* would be nice. But I suspect it would require a very very large<br/>
reworking of the core system (read &quot;too much code change&quot;) to make it.<br/>
<br/>
But I can see it being a part of the EQ expansion. So far, the only thing<br/>
you really need to get the expansion for is a few more areas to explore,<br/>
which is nice, but may not tempt everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Now, with this, you suddendly have things to strive for *and* incentive to<br/>
purcahse the expansion. What more could Verant dream of? :) <br/>
