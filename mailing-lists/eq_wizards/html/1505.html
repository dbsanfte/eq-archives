<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Yes there are 2 different planes besides the normal one. Hate and Sky (or <br/>
&gt;air). The spells are Alter Plane: Hate and Alter Plane: Sky. They are both <br/>
&gt;lvl 44 spells. I have a friend who traveled there. He said there are liches <br/>
&gt;on the hate plane. Personally i cant wait to get to go there but are there <br/>
&gt;only certain places from which you can cast these spells? This i do no know <br/>
&gt;he didnt say, but from the way you were talking there is. </span></blockquote></div>
