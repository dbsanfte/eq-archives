<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063643384">This is an EXCELLENT strategy.<br/>
However, you have GOT to do this early in your career.  If you have never<br/>
used a 2H Blunt weapon and then begin using it at Level 16, you will quickly<br/>
be frustrated at the lack of improvement in that skill.  (I know from<br/>
experience)  It won&#39;t take long before you&#39;ll be wondering whether to go<br/>
back to your maxed newbie attack skill (likely piercing) or going to spend a<br/>
whole bunch of practice points to improve it enough to even hit anything.  <br/>
<br/>
I have seen a ton of threads on message boards describing the problem I am<br/>
speaking about above.  There really appears to be a bug or design flaw here.<br/>
For example, last night I basically meleed for 4 hours straight because we<br/>
had a very efficient group fighting mostly blues which meant very little<br/>
downtime. (with a Ranger pulling constantly)   My 2H Blunt skill improved<br/>
once and I was actually surprised to see it.  I am a Lvl 17 Wiz with my 2H<br/>
Blunt skill at 20.  With an INT of 140, and the skill being so low, you&#39;d<br/>
think it would improve very rapidly like the newbie days.   <br/>
<br/>
I really wish I had realized to try and max all three skills from the very<br/>
beginning because it sure seemed easy to do back then.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, If you want to just focus on two skills instead of three, the two<br/>
primary skills would unarguably be Piercing and 2H Blunt.  I have done a lot<br/>
of research on weapons, and I haven&#39;t found one 1H Blunt weapon that you<br/>
would likely choose over one of the other two weapon types available to you<br/>
at most levels. (assuming there&#39;s not a hidden gem somewhere)<br/>

		With the high intelligence of a wizard it is very easy to<br/>
max out all three<br/>
		(pierce, 1&2H Blunt).  At the start of a new level I start<br/>
off with my great<br/>
		staff, then I move on to my trusty cracked staff, and I<br/>
finish off the level<br/>
		with my snake fang.  During level 4 and 5 I tried to work on<br/>
my hand2hand, but<br/>
		alas I am not a monk.  Also something I&#39;ve noticed, you can<br/>
improve on your<br/>
		throwing skills by attacking &quot;con green&quot; mobs.  The simple<br/>
reason I go through<br/>
		all of this is because sooner or later Verant will probably<br/>
introduce new<br/>
		weapons to the game, and whatever skill it uses, I want to<br/>
be ready.</div>
