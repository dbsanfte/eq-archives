<div id="ygrps-yiv-376472548">Yes,  walls are either clipping, or no clipping (Verant refers to them as thick<br/>
wall and thin walls)  I bet you could cast through a thin wall, like the walls<br/>
of an inn, but not thick walls which are most walls in a major dungeon.  I&#39;ll<br/>
try to verify this tonight.<br/>

&gt; Yup, definitely happens for me.  Never really bugged me because I&#39;ve assumed<br/>
&gt; you have to see your target to direct an attack against it.  Your experience<br/>
&gt; in the mino caves might be unique to that area I think only because of the<br/>
&gt; way they had set up the walls there? (ie the way the minos can strike<br/>
&gt; through the walls might have something to do with why you can hit them<br/>
&gt; through the walls there too).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Best to fight away from corners I guess.<br/>
