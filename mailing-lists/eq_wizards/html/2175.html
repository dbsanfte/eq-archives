 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a level 14 human wizard, and since I bought two cut throat rings that<br/>
gave me a total of 4 more dex points, to a total of 79, I definitely have<br/>
gotten the &quot;you regain concentration&quot; message more often. Come to think of<br/>
it, I NEVER received that message before I bought the rings.<br/>
