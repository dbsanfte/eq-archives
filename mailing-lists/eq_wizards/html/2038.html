&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is important to do big rumor about our petition!<br/>
&gt; Im personaly very glad that finaly all of us on this list make one big step<br/>
&gt; in right direction so that our voice is also heard.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; steps to have any result from our petition are following<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; a.) send a final text to all major boards (eqvault, eqss etc..)including in<br/>
&gt; our group <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:EQ_Wizards@onelist.com">EQ_Wizards@onelist.com</a> and verant email mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:EQmail@...">EQmail@...</a><br/>
&gt; i suggest that a person wich corrected my first propost do it as im not so<br/>
&gt; god im english<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; b.) send a final text to alt.games.everquest ( it will be nice if somone<br/>
&gt; who is alredy on send it there)<br/>
&gt; and also to all other wich can be interested to show it<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; c.) all persons wich agree to petition send it personaly to verand adding<br/>
&gt; at the end of pettition all personal opinions and ideas to improve gameplay<br/>
&gt; to cover all diferences what i have seen to exist over final text.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; P.S. i have seen one old nice idea wich can be included in petition or<br/>
&gt; added as personal opinion<br/>
&gt; Its to have a icon on screen as (we have for shield) for root so when root<br/>
&gt; is about to end or when it is broken we can have this icon start pulsating<br/>
&gt; and so know that we have 2 sec to start casting new root.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Fine !<br/>
&gt; &gt;Really send it !<br/>
&gt; &gt;But if you want to have some feedback i think we need to send it too !<br/>
&gt; &gt;I mean, i can write a letter and said that all wizzard think that.. How can<br/>
&gt; &gt;they be sure that all wizzard really think that ? (and not only yourself..).<br/>
&gt; &gt;What about the idea that each who agree with you send it to verant ?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt;-----Start Letter-----<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Dear EverQuest Staff,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;We are a large group of wizards who have come together through a mailing<br/>
&gt; &gt;list. Through much discussion and debate, we have agreed to send you<br/>
&gt; &gt;this feedback concerning improvements to the wizard. We would like to<br/>
&gt; &gt;thank you in advance for your careful consideration of these<br/>
&gt; &gt;modifications.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;1) Spells are 100% resisted by mobs 6+ levels above the caster. In large<br/>
&gt; &gt;groups hunting big prey this level cap turns a wizard from the main<br/>
&gt; &gt;dealer of damage to a useless member in the group. Our suggestion is<br/>
&gt; &gt;that either the cap be raised to 6+ levels of the highest member in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;group, or the cap be raised to 8+ levels higher than the caster.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;2) Spells that both stun and damage targets are often resisted by mobs<br/>
&gt; &gt;that /con green and blue. If this is the result of the stun effect, we<br/>
&gt; &gt;would like one spell without this effect at the same level.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;3) Many spell suggestions have crossed this list. Here is one that we<br/>
&gt; &gt;all feel would be a great addition.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Tap Affinity - Teleport targeted group member to their own bind spot<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;4) O&#39;Kiels Radiation seems that it would be the beginning of a great<br/>
&gt; &gt;line of spells. Why should it end there? Cold and Magic based<br/>
&gt; &gt;buffs/shields would be a very welcome addition.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;5) Wizards seem to be very neglected when it comes to carrying or<br/>
&gt; &gt;wearing items that enhance our appearance. Also, many completely<br/>
&gt; &gt;different spells have the same visual effects.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;We would like to thank you again for your time. Any type of feedback<br/>
&gt; &gt;would be greatly appriciated.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Sincerely,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The Wizards of Norrath<br/>
