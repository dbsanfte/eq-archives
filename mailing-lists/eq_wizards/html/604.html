<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203390211">What are all the ways possible which we can raise our old euridan language<br/>
skill?  I put 3 points into it and have had a friend speak it to me and it<br/>
has raised about 10 times.   Can I raise it just by speaking it?<br/>

Runes are used in later lvls for Research of new spells.  Some highger 16th<br/>
and above lvl spells can only be created (not bought) by combining rune to<br/>
make the spell.  I have finally gotten my Old Erudin to Excellent and can<br/>
read the books offered by our guilds.  These books tell you what Runes amke<br/>
which spells, so if you found one Keep it safe until you reach uppers lvls.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, where were you hunting that you found the Rune of Banding?<br/>
