&gt;It&#39;s useless. It&#39;s ratio is 3 hp to 1 mana. By the time you might get<br/>
&gt;it, your primary DD&#39;s mana cost will be 1/2 of your hp...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well seeing as its about all we have, its much better than nothing.  If my<br/>
group needs an evac you can bed I will be clicking on my stone till I am<br/>
either dead or have the exp to evac to safty.  At the levels that a stone<br/>
becomes accessable, there is a fair chance that you will be grouped with a<br/>
Shamen or a Druid.  Chloroplast regenerates about 15points of health each<br/>
tick, more if your sitting down.  Regenerate is about 10, I believe.  With<br/>
the combined use of the stone and a Regenerate or Chloroplast spell your<br/>
meditation rate effectively increases by 5 more mana per tick.  In the time<br/>
it took you to read my message you just would have gained back about 30<br/>
more mana than you would have access to with out the stone.<br/>
<br/>
Sure an item that increased regen rate would be great.  It would keep all<br/>
the casters on crack all the time.  However for game balance reasons and to<br/>
be fair to the Enchanters and Bards, it would have to be 1) Hard to get, 2)<br/>
Lore No Drop, 3) Not function as well as Clerity and not stack with that<br/>
spell, 4) Be camped to hell night and day, 5) Verant would probably put the<br/>
item on a mob that was 100% resistant to magic just to annoy us.<br/>
