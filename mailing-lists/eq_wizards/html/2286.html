<div id="ygrps-yiv-408600426">Ok now Im Pissed.  I get to Lvl 29 thinking I can finally cause fear in<br/>
people when I duel them to find out that I cant.  Apparently the Yonder<br/>
spell that we are supposed to get at 29 is for Enchanters ONLY.  Even though<br/>
you can buy it in our guild, we can not use it.  And the GM I spoke to said<br/>
that it was not meant to be used by Wizards anyway.  Time for a new Mass<br/>
Petition.<br/>
