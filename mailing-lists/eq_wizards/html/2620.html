<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154431722">Dear EverQuest friends,<br/>
<br/>
I wish first to excuse to all for my not so perfect English which sometimes<br/>
will make difficult to understand what I wish to say without little thinking<br/>
I�m Italian so I don�t maxed English to excellent for now but I�m working on it<br/>
. I divided my letter in 3 parts first one is recapitulation of previous action<br/>
and information gathered in meantime, second is list of problems with relative<br/>
examples and third is a list of proposed modifications which can help to<br/>
compensate or eliminate this situation. Also as official place to reply and<br/>
comments to this letter is a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:EQ_Wizards@onelist.com">EQ_Wizards@onelist.com</a> but you must first visit <br/>
www.onelist.com and get approval to write in this group please send all your<br/>
comments to this place it is much better then any message board to menage<br/>
posts. If you dont wich to reply to list my personal email is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Wizard@...">Wizard@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Some time passed after I started a first petition for wizard class and we don�t<br/>
get any official reply to at last I don�t have seen it, I have seen some<br/>
modification in last patch that decreased a wizard casting time better to say I<br/>
noted most a decreasing of recovery time for a force shock spell which I<br/>
started to use.  But this last modification is only part of a all casters<br/>
classes rebuild and is mainly introduced to compensate faster damage dealing<br/>
from a necromancers (DOUBLED damage done in unit of time, enchanters, and<br/>
magicians pets spells) so I talked with some of my friends which are high lv<br/>
40+ and I started o be seriously preoccupied as one of them messaged me this �<br/>
We are useless against reds, yellow resist our spells 60% of time and GREEN in<br/>
najena once resisted 2 lighting bolts! So I started a bard and a paladin to get<br/>
some satisfaction� second thing was a message which I received from other<br/>
player which I know � none is so crazy to get a wizard in his group against a<br/>
Lady Vox we will never get kill he will be resisted all time, we can use it<br/>
only for evacuation and to kill low mobs fast so that warriors don�t have to<br/>
spend HP and mana on healing from low guys, but for this he don�t need to be in<br/>
group�<br/>
<br/>
Problems with wizard class<br/>
<br/>
1.)     Many people hate wizards as kill stealers and think they are too<br/>
powerful with their fast transport by teleport so they don�t have to be buffed<br/>
any more ! (WRONG)<br/>
<br/>
First wizard is very weak class once a monster get on you at higher levels<br/>
there is no hope to survive for him. Kill stealing for now exists in places<br/>
where many groups fight a newly respawned monsters and nearly all at middle lv<br/>
from 16 to 29 as I seen and against blue monsters where one wizard hit is 35 <br/>
40 % of total HP what monster have . Places like high hold, south ro, lake<br/>
rathe comes to mind. But to get a whole picture you must also imagine that a<br/>
wizard will never go steal in any high lv dungeon, only try to imagine lone<br/>
wizard stealing a Fire giant wizard (guy can burn a lv 40 player with one spell<br/>
and is in depth of a dungeon full of similar MOBs) so this is only temporally<br/>
middle lv problem when wizard start to get his high damage spells and all are<br/>
hunting in intermediate overcrowded areas. So this problem is same as low lv<br/>
casters which look a mob at which they hack half hour killed by warrior classes<br/>
which pass by in 4 sec for this all say it is normal casters are weak at start<br/>
eheheeheh :-). High level transportation is not only wizard domain lets look at<br/>
one other class which have SOW AND transportation! I really wish to make one<br/>
other statistic here in. Question is really simple FROM ALL CLASSES WICH<br/>
ONE DIE<br/>
MOST ? reply to this is simple WIZARD ! Think about it !<br/>
<br/>
2.)     mana inefficient use ! <br/>
<br/>
Now Verant start to see mistakes they create with warrior class when will you<br/>
admit a mistakes in wizard class. Verant guys say a wizard is class which we<br/>
balance all other casters on so we will not touch it, hell you buffed and<br/>
rebalance all other class and until now you don�t have seen a weakness of<br/>
wizard class I�m angry at this one mistake!<br/>
<br/>
I look at wizard from opposite direction wizards are ONLY magic only class !!<br/>
They are like a warrior or monk class which is only pure simple weapon user,<br/>
wizards class are simple spell only damage dealer and they are penalized in<br/>
same time with all magic restrictions much much more than any other caster<br/>
class. Fizzles or resists are much more dangerous and time wasting for a wizard<br/>
they are death for him! Why ? .. because as wizard without mana cannot fight,<br/>
cannot run and can only die. A little example of  this is what I say in one of<br/>
my previous letters it that we use more mana to deal same kill than any other<br/>
caster class !! <br/>
First hand example .. after I got lv 21 I decided to go to lake rathe to try<br/>
powerleveling killing aviak guards I go to a little 2 aviak isle and there was<br/>
already one very nice enchanter which solo this hut but admitted my company to<br/>
share a spawn spot we passed very nice time there and I noted that he can alone<br/>
solo any bird using only 2 bubbles of his mana he can lull one and pull only<br/>
one bird on him also ! His pet killed it easy and all time when I have to go to<br/>
sell he soloed 2 birds easy. On the other side I used from min 3 bubbles of<br/>
mana and to OOM where he at last two times saved my life. Ok I say he is higher<br/>
lv so he spend less mana. Then comes a lv 17 enchanter on isle and we get him<br/>
in turn he spend all mana but he can solo same bird what I nearly die from.<br/>
What was my main problem?  Resistance ! I spend 200 mana in every fight at<br/>
resisted spells !! and it is normally at last one force shock and some roots<br/>
and flame shock! It is one bubble and half of my mana !! and I have +23 INT and<br/>
+70 mana in items ! cc 770 total. 22 lv. <br/>
Lets think at this on this way at lv 50 one necromancer and one wizard decide<br/>
to kill all in dungeon of najena how will they do this in shortest time<br/>
possible?<br/>
<br/>
-       Necromancer summon a skeleton and leave it kill all what moves,<br/>
loot all<br/>
items and sell for great profit don�t wasting any time for meditation also.<br/>
(this is same for all pet owners)<br/>
<br/>
-       Wizard on other time sit and memorized his lower lv spells WICH ARE NOT<br/>
SO MANA EFFICENT AS HIGER LV SPELLS so he have to spend much more mana to deal<br/>
same damage but for most guys here in this will be waste of mana to use a high<br/>
lv ones. He kill some ogre guards, elementals and tentacles to start with and<br/>
is OOM so he find one place and start to meditate to get some mana back, argh<br/>
one guard passing buy start hacking at him so he needs to root it until get<br/>
some mana to kill it��.. and so on long story. I hope you get what I wish to<br/>
say.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3.)     Resistance of high lv mobs BUT also low lv ones<br/>
<br/>
Wizard is a group class which is used to stop and destroy fleeing monsters in<br/>
normal battles with root and by giving a last deadly touch and to intercept and<br/>
destroy a dangerous MOBs which try to join a fray. At last it is what I<br/>
understand maybe I�m wrong. There are some thing what I never understand or<br/>
used AE and PAE spells which Verant guys put in and which are absolutely<br/>
useless and can be only used as a fast suicide, glimpse spells are also very<br/>
useless as I seen for now they probably remain from times where you can used<br/>
them for aiming bolts which were limitless range? There is also one presumption<br/>
that a MOB is less resistant when he is wounded but I�m not sure on this and<br/>
this will be a nice add on? <br/>
<br/>
If a wizard is a group class then why they put in a high MOB resistance? I<br/>
think it is because they donut wish a group of wizards dealing high damage make<br/>
a short work of much higher lv MOB. But here are Two mistakes in this what<br/>
result of this is. Wizards are useless in group fighting high lv mobs! And I<br/>
think that we will need to wait quite a bit of time to find someone to fight a<br/>
lady Vox, beautiful dragon and that she will be considered blue to him! So<br/>
wizards are deprived from a pleasure of reaching many hard victories. I was in<br/>
a group which hunt najena for example and my friends were from a lv 20 26 and I<br/>
was lv 20. First time I used all my mana on fear and with resisted fizzles I<br/>
don�t have any damage !!  0  !! null , bard which was a same lv helped in<br/>
combat actually hitting her, healed with his song and so on I was totally<br/>
useless. Druid 23 cast a damage shield, combat and healed. Only useless one was<br/>
me wizard not great feeling I can assure you. Ok next example I fight a blue<br/>
aviak guard great !! I�m at last 3 lv higher and in one combat he resist at<br/>
last 2 of my spells and sometimes 4 !! I use 10 to 12 spells in all combat so<br/>
this is from 20 % to 40 % of my mana wasted !! with high risk that I will die<br/>
if 2 roots are resisted or not hold long enough!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
CONCLUSION what to change to make wizard at last worth a time invested to<br/>
develop it to high levels and to make this way at last more funny.<br/>
<br/>
A.) Game mechanic !<br/>
<br/>
Magic resistance   If for balance reasons you cant make all wizard spells less<br/>
resisted which is very dubious for me but as I don�t know game mechanic I can<br/>
accept this. Then you can make a spell recovery time doubled but mana is not<br/>
wasted, AND monster don�t get a full hit on his hate list if you don�t damage<br/>
it make it 1/6 spell max damage. <br/>
<br/>
I think there is much place to redo a magic resistance in base of group lv in<br/>
difference of MOB lv. <br/>
<br/>
Kill stealing  I suggest that a wizard damage is reverse proportional to full<br/>
health of MOB so a wizard do less damage at start of battle as MOB have full<br/>
health and do more and more damage as MOB have less and after passed 50% he can<br/>
gain a full hit. But to compensate this a wizard spend only mana for damage<br/>
inflicted. So only fix thing for a spell is a damage to mana ratio. All other<br/>
is calculated. Hmm I know this is a difficult one to get programmed but I liked<br/>
idea.<br/>
<br/>
Faster mana regeneration, - I suggest that wizard get max meditation skill<br/>
7*(leve+1) for recovering mana faster. That is because a wizard is ONLY I<br/>
repeat only magic fully dependent class. All other classes can have pets which<br/>
are permanent 0 mana damage spell, can cast many buffs transfer hit points to<br/>
mana, summon things��.. <br/>
<br/>
B.) Modification to spells !<br/>
<br/>
Shadow step  there are many solutions one is what I see in previous post on<br/>
eq_wizards to make it not any more random direction but in direction where you<br/>
are looking to with higher minimum range.<br/>
Other is my idea to give it a 30 40% chance to be permanently removed from MOB<br/>
heat list and the last lets MOB have to wait a 2 or 5 seconds until they start<br/>
to chase you again. <br/>
<br/>
So solution can be to make it a personal teleport with radius stun spell! <br/>
<br/>
AE and PEA spells  my opinion to make this spells useful is to add to them a<br/>
invulnerability component like a clerics have but with no move component. So<br/>
you cast a spell it hit 5 guys and 3 leave what they were fighting before and<br/>
start hacking at wizard ! but wizard is temporary invulnerable so his group<br/>
members have some time to get a MOBs from him. I also added a auto-root so that<br/>
it cant be used to run from battle to balance.<br/>
<br/>
Invisibility  lets it start to blink before it wears off now it is too risky to<br/>
be used.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Disintegrate series of spells DD and AE  High level kill only low mana spells<br/>
which kills green MOB fast and without wasting too much mana it is used for<br/>
cleaning. To compensate its  power it also DESTROY all items and money a MOB<br/>
have so no loot !! and no experience. Kill only so you cent help someone making<br/>
experience. It is to compensate somehow wizard inability to deal with a green<br/>
mobs without loosing exaggerating much mana.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Gaze spell series  What for is this ? You think that I will stay on zone wall<br/>
and look around or this have some better use?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Verant at last for my look on it balanced classes and races with time and<br/>
effort needed to reach certain level so a human wizard is penalized with low<br/>
mana and lack of infravision but is advantaged with high experience gain<br/>
against dark elf who start with high night vision and high INT but is KOS in<br/>
many places. But they forgot to think about frustration of how many times a<br/>
wizard die, without hope to gain satisfaction of giving a killing blow to any<br/>
monster higher than a lv or two from him all time judged too powerful and so<br/>
expected must to meditate all time looking on his beautiful Spell book hoping<br/>
that something will not jump on him so that he will have to waste his mana and<br/>
again meditate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Post scriptum  --- Thanks you for reading it all I put much time into this<br/>
letter and I�m not paid for it to be more precise I�m paying to write it  (hmm<br/>
any place in online game industry for me?). I like this game very much and I<br/>
appreciate a job which a Verant guys do very much they created one of greatest<br/>
games ever! Of course there is many things which take too much time to get<br/>
resolved, and worst of all feedback is lost in mass boards and lists there is<br/>
no central FAQ or PLAN . They created a beautiful and very complicated game and<br/>
they I�m sure have lost many nights working on it and thinking about problems,<br/>
all my moaning and lamentation is to give them one I hope creative look from<br/>
other side of table from us players which wish to spend our immense quantity of<br/>
time with greater satisfaction, and that they can create our world more funny.<br/>
