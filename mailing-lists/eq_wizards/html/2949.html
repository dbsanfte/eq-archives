&gt; &gt; A good idea about research is to put all points<br/>
&gt; &gt; possible each level into<br/>
&gt; &gt; it. Personally, I&#39;ve made all possible spells, some<br/>
&gt; &gt; twice, and I&#39;ve only<br/>
&gt; &gt; failed twice, maybe three times. Each time you try<br/>
&gt; &gt; there is a chance<br/>
&gt; &gt; your skill will go up too.<br/>

&gt; Couple of quick (I hope) questions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was planning on putting all my training points at every level<br/>
&gt; (post-20) into Research. Should I do this as soon as I level, or wait<br/>
&gt; until just before I level (in case I get a couple of Runes to try which<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t yet trivial during the level)?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You mean they are not trivial, and you just want to practice making the<br/>
spell, hoping to raise the skill? I recommend doing that before you<br/>
level, for the reason you mentioned, though I&#39;ve never done that. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve heard there&#39;s a 5 point per level cap...if I happen to miss a<br/>
&gt; level, and not make it to a guild hall, can I put in 10 next level?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know about the cap, but after missing a bunch of levels I<br/>
remember putting many points in to research. More than 10, even. <br/>
<br/>
BTW I recommend to put the rest into Dodge.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Can I top the 5 point cap by actually doing Research (since there&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; chance it goes up every time I try to combine runes), or is that a cap<br/>
&gt; based on my level, like most skills?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s like all skills. when it reaches the cap, it doesn&#39;t care how it<br/>
got there.<br/>
