<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127525732">Eheheh i just thinned a same and i wished to write a letter to our list to<br/>
ask a same question. I see that other groups are much better organized and<br/>
they have also members of Verant reading their forums. Here all talk about<br/>
other things and none wish to talk about real problems of our class, spell<br/>
improvement threads are lost in really stupid thread about twinkling which<br/>
can find its place in everquest list not in one list which idea is to talk<br/>
about problems of Wizards and not balancing of all game.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I read some excellent ideas in previous posts on this list but do you send<br/>
email to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:EQmail@...">EQmail@...</a> about things which you would like to see in game?<br/>
<br/>
Think what impresion one can take of our list if he takes a casual look ?? <br/>
<br/>
Horrifying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Twinking ... xxxxxxxxx <br/>
<br/>
and other inappropriate posts which fill my mailbox without bringing any<br/>
fresh ideas only lamentation!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for a long letter but i really wish to see in this list some long<br/>
thread about new spells, about how shadow step can be made better, or<br/>
anything other but a twinkling subject which can easily transfer to<br/>
everquest list or cheats list. <br/>
<br/>
And only what i see is that many strange individuals like to combat any new<br/>
idea which somebody propose.<br/>

&gt;I know there was an Argument about this before but it is starting to bother <br/>
&gt;me a little.  It seems that all the classes are getting updated except the <br/>
&gt;wizard class.  Could someone please give me news that the Eq people didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt;forget about us wizards.<br/>
