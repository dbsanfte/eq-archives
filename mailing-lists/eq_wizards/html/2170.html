&gt;Well I&#39;m back from my much needed long weekend and would like to get the<br/>
&gt;ball rolling again.  I made some very minor changes to the petition, and<br/>
&gt;unless a lot of people have major problems with it, I think its time to<br/>
&gt;start posting it around (maybe Wed, or Thursday).  Since nobody really<br/>
&gt;wants to spend the time collecting names I Feel we should post the<br/>
&gt;petition to EQ-Vault, Stratistics, alt.games.everquest, etc. and ask<br/>
&gt;people that agree with the petition to send an in-game /feedback to<br/>
&gt;express their support.  In addition, we can mail a copy to everquest<br/>
&gt;with an e-mail address for feedback.  Does this sound okay with<br/>
&gt;everybody?  Also, by using the in game feedback you can have the<br/>
&gt;opportunity to add examples to the items, if you feel it necessary.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Cheers,<br/>

&gt;Dear EverQuest Staff,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We are a large group of wizards who have come together through a mailing<br/>
&gt;list. Through much discussion and debate, we have agreed to send you<br/>
&gt;this feedback concerning improvements to the wizard. We would like to<br/>
&gt;thank you in advance for your careful consideration of these<br/>
&gt;modifications.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) Spells are 100% resisted by mobs 6+ levels above the caster. In large<br/>
&gt;groups hunting big prey this level cap turns a wizard from the main<br/>
&gt;dealer of damage to a useless member in the group. Our suggestion is<br/>
&gt;that either the cap be raised to 6+ levels of the highest member in the<br/>
&gt;group, or the cap be raised to 8+ levels higher than the caster.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2) Spells that both stun and damage targets are often resisted by mobs<br/>
&gt;that /con green and blue. If this is the result of the stun effect, we<br/>
&gt;would like one spell without this effect at the same level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3) Many spell suggestions have crossed this list. Here is one that we<br/>
&gt;all feel would be a great addition.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Tap Affinity - Teleport targeted group member to their own bind spot<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;4) O&#39;Kiels Radiation seems that it would be the beginning of a great<br/>
&gt;line of spells. Why should it end there? Additional spells of this type<br/>
&gt;would be a very welcome addition.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;5) Wizards seem to be very neglected when it comes to carrying or<br/>
&gt;wearing items that enhance our appearance. In addition, many completely<br/>
&gt;different spells have the same visual effects.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We would like to thank you again for your time. Any type of feedback<br/>
&gt;would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sincerely,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The Wizards of Norrath<br/>
