 </span></blockquote>Yeah, go anywhere where there are psycho trains or fast spawns.  :)  I&#39;m <br/>
serious...try places like HighHold, Unrest, or Cazic depending on your <br/>
level.  I&#39;ve personally found these places to be easiest to find a <br/>
group....not every night though, some nights are just hopeless.  But more <br/>
often than not, they&#39;ll be somebody in need of our services.  I&#39;ve never <br/>
been to Mistmoore, but it sounds like a pretty good spot too.  I hung around <br/>
S Karanas for a bit killing chickens, but I found that place to be pretty <br/>
tough to find a group...especially if you can&#39;t reliably hit the Advocets <br/>
till your about 24 at least.<br/>
