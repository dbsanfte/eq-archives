<div id="ygrps-yiv-1398145468"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;m not speaking from experience here. But most<br/>
&gt; enchanters over about lvl 20 seem to feel that they&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; screwed up if the group has to zone due to a bad pull.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know what spells they use. AoE Mesmerize,<br/>
&gt; Lull, Memory Blur...crowd control is what Enchanters<br/>
&gt; do. They turn a fight against 12 MOB&#39;s into 12<br/>
&gt; different fights against lone MOB&#39;s. And Charm works<br/>
&gt; great as well in those situations.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Although, I wouldn&#39;t go as far as saying turning 12 mobs into 12 fights (8<br/>
is about my max grouped, 3 max solo).  I agree with your point.  Enchanters<br/>
rock against a mob of blues.  Against 1 yellow mob, I&#39;d still pick the<br/>
wizard though.  1 Ranger (needs root), and 1 wizard will take down a mob<br/>
much faster than a Ranger and an Enchanter.  (I&#39;m breaking it down to a<br/>
bare minimum now)  Of course having a full group including a tank, cleric,<br/>
2 wizards and an Enchanter is almost unfair :)<br/>
<br/>
Just for the record,  My wizard is stuck on Hell Level 1,  My Enchanter<br/>
just hit level 12.  As far as an enchanters resistablity,  in many cases it<br/>
is very similar to a wizards.  The big difference is that the spells cost<br/>
very little mana (as compared to a wizzies latest burn) so while it is a<br/>
pain when your spell doesn&#39;t stick, it isn&#39;t the end of the world.<br/>
<br/>
Charm is a blast.  One of the reasons i picked the enchanter as my second<br/>
class is because I have this demented dream of Charming Holly Windstalker<br/>
and having her battle Cros Treewind. Kind of like a celebrety death match<br/>
:).  One of the lessons I learned with charm is that you never ever charm a<br/>
creature who is presently a non-combatant.  If 2+ mobs are attacking, then<br/>
charm is the way to go.<br/>
