&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hello folks,glad i found this community, here is the rant i sent to eq<br/>
&gt;god GZ and his response (he responded today).<br/>
&gt;All Notes are are my thoughts only,they werent sent in my original<br/>
&gt;email.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;ME:<br/>
&gt;&gt;1/Radiation shield:<br/>
&gt;&gt;Our radiation shield is the only combat related spell that we can cast<br/>
&gt;&gt;on others,and yet it is worthless past newby initiation.<br/>
&gt;&gt;I am lvl 34th now,i see other casters doing slightly less damage than<br/>
&gt;&gt;myself with slightly lower damage/mana ratio (magiciants come to mind) ,<br/>
&gt;&gt;when i was 24th it was the same with necros ect...even enchanters do<br/>
&gt;&gt;have very decent damage/mana ratio<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(Note: i wasnt entirelly correct on this one,i realized that only after<br/>
&gt;it was too late, but we do get cancel magic that is castable on others<br/>
&gt;and is a combat related spell.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;GZ:<br/>
&gt;        Wizards should not actually get damage shields - this one was<br/>
&gt;kept<br/>
&gt;in because it was in our origional design doc, and people liked it.<br/>
&gt;Wizards<br/>
&gt;to have the best damage ratios, the quickest spell casting times and the<br/>
&gt;best variety of damage of any class in the game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;ME:<br/>
&gt;&gt;Since these classes can do a whole lot more than just damage, isnt it<br/>
&gt;&gt;fitting for wizards to have a slight upgrade to our radiation shield?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(Note:GZ didnt answer me on that last one, my point was certain classes<br/>
&gt;do almost same damage as us (magiciant do almost same, think, its 7%<br/>
&gt;difference at my lvl) but they can do much more than dd,i was pressing<br/>
&gt;for anything extra &lt;grin&gt;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;ME:<br/>
&gt;&gt;2/Gates and evacuates:<br/>
&gt;&gt;Is there any difference at all between the mass gate and the evacs?? the<br/>
&gt;&gt;duration of the cast seem to be identical,is this a bug that will be<br/>
&gt;&gt;fixed?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;GZ:        Evac is quicker to cast.  It also has a chance of leaving<br/>
&gt;people<br/>
&gt;behind (about a 1% chance).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;ME:<br/>
&gt;&gt;Mass gates: Many wizards are very diasapointed with the locations of the<br/>
&gt;&gt;gates,i know i am. Why have 2 gates in the karanas 2 min from each<br/>
&gt;&gt;other?? why are all 3 other gates ro,neriak,and common so close to each<br/>
&gt;&gt;other while a vast expense of land is unreachable?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; GZ:       Teleportation cheapens the game - it makes it easy to get<br/>
&gt;around<br/>
&gt;(look at UO).  We wanted to keep our world big.  That is why so few<br/>
&gt;classes<br/>
&gt;get teleportation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(note: Druid locations are far superior to ours and much better located,<br/>
&gt;guess that is to compensate for the lack of the dimensional planes.also<br/>
&gt;and i am not sure if this is true but i hear druid mass gates sometimes<br/>
&gt;drop party in a random loc)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;ME:<br/>
&gt;&gt;Now understand we love mass gating, it is a lot of fun to have special<br/>
&gt;&gt;abilities that not many others enjoy, but there are large portion of the<br/>
&gt;&gt;norath world that far far from our gates,i wish our gates were more<br/>
&gt;&gt;strategically placed. Also i surelly hope you will not forget to include<br/>
&gt;&gt;a gate to all future continents.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; GZ:       Future continents will have gates for sure.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;ME:<br/>
&gt;&gt;3/Eye of Zomm: this is the most fun in my inventory i get a kick out of<br/>
&gt;&gt;using it everytime,but for the life of me i do not understand why it is<br/>
&gt;&gt;of such short duration.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; GZ:       It has a short duration to prevent players from mapping<br/>
&gt;dungeons<br/>
&gt;with no risk.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(note: i am wondering if he realizes it only last like 15 seconds)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;ME:<br/>
&gt;&gt;4/bind sight: another great fun spell, its only problem is imo way way<br/>
&gt;&gt;too short range on pcs, i think it must be bugged that is the only<br/>
&gt;&gt;explaination i can come up with. if i binded sight on a player and the<br/>
&gt;&gt;player walks away just a short distance all i can see is a static<br/>
&gt;&gt;display.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; GZ:       Hmm - i will check that out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;ME:<br/>
&gt;&gt;5/Root: wile enchanter whirl seem to have been fixed in such a way as<br/>
&gt;&gt;not to break while the mob is taking -bash-damage, i could also point<br/>
&gt;&gt;out that root certainly seem to behave the way whirl used to prior to<br/>
&gt;&gt;patch.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;From my own experience root seem to last a lot longer if the mob is not<br/>
&gt;&gt;taking damage but would tend to break after nuking. If in fact this is<br/>
&gt;&gt;true,then doesnt root also need to be fixed in the same way that whirl<br/>
&gt;&gt;was? As far as i can see both spells have the same purpose more or less.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;GZ:        Root has a % chance of breaking when the creature takes<br/>
&gt;damage - the<br/>
&gt;same as we changed whirl to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;6/Finally my rant would be that wizards arent set that far apart in<br/>
&gt;&gt;damage dealing nor in damage/mana efficiency then any of the other<br/>
&gt;&gt;casters save maybe shamans (i am only 34th though i havent seen yet what<br/>
&gt;&gt;is to come). Yet these other classes can do magical damage and much much<br/>
&gt;&gt;more. I must say at this point, only mass gating make me continue to<br/>
&gt;&gt;want to be a wizard.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;GZ:       Try another class for a bit and see the difference in the<br/>
&gt;amount of<br/>
&gt;time that it takes you to deal out similar damage.  :)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(Note: well GZ seem to think that because we cast the nukes slightly<br/>
&gt;faster that puts us way ahead of the pack, well he is entitled to his<br/>
&gt;opinion of course,mine is that the fact that i can cast spells 1 sec<br/>
&gt;faster than everyone else is totally worthless.The only advantage that i<br/>
&gt;can see is for soloing and i quit doing that long time ago.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He also seem to think that wizard having -almost- same damage/mana<br/>
&gt;efficiency as magiciant is quiet ok as long as our damage is dealt<br/>
&gt;slightly faster. This really bugs me. i see no purpose whatsoever in<br/>
&gt;myself doing a mob 1000 damage in 4 shots vs a magiciant doing it in<br/>
&gt;5.With both of us having used the same mana spent. That is suppose to be<br/>
&gt;a big asset??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyways, glad i took the whine of my chest, now at least i know he is<br/>
&gt;aware of some of our grivences.)<br/>
