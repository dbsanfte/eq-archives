<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-333406259">I&#39;m just wondering i saw a Magician on the Mithandril Marr server the other <br/>
day dueling a wizard.  The Magician was of the 13th level and the Wizard was <br/>
of the 9th level.  The wizard won because of his quick spell casting.  The <br/>
Magician had his pet out but the pet wouldn&#39;t attack.  I am just wondering if <br/>
the Magician&#39;s pet can attack or kill a regular player in a dueling match?  <br/>
So far the Magician guy told me that it wouldn&#39;t respond to him when he told <br/>
it to attack the 9th level Wizard.<br/>
