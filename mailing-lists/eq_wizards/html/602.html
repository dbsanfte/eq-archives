&gt;Subject: Re: 8th lvl spells<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m about to become 8th level can you give me the spells<br/>
&gt;&gt; that are best to buy<br/>
&gt;&gt; first someone please send me a list in order from first to<br/>
&gt;&gt; buy then to last<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Shock Of Ice<br/>
&gt;Lesser Shielding<br/>
&gt;Shadow Step<br/>
&gt;Fire Bolt<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The other 4 I haven&#39;t even bought myself yet.  Eye of Zomm looks<br/>
&gt;totally useless, ditto for Sense Summoned, and the other two are<br/>
&gt;combat spells I&#39;ve never seen anybody use.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, sence summoned or sence magic or any other spell that uses<br/>
divination skill is very valuable when you hit level 12, because bind<br/>
affinity uses divination skill.  I&#39;ve noticed that when I got my divination<br/>
skill up higher, that I fizzled far fewer times with bind affinity.<br/>
<br/>
I bought the cheapest spell I could find to raise Divination, and that<br/>
turned out to be sence magic.  At only 5 mana per cast, I can cast A LOT of<br/>
them, and the spell only cost 1 gold.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, since fade and shadowstep both use the same skill as root,<br/>
(abjuration?) at each level, I cast a ton of fades to increase that skill<br/>
and make sure its at its maximum.<br/>
