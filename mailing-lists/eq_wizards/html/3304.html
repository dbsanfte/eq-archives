<b>Subject:</b> Need +int stuff <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000575537">I&#39;m a level 21 wizard who needs +int items. I have +2 rings and a BiM, but<br/>
have not tried to get any other items or do any quests for I think I&#39;m too<br/>
low a level. If someone could please tell me when I can get some +int items<br/>
and from where, or what quests I could do at my level I&#39;d be greatful.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Lott.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I know about Cubert and the Stein of Mogok, but at the present time I&#39;m<br/>
not able to do these since I&#39;m an evil race on a PvP teams server.</div>
