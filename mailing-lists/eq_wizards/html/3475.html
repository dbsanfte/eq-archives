<div id="ygrps-yiv-528655555">&quot;I&#39;ve felt the shock spells have been fairly reliable so far.  I&#39;ve heard<br/>
weather patterns affect our spells too but I haven&#39;t devoted the time to<br/>
confirm that. :)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, If thats true, maybe I should be casting shock spells in the rain?  I<br/>
love Thunderstrike when it works but mine seems to get resisted a lot.  It<br/>
reminds me of what the Terrors used on me when I was fighting them.  At<br/>
least until I learned I could root them and my bolt spell had a longer range<br/>
then their spells.  I&#39;d still laugh my butt off as my shamen friend would<br/>
get blasted by me .  He didn&#39;t think it was so funny tho&#39;.</div>
