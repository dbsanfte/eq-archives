<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508684578">i like it.  i have steered away from research, as it&#39;s just so hard to find<br/>
runes.  i have found probably over 100 words/pages and have only found a<br/>
total of 5 runes. this makes it real hard for our class.  even if i were<br/>
finding the same runes over and over again, at least i would be able to<br/>
raise my skill lvl (I have only made two spells, only because those are the<br/>
only runes ive been able to find).<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;When I first started EQ and was told about the research skill. I thought<br/>
&gt;&quot;Wow! Cool I&#39;ll be able to find new spells&quot;. But low and behold what a<br/>
&gt;dismal dissapointment this skill is. It is a skill that you NEED to be of<br/>
&gt;any use at high lvls. More and more of your &quot;Main Spells&quot; become research<br/>
&gt;only, the skill is TEDIOUS AS HELL to raise, finding runes can be hard.<br/>
&gt;Finding the ones you need is the worst and finding enough of the ones you<br/>
&gt;need to get to a descent skill level is HELL.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So what do I suggest for this skill? A few things<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(A) Have 2 spell components per rank buyable at guilds. So you can buy the<br/>
&gt;runes/components you need at that lvl to get to a descent skill to make<br/>
 </span></blockquote>your<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;other spells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(B) Make all of the &quot;Main Spells&quot; buyable. So for<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- Wizards : Direct damage, Gates<br/>
&gt;- Magi : Direct damage, pets<br/>
&gt;- Encs : ???? Buffs and Debuffs ???<br/>
&gt;- Necros : Pets and DoTs<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;These would be the &quot;basic spells&quot; for those ranks. Things like area effect,<br/>
&gt;buffs/debuffs for some class&#39;s. Root, util spells, etc would be research<br/>
&gt;only. Then, have some nice &quot;upgraded&quot; DDs, DOTs, Buffs, etc that are rare<br/>
&gt;research runes. And verant could constatnly be adding new combos, etc. ie)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;lvl 29 wiz spell does 240 dmg. Make it buyable (which it is), Have another<br/>
&gt;lvl 29 wiz spell that is harder to get, research only, etc, but have it do<br/>
&gt;like.. 270 dmg for only a few more mana.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If verant was to be constantly adding componet combos/etc to the game it<br/>
&gt;would add alot to it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So for example, a wizard would get every DD and every teleport buyable. But<br/>
&gt;any of his other spells would need to be researched, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Or a magi could buy every &quot;basic pets&quot; he would need. But he could be lucky<br/>
&gt;and manage to research a pet at the same lvl that has more hp and hits for<br/>
&gt;more damage then his standard one would.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(C) In certian areas in the game, you should be able to invoke the research<br/>
&gt;skill to digup components. Much like the forage skill. ie) Wizard is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>putsing<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;about in Befallen, in the library he uses his research skill, he may dig up<br/>
&gt;a rune from the shelf that could be used for a spellt aht he needs. This<br/>
&gt;would also provide an alternative way to raise your skill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(D) Have various components that change the effect of your spells. And the<br/>
&gt;mana/dmg/cast time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(btw: I play a wizard so all my examples will use wizards, this does not<br/>
&gt;mean I want to &quot;buff up the class&quot; since this would effect all the other<br/>
&gt;casters in this game aswell)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, lets say I find rune Hot and rune Bolt, which would make the Inferno<br/>
&gt;Shock spell. I dont want to have the &quot;standard&quot; look of the inferno shock<br/>
&gt;spell. I&#39;d like it to look like a healing spell but just do a pallet swap<br/>
 </span></blockquote>so<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;it looks like fire not the cool-healing blue it is. I&#39;d also like to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>incrase<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;its mana efficeny by sacraficing it&#39;s casting time ( so it takes longer to<br/>
&gt;cast ). So while researching the spell, I toss in the componets and pop out<br/>
&gt;the inferno shock spell. Then, I put the scrool back into the wizards<br/>
&gt;lexcion, then mix/match combos etc untill I get the new desired effect that<br/>
&gt;I want.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think this would add ALOT of diversity to all of the magic casters. Every<br/>
&gt;other magi looks like the next, every wizard looks like the next when<br/>
&gt;casting. Not a whole lot sets them apart.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Wizard (A) May have a fast casting inferno shock that is less manna<br/>
&gt;efficent, but he can pop them off faster then wizard (B), whos inferno<br/>
 </span></blockquote>shock<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;does more damage but takes alot longer to cast.<br/>
