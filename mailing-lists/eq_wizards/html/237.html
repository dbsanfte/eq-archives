<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369480919">I only have 100 Int, figured that was enough, but as a human I&#39;ve got some<br/>
other better stats. I don&#39;t see any REAL detriment till perhaps later on.<br/>
Later on we&#39;ll have less mana, so perhaps 1 less damage spell goes off. So<br/>
far I haven&#39;t really noticed a big deal. However, let me point out that what<br/>
you&#39;re doing is playing the numbers. It&#39;s like having a D&D character with<br/>
18/00 str. Sure, it&#39;s nice, but if we all played them then it&#39;d get stale<br/>
fast.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just my opinion, and that&#39;s why I stopped putting points into my int<br/>
at 100/<br/>
