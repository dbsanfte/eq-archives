<div id="ygrps-yiv-357431952"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To anyone who has completed the Ice Comet quest, was wondering how the rod <br/>
&gt;that is located in Neriak can be obtained if you are not a Dark Elf or evil <br/>
&gt;race. Thanks for any hints.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This quest can be easily completed anywhere from level 16 on up.  But I<br/>
would personally wait till about 29th.  Reasons are as follows.<br/>
Untill you reach the 30.  Mana plus items are much more valuable to a<br/>
caster than int items.   At level 25 each extra int point gives you 5 mana.<br/>
Ok sure the staff gives 10 int plus other stuff, but it sucks for a weapon.<br/>
 Prior to the 30, your combat still sucks, but your offense and defense<br/>
skills probably haven&#39;t caped yet.  Its important to get in melee and get<br/>
beat on a bit so you have that Defense skill caped asap.<br/>
<br/>
On to the quest.<br/>
Invis will get you through 90% of this quest.  You may need someone to cast<br/>
enduring breath on you for some locations.  The rod in neriak is not one<br/>
such place.  Just using invis will work here.<br/>
The only rod that requires more than invis is the rod from Lower Guk hand<br/>
room.  Personally I am on a quite crouded server, if you are as well,<br/>
simply go to lower guk on a weekend night when the zone is packed.  Have<br/>
someone invis you to undead at the zone and then make your way to the hand<br/>
room where the rod is located.<br/>
<br/>
Its an easy quest overall, just time consuming.<br/>
Once I hit 49th (5.5 more bubbles, woo hoo) I&#39;ll probably end up either<br/>
buying the IC spell from another player. (Someone already tried to sell it<br/>
to me for 500plat.) That or I will hit the planes, which are where your<br/>
most likely to find the rune of the astral.  Ive found frost runes on high<br/>
level mobs in the non planar areas of the game.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps<br/>
