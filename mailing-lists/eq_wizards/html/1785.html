<b>Subject:</b> Re: Kill the Twink...one curious statement <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003341515">Doesn&#39;t this statement make you wonder about the person who was supposedly<br/>
suspended from the game for 30 days or something?  If that is Verants stance<br/>
on the topic then maybe the fellow who was playing EQpoliceman was either A.<br/>
Fibbing to us to make a point, B.  A big annoyance to the GMs so they<br/>
finally told him something happened when it didn&#39;t to get him off their<br/>
back, or C. Misinformed or misunderstanding of a statement made to him.  I<br/>
really don&#39;t give a rip either way, its just a kind of curious thing to come<br/>
up at this point with all the suspension and banning talk...kinda makes me<br/>
laugh.<br/>
I&#39;m done with the topic as well now, having said this.  :)<br/>
Have a darn good day and lets get some fixes put in for wizards now...maybe<br/>
a spell to generate copious amounts of cash and cheeseburgers in<br/>
game.....McWizzy....heh<br/>

&gt;&gt; I personally have seen GMs come to answer a petition about twinking, and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>say,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; and I quote, &quot; Twinking is Pointless, and thus, not illegal.  We have no<br/>
 </span></blockquote>way<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; of verifying or controlling it.  Continue enjoying the game, as if the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>person<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt; who YOU have a problem with does not exist. Everyone will be happier that<br/>
&gt;&gt; way.&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; THAT is verants stand, not Suspending people<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And I agree with them 100%.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Subject pretty much closed, as far as I&#39;m concerned<br/>
