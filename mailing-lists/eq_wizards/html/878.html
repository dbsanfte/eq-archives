<b>Subject:</b> Murderous Merchant In Akanon. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1568953856">Hello fellow Wizards,<br/>
    A wood elf friend of mine was recently KOS immediatly upon entering Akanon by a Merchant. He wasnt able to get the name of this npc though. Does anyone know the name of this npc so I can steer clear of him. I need to go to Akanon to get my lightning spell soon.<br/>
    Another question. Has anyone had sucsess in getting a black robe from neriak by having  friend get it and then giving consent to loot his corpse? This was discussed here a while ago and was wondering if it was indeed possible to do. If robes cannot be traded and/or sold (even ones from najena or the thatamurgist) this seems like a serious bug since these robes are valuable to us casters but not to others and they would likely want to sell them if they(non-casters) got those robes. Any thoughts?</div>
