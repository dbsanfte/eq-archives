&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I thought wizards were supposed to be masters of DD spells. I was with a<br/>
&gt; level 29 cleric recently, and he has a spell (wrath) which was doing 198<br/>
&gt; damage to my 178. Granted, I am level 27, but was still kind of shocked.<br/>

takes. I&#39;m sure if you went head to head with the cleric, you&#39;d out<br/>
damage him.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, it&#39;s a level difference where the levels are separated by a spell<br/>
level gap. If you&#39;d compare a 19 wiz to a 20 wiz you&#39;d see a big<br/>
difference too. Wow, it&#39;s only one level, right? Well, when it is a<br/>
spell level it&#39;s not the same.<br/>
