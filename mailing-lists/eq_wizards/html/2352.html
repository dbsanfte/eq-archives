You are absolutely correct where you won&#39;t <br/>
find the kind of problems you do in software as you do in other consumer<br/>
products. But ask yourself this question <br/>
Why is software inherently so buggy ? <br/>
The answer in my opinion is the consumers. We as consumers demand better<br/>
software day in day out, we always<br/>
want the latest and greatest, the better game, the more featured OS, the<br/>
fancier word processor. I can&#39;t remember<br/>
how many posts i read when EQ was still in beta where people we&#39;re<br/>
complaining that the schedule kept slipping and they<br/>
wanted it NOW. I think Verant did the best they could too satisfy both<br/>
end&#39;s of the spectrum. <br/>
<br/>
1. Keep the consumers happy by releasing the product as soon as possible.<br/>
2. Keep the consumers happy by releasing the product as stable as it can be<br/>
in a timely manner. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s always a double edge sword ... you can slip the schedule to fix bugs,<br/>
but then they get flamed for slipping. <br/>
Or you can release on time with more bugs in the software, then they get<br/>
flamed for releasing buggy software. <br/>
The fact is software companies have learned to live and deal with flames<br/>
because you can never please everyone.<br/>
The key is findng a good balance.<br/>
<br/>
There is no such thing as bug free software. At least i&#39;ve never seen any<br/>
such thing. You live with the fact that <br/>
your operating system (i&#39;m guessing most of you are running some sort of MS<br/>
Windows) crashes quite often. <br/>
We were promised plug-n-play and we got plug-n-pray. Yet we still go out<br/>
and buy these buggy pieces of software.<br/>
<br/>
Why ? because at the end of the day it&#39;s usually better than what we<br/>
currently have and we are willing to put up with <br/>
the bugs that are in it. <br/>
<br/>
At the end of the day WE are just as much to blame as the developers for<br/>
buggy software. WE create the demand and<br/>
the developers are just trying to meet that demand. <br/>
<br/>
I personally think Verant has done a very reasonable job in handling bugs<br/>
and getting patches out. I don&#39;t expect or ask<br/>
for perfection in software because i truly believe it does not exist. All I<br/>
ask is that bugs/problems get dealt with in a timely<br/>
manner. <br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Two things.<br/>
&gt;&gt; First, you will never have a project of this magnitude without having some <br/>
&gt;bugs<br/>
&gt;&gt; making it to release undiscovered.  Software is inherently buggy, its a <br/>
&gt;fact of<br/>
&gt;&gt; life, get used to it, you will see it happen more and more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Being a software designer, I tend to notice that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Second, they have stated that people found exploiting a bug will be <br/>
&gt;warned.  If they<br/>
&gt;&gt; continue to exploit the bug, then they will be punished.  Its painfully <br/>
&gt;obvious why<br/>
&gt;&gt; they don&#39;t list bugs.  They don&#39;t want to be forced into policing them <br/>
&gt;24/7.  If you<br/>
&gt;&gt; stumble onto something that is a blatent bug, report it so that it gets <br/>
&gt;fixed, and<br/>
&gt;&gt; move on.  If you find something that could go either way, enjoy it until a <br/>
&gt;GM/Guide<br/>
&gt;&gt; tells you to stop.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thing is, they released buggy software. I paid good money for it, and keep <br/>
&gt;paying every<br/>
&gt;month.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;They should take care of it. Their game. My money. Their problem, not mine. <br/>
&gt;As a<br/>
&gt;consumer, I shouldn&#39;t even have to think about these things. What happens is <br/>
&gt;that the<br/>
&gt;game designers are aware as to how much the gaming public is involved in the <br/>
&gt;process of<br/>
&gt;making designing games, so the EXPLOIT us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Have you ever seen a TV released that only shows prime number channels, with <br/>
&gt;a promise<br/>
&gt;to come fix it some time? Ever seen a stove that only heats to 50 degrees <br/>
&gt;with a promise<br/>
&gt;to come fix it some time? Ever see a car that only turns left with a promise <br/>
&gt;to come fix<br/>
&gt;it some time? No. This happens only in computer software, especially high <br/>
&gt;profile games.<br/>
