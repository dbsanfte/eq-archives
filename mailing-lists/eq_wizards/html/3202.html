&gt;&gt;Nah I am a Wizard from Erudin.  That spell gave off almost no light.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Well, it&#39;s better than nothing, and it&#39;s free and it&#39;s more than other<br/>
&gt;classes that can&#39;t cast it got, so why complain about it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, it&#39;s not completely useless, better than nothing.  The Halo of Light <br/>
spell would be better for you later on.  Especially when you die somewhere <br/>
and you are in need of light on the fly.  I hear you Erudites are <br/>
particularly feeble in the dark. ;)  Bwaaahahaah.  (my attempt to feel <br/>
superior to your overinflated INT. :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, anybody have a guess what the fair market value of a water crystal <br/>
staff is?   I got a spare one lying around and I want to use it for trade...<br/>
