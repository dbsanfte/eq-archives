<div id="ygrps-yiv-565461190">Well who is really to say what is considered twinking . . .  I think we<br/>
should just play the game and let people do whatever.    I would rather<br/>
discuss spells and stuff in this list than people getting mad cus JOE FRIDAY<br/>
has full plate or whatever.  I don&#39;t really like twinking but it happens and<br/>
to BAN it seems weird kinda strict.   There are too many scenerios.  I mean<br/>
there is this friend of mine in real life and he plays more than I do and is<br/>
higher lvl and he gave me a cool Savant Cap and I like it.  So should I be<br/>
banned?   Dunno, but I&#39;d rather talk about cool &quot;in-game&quot; stuff . . .<br/>

&gt; I hear a lot of players say that it is wrong and I agree. I hear few say<br/>
&gt; leave it alone! I and a lot of other players left twinking alone in UO and<br/>
&gt; look where that game is now. Same for Diablo. It does effect me and my<br/>
&gt; character cause it will lead to every other player having to twinkle just<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; play on even ground. Then all the honest players will be left behind like<br/>
&gt; UO.<br/>

&gt; Twinking the Definition....Giving high level gear to a low level<br/>
character.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I agree that &quot;low level&quot; is not lower level. I a 10th level wizard gave<br/>
&gt; items to a fighter who is 7th level. Things I can not use but he can and<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; helps our party. He being only 3 levels under me. This just makes sense.<br/>
But<br/>
&gt; when a 20th level character gives items high in value to a less then 10th<br/>
&gt; level character that is simply foolish and exploitable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now at 5th level I did find a mighty magical item that someone had<br/>
&gt; mistakenly dropped. I belive this is fair in the game. But to have a<br/>
&gt; character outfitted by other, in a guild or no, is simply cheating and<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; ruin the balance of the game.<br/>
