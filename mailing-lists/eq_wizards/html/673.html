<div id="ygrps-yiv-713923161">Verant IMHO has done an *outstanding* job of balancing<br/>
the game and the various classes.  With this in mind I seriously<br/>
doubt they would &quot;neuter&quot; the wizard class or make any changes at all<br/>
without serious forethought.<br/>
<br/>
But I do think we might see these kind of downgrades (along with<br/>
upgrades) pretty often.  MUDs do this all the time, and EQ is<br/>
a lot like a MUD.  Verant seems to pay much closer attention to game<br/>
balance than UO ever did, thats a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
With all that said, my guess is that if they do lower the high-<br/>
end wizard damage, then they&#39;ll give wizards something else to<br/>
make up for it.  I have to admit the kill-stealing thing is a<br/>
valid complaint - it IS easy for wizards to steal kills.  But<br/>
looking at the evidence so far, having played in beta, I&#39;d say<br/>
Verant knows what they&#39;re doing and I trust them not to screw<br/>
us over.<br/>

&gt;My opionion is wait and see.  I mean, if we KNEW this was going to be in an<br/>
&gt;upcomming patch, then feedbacking ahead of time would be fine to ward it<br/>
&gt;off.  As it stands right now, we would likely just be filling the feedback<br/>
&gt;cues with messages asking them not to do something they weren&#39;t going to do<br/>
&gt;anyway and wasting time that would be better spent fixing actual problems<br/>
&gt;with the game.  Of course, that&#39;s just my opinion.<br/>

&gt;&gt; So.. should we all wait to see if its just a rumor?  or should we all<br/>
&gt;petition today stating that it would ruin the game for us?    Opinions<br/>
&gt;please.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; This is nuts.  Wizards have it tough already getting to high levels.<br/>
&gt;Until<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; lvl 12 or so you are effectively a magician with no pet (and therefore a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; pretty weak magician.)  If they hurt wizards offensively there would<br/>
&gt;have to<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; be some change defensively to offset it.  I mean, wizards only real way<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; survive is nuke the critter into oblivion fast enough that it can&#39;t take<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; down your paltry hit point pool through your nearly nonexistant AC.  I<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; seriously think this is just a rumor, though.  EQ is balanced to be PvE,<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; a Wizard is, in general, not better off than any other classes.  I mean,<br/>
&gt;at<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; high levels you may be the only one who can solo a Hill Giant, but after<br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; do that a young lion could maul you because it takes all your mana to<br/>
&gt;kill<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; the giant.  I think the drill here is remain calm and then if they gimp<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; wizards flood them with polite feedbacks on why this was bad.  Heck,<br/>
&gt;Wizards<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; were gimped right near the end of beta, too, and feedbacks seem to have<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; improved that situation.<br/>
