<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640816288">OK, just read Shadair&#39;s post in the digest I just got, so as far as<br/>
languages - what he said.  He is RIGHT on the mark with all of that, so<br/>
just refer back.<br/>
(BTW, I might just hit you up for some training in that - Do you need<br/>
Elder Elvish maybe?)<br/>
<br/>
One thing to note when looking for spells- some are class only - You<br/>
wont find enchanters selling Shock of Lightning.  But spells like Bind<br/>
are used by sooo many people that your particular guild area might not<br/>
even carry it - look for either a common seller (like the center<br/>
merchants in the Gnome city or others), or check other classes guild<br/>
halls.  When I wanted Gate, I ended up hitting the Clerics in Felwithe.  <br/>
