<b>Subject:</b> Some Reading....Touching on a few points.. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-82192073">The petition is a good Idea but if I had to narrow it down to a working goal<br/>
I would have to say that we most definitely should be able to affect a Mob<br/>
with our spells that is even 15 levels above us. Not just the melee classes<br/>
but every other class has the potential to do that. There&#39;s no reason why we<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be able too either. Ok, I&#39;m lvl 16 and I want to hit something<br/>
that is lvl 26 and maybe there&#39;s a 50% chance for a full resist and a<br/>
successful hit would only do 20% damage but at least it is damage and come<br/>
on what&#39;s 20pts of damage to a lvl 26 Mob? Barely even a scratch... This<br/>
would also prevent gangs of Wizards at lvl 15 from taking down SG&#39;s and HG&#39;s<br/>
and yet we would still be able to do something. Currently resists seem a bit<br/>
ridiculous....evertime I level until I get that next 5 points I go thru a<br/>
rash of resists....which just doesn&#39;t make sense to me...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad our resident lvl 30+ is saying that groups don&#39;t take on anything<br/>
but blues at his lvl which means that we will come into our own but I still<br/>
think the above is a valiod issue.<br/>
<br/>
Damage shields could be very unbalancing as I understand it but what if we<br/>
only got a 1 pt. increase in the damage done per level with each spell? That<br/>
would make a lvl 20 spell do 6pts. which is just now catching up to what a<br/>
Druid can do(but a druids damage shield is also a buff). Even if they are<br/>
not practical in their use I would still like to see this class of spells<br/>
continued...<br/>
<br/>
Familiars? I have to disagree with this. Which is kinda funny cause I sat<br/>
down and wrote up a list of familiar spells way before the mana-battery idea<br/>
was posted on this list but I scrapped it and here&#39;s why: Instead of making<br/>
this a spell I would like to see familiars end up in the game as rewards for<br/>
GM run quests. This would cut down on the availability yes but it would also<br/>
allow the winner of each quest to have a &quot;Unique&quot; or near unique item. For<br/>
instance: Cinius completes the first quest and is rewarded a miniature<br/>
gargoyle as his familiar which normally rests upon my shoulder but can move<br/>
around on his own(with limited graphics of course). Mata(Easiest name I can<br/>
think of right now that&#39;s on this) comes along for the next familiar quest<br/>
and is rewarded with a vicious, horrifying, fuzzy caterpillar, which rests<br/>
upon her shoulder and becomes part of her character graphic for the most<br/>
part.... Anyways, the potential is limitless with this....or we can all run<br/>
around with the 8th level familiar spell which is a Bat that provides us<br/>
with 15 extra mana.....<br/>
<br/>
On a side note: Animations do suck. Graphics in this graphical game are very<br/>
limited. Wizard specific Items!!! Way kool Idea! and why not?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for this long one....<br/>
