<b>Subject:</b> hello? :) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1456110896">Why is everyone so quiet lately?  Trying to finish that dumb quest for the <br/>
cloak? hehe.  Has anyone done it yet?  I think it&#39;s really no big deal so <br/>
I&#39;m not sweating it yet, but it would be a nice accomplishment to do it <br/>
anyway.  I think I&#39;m going to pass up the extra AC and just try for that <br/>
Molten Cloak instead.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, 29th level is one heck of a fun set of spells.  I&#39;m not using <br/>
the DD yet as they tend to fizzle still, but we can cast those frost shock <br/>
spells with impunity it seems.  And until it gets old, thse group teleports <br/>
are fun to play with.  They make it easy to get some quick cash or some free <br/>
buffs.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, enough rambling.  Just trying to create some conversation again. :)<br/>
