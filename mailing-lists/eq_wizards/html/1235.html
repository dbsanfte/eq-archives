<div id="ygrps-yiv-989236072"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Playing my wizard I have really not noticed<br/>
		&gt;faster weapon skill gain than what my ranger had (his int<br/>
 </span></blockquote>was only 80 or<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;something).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well INT is definitely supposed to mean faster learning.  But in the<br/>
scenario of meleeing, in general it may not be much of a difference when you<br/>
do it so much.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;As to your skills increasing slowly, that is strange.  When<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my ranger got to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;about level 17 and he got a screaming mace, his 1h blunt<br/>
 </span></blockquote>skill was 0.  I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;went to unrest and got permission from the groups there to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>get some whacks<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;in on the mobs they were fighting (many of which were<br/>
 </span></blockquote>white/black or yellow<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;cons).  It took me a while, but skill steadily improved<br/>
 </span></blockquote>from 0 all the way<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> 		&gt;to max of 100 at level 19. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is why I suggested there is a bug or design flaw.  The only common<br/>
thread of all the complaints on message boards is they were all Level 14 or<br/>
higher mage classes using the 2H Blunt (Runed Totem Staff) skill for the<br/>
first time and it was hardly improving at all, even though they were at 0!!<br/>
I&#39;ve had my RTS for three levels now and the only reason I am at skill of 20<br/>
on 2H Blunt is because I pumped 15 practice points into it after spending a<br/>
whole level of going nowhere with that skill.  Something&#39;s not right here.</div>
