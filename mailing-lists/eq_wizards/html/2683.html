<div id="ygrps-yiv-1913680329">You couldn&#39;t be more wrong.  The faction system makes you explore different<br/>
areas of the game to find ways to improve your faction.  If they just told<br/>
you how to improve or destroy your faction with any races then why have it.<br/>
Why would a DE be allowed to enter or even buy from venders of Good diety?<br/>
The faction system allows for a person to create their own destiny by<br/>
choosing which faction they wish to increase and hunting that method out.<br/>
<br/>
    In Guk there are two factions of Frogloks, Good and Undead (Ghoul).  At<br/>
the begining if you do not harm any Good frogloks and head into Guk and get<br/>
attacked by a Ghoul froglok, you can run to a good froglok and he will<br/>
protect you just like a guard would in your city.  This of course depends on<br/>
your starting faction with them.  Without a faction system then you will get<br/>
attack by everyone of them.<br/>

  well, i don&#39;t have an answer for u, but i think Verant royally screwed up<br/>
with the PC faction system they implemented.  anyway, i say if Verant is<br/>
going to continue with this patsy faction crap, they need to at least post<br/>
how u can alter ur faction in a positive manner.  or just totally remove the<br/>
stupid friggin PC faction system.<br/>
<br/>
  just my rant.<br/>

    Hello, fellow Wizards!<br/>
<br/>
    Several weeks ago I participated in a guild war and slew a High Elf not<br/>
knowing that there would be a faction hit as a result. Well, I can no longer<br/>
 purchase or sell items in Felwithe. I&#39;ve tried everything that I know of to<br/>
improve my faction standing with the Merchants there, but to no avail. My<br/>
faction standing with the guards is &quot;amiable&quot; -- It is with the &quot;Merchants&quot;<br/>
that I need a faction adjustment. Does anyone have any ideas? Suggestions?<br/>
Personal experience? Would appreciate any and all advice.<br/>
