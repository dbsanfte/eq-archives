&gt; Any wizards out there with high dex (gnomes start with 85 dex I believe)<br/>
&gt; care to comment on this?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a gnomish Wizard, I also put 5 of my bonus points into dex (90?), and 3<br/>
into wisdom (70).  It doesn&#39;t seem to matter what is hitting me when I<br/>
recover.  I&#39;ve recovered while being hit by deep reds and Decaying skels.  I<br/>
tend to recover most while being hit by blues, but I have attacked/been<br/>
attacked by blues more than anything else.  Anyway, I pulled this from the<br/>
manual.<br/>
<br/>
Dexterity:<br/>
This is your hand/eye coordination and is used in combat accuracy and spell<br/>
casting capability.  This is<br/>
used in calculating your missile combat skills and aids in determining if you<br/>
are interrupted when you are<br/>
hit while casting a spell.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wisdom:<br/>
This is willpower and faith and is used to determine the casting abilities of<br/>
Shaman, Druids, Rangers,<br/>
Clerics, and Paladins.  It is also involved in resisting magical spells that<br/>
effect the mind.<br/>
<br/>
