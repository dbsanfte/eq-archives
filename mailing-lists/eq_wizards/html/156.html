<div id="ygrps-yiv-159850395">--==SPOILER==-- Well Wizards might get powerful but at lev 14 they are still weakAs a 20th lvl wizard, I can tell you that no one can match our raw power, not even clerics with their undead spell.  At 20th lvl, I&#39;m doing 171 dmg that also has a chance to stun the creature.  The clerics don&#39;t get their next Undead DD spell until 24th, so they are only doing 90+ dmg at 20th.  At 24th they will be doing close to 200, but the wizard&#39;s DD spell with be doing at least that much.<br/>
<br/>
 *Major Spoiler*  At 49thh lvl, the wizards get a DD spell that does 1100 dmg!!!!  No other class can come close to that amount of dmg ;)  Gives ya something to look forward to ;)<br/>

  Hail Fellow Wizards <br/>
<br/>
  My name is Oonagh i play on the E&#39;ci server <br/>
<br/>
  I am a devouted Wizard.. Don&#39;t get me wrong , but as a reply to Greg (Kronan) <br/>
  I would say: <br/>
<br/>
  All caster class can do as much damage as a wizard until lev 15 at least (I am only 14 ) <br/>
<br/>
  Magicians does in the mid 70 dam with their spell DirectDam spell <br/>
  Clerics do the same <br/>
  Necros i don&#39;t know about, but think they do about mid 70 as well <br/>
  Wizards does 80dam per DD spell <br/>
  At 16 you do about 100 dam as your DD spell <br/>
<br/>
  So you would not see your class shine until higher lev.. <br/>
<br/>
  Perhaps 20.. I don&#39;t know but i heard the DD Wizard spell did 200dam there.. offcourse the Cleric undead spell at that lev does  close to 200 dam as well.. But thats just against undeads.<br/>
<br/>
  I am 14th lev now and all the other casters i meet do just as much damage as me and have much more nicer utility spell like pets. buffs/debuffs etc..<br/>
<br/>
  I am in need of another player to really get xp (or actually any xp at all without the danger of dying or zoning to save my butt on every mob i attack).. wheras the magics and necros etc can solo perfectly alone..<br/>
<br/>
  I am sure the reward will be GREAT, BUT it will come at a later level than 14, believe me. <br/>
  maybe 20 maybe higher. <br/>
<br/>
  Hang in there fellow Wizard, we WILL rule the world *snicker* <br/>
