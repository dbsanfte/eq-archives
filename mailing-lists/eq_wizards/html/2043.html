<div id="ygrps-yiv-1491812624">Well i was just thinking about a spell.  The good ole D&D silence spell.  I <br/>
figure spells have the same concept here at EQ.  ie: you have to say <br/>
something for the spell to work.  It could be a wizard only spell.  It would <br/>
most likely help in the duel aspect but could be used on those high powerd <br/>
npc mages.  Oh well just bored and the thought ran through my mind.<br/>
