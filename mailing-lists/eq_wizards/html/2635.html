<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434404479">Silverion, you are a higher lvl wizard than I am, and you&#39;ve made some<br/>
very interesting and helpful posts in the pasts--all this to say that I<br/>
intend no disrespect with the following.  I just thought I&#39;d reply to<br/>
your points, some of which I disagree with.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 1.)     Many people hate wizards as kill stealers and think they are too<br/>
&gt; powerful with their fast transport by teleport so they don&#39;t have to be<br/>
 </span></blockquote>buffed<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; any more ! (WRONG)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agreed with you on everything you said in this section, except that<br/>
wizards die the most.  I&#39;ve spent the last two weeks in Lake Rathtear going<br/>
from about 18 to 23.  I died, I believe, twice--once when everyone was<br/>
shouting for me to run.  (I wanted just one more shot &lt;hehe&gt;)  And, in<br/>
general, I don&#39;t die that often.  I&#39;m very careful, I tend to use landscape,<br/>
distance, and timing to my advantage, I run when resisted twice (or root and<br/>
run) when soloing, and try to group.<br/>
<br/>
Now wizards can die a lot, and that depends on where they are, what they<br/>
fight, etc.  I have a couple of friends over in Najena and they love it and<br/>
have gotten used to retrieving corpse once or twice nightly.  But, at the<br/>
same time, they tend to earn xp at a faster rate than I do because of the<br/>
mobs they take.  I think, to a degree, it balances.  With respect to Aviaks,<br/>
I&#39;ve found they can be very tough to solo.  Depending on which ones you&#39;re<br/>
fighting, they get multiple attacks, hit hard, and if it wasn&#39;t for the xp,<br/>
we probably wouldn&#39;t go after them.  They are not well suited for<br/>
wizards--similar to gorge minotaurs, I believe.  Even when green they can be<br/>
quite dangerous.  But plop us next to an embalmer, a high shaman, an evil<br/>
eye, etc., and we shine.  A lot has been said on this list about carefully<br/>
picking mobs when soloing, and I agree.  And when grouping, this isn&#39;t an<br/>
issue.<br/>
<br/>
As to your kill stealing points, I think you are absolutely correct.  Anyone<br/>
that plays that game is not seeing the large picture (unless they&#39;re in it<br/>
for the RP element, I suppose, and want to be hated and vilified).  And it&#39;s<br/>
not like they&#39;re earning xp at a greater rate, or loot either.  I can still<br/>
power game a level a day, if I want, by grouping.  I can earn 30 to 40 plat<br/>
in an evening easily, and I&#39;m not making any enemies--just friends.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2.)     mana inefficient use !<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry, but you haven&#39;t convinced me of anything here.  Yes we get<br/>
resisted a lot.  And like others have said, I&#39;ve noticed that when you cast<br/>
a spell in a fight makes a huge difference on its chance of being resisted.<br/>
End fights with the big blast, don&#39;t begin them that way, etc.  I think<br/>
where wizards have the hardest time is getting used to the shame of running.<br/>
If a mob resists two of your blasts, even if it&#39;s green, consider running.<br/>
Root, then run.  Annoying?  Heck yeah.  But we should almost never die while<br/>
soloing, and when our resists don&#39;t fail we can take down a mob faster than<br/>
anything.  I&#39;ve paired (ungrouped) with many spell casters and done damage<br/>
comparisons, etc.  Magicians and enchanters run much less often, but they<br/>
divide xp with pet.  They *should* run less often; they&#39;re not really<br/>
soloing.  Same with necros.  Want to see what happens when a magician or<br/>
enchanter truly solos?  It&#39;s a joke.  Ever see a magician try to get off a<br/>
DD spell when a mob is hitting him?  Heh.  Heh Heh.<br/>
<br/>
Even though we run a lot, we don&#39;t split the xp with a pet.  I&#39;ve matched<br/>
other spell casting classes on xp earning rate hour after hour.<br/>
<br/>
Now the obvious rebuttal is the ole, &quot;well, when I was in (location X),<br/>
(class Y) was performing much better than I was.&quot;  Very very true.  I&#39;m sure<br/>
some of you have seen mid to high teen druids soloing in Crushbone, or out<br/>
in N. Karanas kiting, etc.  We all know that some classes have leveling<br/>
sweet spots (the druids appear to be lvl 1 to at least 20 &lt;grin&gt;).  Such as<br/>
the 16th lvl necros, and the sand giant slaying that has been common in<br/>
Oasis (don&#39;t know if it still happens).  I&#39;m only lvl 23, but I&#39;ve noticed<br/>
that *most* of the people I know who I started out with, regardless of<br/>
class, are still in my level range.  It seems to me that even if wizards<br/>
aren&#39;t especially great at leveling, we aren&#39;t particularly bad off.  There<br/>
is another way to look at this, but I&#39;ll get to that momentarily.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3.)     Resistance of high lvl mobs BUT also low lv ones<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Resistance of low level mobs is annoying, but something which I&#39;ve heard<br/>
other classes complain of as well.  In my case, it doesn&#39;t happen that often<br/>
(don&#39;t know if it is affected by caster stats), but I don&#39;t see this as an<br/>
especially big problem.  The wizard just has to have an escape route<br/>
planned, or know how to get help.<br/>
<br/>
What really hurts is the resistance of high level mobs.  I&#39;ve found my<br/>
personal solution, but I guarantee most of you aren&#39;t going to like it.<br/>
<br/>
I try and group only when I can be within a lvl or two of top player.  Yes<br/>
this restricts who I group with, but not as much as one might think.  And I<br/>
can always, always, always hit the mob because groups in their right mind<br/>
don&#39;t take mobs 4 or 5 levels higher than their highest player [I should<br/>
probably qualify this by saying &quot;sometimes,&quot; &quot;almost never,&quot; etc., but I<br/>
think you get the gist of what I&#39;m saying].  I switch to lower damage spells<br/>
to play the resist odds and not attract the mobs attention, and I always<br/>
account for my share of the damage (usually 100 to 200 pts damage per mob).<br/>
This means, of course, that I won&#39;t be going into High Keep or deep into<br/>
Najena for a while, because I couldn&#39;t do that without joining a much higher<br/>
level group.  Restrictive?  Yes.  But Najena, High Keep and Permafrost<br/>
aren&#39;t going anywhere.  I just reset my mentality to visit them 2 to 3<br/>
levels later than most classes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Couple of last points to Silverion&#39;s post:<br/>
<br/>
There are several weaknesses to the wizard class.  I grant that.  But I<br/>
think the bottom line that Verant is looking at is the overall leveling rate<br/>
(from level one all the way to level 50).  If, after a few months, it looks<br/>
like wizards aren&#39;t getting to the top at the same rate as other classes,<br/>
I&#39;m guessing they&#39;ll do something.  But really, I&#39;ll expect modification to<br/>
be more in the nature of toning other classes down, not enhancing ours.<br/>
Why?  Because I think they have a feel for how difficult they want the game<br/>
to be, and the difficulty we experience is the desired amount.<br/>
<br/>
I have one other comment.  I think it is a bit easy to get caught up in the<br/>
whole fairness issue, which is very artificial.  After I take my wizard as<br/>
high as I want, I&#39;ll start another class and play it until I get bored, and<br/>
then start a third.  Some classes will be easier than others, and I&#39;ll get<br/>
around to them sooner or later.  I personally have no desire to see Verant<br/>
spending all of their time trying to make things perfectly balanced for all<br/>
classes.  [I wouldn&#39;t even mind if the game were set up like rock, paper,<br/>
scissors--i.e. in dueling (just pulling names from thin air) Wizards of a<br/>
certain level are always better than Warriors, who are always better than<br/>
Bards who are always better than Wizards.]<br/>
