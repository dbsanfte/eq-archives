&gt; I&#39;m a level 21 wizard who needs +int items. I have +2 rings and a BiM, but<br/>
&gt; have not tried to get any other items or do any quests for I think I&#39;m too<br/>
&gt; low a level. If someone could please tell me when I can get some +int items<br/>
&gt; and from where, or what quests I could do at my level I&#39;d be greatful.<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt; Lott.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.S. I know about Cubert and the Stein of Mogok, but at the present time I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not able to do these since I&#39;m an evil race on a PvP teams server.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Head to Qeynos, and talk to the guy by the bridge on the way to the bank.  He<br/>
can clue you in to a quest that will yield +3 earings.  These earings are also<br/>
dropped as loot in Paw/Lake Rathe (I think, I never obtained a pair that way<br/>
myself)  You can also have a jeweler whip you up some good stuff.  Just do a<br/>
/who Enchanter 34 all, and start sending tells.  You can also camp Pyzgin in<br/>
Qeynos hills for a stone (+9) but that may take some time.  Finally, the stien<br/>
of Mogguk sells for around 400pp, if you have the cash.  Or you can kill king<br/>
Tranix :) but thats another story<br/>
