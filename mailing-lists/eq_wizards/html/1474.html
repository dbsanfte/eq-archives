<br/>
As a fellow seeker of knowledge I have travelled the land from Faydwer to<br/>
Odus, crossing the breadth of Antonica on foot.  I noticed some information<br/>
in your tome that I can expand on to add to our knowledge.  Mostly I will<br/>
add information on the different color robes that can be purchased.  It is<br/>
interesting to note the Erudin does things differently when it comes to<br/>
Robes.  In all other cities, there is only 1 color of Jr. and Sr. apprentice<br/>
robe sold and they can be worn by all magic using classes.  In Erudin<br/>
however there are 3 different color robes that are sold and each one can<br/>
only worn by 1 of the magic using classes (enchanter, magician, and wizard).<br/>
I will detail this information below.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Items                   Info/Location<br/>
&gt;----------------------	--------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt;Blue Robe               Erudin, Qeynos<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are 2 types of blue robes, light blue and dark blue.  The light blue<br/>
(jr. and sr. apprentice) are found in Qeynos and can by worn by all magic<br/>
users, while the dark blue (jr. and sr. apprentice) are found in Erudin and<br/>
are Magician ONLY.  Also I think that only medium sized classes can wear<br/>
both of these robes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Red Robe                Erudin<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The red robe is Wizard ONLY, and I think only medium sided classes can wear<br/>
them (sorry gnomes).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Violet Robe             Freeport<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again I believe this is for medium sized classes only.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Yellow Robe             Ak&#39;anon (Though I think only gnomes can ware them).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes only gnomes can wear.  I confirmed this.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Senior Apprentice Robe  +1 mana only no extra regeneration/+? AC<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Armor class value on Sr. robes are 6.  Also, the Erudite robes are better<br/>
than the others as far as I have seen.  The red robe I purchased is +2mana<br/>
6ac rather than the +1mana 6ac green robe I was previously using.  The other<br/>
robes I checked in Erudin had the same +2mana value as well.<br/>
<br/>
Those are my corrections/modifications, and now for some additions:<br/>
<br/>
Junior Apprentice Robe - 4 AC<br/>
Gold Robe (jr. and sr.) - Erudin (this robe is Enchanter ONLY and can only<br/>
be worn by medium classes)</div>
