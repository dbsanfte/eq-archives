<b>Subject:</b> ARG!  Don&#39;t reply to the whole digest... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623658342">Because it ends up quoting the entire digest and sending it out again,<br/>
making it very difficult to wade through all the information and find what<br/>
people said.<br/>
<br/>
I know some people didn&#39;t like the idea of a message board, but I still<br/>
think its a pretty good idea.  Either that or a newsgroup with message<br/>
threading.<br/>
