<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271893825">Dear friends from EQ.<br/>
<br/>
I wish to divide with you my opinion on languages and how to enchant<br/>
everquest using it better.<br/>
<br/>
Already in game is included languages, we have Troll, dark elf, halfling,<br/>
elf and some secret languages. But what is use of this very important<br/>
feature in game? <br/>
<br/>
Nearly nonexistent unfortunatly only some magic users use it for reading<br/>
some lost magic books in long lost languages and nothing more. <br/>
<br/>
In all citys merchants speak common, people in remonte huts talk common,<br/>
trolls talk common, elfs a nobile and arrogant race talk common you can go<br/>
in every city and every place and all shop vendors speak common ALL PLAYERS<br/>
talk perfect common also. So all other languages are nearly never used !!<br/>
Why to waste this valuable resurce ? <br/>
<br/>
What we can do,  as now in Verant they have under work a new race war<br/>
server it will be nice to include this option in new code and enchant this<br/>
interesting new idea!<br/>
<br/>
My points to change<br/>
<br/>
1.) I think that some MAX knowelege based on inteligence and wisdom for any<br/>
language can be imposted so that you can learn max awaful in dragon if you<br/>
have inteligence under 60. It is very strange to have a Troll wich speak<br/>
fluent and with melodic elf language or read a long lost book writen in<br/>
combine language.<br/>
<br/>
2.) all city vendors speak a local language and some rare speak also common<br/>
in some degre. In some citys arogant high elfs can speak only their<br/>
languages and will not hear any of  beast races languages. <br/>
<br/>
3.) All players start with a race language based on total inteligence and<br/>
wisdom and common in some degre but not at maximum. On base of class i will<br/>
add some rare aditional languages but only for casters some base of<br/>
languages at wich are writen a basic spell books.<br/>
<br/>
4.) all aditional lv of spells can be only writen if you have enough<br/>
knowelege in language on wich a scroll is writen. This can create a<br/>
traduction skills to translate spells from one language to another and so<br/>
on. Some paterns instructions can be in a specific language.<br/>
<br/>
5.) In spell research you must have a tome with instruction in one hand and<br/>
a combine book in another and to create new spell is checked not only your<br/>
skill but also a language knowelege for language in wich is writen a book.<br/>
<br/>
6.) Npc will nor reply on your questions or trade with you if you dont know<br/>
a language enough<br/>
<br/>
This are only some of possible uses of languages and there are many more im<br/>
shure that some can be easily implemented right from start and others will<br/>
require much work and maybe will not enter in game untio a everquest 2 but<br/>
i think that here is hiden posibility to make a new profondity to this<br/>
great game .<br/>
