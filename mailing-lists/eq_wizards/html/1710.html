<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176578362">Hmm...I&#39;m kinda divided.  I too have a lot of friends that I used to party <br/>
with.  They eventually left me behind in levels as typical of my <br/>
Wizardry...but every now and again, they DO help me find items that might <br/>
help my cause. (ie. Savant&#39;s cap).  I find no problem with this.  Yes, it <br/>
benefits me of course!  :)  But on the other hand, this is not so much <br/>
different from real life where you need the help of friends to get ahead.  <br/>
It&#39;s all part of being social and working with the people you meet online.<br/>
<br/>
But other posts here have convinced me that &quot;twinking&quot; is not all that good <br/>
either.  If a 1st Lvl Wizard uses his Observer Robes and RTS to an unfair <br/>
advantage over other 1st level users by stealing kills and such, I CAN see <br/>
how this will ruin the experience for others.  Should this be banned?  I <br/>
don&#39;t think this can or should be policed.  I&#39;d rather have the Verant team <br/>
working on other things to improve the game.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can do is to foster an environment that discourages <br/>
playing in this fashion.  Ban these players from getting <br/>
buffs/binds/guilds/etc. ?   If I&#39;m in a situation like this where I don&#39;t <br/>
get help from anybody...I&#39;ll give it up pretty fast!  ;)<br/>

&gt;Well who is really to say what is considered twinking . . .  I think we<br/>
&gt;should just play the game and let people do whatever.    I would rather<br/>
&gt;discuss spells and stuff in this list than people getting mad cus JOE <br/>
&gt;FRIDAY<br/>
&gt;has full plate or whatever.  I don&#39;t really like twinking but it happens <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;to BAN it seems weird kinda strict.   There are too many scenerios.  I mean<br/>
 </span></blockquote>there is this friend of mine in real life and he plays more than I do and is<br/>
higher lvl and he gave me a cool Savant Cap and I like it.  So should I be<br/>
banned?   Dunno, but I&#39;d rather talk about cool &quot;in-game&quot; stuff . . .<br/>
