&gt; Dear Gregory,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You hit he nail on the head, how many times have we seen a /shout for a<br/>
&gt; wizard..never. Verant need to do something about the mages, enchanters and<br/>
&gt; wizards. I think Ken has a point, combine the lot into one. When<br/>
&gt; Verant split<br/>
&gt; them it sounded a great idea, I thought it was at the time too. But, the<br/>
&gt; reality is quite different, unfortunately.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; I was attracted to playing a wizard by the way the class was<br/>
&gt; described in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the game&#39;s manual, but if I had to do it over again (and I<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t because I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have already put a lot of time into my character, and want to<br/>
&gt; play with my<br/>
&gt; &gt; friends who are of the same level as I), I would pick a druid or shaman<br/>
&gt; &gt; type character. They have great spells, which can also be cast on other<br/>
&gt; &gt; party members, and aren&#39;t so weak in weapons and AC as wizards<br/>
&gt; are. I hate<br/>
&gt; &gt; it when I tell my friends about the spells I can get, only to<br/>
&gt; find out they<br/>
&gt; &gt; can be cast only on myself (shielding, resistant skin, etc.) My ranger<br/>
&gt; &gt; friend casts Skin like Wood on my all the time, I have nothing to<br/>
&gt; &gt; reciprocate. I think wizards as a class are short changed, and<br/>
&gt; have never<br/>
&gt; &gt; seen anyone do a /shout looking for a wizard to join with them<br/>
&gt; as they do<br/>
&gt; &gt; for rangers, shamans, bards, etc. Just my 2 cents.<br/>
