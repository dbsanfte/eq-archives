<div id="ygrps-yiv-1874751456">Unfortunately I am not playing on Solusek Ro.<br/>
If anyone wants I propose that we set this up for all shards at this time<br/>
I will come to this same location on Fennin Ro at the same time. that is<br/>
listed below.  I&#39;d be happy to give anyone that needs them the languages I<br/>
have acquired.  Hopefully someone will have some that I do not already have.<br/>
<br/>
Someone actually wanted to charge me 100 plat to get me excelent in Old<br/>
Erudin.  So far Zero plat investment and I am up to Good, excelent in 11<br/>
others, average in Elder Elvish, and the basics in 9 more.<br/>
<br/>
I await a response.<br/>

&gt;Okay. The best place seems to be the large open area in the tunnel from<br/>
&gt;Ecommons to North Ro. So<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Date: Saturday May 22nd<br/>
&gt;Time: 2 pm EST<br/>
&gt;Place: Open part of the Tunnel in East Commons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bring, yourself and anyone else who knows any languages. Evil races welcome.<br/>
&gt;We&#39;re here for knowledge. If you don&#39;t want to know T&#39;ier Dal, don&#39;t listen.<br/>
&gt;: )<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We&#39;ll be forming up in groups depending on how many people are there, I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;found that setting up a hotkey to<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;/g I&#39;m speaking another language, understand?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;works the best. You can click the mouse faster than hitting the keyboard,<br/>
&gt;and it&#39;s not as tiring.<br/>
&gt;Anyone think I should email the new sites to post up about the meeting?<br/>
