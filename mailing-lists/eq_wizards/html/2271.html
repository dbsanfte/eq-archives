<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048671038">I am a lv 18 wiz that has had very good success soloing and grouping. I have <br/>
no complants about how a spell works or how much damage it does or how <br/>
unfair something is. I enjoy the game and have found that most every <br/>
character type has it&#39;s own flaws. A particular spell may not work as you <br/>
like it to but remember that if we got everything we wanted we would only <br/>
want more and bigger.<br/>
As for those of you who KS it is your choise and you&#39;ll regret it latter. <br/>
I&#39;ve met many KS&#39;s and while at lower lv&#39;s it is good and everything latter <br/>
on when you need a little help or want to group your life will be miserable. <br/>
I know so because I&#39;ve made KS&#39;s lives miserable by refusing to work with <br/>
them and the shouting so that all know what he is like. While there is a few <br/>
that will group with them on the whole I&#39;ve seen very few people who do <br/>
group with him. Usually he is alone and miserable. That my bit and so so<br/>
<br/>
