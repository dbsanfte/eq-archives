<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318846459">These are very good ideas - I like them a lot.  Instead of Haste though,<br/>
I&#39;d like to see Shadowstep become a Line-of-sight teleport spell (as<br/>
someone on the list suggested earlier), and use that as our<br/>
travelling/exploring spell.  SoW by any other name is still SoW.<br/>
