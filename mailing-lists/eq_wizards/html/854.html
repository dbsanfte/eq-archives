<b>Subject:</b> just exactly how much mana... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121744649">Ok y&#39;all, the thing i cannot understand is how Verant overlooked the fact<br/>
that there is no numerical representative number for amount of mana.   I<br/>
mean, in battle a fighter can always look at his HP status, but in 12 levels<br/>
of play my int is still the same and im SURE i have been getting a higher<br/>
mana limit each level, but how much???<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know the formula used to calculate mana points?<br/>
I would like to see a meter like MP/MP just like the HP/HP bar that all<br/>
classes have.<br/>
<br/>
Since nooen else seems to be really bitching about this i will assume that<br/>
the answer is right in front of my face and i just cannot see it.<br/>
Help...anyone?</div>
