<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-726442226">Hm, maybe some people are craving more power. Mostly I think, we are<br/>
trying to resolve perceived ( being the operative word ) imbalances. I<br/>
for one want a certain amount of challenge and do not care to be able to<br/>
instantly kill everything. But I think some of the concerns that people<br/>
are bringing up are valid, and do not fall into the &quot;jafaarism&quot; category<br/>
( Aladdin reference ).<br/>
<br/>
For instance, when we are in a group fighting high-level creatures, we<br/>
are mostly useless because we cannot blast. The purpose of grouping is<br/>
to take on high-level creatures and we want to be able to affect the<br/>
battle to some degree. I actually hear magicians complaining (at the 30<br/>
level range) about the same sort of thing. Instead they complain that<br/>
their pet is too low level and doesn&#39;t do enough damage. What they<br/>
forget is that it does do some damage, lasts for the next battle, and<br/>
they can do stuff between battles (summon, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Another complaint is that we are not a unique class. Whereas the other<br/>
classes all have something that sets them apart, we are just a<br/>
particularly strong magician without a pet and a teleporting druid to a<br/>
lesser degree. Some argue that we can cast spells faster than magicians<br/>
( 1 second to be exact ) but this doesn&#39;t help us at all, especially in<br/>
a group. We have to space our blasting out anyway to avoid getting<br/>
tagged. So that extra second doesn&#39;t help as we wait in between blasts<br/>
anyway. For soloing it may help, but this is a group game, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
Some people say that we are balanced because we can do the most amount<br/>
of damage in the least amount of time. There are few cases where this is<br/>
useful. In soloing it is useful of course. In a group it is only useful<br/>
if we don&#39;t play smart. In other words if we wait too long to blast and<br/>
a tank is getting hurt then we may want to blast*blast*blast in rapid<br/>
succession to save him. So magicians do that 3 seconds slower and do 60<br/>
less damage from that...but that is still impressive! And don&#39;t get me<br/>
started on the fact that we are wanted in a group because then no one<br/>
else will steal their kills. Bah! I, frankly, don&#39;t like having to fight<br/>
over kills and would just as soon go somewhere else if a place is<br/>
crowded. There&#39;s nothing to pull me out of the game than to have 10<br/>
people blasting away at a creature to eke out the little bit of<br/>
experience that it provides. And the shouting match and &quot;accidental&quot;<br/>
trains that follow are not fun.<br/>
<br/>
In a balanced game, all magic-using classes would be desired members of<br/>
a group. From what I hear, wizards are losing their air of mystery and<br/>
power that presided when the game was just beginning. Now people are<br/>
realizing that we can&#39;t help them when it counts, when the party is<br/>
risking life and limb to kill a creature that would wipe the floor with<br/>
us individually. A creature that maybe came out of nowhere to attack our<br/>
brave lurer as he sprints back to the party. No instead, we yell<br/>
&quot;RESISTED&quot;, people run, people die, and we stand hapless as the people<br/>
who entrusted their lives to us are struck down like so many newbies in<br/>
a field of griffins. What are we going to do? Melee it? Stand there when<br/>
the tank falls and die as well out of principle? Gate out and face the<br/>
unasked question, &quot;What happened to all for one and one for all&quot;??<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we&#39;re supposed to be useless against high-level monsters? Maybe<br/>
we&#39;re supposed to be high-level buses. &quot;/shout NEXT STOP: ECommons! Come<br/>
on? No one wants to teleport from North Ro to East Commons? Anyone?&quot;<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s part of our &quot;balance&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to be all-powerful, I mean I do, but not more than any<br/>
other class. I think it&#39;s important that we voice this in our petition.<br/>
That we are not grubbing for more power, but maybe just a little<br/>
respect. So we can solo a giant at level 49? He&#39;d be green then so it<br/>
would be pointless...<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t see why everyone keeps wanting more wizard spells, increase wizards<br/>
&gt; spell power, wizards need more of this and that.  Wizards are a VERY balanced<br/>
&gt; class, verant has admitted this and I have seen it.  Wizards are meant to be<br/>
&gt; weak at low levels, they are meant to not be able to solo large groups of<br/>
&gt; monster and like every other class at upper levels they are meant to be in a<br/>
&gt; group.  All of the suggestions I have seen to increase wizard spells, give us<br/>
&gt; a familiar, etc etc, all seem attempts to just give the wizard class that we<br/>
&gt; &quot;like&quot; more power.  I have played every class to at least level 16 and the<br/>
&gt; wizard is by far the most balanced.  If you want to be able to fight large<br/>
&gt; amounts of blue monsters play a shadow knight, paladin or warrior.  If you<br/>
&gt; want a pet then play a necro or magician.  There is no class that can have it<br/>
&gt; all and it is my opinion that when wizards voice their opinions for more of<br/>
&gt; this and that then all they are wanting is more power.  I truely think that<br/>
&gt; these people will never be satisfied until with one spell they can kill<br/>
&gt; anything, with one spell they can go to any zone or plane they wish, with one<br/>
&gt; spell they can destory 6 fire giants etc etc.  A wizard CAN solo and he/she<br/>
&gt; has one of the safest positions in a well ordered party.  A wise wizard will<br/>
&gt; always have emergency mana for a final blast or gate, no tank gets that.<br/>
&gt; Remember its always the tanks that die first.  This response is at no one in<br/>
&gt; particular, just voiceing my opinon.  Bottom line is that I think if we are<br/>
&gt; going to petition verant for things then petition to have more quests added,<br/>
&gt; more dynamic GM involvement, fix broken quests and give us more history of<br/>
&gt; the world.<br/>
