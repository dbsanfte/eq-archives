     Why does everyone keep telling me &quot;come to server blah blah and see how<br/>
your tricks works&quot; .  I am on Tunare server and i&#39;m gona stay here and KS as<br/>
long as i think its giving me more XP than doing  something else.  Anyways,<br/>
ppl<br/>
on every server are just humans, some are stupid, some are smart.  Some ppl<br/>
can&#39;t do dick all about me KS their kills and some will take action.  So it<br/>
doesn&#39;t depend on which server you play on, you can always KS.  On Tunare,<br/>
not a<br/>
lot of KSer out there, i&#39;ve only met 2 others who also KS on a regular<br/>
basis, so<br/>
its pretty rare too.  The more rare it is, the better actually, cuz most ppl<br/>
don&#39;t know how to deal with it instead of just crying how i&#39;m taking all the<br/>
xp<br/>
and challenge me to duals hahaha.<br/>
