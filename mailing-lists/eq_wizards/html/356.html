<div id="ygrps-yiv-540654204">Unrest...Be smart about where you stand and what you look to kill.<br/>
<br/>
Stand along the walls when you first enter.  Make sure you turn on SHOUTs.<br/>
People will almost always announce their trains...as should you if you form<br/>
one (mention what high level creature is in your train too...this way<br/>
someone may help you dispell it).<br/>
<br/>
Next hang out by the wall close to the fountains...either side.  Look for<br/>
death beetles.  These should con yellow to your level 10 friends.  They hit<br/>
hard sometimes but are excellent XP givers.  Also Tormented Dead and Gtr<br/>
Skeletons are good to find and kill...oh yeah..look for the Jack O&#39;<br/>
Lantirns.  All these should be fine.  Remember to take your time and rest up<br/>
your clerics and mages for the next fights.  You should be able to handle<br/>
two mobs at a time, but prefer you take one at a time.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Use overwhelming force to smie your enemy in the least amount of time&quot;<br/>
&quot;Expose yourself to danger for least amount of time&quot;<br/>

Well, on someone&#39;s advice, forget whom it was, but I made the trip to<br/>
Kaladim to plumb the depths of Unrest. I&#39;m 14th level and just coming into<br/>
my power right now. Right now the rest of the people in my group are between<br/>
3-5 levels below me. So I figure I&#39;ll just solo and get xps slower, but also<br/>
not hinder their progress either. Where should I go? I&#39;ve gone to the<br/>
chessboard and killed pawns, bishops and their annoying pets, as well as the<br/>
odd King that shows up. A dwarven friend of mine was telling me how his 6<br/>
member lvl 10 party was completely wiped out in Unrest down to the last man.<br/>
I made the following conclusions:<br/>
<br/>
a. Unrest is nasty<br/>
b. My dwarven friend&#39;s party is stupid for not running from something they<br/>
can&#39;t win<br/>
<br/>
I can admire going out gloriously next to your comrade, but not when death<br/>
isn&#39;t permanent.<br/>
<br/>
So, question, if I take my group into unrest what should I be looking to<br/>
kill? Is there somwhere else that is nearby that I should go instead? My<br/>
dwarf friend said to hit the steamfonts, suggestions?<br/>
