<br/>
&quot;You are not experienced enough to put on this ring&quot;<br/>
<br/>
or would it be:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Other adventurers would be jealous if you had this, so you better not<br/>
wear it&quot;<br/>
<br/>
or better yet:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You have been twinked. Please report to the nearest Big Brother station<br/>
to have your gear stripped from you and burned. Have a nice day.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then people couldn&#39;t win cool stuff in contests, win the lottery and buy<br/>
a neat high level weapon, duel a higher level character and grab some<br/>
cool booty. THAT would make the game no fun because isn&#39;t that what we<br/>
are about? To have fun? Or have I missed something?<br/>

&gt; Okay I have to comment, I have been Idle too long....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If they had put in the mud&#39;s little trick of level based equip then there<br/>
&gt; would never be any twinking...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; IE you cant put on that +25 mana ring till your 20th level....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; simple and perfect... problem solved...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ps this has been in muds for DECADES (no I&#39;m not exagerating this)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
