<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462683476">Heheh. I&#39;m still here...although my computer monitor at home blew up on me <br/>
so I&#39;ve been in virtual EQ blackout for a couple weeks now.  *sob*  So tell <br/>
me some of your adventures folks...so I can feel like I&#39;m still playing. :)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s another thing I&#39;ve been wondering too before I was rudely cut from my <br/>
EQ addiction...where are other areas you&#39;d recommend for a 23-25level <br/>
Wizard?  I&#39;ve been drifting between Najena and SKaranas for a while now and <br/>
I&#39;m getting bored.  Unrest is hopeless for me because the lag is <br/>
intolerable.  I heard Cazic is good, but it seems we&#39;re relatively unwanted <br/>
there till we are about level 27+ or so.  Any advice?<br/>
