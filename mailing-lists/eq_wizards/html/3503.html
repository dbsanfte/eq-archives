account...specificly the antispam policy.wonder if these guys are as good<br/>
as all advantage about canceling<br/>
accounts of folks who spam people....<br/>

                 NO SPAM; DAMAGES<br/>
                 GetPaid4 reserves the right to terminate any account<br/>
                 which it believes, in its sole discretion, is transmitting<br/>
                 or is otherwise responsible for any spam or other<br/>
                 unsolicited bulk e-mail, including, but not limited to,<br/>
                 instant messages, chatrooms, newsgroups, ICQ and<br/>
                 IRC. Any account which is terminated for violating<br/>
                 this provision of the terms of use will not be paid for<br/>
                 any amounts due at the time of termination or<br/>
                 thereafter and may not be allowed to participate in<br/>
                 the Service or any other future GetPaid4 online<br/>
                 community. In addition, because damages are often<br/>
                 difficult to quantify, if actual damages cannot be<br/>
                 reasonably calculated then you agree to pay<br/>
                 GetPaid4 liquidated damages of five dollars ($5.00<br/>
                 U.S.D.) for each piece of spam or unsolicited bulk<br/>
                 e-mail transmitted from or otherwise connected with<br/>
                 your account, otherwise you agree to pay GetPaid4&#39;s<br/>
                 actual damages, to the extent such actual damages<br/>
                 can be reasonably calculated.<br/>
