<div id="ygrps-yiv-1407749678">I wouldn&#39;t worry about that just as yet. You won&#39;t start getting the ability<br/>
to &#39;create&#39; spells till level 16, and the ones that you can create are I<br/>
believe are over 20th lvl. Unless you&#39;re a complete hardcore EQ player, and<br/>
have the ability to spend over 8 hours a day playing, you&#39;re not going to<br/>
hit 16th+ in less than 2 weeks. I&#39;ve been playing for a month and I&#39;m just<br/>
hitting 16 now.<br/>
