<div id="ygrps-yiv-688433167">I just started a new caracter in freeport, as i go to newbee area i see all<br/>
around me killing snakes and bats was people with full banded mail all lv 1<br/>
or 2 i have seen in 6 hours more then 10 full armored people. And i dont<br/>
have any problem about it! <br/>
If they transfered items from their high lv caracters or if guild give it<br/>
to them its ok for me i go around killing my bats and snakes and they do it<br/>
in same way without skills they must work much things a same way as you do<br/>
a little bit easier but they alredy worked for it.<br/>
I played a long time a everquest creating some middle lv caracter and i<br/>
know  how dificult it is to start it all over if you have find that your<br/>
caracter is not what you wish and you decite to start new class.<br/>
Im shure that a people wich complain are ones wich have enugh money and<br/>
free time to play as long as they wish, ohers wich cannot support to pay a<br/>
10 $ a month and 1 $ a hour (as connection rates to internet go in europe)<br/>
i aprove fully to transfer their items to new started caracter. If this is<br/>
possible to do in game then its ok to do if you wish to pay 100 $ a month<br/>
so that you can have a payed gm controling every transaction in game then<br/>
its ok for you send email to Sony saying that you are ready to pay 100 $ a<br/>
month to play a game where every move will be GM controled so wou can be<br/>
shure that every caracter is not twinked ;-), They willl accept this idea<br/>
gladly as soon they start reciving your bucks.<br/>
<br/>
About guild camping im strongly against it i support idea that if person<br/>
wich killes a monster is more then 5 lv higher then loot will be only<br/>
normal one and for special items only a 1/3 of normal chance or not at all<br/>
so higer lv players wishing one item must buy it from a low lv players. it<br/>
will be a nice push to player interaction.<br/>
