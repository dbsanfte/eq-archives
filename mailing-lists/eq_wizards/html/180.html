<div id="ygrps-yiv-337776608">Hahaha.. that&#39;s hillarious.. I&#39;d love to see someone get whipped and go flying.  Though it probably wouldn&#39;t be too funny if it was me :)  Strange that the ogre had a key for you, I&#39;ve killed him a ton of times and I don&#39;t think any of us has ever gotten a key.  Oh well.. perhaps next time.<br/>

    I think tentical-terrors range in the 20+ area, not that sure. Last time I was in Najena I was lvl 12 or so, and having fun but it was hard, we managed to kill the oger guard that held the key tho, which I snagged and now hold onto. One thing to look out for on TT&#39;s is getting whiped backwards, they can actually lift you off the ground and toss you backwards, was rather wied watching a lvl 14 sk that was training them fly around =)</div>
