<div id="ygrps-yiv-685470819">Ah, good information thanks.  I just made my first attempt to create Project <br/>
lightning.  It was a flop.  Pretty depressing after spending all that time <br/>
learning new languages and getting all the elements to have it fail without <br/>
event.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody know how to increase skill at Research?  I know training on it at <br/>
the guildmaster is capped so is the only way to improve it only by trying <br/>
over and over again?  Too bad I can&#39;t just throw all my 70+ training points <br/>
into it...wonder why I&#39;ve been saving it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Well, I made level 16 last night so I decided to try research for the<br/>
&gt;first time.  I had been collecting runes for a while, so I had a &gt;sizable<br/>
&gt;collection in the bank.  Just thought I would share the results.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Project Lightning - I had enough runes to attempt this spell twice.  &gt;The<br/>
&gt;first attempt failed, the second one succeeded!  My first spell!  Ok, &gt;1<br/>
&gt;out of 2 is not bad.<br/>
