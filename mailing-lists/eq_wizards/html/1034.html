	The spells you are looking for may not be around the wizard&#39;s<br/>
section of the Arcane College.  Look at EVERY merchant in the whole<br/>
place....this will mean going up to everyone and right clicking them.  Think<br/>
about it, Shielding (new shield spell available) is available to more than<br/>
just wizards (all mages I think) and you can also use Invisibility (rank 2<br/>
Magician spell).  You will find them there...trust me.  Keep looking on all<br/>
floors and levels.   Also, be sure to buy shieldskin if you plan on soloing<br/>
or want that extra protection from hits.  Then make damn sure you buy about<br/>
10 Cat&#39;s Eye Agate gems from the merchant lady when you first get teleported<br/>
into the guild.<br/>

Hi all,<br/>
i am near level 16 now (very close in fact) and i need to buy some spell. I<br/>
am in freeport now and i have done all the merchant to try to find some<br/>
spel.. At the wizzard guild, there is only let s say 10 wizzard spel and<br/>
early one :( Anyone knows if there is a secret house or something like that<br/>
who is selling attack spel for level 16 ? and does someone knows how to open<br/>
the door located under water in the magical hall in freeport ??? <br/>
<br/>

this book the rune for the spel then hit combine : yeah but can we miss ???<br/>
