&gt;I have successfully made both Piller of fire and project lightning through<br/>
 </span></blockquote>research.  There really wasn&#39;t much to it, put the two *right* runes in the<br/>
Lexicon, hit combine, and get the message, you have successfully fasioned<br/>
these items into something new.  Of course those two spells are worthless,<br/>
but hey; I researched something.<br/>

&gt;Problem is that I have all the useful spells (including alot of useless<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ones) for level 16 and 20, so right now I&#39;m in rune collection mode for 24<br/>
and 29.  I&#39;m also looking for someone to get me above Below average in old<br/>
erudian.  I saw someone auctioning that they will train up to excellent for<br/>
20pp (train 4 others for the more reasonable price for 5pp and I&#39;ll make it<br/>
back), didn&#39;t have enough.  Such is life.<br/>

&gt;For your information you can train up to your level + 1 in research.  You<br/>
 </span></blockquote>start off with 17 points after one training I beleive.  After you level a<br/>
few times you can keep pumping points in there.  I presume with the level<br/>
49 spells you will be failing alot.  <br/>
