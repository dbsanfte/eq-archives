<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-611949282">I have yet to try this, but it just popped into my head reading some of these post and I was wondering if anyone has tried it already.  What about casting the Eye of Zomm, and them casting invis.  It should make the caster invis, but will it also make the eye invis?  If it does, then you should be able to use this combo to actually use the eye to scout.  I agree that we shouldn&#39;t be attacked for sending the eye out, but this might be an existing work around to get some use out of an otherwise almost worthless spell.<br/>
