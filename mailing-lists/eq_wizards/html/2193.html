<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296376653">I had the same problem your having bringing up two handed blunt, i put 14 <br/>
points into it and i was having trouble bringing it up but i started <br/>
fighting in groups and sonce the group was tough enough i didn&#39;t need to <br/>
bomb the monster so i&#39;d join in the fighting with them and slowly but surely <br/>
it started going up and after a couple of points into it it should rise <br/>
pretty easily just be patient with it.<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>

&gt;I was lucky enough recently to acquire a runed totem staff. Unfortunately<br/>
&gt;as I had never used a staff before my skill was at &quot;awful&quot; level. No matter<br/>
&gt;how much I use it I can not seem to get my 2H blunt skill up. And I am<br/>
&gt;fighting blues or higher with it. I poured a bunch of practice points into<br/>
&gt;2H blunt, so now it is at &quot;very bad&quot; level, and I do more damage with it,<br/>
&gt;but still have never gotten a message saying my skill has gone up. I did<br/>
&gt;get a message about my offense skill going up, but that&#39;s it. Is there some<br/>
&gt;trick to this?<br/>
