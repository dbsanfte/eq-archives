<div id="ygrps-yiv-785832172">What about our ae spel ? and pe spel ?? Did someone here use them ????<br/>
NOBODY...<br/>

I use the ae spells all the time in group.  For example, when we are<br/>
fighting, say, orcs, and 3 of them attack our warriors, I use column of<br/>
frost.  It damages all 3 of them quickly.  I was doing that last night, and<br/>
could cast it 3 times quickly in succession without angering any of the<br/>
orcs.  Thats was nearly 100 damage to all THREE with no danger to me.  My<br/>
group was impressed.<br/>
