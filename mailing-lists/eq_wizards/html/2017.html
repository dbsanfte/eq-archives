<div id="ygrps-yiv-656343751">It is important to do big rumor about our petition!<br/>
Im personaly very glad that finaly all of us on this list make one big step<br/>
in right direction so that our voice is also heard. <br/>
<br/>
steps to have any result from our petition are following<br/>
<br/>
a.) send a final text to all major boards (eqvault, eqss etc..)including in<br/>
our group <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:EQ_Wizards@onelist.com">EQ_Wizards@onelist.com</a> and verant email mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:EQmail@...">EQmail@...</a><br/>
i suggest that a person wich corrected my first propost do it as im not so<br/>
god im english<br/>
<br/>
b.) send a final text to alt.games.everquest ( it will be nice if somone<br/>
who is alredy on send it there)<br/>
and also to all other wich can be interested to show it<br/>
<br/>
c.) all persons wich agree to petition send it personaly to verand adding<br/>
at the end of pettition all personal opinions and ideas to improve gameplay<br/>
to cover all diferences what i have seen to exist over final text.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. i have seen one old nice idea wich can be included in petition or<br/>
added as personal opinion <br/>
Its to have a icon on screen as (we have for shield) for root so when root<br/>
is about to end or when it is broken we can have this icon start pulsating<br/>
and so know that we have 2 sec to start casting new root. <br/>

&gt;Fine ! <br/>
&gt;Really send it !<br/>
&gt;But if you want to have some feedback i think we need to send it too !<br/>
&gt;I mean, i can write a letter and said that all wizzard think that.. How can<br/>
&gt;they be sure that all wizzard really think that ? (and not only yourself..).<br/>
&gt;What about the idea that each who agree with you send it to verant ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;yakos<br/>

&gt;Dear EverQuest Staff,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We are a large group of wizards who have come together through a mailing<br/>
&gt;list. Through much discussion and debate, we have agreed to send you<br/>
&gt;this feedback concerning improvements to the wizard. We would like to<br/>
&gt;thank you in advance for your careful consideration of these<br/>
&gt;modifications.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) Spells are 100% resisted by mobs 6+ levels above the caster. In large<br/>
&gt;groups hunting big prey this level cap turns a wizard from the main<br/>
&gt;dealer of damage to a useless member in the group. Our suggestion is<br/>
&gt;that either the cap be raised to 6+ levels of the highest member in the<br/>
&gt;group, or the cap be raised to 8+ levels higher than the caster.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2) Spells that both stun and damage targets are often resisted by mobs<br/>
&gt;that /con green and blue. If this is the result of the stun effect, we<br/>
&gt;would like one spell without this effect at the same level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3) Many spell suggestions have crossed this list. Here is one that we<br/>
&gt;all feel would be a great addition.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Tap Affinity - Teleport targeted group member to their own bind spot<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;4) O&#39;Kiels Radiation seems that it would be the beginning of a great<br/>
&gt;line of spells. Why should it end there? Cold and Magic based<br/>
&gt;buffs/shields would be a very welcome addition.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;5) Wizards seem to be very neglected when it comes to carrying or<br/>
&gt;wearing items that enhance our appearance. Also, many completely<br/>
&gt;different spells have the same visual effects.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We would like to thank you again for your time. Any type of feedback<br/>
&gt;would be greatly appriciated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sincerely,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The Wizards of Norrath<br/>
