<b>Subject:</b> Re: Tishan&#39;s Clash - BONE CRUSHING tactic <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-364181808">Great post i used it tactics when camping a bone crusher in najena he deal<br/>
a fair amount of damage and first two pops he nearly get us killed. Until i<br/>
got on with strategy involving a titan clash. I was in group with a shaman<br/>
but i think this tactic can be used with any orher armored caster.(cleric,<br/>
shaman, druid). <br/>
<br/>
Lets call this a BONE CRUSHING tactic<br/>
<br/>
Armoured caster (AC)cast his strongest offansive spell on BC and start<br/>
fight he have a 81 damage spell and magic staff i casted as soon as he<br/>
start combat one titan clash and stun a BC so he cen get 1 more spell off<br/>
and hack on guy. until this time if no spells are resisted he build cc. 190<br/>
agains my 30 damage heat. Then i cast my lower lv spell 110 damage twice in<br/>
rapid sucesion and i build a heat to 250 against cc. his 210 and BC run to<br/>
me. i waited as he start bashing on me AND I DONT USE ANY WEAPON so to not<br/>
build heat against me and waited to AC to hit it once with his spell and<br/>
bring heat against him to over 250. with one full hit a guy turned and<br/>
runned to AC a tishans clash was ready and i stun it again and after this i<br/>
cast my strongest spell to finish it fast! VICTORY !!! <br/>
<br/>
This tactic was great and we were killing him nearly 7 hours eheeh. We died<br/>
occasionaly too but this was as we pulled in room some dark bones and<br/>
guards and in midle of fight poped necromancers out ..... they made a short<br/>
work of us and our bodyes soon start to march in army of dead but not for long.<br/>

&gt;Good strategy.  I use it in the same way you described.  Also the monsters<br/>
&gt;that can cast spells get harder and harder as you progress in levels.  They<br/>
&gt;can do massive amounts of damage very fast.  With a wiz and another caster<br/>
&gt;with stun in a gruop you can prevent others in your group from getting hit<br/>
&gt;for huge damage.  For example, Drelzna in Najena can harm touch multiple<br/>
&gt;times for 500dmg each.  With correct usage of stuns in a group,  her<br/>
&gt;opportunities to deal damage will be kept to a minimum.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also noticed that you play on Rallos Zek(non carebear server, hehe) as<br/>
&gt;well.  The stuns are invaluable in PVP and dueling.  Without giving too much<br/>
&gt;away i can say this... at higher levels, the stuns will effectively be your<br/>
&gt;root against other players.<br/>

&gt;when solo&#39;ing, tishans clash isn&#39;t very usefull. but when in a group, it is<br/>
&gt;very useful.  for sake of simplicitity, imagine yourself and a pure tank<br/>
&gt;(both of u lvl 25ish) grouped together fighting white and yellow mobs (we&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;use a white mob as the example).  the tank starts the attack, and is getting<br/>
&gt;beat on pretty good.  he&#39;s got a lot of hp and good ac, so he can take it<br/>
&gt;for a period of time.  now, if you start casting force/frost shock or any of<br/>
&gt;your other high dmg spells, the mob&#39;s gonna come for u (and many times it<br/>
&gt;doesnt matter how good the tank can taunt, once he gets on u, he&#39;s usually<br/>
&gt;not gonna get off).  and this means u cant get ur big spells off (cast time<br/>
&gt;too long at higher lvls) and u cant take the beating the mob is giving you<br/>
&gt;once he does get on u (u will end up having to root it).  so, with that<br/>
&gt;said, u shouldnt be casting ur big spells early on in the battle.  so what<br/>
&gt;do u do for the first half of the fight to help the tank?  well, i usually<br/>
&gt;do two things.  melee a bit, although i usually dont do much, if any dmg at<br/>
&gt;all...  and cast ur stun spell :)  what the stun spell does is prevents the<br/>
&gt;tank from getting hit for a cpl of rounds, and also does a little bit of dmg<br/>
&gt;(i think mine does 36 now if im not mistaken).  the stun seems to last a bit<br/>
&gt;longer as i progress in lvls, but i cant confirm that.  it might just be my<br/>
&gt;imagination :)the 36 dmg is definately not enough to make a mob frenzy on u,<br/>
&gt;and the stun can sometimes save the warrior from getting hit 4 to 6 times<br/>
&gt;(which can equate to well over 100 dmg at mid 20&#39;s lvl). so i usually cast<br/>
&gt;this sucker twice, which gives the tank enough time to get the mob down over<br/>
&gt;half, and then i start casting my big spells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;keep in mind, when solo&#39;ing, this spell is virtually useless, but i have it<br/>
&gt;memmed at all times when im grouped.  if anybody else has any usefullness of<br/>
&gt;this spell, please let me know, as i would love to start using it when<br/>
&gt;solo&#39;ing, but just dont see its benefits right now.<br/>

&gt;ps. too bad we dont get another stun spell before lvl 49.  the clerics have<br/>
&gt;a whole line of stun spells :(<br/>

&gt;&gt;I was wondering if anyone could tell me the usefulness of this spell.  It<br/>
&gt;&gt;does about 30 dmg and a 2 second stun.  But for the mana used it seems like<br/>
&gt;&gt;a waste where as you could just do a dd spell instead since the 2 second<br/>
&gt;&gt;stun doesn&#39;t seem to help that much.  Thanks.<br/>
