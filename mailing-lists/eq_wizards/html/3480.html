 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m ambivalent about it.  I like dungeons just as much as outdoors...if you <br/>
know the right spots, dungeons can actually be safer than outdoors once you <br/>
control which mobs aggro on you.<br/>
<br/>
I tried experimenting with killing WC guards last night... they conned blue <br/>
to me at 34, but I still had difficulty soloing them.  My friend convinced <br/>
me that it&#39;s excellent xp.  Anyway, the standard tactic of root, run, and <br/>
nuke was not working very well for me.  A lot of resists and a bunch of <br/>
half-fizzled nukes.  :P  I&#39;m not a very good solo wizzie, I don&#39;t know how <br/>
you solo guys do it. :)  I don&#39;t trust root at all.<br/>
