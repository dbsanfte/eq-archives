    Watch out, I just decided to test a Gnomish Warrior out 1 day(it does<br/>
suck btw :P)<br/>
    Anyways, I saw 2 elves die, there is a Elf KoSer merchant at the VERY<br/>
FRONT of Ak&#39;Anon, there is no way around it, right when U enter the city<br/>
part(after the zone by about 4 steps) you hit a wall, this merchant is right<br/>
by the wall, the only way I see to get in Ak&#39;Anon around this crazy merchant<br/>
is to:<br/>
    1) Have Someone get it for you that is not an ELF(High Elf or Wood Elf,<br/>
not sure about Half-Elves, but I dont believe thise affects them)<br/>
    2) Or, you can get someone to group teleport you in there(you&#39;re prolly<br/>
gonna take number 1, cuz noone can currently group teleport, that I know of<br/>
atleast, eheheh)<br/>
    3) Yes, I know this sux! Its gonna be hard for me, but all I am gonna do<br/>
is make a gnomish character with HIGH charisma and get him some money and<br/>
then buy my spells then transfer it after walking to Kelethin or Felwithe or<br/>
whatnot!<br/>

         Hello fellow Wizards,    A wood elf friend of mine was recently KOS<br/>
immediatly upon entering Akanon by a Merchant. He wasnt able to get the name<br/>
of this npc though. Does anyone know the name of this npc so I can steer<br/>
clear of him. I need to go to Akanon to get my lightning spell soon.<br/>
Another question. Has anyone had sucsess in getting a black robe from neriak<br/>
by having  friend get it and then giving consent to loot his corpse? This<br/>
was discussed here a while ago and was wondering if it was indeed possible<br/>
to do. If robes cannot be traded and/or sold (even ones from najena or the<br/>
thatamurgist) this seems like a serious bug since these robes are valuable<br/>
to us casters but not to others and they would likely want to sell them if<br/>
they(non-casters) got those robes. Any thoughts?</div>
