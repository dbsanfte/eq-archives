<div id="ygrps-yiv-848219223">I disagree.  I think O&#39;Keils radiation is a waste of time when soloing.  The reason is because it only lasts about 15 seconds or so.  If you are in a battle with more than one creature, you&#39;re probably going to die anyway.  Not all the time, but a LOT of the time.  O&#39;Keils might be ok against a lot of creatures.  But it doesn&#39;t do enough damage to kill anything by itself..  So, you&#39;ll die before they do.  (except goblin whelps, etc)  ..and if you&#39;re fighting those still, then you should be trying for one on one fights only.  Wizards are basically looking for one on one fights when solo&#39;ing, so they can time their castings between hits.  O&#39;Keils only does 2 dmg per burn, so at higher levels it is almost useless.  The only way to rack up dmg on these is to cast them repeatedly.  It doesn&#39;t stack, so you&#39;ve got to cast on others.  IE. Tanks.  Verant made the game this way on purpose.  <br/>

&gt; O&#39;Keils Radiation is best used when soloing. It is relatively low in mana<br/>
&gt; cost and if you get attacked by more than one critter it can help turn the<br/>
&gt; battle around. Of course I rarely solo anymore so I don&#39;t memorize it.<br/>

&gt; 		Ok, I know that O&#39;Keills Radiation seems useless.. and in<br/>
&gt; generel it is. However, let me give you an example of how it saved my life,<br/>
&gt; once.  We were hunting in Unrest.. (party of 5 or 6 level 11-14s)..   We&#39;re<br/>
&gt; doing fairly well.. avoiding the really tough ones, etc.. etc..   Our tanks<br/>
&gt; are doing ok too, but only one of us has a magical weapon, and non magicians<br/>
&gt; in the party.  Anyway..  we get attacked by a dark boned skeleton.  This<br/>
&gt; thing was hitting us for HIGH damage, and we almost decided to run from the<br/>
&gt; very start.  The warriors had the thing down to half health, and it resisted<br/>
&gt; almost EVERYTHING I cast at it.  So..  I hit all of our tanks with O&#39;Keils<br/>
&gt; Radiation.  2 dmg here, 2 dmg there..   eventually they started adding up..<br/>
&gt; and the health of the skel started dropping quicker.  I guess what I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; saying is...   if you have 4 people hitting a monster that is resisting your<br/>
&gt; spells... you can use O&#39;Keils radiation on your tanks.. and it WILL get<br/>
&gt; through.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; 		&gt; <br/>
&gt; 		&gt; O&#39;Keills Radation is a damage shield. You cast the spell<br/>
&gt; on yourself or another person, and everytiem the monster does melee damage<br/>
&gt; to them, it reflects back some damage. This spell only does 2 damage and I<br/>
&gt; find it to be useless, the Magi damage shields are MUCH MUCH better. At lvl&gt;<br/>
&gt; �4 it was reflecting 5 damage, compared to mine that only did 2, and I am<br/>
&gt; pretty sure that the higher-lvl ones dish out more. I am not sure if we get<br/>
&gt; any more damage shields tho.<br/>
