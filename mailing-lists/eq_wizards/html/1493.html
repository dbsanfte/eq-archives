<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044783254">Also the other thing to take into consideration when purchasing/using this <br/>
spell is that if you send the eye out to look around you have to be <br/>
prepared for monsters to train to you.  I have not personally experienced <br/>
that happening (because I use it very rarely if at all), but I have heard <br/>
of others who have used it in the dungeons only to pull a bunch of nasties <br/>
out on themselves, and everyone else, in the process.  It is kind of a <br/>
novelty spell, if you ask me, with no real use at this point.  If they made <br/>
the eye an entity that monsters would not train on it would be worthwhile, <br/>
otherwise I would just wait.   Had I known I wouldn&#39;t have purchased it myself.<br/>

&gt; &gt; in Qeynos? I<br/>
&gt; &gt; just want to increase my conjuration skill, which is at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;awful&quot; level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I haven&#39;t purchased this spell, as it seems completely useless except<br/>
&gt;for increasing Conjuration.   My guess is that you will find it in the<br/>
&gt;Guild of mages OR in the Temple of Life.  If not there, take the boat<br/>
&gt;to Erudin, it should be available in the Library or one of the<br/>
&gt;spellcasters&#39; towers.<br/>
