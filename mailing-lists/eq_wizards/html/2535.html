<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116627612">At this time they don&#39;t have any purpose I believe.  You may be able to <br/>
purchase the two and use the quill to write ON the parchment, but it has <br/>
zero to do with spell creation in research at this point.  I haven&#39;t heard <br/>
anything that there would be changes to that in the future, either.<br/>
