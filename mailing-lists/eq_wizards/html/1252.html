<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225415671">I agree.  I like the &quot;eye candy&quot; as well.  It makes the game for me.  If <br/>
you recall ( or maybe not if you didn&#39;t play ) but UO didn&#39;t have anything <br/>
exciting except some dorky noise and when you failed at your spell casting <br/>
it sounded like your guts were backfiring on you.  :)<br/>

&gt;Well everyone knows that ice comet does 1100 damage or so its been said.<br/>
&gt;But what is the most powerful DD spell before ice comet?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And is it only me are there certain spells (3rd circle column of frost comes<br/>
&gt;to mind) that when you cast them there is NO animation for?  When I was a<br/>
&gt;ranger I noticed this with invoke lightning as well.  You would cast and see<br/>
&gt;the monsters get hit for damage yet no animation.  Pretty sucky if you ask<br/>
&gt;me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So far the coolest animation I think we have on any spell throught the 3rd<br/>
&gt;circle is the measly little 1st circle spell, numbing cold.  The ring of<br/>
&gt;frost around the opponents slowly rising up into the air is way cool.  Our<br/>
&gt;rain spells look incredibly gay.  Shock of Lightning looks like a million<br/>
&gt;other spells including shock of blades (magician) and all the cleric spells<br/>
&gt;(strike, furor, smite).  I am big time in favor of seeing more unique<br/>
&gt;animations for spells.  Some might just call it eye candy and who cares, but<br/>
&gt;I think it add a lot to the RP aspects.  Unique looks for spells is what<br/>
&gt;makes them what they are, and what gives the caster that mysterious and<br/>
&gt;powerful air.<br/>
