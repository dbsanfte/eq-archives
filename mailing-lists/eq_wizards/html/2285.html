&gt;      You guys don&#39;t seem to understand why some of us (such as myself) kill<br/>
&gt; steal all the time.  IT IS BECAUSE WE CANNOT FIND GROUPS !!!  simple as that.<br/>
&gt; no groups, KS !  thats it.  I don&#39;t feel like sitting on my ass for 30 - 40 min<br/>
&gt; waiting for ppl to group, while shouting all the time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) people hate us for shouting so much<br/>
&gt; 2) people don&#39;t message us even if they need group member (weird)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      You ppl who are against kill stealers by shouting their names out so no one<br/>
&gt; will group them are so god damn stupid, all you have to do is group with them<br/>
&gt; and BINGO !! no more kill stealing.   If i am getting good xp , why kill steal<br/>
&gt; ??  there is no point for me to risk my life trying to get xp from some monster<br/>
&gt; 6 others are beating up on.  I rarely die in a group since I stand so far back,<br/>
&gt; but while kill stealing if i beat them up too much, the mob might run to me with<br/>
&gt; no one else helping.   If you really want to stop kill stealing, then just group<br/>
&gt; with those people so you guys can take on higher mobs together.   I would<br/>
&gt; happily stop KS anytime during the day to Group with ppl passing by.  I only KS<br/>
&gt; while waiting for groups and i do shout for groups while i KS as well.<br/>
&gt; People are stupid and don&#39;t know how to stop a problem,  oh well... what can you<br/>
&gt; do ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The same can be said as in &quot;If only I got a job I wouldn&#39;t go rob a bank! Just get<br/>
me a job, and BIngo, no more robberies!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But I got no problems with people like you, because I&#39;m a wiz, and if someone DARES<br/>
to KS me I&#39;ll follow them around for a day stealing everything they want to take.<br/>
Including other Wizards. And I also know that you&#39;ll be screwed later. You have no<br/>
idea how easy and fast your reputation goes around.<br/>
