<div id="ygrps-yiv-1454888669">Kill stealing is not the way to make friends for personal or the class as a <br/>
whole.  It might serve the purpose of the person at the time, but rest <br/>
assured, those groups/people you steal kills from WILL remember your name <br/>
and later on down the road when you can&#39;t cast/melee your ass out of a <br/>
tight spot, if those folks are around they will more than likely just sit <br/>
and watch you get the crap beat out of you til you die and laugh their <br/>
heads off.  Sad people think this is okay.  I get more exp working with a <br/>
group of 6 than I do alone by far.  The bonus for a full group helps a lot <br/>
and if you find the right spots (not telling mine), you will get more than <br/>
enough cash and goodies to go around.  We normally have a pile of bodies to <br/>
loot and everyone goes away with their pockets full and their exp bumping <br/>
up nicely...AND a good feeling.<br/>

&gt;I probably will get flamed for this for sure, but who cares.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I made it all the way to lvl 12 as an erudite wizard.   I found that leveling<br/>
&gt;was very slow indeed and it was getting really boring camping with my groups<br/>
&gt;till the sun comes up.   However, i was on a few days ago in the morning <br/>
&gt;and my<br/>
&gt;regular group wasn&#39;t on.  I shouted for about 30 min and no one wanted to join<br/>
&gt;up with me for bandit hunting.  Out of boredom, i went down to the bandit <br/>
&gt;camps<br/>
&gt;to see if i can find a group there(West karanas on top of Hill).  I found this<br/>
&gt;group of 6 there camping the bandits so i just sat around shouting for groups<br/>
&gt;once again. But while those guys were fighting the bandits, i thought, hey <br/>
&gt;might<br/>
&gt;as well try to see if i can kill one solo, if i can&#39;t, then they will probably<br/>
&gt;help me anyways.  I attacked one bandit and killedh im in 3 shots with <br/>
&gt;Shock of<br/>
&gt;Lightning.  and WOW ! so much XP !!!   so i just kept going.  I got around <br/>
&gt;10-15<br/>
&gt;pp in 30 min and gained 1 bubble of xp. normall i gain 1 bubble in 6-8 <br/>
&gt;hours of<br/>
&gt;playing.   FINALLY ! i found how to have fun with my wizard and not be the <br/>
&gt;lamer<br/>
&gt;that spent all his time trying to group and get shitty XP cuz of the split<br/>
&gt;between members !!   who cares if they think i am a kill stealer, its not like<br/>
&gt;they can do anything about it HAHAHA.  too bad for them that they wont group<br/>
&gt;with me.  I also found some wizards are really stupid, the group  of 6 i was<br/>
&gt;stealing from had a lvl 14 wizard and a lvl 11 wizard. and none of them could<br/>
&gt;stop me from stealing. its odd but true... ppl just don&#39;t think.. oh well.. i<br/>
&gt;hope you all try to just have fun and not give a shit what other ppl think for<br/>
&gt;once.   then you might find why Varent say we are a balanced race, i <br/>
&gt;personally<br/>
&gt;think we were made to give grief to others heehhe.. j/k   I personally <br/>
&gt;think we<br/>
&gt;should be changed to Erudite Magical Theives hehe..<br/>
