&gt; This is nuts.  Wizards have it tough already getting to high levels.  Until<br/>
&gt; lvl 12 or so you are effectively a magician with no pet (and therefore a<br/>
&gt; pretty weak magician.)  If they hurt wizards offensively there would have to<br/>
&gt; be some change defensively to offset it.  I mean, wizards only real way to<br/>
&gt; survive is nuke the critter into oblivion fast enough that it can&#39;t take<br/>
&gt; down your paltry hit point pool through your nearly nonexistant AC.  I<br/>
&gt; seriously think this is just a rumor, though.  EQ is balanced to be PvE, and<br/>
&gt; a Wizard is, in general, not better off than any other classes.  I mean, at<br/>
&gt; high levels you may be the only one who can solo a Hill Giant, but after you<br/>
&gt; do that a young lion could maul you because it takes all your mana to kill<br/>
&gt; the giant.  I think the drill here is remain calm and then if they gimp the<br/>
&gt; wizards flood them with polite feedbacks on why this was bad.  Heck, Wizards<br/>
&gt; were gimped right near the end of beta, too, and feedbacks seem to have<br/>
&gt; improved that situation.<br/>
