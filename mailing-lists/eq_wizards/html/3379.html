<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-487916475">I hit level 30, and have found exp very slow in a steady group, especially<br/>
if you die once a day (as I do) you end up at getting about 1/4 a bubble a<br/>
day. Soloing seems to be the only answer for the time being, but i&#39;m having<br/>
extreme trouble doing it, without sow/jboots. Root will usually work, but<br/>
either for a second, or for one blast, which still gives it time to kill me.<br/>
Bonds of force is also the same way. Any suggeston on a good way to solo, or<br/>
on something that has EXTREMELY low magic resistance would be nice. Thank<br/>
you.</div>
