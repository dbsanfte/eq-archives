<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647603886">Were these druids referring to out level 39 root upgrade &quot;Immobolize&quot;?  I<br/>
hear that this one is definately the best of the root series.  And btw, I<br/>
just read an email from GZ, the druid roots are resisted EXACTLY as much as<br/>
all other roots in the game...<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t really feel bad about Bonds of Force, I&#39;m definately not pissed<br/>
about it since it was an extra I didn&#39;t expect but I am disappointed with<br/>
its functionality.  If and when you test it against a druid&#39;s ensnare you&#39;ll<br/>
know what I mean.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t feel to bad about ensnare.  I just got finished &quot;discussing&quot; root and<br/>
ensnare with a couple of high level druids on a message board.  Basically<br/>
they<br/>
wanted a reliable root spell like wizards instead of their ensnare line.  I<br/>
guess its true,  The grass is always greener on the other side.</div>
