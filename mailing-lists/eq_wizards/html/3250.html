<div id="ygrps-yiv-1013939700">Anybody know how the secondary spell Chaotic Effect takes place?  Is it <br/>
level dependant or DEX dependant?  I&#39;ve been assuming it was dependant on my <br/>
level...but yesterday I was grouped with a bard that was singing a song to <br/>
increase DEX.  Lo and behold, the staff was going off on spells!  It was <br/>
pretty cool, it hit for 48 dmg.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m level 28, and with the bard&#39;s buff, my DEX was about 86.<br/>
