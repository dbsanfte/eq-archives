&gt;&gt;Don&#39;t mean to bash you, but this is *not* a solution.  I am at level 16 and<br/>
&gt;&gt;I notice that the higher I get, the less and less well I fare in melee.  I<br/>
&gt;&gt;have a runed totem staff as well and I can hit ok against blue creatures,<br/>
&gt;&gt;but against a red where my spells are being resisted I can barely even<br/>
&gt;&gt;scratch the mob in melee...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is what I was talking about in an earlier post, but was assured by<br/>
&gt;many others that it gets better at higher levels, like in the 20&#39;s to 30&#39;s<br/>
&gt;(I&#39;m 11 now). I thought at the time that this was a ridiculously long time<br/>
&gt;to wait for the game to get better for wizards. Why SHOULD it have to take<br/>
&gt;so long? Now I see from someone with a lot more experience than I that it<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t get better. I think we need to seriously petition Verant about the<br/>
&gt;shortcomings of the wizard class. We need more buff spells to help<br/>
&gt;ourselves and our parties, and spells of protection, like you mentioned. It<br/>
&gt;seems to me that this is the sort of things wizards should be able to do<br/>
&gt;anyway. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Resistanco to our spells i aprove it must be lowered but whan you start to<br/>
speak about buffs and debuffs we are solo players in idea and for us is<br/>
important to protect ourselves and to deal as much damage as we can. buffs<br/>
debuffs go to other classes i dont need them i wish to our class beter<br/>
travel spells and also faster mana recovery then to others as we need it<br/>
much more take a look at my next letter about wizards (long very long)<br/>
