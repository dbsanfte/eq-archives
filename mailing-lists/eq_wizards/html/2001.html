&gt;Okay,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I spent the last 1/2 hour rewriting the petition.  Hopefully this will<br/>
&gt;get us closer to bring this to a conclusion.  I left the majority of the<br/>
&gt;spells out only because I really feel that we as a group will never come<br/>
&gt;to an agreement on them.<br/>

&gt;Dear EverQuest Staff,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We are a large group of wizards who have come together through a mailing<br/>
&gt;list. Through much discussion and debate, we have agreed to send you<br/>
&gt;this feedback concerning improvements to the wizard. We would like to<br/>
&gt;thank you in advance for your careful consideration of these<br/>
&gt;modifications.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) Spells are 100% resisted by mobs 6+ levels above the caster. In large<br/>
&gt;groups hunting big prey this level cap turns a wizard from the main<br/>
&gt;dealer of damage to a useless member in the group. Our suggestion is<br/>
&gt;that either the cap be raised to 6+ levels of the highest member in the<br/>
&gt;group, or the cap be raised to 8+ levels higher than the caster.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2) Spells that both stun and damage targets are often resisted by mobs<br/>
&gt;that /con green and blue. If this is the result of the stun effect, we<br/>
&gt;would like one spell without this effect at the same level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3) Many spell suggestions have crossed this list. Here is one that we<br/>
&gt;all feel would be a great addition.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Tap Affinity - Teleport targeted group member to their own bind spot<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;4) O&#39;Kiels Radiation seems that it would be the beginning of a great<br/>
&gt;line of spells. Why should it end there? Cold and Magic based<br/>
&gt;buffs/shields would be a very welcome addition.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;5) Wizards seem to be very neglected when it comes to carrying or<br/>
&gt;wearing items that enhance our appearance. Also, many completely<br/>
&gt;different spells have the same visual effects.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We would like to thank you again for your time. Any type of feedback<br/>
&gt;would be greatly appriciated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sincerely,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The Wizards of Norrath<br/>
