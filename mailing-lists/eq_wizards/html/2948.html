&gt; A good idea about research is to put all points<br/>
&gt; possible each level into<br/>
&gt; it. Personally, I&#39;ve made all possible spells, some<br/>
&gt; twice, and I&#39;ve only<br/>
&gt; failed twice, maybe three times. Each time you try<br/>
&gt; there is a chance<br/>
&gt; your skill will go up too.<br/>

<br/>
I was planning on putting all my training points at every level<br/>
(post-20) into Research. Should I do this as soon as I level, or wait<br/>
until just before I level (in case I get a couple of Runes to try which<br/>
aren&#39;t yet trivial during the level)? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard there&#39;s a 5 point per level cap...if I happen to miss a<br/>
level, and not make it to a guild hall, can I put in 10 next level? <br/>
<br/>
Can I top the 5 point cap by actually doing Research (since there&#39;s a<br/>
chance it goes up every time I try to combine runes), or is that a cap<br/>
based on my level, like most skills?<br/>
<br/>
Well, okay, that was three instead of two. I think the sun in Oasis is<br/>
getting to me...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
