<b>Subject:</b> Some coments from necro site necromonitor about wizards !! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-190976577">Eheheheh look what a necromancers get from a petition !<br/>
<br/>
Ehehehe yep wizard are great class we dont need petition, it was some comments<br/>
on this list now looks what a necromancers have !! At 29 lv our spell do 250<br/>
dmg cc and it is as alwas many times resisted and it cost much mana! Necro have<br/>
at this lv a spell wich damage same amount 250, heal in same time, and cost<br/>
less mana, only it takes a longer time to deal it, but first they will not get<br/>
mob on them as a pet can deal similar damage and tount, they heal themselfs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-Vampiric Curse / Bond of Death (formerly Circle of Death) (NECROMANCER) now<br/>
work with their new effects.<br/>
<br/>
These are a new breed of DOT spells that not only damage but also restore HP<br/>
over time. Vampiric Curse is a Level 29 research only spell that seems to trade<br/>
about 250 damage for 250 HP over time. Note this spell will continue to heal<br/>
even after the target has died!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
im pissed guys look a coments what a necro say about us !!      <br/>
<br/>
-Necromancer poison spells have had their damage doubled and their duration cut<br/>
in half. They will do EXACTLY the same amount of damage, but in half the<br/>
pervious amount of time. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A la petition.. we got what we wanted. Necromancers can now actually pace<br/>
wizards for damage in higher levels with effective stacking of DOTs. At L34<br/>
Necros have five stackable DOTs, at 39 they gain one more powerful one. And<br/>
damage for mana certainly outclasses wizards.<br/>
<br/>
to see only one of nice necro spells i will also paste a comment on this one<br/>
spell<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Allure of Death<br/>
<br/>
This is an upgrade to the Dark Pact spell. It costs a meager 5 mana to cast and<br/>
is another one of our many Alteration magic based spells. This spell drains 8<br/>
life from you every round and exchanges it for 8 mana. As is tyical for<br/>
upgraded spells, this one lasts longer then the last version, Dark Pact. Now<br/>
what good does damaging oneself for mana have? A bit suicidal perhaps you<br/>
think? Well we Are Necromancers! As your health withers away and your mana<br/>
returns, start using your lifetap line of spells and heal up... With almost 100<br/>
specialization in Alteration Magic, I practically lifetap back as much health<br/>
as I lost to gain the mana, very useful. There are 2 particularly nasty<br/>
combinations with this spell beyond the lifetap casting. 1) Group with a Bard,<br/>
their heal song should offset your damage taken so that you in effect have a<br/>
super mana regeneration rate so long as bard plasy and you have allure up. 2)<br/>
Get Regeneration cast on you by a Shaman.... same effects as #1 above. The<br/>
downtime you may have had before is halved or less while using these<br/>
combinations. And to confirm this, Allure of Death does NOT turn you into<br/>
skeletal form, though once rumored to do so. A later upgrade called dead man<br/>
walking will do so.<br/>
