<b>Subject:</b> STOP THE PETITION!!! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1414754294">guys. this is a rant. stop complainging about what we don&#39;t have and look at what we do. i totally understand the force shock thing (either take away the stun, or do less dmg... i like the taking away the stun). but you guys are asking way too much. the reason enstill doesn&#39;t work well is they want to encourage grouping! but i completely understand the force shock issue. but come on guys you&#39;re asking way too much way too early. sorry to say this but they still need a lot of kinks to be worked out before they even START adding new spells. and expect an obscene amount of new spells in the expansion. from what i saw when i went to Verant. Geoffrey has a lotta time on his hands and way back on may 6th he said he was already working on the new spells for the expansion. not to mention completely overhauling the enchanter spells and *gasp* some of the wizard spells! so just hang in there. don&#39;t petition because it&#39;s pointless. wait a while and if nothing good comes around. THEN petition. if they see a petition, turn it down, then see the same one in a couple months, they&#39;re not going to take it seriously! so just wait.<br/>
<br/>
On another note. I love the familiar idea! it&#39;s great! BUT don&#39;t ask for it yet. that would take a lot of time that they just don&#39;t have yet. i think the highest level person on the mailing list is definetly the wisest and he loves his level and suggests to hang in there... as do I. <br/>
<br/>
So please. stop the petition. all that&#39;s going to happen is they&#39;re going to look at it, then put the big &#39;ol thing in the trash bin. <br/>
