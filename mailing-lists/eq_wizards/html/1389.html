<div id="ygrps-yiv-972254595">I&#39;ve been posting here the past couple days in replies to ppl who think the wizard class needs revamped or is too weak.  I am very much against any such revamping and happen to feel that the wizard class is fine the way it is, for the most part.  These are just my opinions though.  I recognize the fact that not everyone agrees with me and I hope I haven&#39;t come across in such a way that you think I&#39;m putting you down for your thoughts and opinions.  This is far from the truth.  Sometimes I get caught up in what I&#39;m saying and may inadvertantly come across as &quot;I&#39;m right you&#39;re wrong&quot; attitude.  There is no wrong or right, just our own personal opinions and I apologize if I came across too strong and offended anyone.<br/>
