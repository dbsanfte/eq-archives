&gt;there<br/>
&gt;then. dont know if i dare to try the gate there tho, even if there has been <br/>
&gt;some<br/>
&gt;good advice on how to go there the best way without geting killed. My play <br/>
&gt;style<br/>
&gt;is that i dont run around blindly in a new zone not knowing where itï¿½s safe <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;meditate best place to hunt etc. Know any good URL for a map over Casic and <br/>
&gt;our<br/>
&gt;drop spot over there ?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I&#39;ve been too chicken to gate over there too.  Although the <br/>
levitate/invis trick I heard sounds promising.  Anyway...I&#39;ve traditionally <br/>
taken the LOONG way there following all the walls.  Forgive me if I get the <br/>
names of the zones wrong (I hope there are those here who would correct me)<br/>
<br/>
-- Go to Oasis...follow the right wall until the back side of the zone.  You <br/>
can&#39;t miss this huge zone area back there.  I think there is an orc and derv <br/>
camp back there.  Greenies but I steer clear anyway.<br/>
<br/>
-- S Ro.  Follow right wall again...you&#39;ll encounter orc camps along the <br/>
way.  Greenies again.  First zone you encounter will lead to Innothule.<br/>
<br/>
-- Innothule Swamp.  Right again.  I don&#39;t remember bumping into anything at <br/>
all here.  First zone<br/>
<br/>
-- Feerot.  I usually go invis in this zone.  Might be a good idea to go <br/>
invis along the whole journey.  Anyway, Cazic is in this zone.  But you have <br/>
to watch for Ogre guards along the way.  Especially the infamous roaming <br/>
Bouncer Hurd.  So I steer clear by following the left wall till I encounter <br/>
the river.  a short swim across to the other bank.  I would say about....30 <br/>
more yards along the left wall is the temple entrance guarded by two green <br/>
to blue lizards.  Viola.<br/>
<br/>
It takes some time to get used to the place.  But invis will be your best <br/>
friend here heh.  That&#39;s my method....the &quot;Lim&#39;Dul Chicken Express&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t found a place with a very detailed map. Although I currently <br/>
frequent this URL with good Wiz info.  (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.graffe.com/)">http://www.graffe.com/)</a><br/>
