Thanks for your reply.  Sorry to sound like I am yet another whining <br/>
about the Wizard class.  I actually love the Wizard class but can&#39;t <br/>
help but be envious of the others I have seen at my level runing <br/>
around with items that give them 50 extra mana points and AC&#39;s near <br/>
250 at level 10 and I can&#39;t raise enough money to buy basic spells.<br/>
<br/>
Do you really believe that I can be more effective with a snake fang <br/>
then a GS.  I have to melee quite a bit now and the staff although it <br/>
seems that I swing it only once every 10 secs and the damage I do is <br/>
proportional to the creatures HP&#39;s it does hit regularly for 16 points <br/>
of damage. The senario is like this I can hit for 64 points in the <br/>
first four strikes then can&#39;t hit for 3 points in 10 strikes while the <br/>
creature crawls away from me - not run crawl like a slug, follow, <br/>
miss, follow, miss, follow, miss, umph! I am stunned by an ambush of 4 <br/>
creatures as I tried to deal the last 3 points to the creature I have <br/>
already beaten.  Then I die or run losing the kill and becoming very <br/>
bitter.   <br/>
<br/>
I could kill without meleeing at all but at 9th level I&#39;d use all my <br/>
mana in every fight and would have to run back to a safe place to med <br/>
constantly.  Lately in groups I am a fighting Wizard.  I let the tanks <br/>
build a heathly hate with the creatures then join in with my staff.  I <br/>
only use my mana to stop a fleeing creature or save my group when <br/>
things go wrong or to minimize the damage they endure.  My rule is I <br/>
try to use slightly more mana then the tanks take damage.  This way I <br/>
recover my mana in about the same amount of time they recover their <br/>
life and neither of us slows the other. If I burn to recklessly I <br/>
cause the whole group to slow down by having to wait for me to <br/>
regenerate.  I am concerned that with a snake tooth (6dmg I think) I <br/>
would not do nearly as much damage and would be forced to use mana.  I <br/>
conserve mana at all costs even to the point of nearing death or <br/>
having to flee rather than win the fight.  Mana is life.  If I use it <br/>
indescrimanantly I risk the lives of my party or I become a burden to <br/>
them rather than an asset.<br/>
<br/>
Also I have used a staff since day one.  I have practically no skill <br/>
in one hand piece(?).  How long would it take me to build my dagger <br/>
skill to 50 (my current 2H blunt skill)?  How much damage over time <br/>
does the dagger do verses the staff?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Guile<br/>
