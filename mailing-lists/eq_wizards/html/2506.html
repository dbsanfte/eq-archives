<div id="ygrps-yiv-342384162"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;         I do have one question...this may seem obvious for some, but where<br/>
&gt;do I find the tome to combine the spell components?   I hail from Neriak<br/>
&gt;and I have probably just missed it.  I would appreciate if anyone knows<br/>
&gt;where to find this item, please post for the dork here so I can start my<br/>
&gt;spell creation...hopefully...all the comments about the slow skill raising<br/>
&gt;that goes on makes me leery but I have to try it anyway :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you need the &quot;lexicon&quot; (?) to combine the spells.  (I&#39;m going from <br/>
memory here since I&#39;m at work).  I purchased all of my necessary research <br/>
tools over at the mage tower in Freeport..lower floor.  It looks like a <br/>
little red book.<br/>
<br/>
I finally made a successful spell yesterday, projectile lightning.  So now <br/>
I&#39;m 1 out of 4.  This is after chunking in maximum training points for my <br/>
level.  I&#39;m still rated &quot;very bad&quot; for my research skill. :P<br/>
