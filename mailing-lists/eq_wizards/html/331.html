<div id="ygrps-yiv-306531454">First off - MAN a lot of mail, just caught up.  <br/>
<br/>
Reading waay back, I was surprised to see that most people don&#39;t like<br/>
O&#39;Kiels radiation.  This goes to the  mana/damage ratio.  That is a<br/>
topic that I&#39;m real surprised to see some peoples answers to.  Just<br/>
saying &quot;WAIT - you get a spell that does 200, or 300, or whatever damage<br/>
at level X&quot; isn&#39;t a ratio.  Just doing quick figuring, your first real<br/>
spell shock of fire will do about 1.07 dam per mana.  Shock of ice is a<br/>
staple at 1.27, and shock of lightning does get better at 1.3 dam/mana. <br/>
But keep in mind fizzling, and resitances, and try to use the minimum<br/>
spell to do the job.  Also, the next spell at 20th I estimate will be<br/>
about the same ratio - so even tho you are doing about 100 dam instead<br/>
of 80 with lightning, you aren&#39;t doing any better damage.  <br/>
<br/>
Why use it then?  You ARE doing it faster tho, and that is the gain you<br/>
get really there.  (When you absolutely, positively need it dead!<br/>
hehe).  You get gang banged.  Everyone targets the same thing, you<br/>
unload and kill it REAL quick, then you can all fall back into a good<br/>
rhythm on what is left usually.  Your tanks don&#39;t notice, but yet again,<br/>
you took what would have been a loosing battle for them, and made it a<br/>
great victory.<br/>
<br/>
When I am managing my mana in a group, you need to watch your tanks<br/>
(this assumes no cleric healing fast).  You should always end a battle<br/>
about 2-3 bars of mana down, and they should be no more than 1 to MAYBE<br/>
2 bars of life down.  Your mana will always regen faster than their HP&#39;s<br/>
will.  This ensures that your group will be ready to fight sooner after<br/>
a fight, and can even survive that extra ambush that might hit you.  If<br/>
you are holding mana for trouble, then you are all doing ok  - but you<br/>
have a LOT longer downtime between battles while healing / meditating<br/>
for more healing mana. (with a full blown cleric, and not just paladins<br/>
and rangers, you can drop that by about a bar of life)<br/>
<br/>
That said, be ready to unload to keep your tanks over half life.  If you<br/>
are out of mana, but your tanks are alive, then the whole party will a<br/>
LOT more likely survive than if its the reverse. If your tank gets low,<br/>
they may get edgy and run, and then you are all dead basically.<br/>
<br/>
So, back to O&#39;Kiels.  Best instance is when you have a lead tank.  Odds<br/>
are he will take most of the hits, and prolly from two monsters.  He<br/>
will get hit about 10 times from one monster before its dead, and<br/>
another 20 or so from the second (each doing a measly 2 damage you<br/>
say!!).  That is about 30*2=60 points of damage, all for 15 mana -<br/>
that&#39;s a HUGE mana/damage ratio there (4.0).  Even with just one<br/>
monster, 10 hits is 20 dam - that&#39;s 1.33 ratio - better than any other<br/>
spell you have up to at least 20th if not higher.  Oh- it&#39;s also great<br/>
practice for your abjuration - a skill that is otherwise lagging<br/>
horribly cause you don&#39;t need to refresh your shielding that frequently.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly - I tend to agree with the person who said this list has a lot of<br/>
spam, but the problem is it is all basically topic appropriate.  I<br/>
personally would like to see a more focused list, maybe two lists here,<br/>
but that isn&#39;t gonna happen.  I already switched to digest when I got<br/>
hit with the initial 200+ mail, but still!  Any idea from anyone how we<br/>
can make this more manageable?<br/>
