That no drop/trade trick is excellent...<br/>
But, JBoots and many other crazy items can be given to others that way.<br/>
Unless we keep our mouths&#39; tight about this, prepare for that to go away<br/>
next patch.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly,<br/>
The Ice Comet Quest begins in Everfrost, that is all i know. I&#39;m only level<br/>
25 and I can believe that the quest is designed to be much, much higher than<br/>
that but, I wan&#39;t to know what is needed, so I can begin to look now. And if<br/>
it&#39;s item related, I have the cash to purchase those items from people who<br/>
might not know any better.<br/>
<br/>
Third,<br/>
I am still trying to get the Council of Wizardry started on Karana, but<br/>
there doesn&#39;t seem to be enough people to make it. I really need help on<br/>
this. Should I conform and make it the *Council of Magi and open it to all<br/>
four mage classes?<br/>
I&#39;ve been in a few guilds and none so far concentrated on roleplay, player<br/>
driven quests, and helping each other quest for adnventure/knowledge/items.<br/>
(So that is why I&#39;ve been in a few guilds. A collection of people isn&#39;t<br/>
enough for this wizard.) Those of you on Karana or know some other mage<br/>
classes on Karana who might be interested or could offer some advice, please<br/>
drop me a line...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*or Council of Roke (if you&#39;re familiar with the Wizard of Earthsea books)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
