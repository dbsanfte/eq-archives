<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165728953">Hmmm, why do you go through all that hassle?  I walk through Freeport <br/>
myself.  I haven&#39;t had any problems there.  Unless it has something to do <br/>
with necs or sks, I can&#39;t imagine why... I suppose if ya spent a lot of <br/>
time whacking the guards down it might matter, but apparently my faction is <br/>
fine and I can zip right through town with no problems whatsoever.<br/>
I haven&#39;t done any special faction bumping.. no quests, no killing any one <br/>
type of monster to raise my faction with the Freeport residents either...<br/>
