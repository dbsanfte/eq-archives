<div id="ygrps-yiv-1417683722">Bought and tested the following spells...<br/>
<br/>
Bonds of Force:  	Area Effect group Ensnare<br/>
			Cost: 75 mana<br/>
			Skill: Alteration<br/>
<br/>
Bonds of force is NOT as good as the Druid form of Ensnare at my current<br/>
level 29...<br/>
It is resisted about the same amount as Enstill and the length of effect is<br/>
much like our root... random.<br/>
The druid version of ensnare is not resisted as much, and when it sticks it<br/>
always lasts for a minute or two.  I see a few uses for this spell but I am<br/>
dissapointed.  I would rather have the druid version of ensnare for a single<br/>
mob.<br/>
<br/>
Yonder:  This is a BUG!  I talked to a GM about it after I had purchased,<br/>
scribed, memmed and tested it.  In it&#39;s current form, it is basically Shadow<br/>
Step for 15 mana.  Yonder is supposed to be a fear spell.  In beta, wizards<br/>
had the ability to cast this spell but it has since been removed from our<br/>
spell list.  The GM told me that 4 spells had been affected and that they<br/>
hoped to fix the problem without a patch.<br/>
<br/>
I really didn&#39;t notice any significant changes in casting time although I<br/>
didn&#39;t put this through and scientific tests.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, I&#39;m disappointed with the &quot;improvements&quot; made to our class, but<br/>
then again I was never really unhappy with our class either.<br/>
