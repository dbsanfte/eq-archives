<div id="ygrps-yiv-1573954731">Understand this (at least last time I tried it a month ago), Cancel<br/>
Magic will remove an effect at random.  It is not effetive because it<br/>
normally removes a nice Buff you want to have on.  Try it out on your<br/>
friends when they have 3 or more buffs on...cancel them out and see<br/>
which one goes first.<br/>

&gt; It may work like a clerics cure poison.  From what I<br/>
&gt; have seen poison comes in<br/>
&gt; three levels, and if a cleric uses his lowest level<br/>
&gt; curing spell, he may have<br/>
&gt; to cast it several times before the poison is<br/>
&gt; removed.  Here is my suggestion.<br/>
&gt; Go to the Steamfont Mts and have Meldreth charm your<br/>
&gt; buddy again.  Then cast<br/>
&gt; cancel magic 4 or 5 times and see if it removes the<br/>
&gt; effect.  Well okay your<br/>
&gt; buddy probably won&#39;t go for it, but give it a shot<br/>
&gt; the next time its necessary<br/>

&gt; &gt; I also am not too sure what the function of Cancel<br/>
&gt; Magic is... I believe it<br/>
&gt; &gt; can undo roots but that seems to be about it....<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yesterday a druid friend and I were grouped<br/>
&gt; fighting evil eyes.  He was<br/>
&gt; &gt; charmed and I finished the eye.  Even after the<br/>
&gt; eye died, my friend was<br/>
&gt; &gt; still charmed and continued to attack me.  I then<br/>
&gt; rooted him(we play on<br/>
&gt; &gt; Rallos Zek), he clicked all of his buffs off(which<br/>
&gt; can still be done when<br/>
&gt; &gt; you are charmed), then cast cancel magic on him. <br/>
&gt; It said that he felt a bit<br/>
&gt; &gt; dispelled yet it did not cancel the charm.  Does<br/>
&gt; cancel magic only give you<br/>
&gt; &gt; a chance to cancel the charm?  I thought that<br/>
&gt; canceling charm would have<br/>
&gt; &gt; been one of the main purposes of this spell.  Also<br/>
&gt; we tested cancel magic by<br/>
&gt; &gt; him casting stinging swarm(DOT) on me and me<br/>
&gt; canceling.  It seems to work<br/>
&gt; &gt; sometimes, but not always... it may have something<br/>
&gt; to do with being grouped<br/>
&gt; &gt; or not...  Does anyone have any data on how this<br/>
&gt; spell works and when it<br/>
&gt; &gt; will work?  Also should cancel magic work against<br/>
&gt; Necro DOT&#39;s?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
