<div id="ygrps-yiv-1013467379">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
maybe you can help me:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve created a darkelf wizard und spent 20 points to INT, 5 points to STR<br/>
and 5 points to CHARISMA (stupid, I don&#39;t know why i did that). Do you<br/>
think it&#39;s worth to recreate my character spending 25 points to INT and 5<br/>
to AGILITY?<br/>
Or do you think the stats are ok and I will have no major disadvantages in<br/>
the future? By the way I&#39;m lvl 8 now.<br/>
<br/>
These are my stats:<br/>
<br/>
STR 65   STA 75   AGI 90   DEX 75   WIS 83   INT 129   CHA 65<br/>
<br/>
Greetings<br/>
