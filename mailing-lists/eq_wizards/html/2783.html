<div id="ygrps-yiv-29230552">This staff does NOT look like an ice cream cone like the orbs do... Seeing as I have one I can tell you exactly what it looks like. In your weapon slot<br/>
it looks exactly like a glowing crook but on your character when you equip it it looks like a staff with a crsytal on the top the crystal is white and in<br/>
the shape of a pyramid sort of. If anything this staff is for looks only not really worth 300 plat or whatever.<br/>
