<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854837249">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
    List sems to be dieing down so I thought I&#39;d share my experience with<br/>
lava.<br/>
I was in soulsek A and trying to go through the window instead of taking a<br/>
chance with the swinging blade trap.  I was also invisable at the time.<br/>
Well I got stuck in the window.  Suddenly I popped out and fell backwards<br/>
into the lava pool.  At the time I had major shield, Leather Skin and<br/>
Elemntal Protextion on me.  At first I nearly paniced but then I started<br/>
banging my 6 key. It was my hot key for gate.  The whole time I was thinking<br/>
that this was the end, and I&#39;d never get my corps back. After two tries, I<br/>
got a gate off.  When I materialized at m bind point, I had 22 hp left.<br/>
From what I hear, I can  consider myself extreamly lucky to have lived.  I<br/>
think I would have been a lot luckier if I had not fell in at all.</div>
