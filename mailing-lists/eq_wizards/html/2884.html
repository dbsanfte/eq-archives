<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All through the lower levels 1 through about 10 maybe 12 I would, and did,<br/>
work mainly with a tarnished dagger, cracked staff, and worn great staff.<br/>
Once I got to 12th I headed over to paw and was able to get an RTS.  This<br/>
all happened during the first week of the game.<br/>
Now RTS are much more common,  I see them auctioned off for 10 to 20 plat<br/>
all the time (average 15pp).<br/>
Its generally the next step up if you want a magical weapon.  If your<br/>
really looking to upgrade, see if you can get a Fine Steel Great Staff, or<br/>
a Fine Steel Dagger.  Maybe I just haven&#39;t come accross them, but I don&#39;t<br/>
think I have encountered a FS Staff.<br/>
An RTS should last you a while.  Once you get to the upper 20s or 30s start<br/>
looking for an observer staff or some of the other magical 1 and 2 handed<br/>
staves in the game.  Also a Dragoon Dirk is pretty easy to get once in the<br/>
mid 20s.  I could solo acquire one relatively easily at 28th.<br/>
