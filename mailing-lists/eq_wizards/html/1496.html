<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774740407">Wizards of Norrath Rejoice!  The Eye of Zomm (Level 4 spell that makes an eye <br/>
avatar for you to control) gives you the power of a rogue!  It is a universal <br/>
key!!  the eye can open ANY door in the game!  See ya locks!  I know this <br/>
seems rather sucky at first (ye canna walk through the door, since you are <br/>
controlling the eye), but as yall pointed out, ye can train out the door <br/>
whatever ye need!  Yay for us<br/>
