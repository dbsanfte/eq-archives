<div id="ygrps-yiv-520254917">I think these are great spell ideas  Probably too useful for Verant to <br/>
implement. :)   All the other classes have whined and gotten buffed up a bit; <br/>

I&#39;ve been thinking about a few new spells that Verant should implement, tell <br/>
me what you all think.  Most of these new spells is to reinforce the ability <br/>
for wizards to travel, so far it appears that Druids are just as good, or <br/>
even better then wizards with Spirt of the Wolf for traveling.<br/>
<br/>
Summon - Teleports group member inside the zone to your location<br/>
<br/>
Phase - Teleports yourself to location of other group member inside zone<br/>
<br/>
Greater Summon - Teleports group member to your location, even across zones<br/>
<br/>
Greater Phase - Teleports yourself to a group members location, even across <br/>
zones<br/>
<br/>
Group Gate - Slow casting spell which teleports group to your bind spot, <br/>
doesn&#39;t leave anyone behind<br/>
<br/>
Retreat - Evacuate version of group gate<br/>
<br/>
Haste - Increases movement rate for self only.&gt;&gt;</div>
