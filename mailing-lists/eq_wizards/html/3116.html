<div id="ygrps-yiv-284829629">yes our mana is calcualted by our charisma and dexterity.  it is only for<br/>
one song, level 43, which i haven&#39;t used since it came out.  they may have<br/>
fixed it though, it used to do damage to the bard singing it as well.  guess<br/>
like a wizard AE spell?  i have to play around with it, only problem is one<br/>
cast and we have to get our mana back to full.  it takes 4 bubbs, and we can<br/>
not med, nor does our mana song or clarity help, just sitting.  so how do<br/>
you cast an AE spell?  i have heard horror stories about them.  do you<br/>
target yourself, or a tank in your group?  anyway, just a note on bard mana.<br/>

&gt; &gt; lol druids dont sing songs<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Was probably referring to bards. And I rather doubt bards get <br/>
&gt; as much mana<br/>
&gt; as wizards... unless their mana is charisma-based, that is :)<br/>
