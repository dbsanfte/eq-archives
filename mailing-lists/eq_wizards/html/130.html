<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775721489">I know the feeling. It wasnt untill lvl 16 ( I was still feeling weak at lvl<br/>
12, even tho I did more damage then the others ) that I started to feel &quot;ooh<br/>
yeah I am powefull&quot; type thing.  At lvl 16 I can dish out 102dmg in 1 spell,<br/>
at lvl 17 it is 104. The lvl 16 DD spell goes up 2 points of damage per<br/>
level, which is nice.<br/>
<br/>
But I definatly know how you feel, for the longest time I felt like a &quot;magi<br/>
without a pet&quot; but now that feeling is starting to change. In the end we get<br/>
the best direct-damage and are the most mana-efficent when it comes to<br/>
dealing direct damage.<br/>
<br/>
We also get a wide range of teleport and group teleport spells. Wizards and<br/>
Druids are the only two class&#39;s that can get those, and we get more then the<br/>
druids (inter-plane travel spells). So things do look better for us in the<br/>
long run.<br/>

&gt;Just wondering how other people feel about our Wizard class. It seems to me<br/>
&gt;that we are short-changed compared to magicians and necromancers, whose<br/>
&gt;spells seem a lot better, and can have &quot;pets&quot; fight for them. It&#39;s also<br/>
&gt;hard to make signifant amounts of money to buy spells. I still like the<br/>
&gt;game, just wondered if anyone else felt the same way.<br/>
