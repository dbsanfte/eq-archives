<b>Subject:</b> The batch metality and how to conserve EXP <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-819627973">Well, I&#39;m only a 16th level wizard on solusek ro, lately I&#39;ve been playing<br/>
a lot of magican, and I like it a lot.  I&#39;ll go back to wizard after a<br/>
while, but what I wanted to comment on is this:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Spells seem to come and go in streaks, roots will break in streaks, fizzles<br/>
happen in streaks, resists happen in streaks and conversely, things will<br/>
happen that are &quot;good&quot; in streaks, althought the good streaks DEFINATELY<br/>
seem shorter than the bad streaks!  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So how does all of this apply to you?<br/>
<br/>
Simple!<br/>
<br/>
You want to level, right?  And you don&#39;t want to take an eternity to do it.<br/>
<br/>
What it all comes down to is how quickly you can accumulate EXP.  So I<br/>
guess the point I&#39;m trying to make is this:<br/>
<br/>
Its FAR FAR FAR better to escape and lose 10 minutes medding, than it is to<br/>
die and lose 3 hours regaining exp.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, when I&#39;m fighting a monster, if I root it and it resists<br/>
or it breaks root real quick I&#39;ll often try a second root and then keep<br/>
nuking.  If the second root doesn&#39;t hold, I keep trying to root, but now<br/>
I&#39;m rooting so I can cast gate and escape, not because I think I can<br/>
squeeze off enough nukes to kill it.<br/>
<br/>
If I have a monster rooted and I get 2 or 3 fizzles before a spell goes<br/>
off, I gate and get out while its still rooted.  You WILL lose those fights<br/>
about 8 times out of 10, because you are on the BAD streak.<br/>
<br/>
If a monster resists more than 2 spells in a battle I gate and get out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do you see a trend?  The MOMENT things start looking the least bit like I&#39;m<br/>
going into one of those negative streaks, I gate out and meditate for mana.<br/>
 By doing this, I do often lose 10 minutes or so of play time, but in the<br/>
overall scheme of things I actually level a LOT faster than my counterparts<br/>
who are losing hours and hours at a time because they die.<br/>
<br/>
Developing this habit takes a LOT of work and discipline, its HARD HARD<br/>
HARD not to resist the urge to nuke, but you have to do it.  In the long<br/>
run, your MUCH better off learning to recognize streaks and getting the<br/>
frik out of there when the streak isn&#39;t going in your favor.<br/>
