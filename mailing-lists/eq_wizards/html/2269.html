<div id="ygrps-yiv-874557269">Hello everyone,<br/>
This is my first message.<br/>
<br/>
I must say that I find all the info very informing, lets keep it that way.<br/>
The time has past for us to tell Verant our problems, lets move on.<br/>
<br/>
I would like for us to gather up the location(s) of every spell. Yes the<br/>
early spells might be acquired everywhere, but I don&#39;t want to have to run<br/>
around like a chicken-with-my-head-cut-off. If anyone else is interesting in<br/>
doing this, send me an email with your spell data.<br/>
Once I have a large sum of spell locations, I&#39;ll post them.<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Telor(Karana)<br/>
