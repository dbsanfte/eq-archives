&gt; There is a lvl 20 spell that we get that does stun your opponent though. It<br/>
&gt; is Tishan&#39;s Clash. It will stun your opponent for about 2 seconds (much like<br/>
&gt; a skel might stun you), and does approx. 30dmg.  The recover time for it is<br/>
&gt; about the same as force shock, so you cannot cast it several times in<br/>
&gt; succession if you were hoping to keep the opponent stunned. The mana cost on<br/>
&gt; it is very high though, so I don&#39;t really see a valid use for it (if the<br/>
&gt; stun time were longer, it would be a nice spell, but 2 seconds just isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; long enough).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Clash is a wonderfull spell<br/>
for soloing for exemple when you want to fetch a monster and bring him<br/>
to <br/>
a safe place for killing it .<br/>
for spellcaster mob it is a MUST some mob can cast a greater heal <br/>
that mean that they can nearly completly heal themself <br/>
and you dont want that to happen so you just stun them <br/>
