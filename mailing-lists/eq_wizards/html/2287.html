&gt;Hey man, if you can handle a derv by yourself then by all means take the<br/>
&gt;kill if they won&#39;t let you in on the rotation. NOBODY can claim a spawning<br/>
&gt;point as theirs... they can either create a rotational system or it&#39;s FFA.<br/>
&gt;But you said your getting a bubble of exp. in a half hour? if that&#39;s true<br/>
&gt;than your fighting things that are at least yellow, and i would suspect<br/>
 </span></blockquote>red.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  When i was your lvl i had some high lvl friends in the 30s + that use to<br/>
&gt;buff me and i could take on reds, and that&#39;s the only time when i gained<br/>
&gt;truly amazing exp.  Otherwise, don&#39;t expect them to tank for you while you<br/>
&gt;blast the shit out of them.<br/>
&gt;And also, just because a party has two nukers and you are one doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
&gt;anything.  First off, in parties with more than one nuker i like to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>conserve<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;my mana... i like the tanks to do their jobs while i soften the kill up a<br/>
&gt;bit.  This also gives the tank some fun and also cuts down on the downtime.<br/>
&gt;Maybe you havne&#39;t figured this out yet and that&#39;s why your such a shitty<br/>
&gt;person to have in a group, and you&#39;re not being invited. I RARELY ever have<br/>
&gt;to beg around or do shouts for long to find a group.  People know my<br/>
&gt;reputation and playing abilities and WANT me in the group.  This game is<br/>
&gt;more than powerlvling believe it or not.  You&#39;re still in the low levels,<br/>
&gt;wait until you&#39;re 30+ where you can no longer hang around Unrest or Cazic<br/>
&gt;and steal kills and actually have to venture forth into dungeons like Lower<br/>
&gt;Guk and Solusek...lets see you do that solo.  By that time most people have<br/>
&gt;formed regular travelling friends and groups.  At higher lvls (i&#39;m at 30+<br/>
&gt;now) you RARELY see people shouting for groups, and you&#39;re just damning<br/>
&gt;yourself now.<br/>

&gt;&gt;i thought this for a while too but now i am a semi-KSer. please, let me<br/>
&gt;&gt;explain: i spent most of my wizards life trying to keep order at the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>camps.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Me being a wizard threatened people by saying that if they stole, i could<br/>
&gt;&gt;easily steal every kill from them from then on, and it worked... for a<br/>
&gt;&gt;while. I have tried very hard lately to keep order at camps and nothing<br/>
&gt;&gt;works. so I gave up. I count the number of people in the camp and wait for<br/>
&gt;&gt;that many dervs to spawn, then i take the next one... regardless of who&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;turn&quot; it is. I figure that i have to be at the end of the rotation so<br/>
&gt;&gt;everyone there has already had a turn when i go and the person that whines<br/>
&gt;&gt;to me was on his/her second turn. I guess you can call it killstealing,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;not many get  mad because i&#39;m not just stealing everything when i have the<br/>
&gt;&gt;mana... but that&#39;s what i do now... i am moving to a new server soon and i<br/>
&gt;&gt;am seriously thinking of just going out and stealing everything i can for<br/>
&gt;&gt;the hell of it. but i don&#39;t think i&#39;ll do it because i&#39;m a nice guy and<br/>
&gt;&gt;that<br/>
&gt;&gt;sucks for everyone else<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;I probably will get flamed for this for sure, but who cares.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;I made it all the way to lvl 12 as an erudite wizard.   I found that<br/>
&gt;&gt;leveling<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;was very slow indeed and it was getting really boring camping with my<br/>
&gt;&gt;groups<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;till the sun comes up.   However, i was on a few days ago in the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>morning<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;and my<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;regular group wasn&#39;t on.  I shouted for about 30 min and no one wanted<br/>
&gt;&gt;to<br/>
&gt;&gt;join<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;up with me for bandit hunting.  Out of boredom, i went down to the<br/>
&gt;&gt;bandit<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;camps<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;to see if i can find a group there(West karanas on top of Hill).  I<br/>
&gt;&gt;found<br/>
&gt;&gt;this<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;group of 6 there camping the bandits so i just sat around shouting for<br/>
&gt;&gt;groups<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;once again. But while those guys were fighting the bandits, i thought,<br/>
&gt;&gt;hey<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;might<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;as well try to see if i can kill one solo, if i can&#39;t, then they will<br/>
&gt;&gt;probably<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;help me anyways.  I attacked one bandit and killedh im in 3 shots with<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Shock of<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Lightning.  and WOW ! so much XP !!!   so i just kept going.  I got<br/>
&gt;&gt;around<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;10-15<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;pp in 30 min and gained 1 bubble of xp. normall i gain 1 bubble in 6-8<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;hours of<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;playing.   FINALLY ! i found how to have fun with my wizard and not be<br/>
&gt;&gt;the<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;lamer<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;that spent all his time trying to group and get shitty XP cuz of the<br/>
&gt;&gt;split<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;between members !!   who cares if they think i am a kill stealer, its<br/>
&gt;&gt;not<br/>
&gt;&gt;like<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;they can do anything about it HAHAHA.  too bad for them that they wont<br/>
&gt;&gt;group<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;with me.  I also found some wizards are really stupid, the group  of 6<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;stealing from had a lvl 14 wizard and a lvl 11 wizard. and none of them<br/>
&gt;&gt;could<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;stop me from stealing. its odd but true... ppl just don&#39;t think.. oh<br/>
&gt;&gt;well.. i<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;hope you all try to just have fun and not give a shit what other ppl<br/>
&gt;&gt;think<br/>
&gt;&gt;for<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;once.   then you might find why Varent say we are a balanced race, i<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;personally<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;think we were made to give grief to others heehhe.. j/k   I personally<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;think we<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;should be changed to Erudite Magical Theives hehe..<br/>
