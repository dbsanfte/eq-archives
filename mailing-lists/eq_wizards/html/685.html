<div id="ygrps-yiv-778987877">Remember that skill called &#39;channeling&#39;??  That is causes you to regain your<br/>
concentration in battle.  The higher your channeling skill, the more often<br/>
you&#39;ll regain your concentration after being hit.  My channeling is<br/>
currently 110 and it kicks in all the time during battle ;)  I have heard<br/>
rumors that eventually, once in gets up in the 200&#39;s you&#39;ll even be able to<br/>
run and still cast spells, although it will only seldom work ;)<br/>

P.S.  And no, its not something new that was just added in the last patch,<br/>
it has been around since beta ;)  You&#39;re probably just now getting your<br/>
skill high enough where its finally kicking it every so often ;)<br/>

&gt; Well I think they have taken some of this in to consideration because it<br/>
&gt; seems they added somehting new to last nights patch.  During the game last<br/>
&gt; night I received a message while in combat taht stated &quot;You regained<br/>
&gt; concentration&quot; and it cast my spells after it told me I lost<br/>
concentration.<br/>
&gt; Could be the first steps...?  Who knows.<br/>
