<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857881643">---I ended up going to Lvl 13 pretty soloing YKs and Willos in the WC, <br/>
then really went fast to 14 in a Derv group in WC, i think i can make <br/>
15 pretty fast in these Dervs groups. Just thought i would let yall <br/>
know about the WC seems good for 12-15 lvls.</div>
