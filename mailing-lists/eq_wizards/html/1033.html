<div id="ygrps-yiv-1257078943">Hi all,<br/>
i am near level 16 now (very close in fact) and i need to buy some spell. I<br/>
am in freeport now and i have done all the merchant to try to find some<br/>
spel.. At the wizzard guild, there is only let s say 10 wizzard spel and<br/>
early one :( Anyone knows if there is a secret house or something like that<br/>
who is selling attack spel for level 16 ? and does someone knows how to open<br/>
the door located under water in the magical hall in freeport ??? <br/>
<br/>
thanks for all<br/>

<br/>
p.s. ho and yes any good information about research would be appreciated too<br/>
:) We all know we need rune to make scrol : we must buy a book , then put in<br/>
this book the rune for the spel then hit combine : yeah but can we miss ???<br/>
if yes it is going to be real hard for us !!! Rune are sold about 5 pp<br/>
