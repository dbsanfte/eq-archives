<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1098456781">I appreciate Verant making changes to wizard graphics, however, making a<br/>
skull look like a Barbie doll is, IMHO, worse than the small bag it used<br/>
to look like.  I&#39;m sure it was a quick and easy change since the used<br/>
the same graphic from the totems, but come on.<br/>
<br/>
Just my rant.</div>
