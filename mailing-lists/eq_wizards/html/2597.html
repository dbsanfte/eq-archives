&gt; what you think about other races?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>All I can say is that I love my Gnome.  Right now my Int is only 130, but with a<br/>
decent group I&#39;m never using more than 20% mana in a fight anyway (unless things<br/>
get ugly).  I&#39;ve gotten my Dex up to 101 and at level 12 I regain concentration<br/>
at least once every 2 fights.  That is when the mob gets to me :).  High<br/>
dexterity and intelligence is great for trade skills.  I&#39;ll gain 2 skill points<br/>
for every three to four attempts while baking and brewing, and have a success<br/>
rate much higher than the spoiler boards predict.  I certainly hopes this holds<br/>
true when it comes to spell research.  I think Gnomes will hold a very clear<br/>
advantage in this area.  I just wish we had more choices when it comes to our<br/>
robe selection.<br/>
<br/>
