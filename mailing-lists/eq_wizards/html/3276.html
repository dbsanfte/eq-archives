  I just had a question.  I have been working on the new quests (Acumen&#39;s Mask at the moment) and I have killed about 15 darkbone skeletons and 1 greater darkbone skeleton and still have not seen a darkbone skull.  Has anyone else gotten this loot item yet, and if so, do I just need to keep killing more darkbones, more greater darkbones, or something special?<br/>
