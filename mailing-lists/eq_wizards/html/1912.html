&gt;Hm, when ever I blast they just keep running at me...I guess I really<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t need the stun effect. That&#39;s what rooting is for. If it is stun<br/>
&gt;meant to cancel spells, well I don&#39;t need that either because that is<br/>
&gt;what enchanters are for (anti-magical-artillery). It doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>
&gt;cancel the orc priests from casting on me so I don&#39;t know...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I guess I&#39;m going to be a 16th level wizard until 24. I Sincerely hope<br/>
&gt;none of our later spells have stun because it gets hardeer and harder as<br/>
&gt;it is than to have blue stuff kick our asses even more :P If we do get<br/>
&gt;these more often, then we should get tashan/tashani in order to be<br/>
&gt;effective.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, how does one explain enstill resisting all the time? Even more<br/>
&gt;than my Force Shock...<br/>

&gt;&gt; The reason why your level 20 spell shock of force is resisted so often is<br/>
&gt;&gt; because it has a dual effect.  It not only does damage but it also stuns the<br/>
&gt;&gt; opponent.  Any spell with a dual effect is resisted a LOT more (ask<br/>
&gt;&gt; enchanters because almost all their spells have dual or triple effects).  At<br/>
&gt;&gt; level 24 we get a DD spell that does about the same amount of damage as<br/>
&gt;&gt; shock of force, but does not have a dual effect and is thus not resisted as<br/>
&gt;&gt; much.  It also costs less mana to cast.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Same problem here with abnormal amounts of resists with Lvl 20 spells...<br/>
&gt;&gt; This is quite different from any other new level spells in the past.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Enough of a difference to conclude that Lvl 20 spells were programmed<br/>
&gt;&gt; differently or there was a change in a patch that affects all spells that<br/>
&gt;&gt; just coincided with my reaching lvl 20...<br/>

&gt;&gt; I just reached lvl 20, got all my spells, and I guess am a little<br/>
&gt;&gt; dissapointed. I do enjoy blasting for 170 points of damage, but it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt; almost as if Verant has made these new spells EASIER to resist. For<br/>
&gt;&gt; instance, I fight Orcs in oasis. Low blue orcs and they are resisting my<br/>
&gt;&gt; new shock spell. They NEVER resist my 16th level lightning bolt. You<br/>
&gt;&gt; would think that a higher level spell would be as or harder to resist.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Another example is enstill. This ONLY works on greens. There is no blue,<br/>
&gt;&gt; white, yellow, red that I have found that is successfully enstilled. In<br/>
&gt;&gt; fact, when I fight the 20th level orcs that con black to me, they always<br/>
&gt;&gt; resist. Yet root works on them about 25% of the time. I was hoping that<br/>
&gt;&gt; when I got enstill it would be easier to solo because it is more<br/>
&gt;&gt; powerful, alas it isn&#39;t so.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; I am heading to Lake Rathe now and hopefully my spells work better<br/>
&gt;&gt; there. If not, mayhaps we should petition to get this change. I mean<br/>
&gt;&gt; come on, I am about as useful as a 16th level wizard against red if<br/>
&gt;&gt; BLUES resist my new 20th level spells. While monsters are getting<br/>
&gt;&gt; progressively better I seem to be getting progressively incapable to<br/>
&gt;&gt; handle them.<br/>
