<b>Subject:</b> Dissapointments with everquest. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-324843959">First of all I would like to tell the people that complain about druids and<br/>
necros being so much better at soloing (or anything) to just forget your<br/>
wizard and go play a druid or necro.  And also, I would like to state what I<br/>
am dissapointed with in the game.<br/>
1) The fact that the /ooc chat lets everyone discuss the solutions of quests<br/>
or the fact you can buy quest items.  I think anyone should be banned if<br/>
they give the solution of a quest out in game, I know we cannot stop the ICQ<br/>
contacts or web sites that do but most of the solutions are givin out in<br/>
game anyways.<br/>
2) The camping issue, I think verant should change spawning points of<br/>
monsters to a random location in the zone, or something similar and not let<br/>
tracking find NPCs.  I know that will hinder ranger&#39;s importance but I don&#39;t<br/>
see the logic behind tracking an NPC that&#39;s not an animal.<br/>
3) The role playing aspects of the game are very weak, I know that&#39;s what I<br/>
long for.  When AC comes out I am buying it instantly, it&#39;s the type of game<br/>
I am looking forward to.  Although I wish they would put a class system or<br/>
race system in.<br/>
4) Classes in everquest should have more uniqueness, I don&#39;t like the fact<br/>
that wizards are just the masters of DD spells.  I think we should get<br/>
something special, anything really.  Like special wizard hats or something<br/>
of the sort.<br/>
5) Everyone complaining, Verant seems to be shifting toward listening to<br/>
people whine about &quot;I cannot camp this critter because mister X big and<br/>
powerfull is&quot;  I think that camping should be something frowned upon in<br/>
general and I definitly think they should randomize spawn points and make<br/>
mobs have the urge to walk around more and stir up trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, just my 2 cents.<br/>
