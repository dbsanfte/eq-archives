&gt; Any of you Wizards out there know what skull, you need to combine with a<br/>
&gt; Ruined Totem Staff...and what NPC combines them for you?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   Unless someone can come right out and give exact NPC names and info<br/>
right now, assume that combining the rts and the skull is just a rumor. As<br/>
far as I know, the staff that Priests of Discord carry are actually<br/>
_different_ weapons and not a combo of these two items. No one to my<br/>
knowledge has actually been able to combine the two though many like to<br/>
claim that it is possible.<br/>
