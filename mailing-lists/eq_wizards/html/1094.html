&gt; which leads me to believe that the skull still is used in some fashion to<br/>
&gt; unleash its magical properties to the user.  But what?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; i just spent an entire day at Verant Int. it was a helluva lotta fun. I<br/>
met<br/>
&gt; the guy who developed all the spells, went to lunch with smed, etc. I even<br/>
&gt; had a chance to ask him about the runed totem and that skull. RUMOR. you<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; do no such thing. his GM character has one and it&#39;s called the staff of<br/>
&gt; discord and you probably get it if you kill the priest of discord. other<br/>
&gt; than that, the runed totem staff is ONLY the runed totem staff and cannot<br/>
&gt; into something else....<br/>
