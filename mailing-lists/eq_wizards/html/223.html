<b>Subject:</b> Re: 836pts of damage in under 10 secs from a 14th wizard <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-65702723">Wait till 16 and get shock of flame, that does 102 damage, I think lighting<br/>
bolt does 112 damage. So within one round using shock of flame, you&#39;d doe<br/>
612 damage that is IF you did max damage each round. Spells have a nasty<br/>
habit of doing 4 damage when you need them to do the most =).<br/>
<br/>
But one problem - if you figt &quot;social&quot; monsters you may find yourself with<br/>
more then 1 monster on you and running quickly for your lives. I am sure if<br/>
you managed to get them 1 on 1 (which can be tricky), you would do quite<br/>
well.<br/>

&gt;    PCs can&#39;t interrupt monster spells. Well, not that I&#39;ve ever seen. If<br/>
&gt;someone can refute this, then let me know. So I&#39;m not sure if your ROOT<br/>
&gt;example is really a good one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now, while on the subject of killing things, I thought of something that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;like to try.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d like to form a 6 player all wizard party. I&#39;m on the Solusek Ro server,<br/>
&gt;14th Wizard, would like to have about the same level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Verant, and everyone is always saying that you need to mix classes to level<br/>
&gt;and go up the fastest. Here&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Form group.<br/>
&gt;Everyone target same large honking creature.<br/>
&gt;One person shouts &quot; NUKE! &quot;<br/>
&gt;Everyone clicks on shock of lightning<br/>
&gt;BLAM<br/>
&gt;456 pts of dmg.<br/>
&gt;1 Shot.<br/>
&gt;1 Kill<br/>
&gt;Thank you for shopping at Wizzie mart.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Even if it&#39;s still alive and not running away, next volley should be for an<br/>
&gt;additional 380pts<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(assuming that 1 person is attacked and spell is interrupted).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;End result after 2 rnds: 836 pts of damage in I figure about less than 10<br/>
&gt;seconds. A Hill giant takes longer than that to kill me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;l stand in front of ANYTHING for 10 seconds. With bind abilities, the<br/>
&gt;entire group is pretty safe for escaping, you don&#39;t have to go far if you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>DO<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;die, which is highly unlikely.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How fast do you think this kind of group is gonna level taking out things<br/>
&gt;like griffawns, griffons, etc...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Only problem I can see is some things have a big magic resistance. I was<br/>
&gt;with a 15th barbarian in North Karanas, and we were feeling brawny. He<br/>
&gt;wailed on a Scythe beetle and brought it back to me and another 13th<br/>
 </span></blockquote>wizard.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My shock of lightning was only doing 30-35 pts of dmg. The 13th wizard did<br/>
&gt;0, nil, zip, zero pts. of dmg.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone wanna try out my idea, and you&#39;re on Solusek Ro let me know.<br/>

&gt;&gt;Here  lets solve the root debate:<br/>

&gt;&gt;Goto the cauldron (a zone off of BB mtns),  and poke an aqua goblin<br/>

&gt;&gt;PS  Speaking of the befallen (unrest-like dungeon in the west commons)  be<br/>
&gt;&gt;careful just running through doors on lvl 2, there are pits that drop you<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;&gt;lvl 3.  Lvl 3 is A LOT harder than lvl 2 !<br/>
