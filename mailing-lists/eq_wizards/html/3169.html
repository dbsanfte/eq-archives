<div id="ygrps-yiv-1840805563">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I thought wizards were supposed to be masters of DD spells. I was with a<br/>
level 29 cleric recently, and he has a spell (wrath) which was doing 198<br/>
damage to my 178. Granted, I am level 27, but was still kind of shocked. It<br/>
was only a two level difference, and he had a better DD spell, and could<br/>
melee too. And buff. And heal. I know at 29 I will get Inferno Shock, but<br/>
this just makes my think that we should be doing more damage, or have faster<br/>
mana regen, or SOMETHING. Just another example of how Verant has made the<br/>
wizard class suck.<br/>
