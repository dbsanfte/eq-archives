<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121420551">Trade Skills I know for sure do not have a level cap for skill.  I have a<br/>
friend who is a Dark Elf Necromancer on Fennin Ro.  At level 17 he has a<br/>
Smihting skill 126.  By the level+1 times 5 rule he should be maxed at 85.<br/>
However, this is not the case.  Any of the trade skills as well as swimming<br/>
(yes I am counting Fishing as a trade skill) have a 255 skill cap but none<br/>
other based on level that I have seen.<br/>

&gt;All skills have a cap based on level now. This was implemented towards the<br/>
&gt;end of the beta contrary to what Brad preached about not having to kill bats<br/>
&gt;to become a better fisherman.<br/>

&gt;PS -- I have not tested this with any trade skill other than fishing, if<br/>
&gt;anyone has any information on those please let me know.<br/>
