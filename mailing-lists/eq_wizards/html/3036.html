<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470730919">According to Garramone, Michael (CCI-Las Vegas):<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I got one LOL.  only time i have ever seen rahotep ever, just happened to<br/>
&gt; hit track running through north ro once hehe.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. That&#39;s why, when you hear someone with the Scepter of Rahotep, the<br/>
Scarab Ring, or something like that, you go aaahhh.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re not overpowered (if they were like JBoot, can you HEAR the cries<br/>
of outrage), but they&#39;re like a badge. If you wield a scepter, wear a<br/>
ring, then you&#39;re *someone*.<br/>
<br/>
But, of course, that doesn&#39;t really interest most powerlevelers, who<br/>
only want the best equipment.<br/>
<br/>
(I remember a dwarven paladin of my friend, whose goal in EQ was to equip<br/>
 with as many &quot;dwarven&quot; items as possible. Rip the shirt from Crush, recover<br/>
 the dwarven axes from Darish, dust the boots, all that)<br/>
