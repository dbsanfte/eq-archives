<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690755055">Skylee i did. I read your very first post on it when i sent the email. And i am talking about guild robes when i wrote that. The robes i was speaking of come from the guilds in erudin. They are one of the only one i know of that have a different robe for each different class. Sorry i was trying to offend you i was just trying to answer to what you said.<br/>
