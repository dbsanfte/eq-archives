&gt; &gt;Yep, I also just got 29. Nice too feel needed with your group Teles. :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I have not had any problem with fizzles since about level 16, so I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt;using Inferno Shock and loving it. I don&#39;t know what good Thunder Strike<br/>
&gt; &gt;is, though. Is it just useless?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Too bad I failed all my research attempts for level 29 spells. But I<br/>
&gt; &gt;think I&#39;ll probably keep using column of Lightning as my AE anyway.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No fizzles at all?  wow.  I think I maxed out my Evocation specialization<br/>
&gt; and I still get fizzles now and again.  I figure I&#39;m not going to use the<br/>
&gt; new DD until 30.  I find it more efficient to use the frost shock for now<br/>
&gt; because we can cast it soo much more at this point.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yeah, it was a real nice surprise, but I was able to make my 29lvl AE spells<br/>
&gt; when I was 24!  I think I really lucked out on that one.  So I was holding<br/>
&gt; it in the bank all this time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not looking forward to &quot;hell-level&quot; are you?  ;P<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think the stories about WIS and fizzles might be true. That&#39;s because<br/>
I rarely fizzle at all, not when Evocating (my concentration,<br/>
obviously).<br/>
<br/>
Hell Level? I think it will be the end of Qenelin. :) I don&#39;t play that<br/>
much, and when I do, I think I&#39;m a tank (got most of 29 by soloing the<br/>
maze in Cazic Thule). So I die a little too much. I think Hell Level<br/>
will become so frustrating that it just might be the log that breaks my<br/>
back.<br/>
<br/>
But we&#39;ll see. I&#39;m having fun with my 29 spells, though.<br/>
