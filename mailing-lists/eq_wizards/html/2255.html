<b>Subject:</b> New graphics? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2122500233">I logged in for a bit and I noticed that my Skull of Jhen&#39;tra (sp?) looked <br/>
like a voodoo doll. I&#39;m glad that they&#39;re adding some more graphics to things <br/>
(anyone else notice another new graphic) but all they&#39;re doing is copying <br/>
other graphics! All they did was copy the graphic of a wooden totem and they <br/>
made the skull look like it. I don&#39;t know if I should interpret this is as a <br/>
good sign or a bad one.<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d let you guys know.</div>
