<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Well you are idiots you have teleport spells which have better lovation then <br/>
&gt;druids you have dd thats what your point in eq was alright god Do necros have <br/>
&gt;witch hats...I dont think so jesus christ eq is fine<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This statement is purely based on your opinion.  In no way am I putting<br/>
wizards or Druids down.  I really like playing my wizard (and I have a<br/>
druid too which is probably my 2nd favorite character).  I&#39;d give up my<br/>
gate inside Cazic for one in Ferrott (bit safer and more centerally<br/>
located).  I&#39;d give up my gate in North Ro for the one in South Ro.<br/>
(Closer to Guk and I already have the one in West Commons for Freeport).<br/>
I wish I had a gate to misty or one to Steamfont.  It would be nice to go<br/>
home to AkAkanon quickly whenever I wanted.  I suppose the Nektulos gate is<br/>
good if your a Dark Elf.  I think the Druid gates are a bit better located<br/>
but I am happy to live with what verant chose to give us.<br/>
<br/>
As a personal request please refrain from describing the people on this<br/>
list as idiots.  Its generally not nice and its hard to determine someone&#39;s<br/>
clinical IQ from email.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Now please correct me if I am wrong.  Why does a druid have the same<br/>
&gt;amount of mana as a wizard?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All mana calculations are done the same for all Casters (not Hybrids).<br/>
Druids, Shamen, and Clerics, generally have less mana than many pure<br/>
casters but only due to the fact that most of the those races don&#39;t have<br/>
wisdom scores as high as the intilligence scores of many pure casting<br/>
races.  Aside from that there is no difference.  Give a Cleric, Druid,<br/>
Shamen, Wizard, Necro, Magician, or Enchanter 150 wis or int and they will<br/>
all have the same mana at the same level.<br/>
Paladins, Rangers and Shadow Kinghts are in the same position with each<br/>
other.  They will all have the same mana if they have equal wis and int<br/>
respectively, at the same level.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;saying that Verant should create the classes correctly.  Wizards are known for<br/>
&gt;magic = more mana points.   Druids use less magic = less mana points.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A: Druids&#39;s don&#39;t play songs.<br/>
B: Bards play songs and they use the Hybrid mana rates to calculate the<br/>
mana that they have for the very few songs that they actually use mana for.<br/>
C: If you ment to mean that we should have more mana than Druids, I don&#39;t<br/>
see why.  Try playing one.  Once you get past the 20s your pretty much a<br/>
mana only person.  Sure you can take a few extra hits (like 2 or 3) and<br/>
maybe you can do a bit more damage in melee but its not that much.  Not to<br/>
bash on Druids as I said earlier I like that class but when stuff his<br/>
hitting for 50 to 70 damage with multiple attacks Druid&#39;s don&#39;t last too long.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps someone, hope it offends no one.<br/>
