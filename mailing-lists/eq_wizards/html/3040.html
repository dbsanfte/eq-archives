<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1313218007">Recently, there have been a number of posts either degrading the wizards<br/>
qualities, or rebutting these.  I thought it might be more convenient to<br/>
just respond to all posts in one, rather than individually.  Please forgive<br/>
if this is a bit confusing.<br/>
<br/>
-First off, Silverion has been comparing the &quot;twinkability&quot; of spellcasters<br/>
to tanks.  I think we&#39;re all pretty much in agreement that tanks twink much<br/>
more easily.  It&#39;s pretty obvious after all.  I agree that Silverion&#39;s<br/>
example wasn&#39;t perhaps the best, but if you take lvl 35 gear and slap it<br/>
onto a wizard (and let&#39;s be generous here: say glowing stein, sacrificial<br/>
dagger, robe of the oracle, etc.) as compared to putting full plate onto a<br/>
cleric, or crafted onto a warrior (which I personally testify is very<br/>
obtainable to lvl 35 types) you immediately notice that the tank twinks are<br/>
much much more effective at low levels.<br/>
<br/>
Now I detest such twinks personally and wouldn&#39;t mind if Verant diminished<br/>
to impact of twinked items [my own private fantasy solution involves some<br/>
random probability of you being assaulted and robbed by higher lvl npc<br/>
raiders if your equipment far exceeds your level, hehe], but the current<br/>
state of imbalance really doesn&#39;t effect wizards in any negative way.<br/>
Seriously, if you watch twinked characters, you&#39;ll notice that usually they<br/>
want to solo (better xp that way, and they are--after all--powergamers).  So<br/>
they weren&#39;t going to group with you anyway, in all likelihood.  Second, the<br/>
newbie zones right now on the mature servers (where twinking is rampant) are<br/>
not overly crowded.  Twinked characters aren&#39;t really interfering with our<br/>
own progression.  They are just being . . . annoying.<br/>
<br/>
While a more level playing field would be nice, Verant certainly shouldn&#39;t<br/>
try to level the playing field by making twinked spellcasters *more*<br/>
effective.<br/>
<br/>
-Second.  Excellent commentary by Vincent Archer.  A few comments of my own.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There are three kind of imbalances that &quot;require&quot; correction:<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First, I think the following are all pretty well thought out imbalances, but<br/>
I have some comments.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; An imbalance that prevents you from adventuring and getting in a group<br/>
&gt; (&quot;we can&#39;t solo&quot; is not an imbalance; EQ&#39;s target is groups, not solo)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I almost agree here.  My disagreement lies in two parts.  First, Verant<br/>
didn&#39;t really intend for individuals to group right off.  Most people solo<br/>
off and on at least until lvl 10, and often lvl 20.  (The benefits of<br/>
grouping show up around level 6 or so, but soloing usually doesn&#39;t become<br/>
&quot;impossible&quot; until the 20&#39;s.)  The classes, IMO, were *designed* to be that<br/>
way.  Afterall, it takes awhile to find your regular group and if you can&#39;t<br/>
do anything solo, you are very apt to quit the game early on.  That&#39;s not in<br/>
Verant&#39;s best interest, or ours.  At any rate, the first 20 levels<br/>
constitutes a pretty substantial part of the game, so *decent* balance in<br/>
the pre 20&#39;s is probably desirable.  My second disagreement is simply a<br/>
matter of degree.  How difficult does it have to be to get into a group or<br/>
adventure before we acknowledge that the imbalance should be fixed?  We all<br/>
know the joys of trying to find a group as a wizard before lvl 12.  And we<br/>
are certainly *less* desirable at many other levels.  Not so much as to be a<br/>
total handicap, but it is there.  I&#39;ve played 4 classes now on The Rathe and<br/>
can say that, for whatever reason (stigma associated with killstealers, our<br/>
inability to buff, or vulnerability during battle, etc.) wizards are a<br/>
difficult class to find a group with.<br/>
<br/>
We have one real perk.  We teleport.  Mind you, it&#39;s not a unique perk, and<br/>
IMO druids sites are a bit better at lower lvls.  Since our access to the<br/>
planes is pretty much cut off, our ability to shine in this area is also<br/>
crimped.  And, of course, people want teleports without necessarily wanting<br/>
to group with you.  [I ran into a real problem in my guild, for instance,<br/>
where people wanted Glyphin to show up and teleport them around, but he was<br/>
always the last person to be asked to group when the guild was decending<br/>
into Guk or Mistmoore, etc.  (with some notable exceptions).]<br/>
<br/>
Now I say all of this to make one point:  The wizard class is certainly<br/>
playable, but it is more FRUSTRATING than the other classes.  You will spend<br/>
more time trying, unsuccessfully, to solo because you can&#39;t find a group.<br/>
You will be persona non grata on many occasions, and you will certainly not<br/>
get the credit you are due in groups most of the time.  So while I&#39;d agree<br/>
that the imbalance as such doesn&#39;t prevent me from playing my wizard, I&#39;d<br/>
point out that I&#39;m spending much less time with him than I used to.  This<br/>
is, IMO, bad for Verant.<br/>
<br/>
Possible fix to be suggested in a moment.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; An imbalanbce that prevents you from leveling and getting in a rgoup<br/>
&gt; with people you want to group with.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, wizards level pretty well I think.  We die more often but since<br/>
we&#39;re the only true spell caster without a pet, we seem to earn xp at a<br/>
greater rate.  I&#39;ve watched enchanters, magicians and necros lvl with me,<br/>
and the playing field in that regard seems pretty fair.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; An imbalance that make a class so unplayable or so easy that people<br/>
&gt; will avoid that class or rush to that class.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, and I certainly agree that an imbalance this extreme is a Bad Thing.<br/>
But long before it gets *that* extreme, it probably merits some course<br/>
correction.  Consider, for instance, what types of people play wizards (and<br/>
let&#39;s be honest here)--a bunch of antisocial jerks.  Oh, not all of us by<br/>
any means.  But the people who read the manual or the newgroups and say to<br/>
themselves, &quot;I want to be able to out blast everyone, kill steal, etc.,&quot;<br/>
these are the sorts of people that go on to choose wizards.  And the rest of<br/>
us have to live with that.  So one the one hand we have more than our fair<br/>
share of The Egotistical and The Puerile, and on the other hand, those of us<br/>
who are truely trying to find groups, make friends, etc. quickly discover<br/>
(or not so quickly in my case) that the other classes are better for social<br/>
symbiotic relationships.<br/>
<br/>
This is a Very Very Bad thing, IMO.  And even if there are enough wizards<br/>
running around that it doesn&#39;t look like there&#39;s a real shortage of them, I<br/>
think we still need to acknowledge that this is a problem.  If you think I&#39;m<br/>
exaggerating, consider the last time you were hunting/camping a valuable mob<br/>
and a wizard 3 levels or higher showed up.  Wasn&#39;t your first thought that<br/>
he/she might be getting ready to kill steal?<br/>

because the other classes were changed, wizards need to be changed, but I<br/>
sure do agree with you that something needs to be done.  (And, btw, I point<br/>
out that my position on this has turned around 180 degrees.)<br/>

experience with dragons.  Give me another 14 lvls or so, hehe.  You may yet<br/>
convince me ;)<br/>
<br/>
Here are my proposed changes, and arguments.  Hear them, and flame away:<br/>
<br/>
First, after some very careful consideration and playing of other mage<br/>
classes, I&#39;ve noticed one area where wizards are at a serious (and, IMO,<br/>
unfair) disadvantage--interrupts.  All other spell casters have pets.<br/>
Because of this, their escape probability is dramatically improved.  Hit F1<br/>
twice, watch pet, pet gets low on health, run, etc., or if you&#39;re getting<br/>
pounded on, back off a bit, let the pet do it&#39;s thing and gate or run.<br/>
Doesn&#39;t always work (say against a high red), but then when it comes to high<br/>
reds, we all die quickly.  The biggest difference is in dealing with the<br/>
&quot;more managable mobs&quot;--blues, and white/blacks, for instance.  If you are a<br/>
careful enchanter/magician/necro, you can solo througout the zone and never<br/>
or rarely die.  Never, never, ever to a green.  You always have time to get<br/>
a head start on a run or a gate.  Because of the xp cost of pets, you don&#39;t<br/>
level at a vastly higher rate, but these classes are much less frustrating.<br/>
We all know the experience where we&#39;re dying to a high green mob, can&#39;t get<br/>
a spell off, can&#39;t run, etc.  Other spell casters can avoid this.<br/>
<br/>
Now the obvious rebutal is that I&#39;m comparing a weakness of the wizard class<br/>
to the strenghts of the others.  Well, sure, but I think it&#39;s still a valid<br/>
comparison.  Wizards are supposed to be pure offense, so no pet.  Fine.  But<br/>
when we&#39;re getting hit, we aren&#39;t pure offense.  We&#39;re pure corpse.  We<br/>
can&#39;t cast to any end.  Our survivability in these cases is tied entirely to<br/>
how far away the zone is.  That&#39;s pure rubbish.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I&#39;d be willing to make one trade concession in the wizard class.<br/>
I&#39;d like our channeling skill to be significantly higher than the other<br/>
spell casters (say an extra 2 pts per lvl).  We need it, and it makes sense<br/>
from virtually every angle (role play, balance, etc.).  And I&#39;d be willing<br/>
to incure an xp penalty for it, to keep leveling balanced.  My point is<br/>
simply that when wizards get into melee situations, they should still have<br/>
some casting ability. It is, after all, the only thing wizards have (unlike<br/>
ALL other casters).  They ought to be the best at channeling.<br/>
<br/>
Second, we need some way to make wizards more of a symbiotic class.  We are<br/>
simply not as desirable for grouping as the other classes in most scenarios.<br/>
There may be many ways of going about this.  Here&#39;s my one suggestion<br/>
(paired down for space purposes, but I think you can see how it could be<br/>
modified for balance, etc.).  Wizards (perhaps with the help of an<br/>
enchanter) should be able to cast their damage spells onto the weapons of<br/>
other classes.  One possible implementation would be to have an &quot;enchanted<br/>
weapon&quot; randomly go off for, say, 1/10th of the total damage possible in the<br/>
spell, for up to 10 hits.  This would allow a wizard to &quot;buff&quot; in a<br/>
meaningful way.  Tanks would want us, and it would increase our<br/>
effectiveness because the damage would cause hate buildup towards the tank,<br/>
not us (which becomes a serious problem at higher levels).  I&#39;ve talked to<br/>
enough non-wizards who loved this idea that I think it worth bringing before<br/>
a group of wizards, possibly for a petition.<br/>
<br/>
couple of last comments:<br/>
<br/>
Micon Bittermage said:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There is one other solution that to me is a lot more in keeping with the<br/>
&gt; AD&D style that I think people are used to - randomization.  You are<br/>
&gt; right tho that virtually all quests are breaks down to kill X and give<br/>
&gt; its head/heart/tongue/whatever to NPC Y.  But randomizing would make<br/>
&gt; them more quest-like.  Easier to explain in an example:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree wholeheartedly.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Lastly, to address the twinking problem:  Maybe the stein instead of<br/>
&gt; giving +10 int would give (+2 times level/10).  Therefore, your level 50<br/>
&gt; wizard has a +10 int stein, but his twinked level 2 wizard has the same<br/>
&gt; stein at +0 int!  Easily explained that with wisdom of levels you gain<br/>
&gt; the ability to use a sword better (damage =level, or something similar),<br/>
&gt; gain more power from the gem, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a good solution, but the problem (as I see it) isn&#39;t the twinked<br/>
wizards, but the twinked tanks.  A glowing stein that gives plus 10 int, is<br/>
only giving a lvl 5 wizard (to pull an example from a hat) an extra 10 mana.<br/>
This is trivial.  In contrast, a warrior wearing several pieces of bronze<br/>
(say 40 or 50 pp worth--substantially less than a glowing stein in value) at<br/>
lvl 1 or 2 gets a significant boost to AC (roughly 50 to 100 AC points).<br/>
I&#39;ve played around enough with low level spell casters and tanks to know<br/>
that the difference is impressive.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I don&#39;t know how twinking should be solved.  I have yet to hear a<br/>
solution I like.<br/>
