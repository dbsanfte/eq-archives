<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146539024">Bolts do more damage, but (a) take longer to cast (b) cost more mana (c)<br/>
you must maintain line of site(i.e.; if they go behind hill before spell<br/>
hits then they wont take any damage), and (d) mostly hit where target<br/>
was at time fired.<br/>
<br/>
By the way allow me to introduce myself, I am Malebion a High Elf Wizard<br/>
currently based out of Felwithe where I was born.  I am at the 10th step<br/>
in the journey for knowledge.  I will be happy to share any knowledge I<br/>
can with my fellow journeymen.<br/>
<br/>
Just consider me your ...friendly neighborhood Wizard ;)<br/>
