<div id="ygrps-yiv-704148406">First of all, I would like to thank Drev and Talarin for their informed opinions and for actually posting something other than &quot;where can I find item X, spell Y&quot;.  Dont worry about telling me I am wrong, I am an Artist/Technical Illustrator in real life, everyday I am told about how I do things wrong and I developed a thick skin many,many years ago! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, I tend to log on to Everquest VERY early in the morning here, (5:00 - 6:00 am EST)  so when I connect to the server there are usually 300-400 people online max.  That means that I can very effectively solo with my Wizard because there is NO competition for blues.  I dont know about anybody else, but lately I have been consistently doing 1 bubble of xp every hour that I play.. I have no idea if that is good or not, but it is perfectly fine for me because I dont come anywhere near dying.  I also realize that that may change as I advance in level, but I tend to move around a lot so I think I should be fine.  Playing that early also means that it is very difficult to group, seems like everyone else is out soloing as well...I dont know, maybe its the time of day?  As well, I have a full time job as Sr. Technical Illustrator which means that I only play 2 hours or so a day, so I am not expecting to be 20th level already.<br/>
<br/>
Actually what truly baffles me is why some people seem so dead set against getting Verant to change Wizard spells.  Whats wrong with fixing something thats broken?  Everyday they keep patching non-working aspects of this game and yet noone seems to care enough to fix Wizard spells, probably because noone complains enough.  Or instead of fixing spells, replace useless ones with some of those beautiful Teleport Other (or was it Tap Affinity?) spells that were mentioned here a while ago.  Awesome.  Fits right in with class description and people would be clamouring for Wizards to be in their group, even at the lower levels.<br/>
<br/>
Well I was going to get in to which spells should be changed and why, but I have yammered on too long as it is.  So I will save it for another post =)<br/>
