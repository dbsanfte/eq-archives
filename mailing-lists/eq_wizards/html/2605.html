<div id="ygrps-yiv-590036862">IMHO the Erudite makes the best wiz.  All races do well in groups but I solo<br/>
90% of the time.  When soloing, for me, its all about mana as I dont get hit<br/>
unless I want to melee a bit.  With the highest starting int, the Erudite<br/>
can have the highest int of any of the races.  I started my Erudite with 140<br/>
int.  I didn&#39;t know exaclty what I was doing at that point so I didn&#39;t max<br/>
my int at 142.  Not that big a deal...  Anyways, with some decent items my<br/>
int is now at 165 and i know i can easily get it to 180 with a few more<br/>
items.  My total mana at level 29 is 1060 compared to 870 without wearing my<br/>
equipment.  190 mana or about 20 percent(one bubble) extra mana makes a huge<br/>
difference.  This is very significant when soloing as it often means the<br/>
difference between taking down that yellow or attacking those two blues.<br/>
Also the Erudite has a very high stamina stat.  This is very important to me<br/>
in that I play on Rallos Zek and two Flame Shocks(lvl 29 DD 237 dmg) will<br/>
very nearly kill me whereas it might kill another race.  This has been the<br/>
difference between other wizzies and I when going head to head...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>All I can say is that I love my Gnome.  Right now my Int is only 130, but<br/>
with a<br/>
decent group I&#39;m never using more than 20% mana in a fight anyway (unless<br/>
things<br/>
get ugly).  I&#39;ve gotten my Dex up to 101 and at level 12 I regain<br/>
concentration<br/>
at least once every 2 fights.  That is when the mob gets to me :).  High<br/>
dexterity and intelligence is great for trade skills.  I&#39;ll gain 2 skill<br/>
points<br/>
for every three to four attempts while baking and brewing, and have a<br/>
success<br/>
rate much higher than the spoiler boards predict.  I certainly hopes this<br/>
holds<br/>
true when it comes to spell research.  I think Gnomes will hold a very clear<br/>
advantage in this area.  I just wish we had more choices when it comes to<br/>
our<br/>
robe selection.<br/>
