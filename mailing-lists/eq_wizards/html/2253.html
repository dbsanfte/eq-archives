<div id="ygrps-yiv-1540829689">I&#39;ve been told that you can get them off pixies and kobold hunters. But I<br/>
haven&#39;t found any myself. I do know that you can buy them from jewelers.<br/>

  Sheildskin (16th level spell) requires a cats eye agate I know because I<br/>
tried to cast and it told me I needed that.  I believe its just one that you<br/>
need.  Of course I couldn&#39;t find one to save my life...<br/>

    Hello All,<br/>
        Could someone please post which spells require reagents and what the<br/>
reagent is for each?<br/>
    Thank you.<br/>
