<div id="ygrps-yiv-886075365">I have zoned from Qeynos South to Erud&#39;s Crossing by swimming. you can zone<br/>
while swimming. i swam all the way from Qeynos to Erud&#39;s isle.  and i teleported<br/>
many times underwater without problem. i think the gate collapse only happens<br/>
when someone is STANDING on your gate position.  because the gate collapse<br/>
happen to me only 4 times and those 4 times happen ALL together within a period<br/>
of 1 min. where all my gate just either fail or collapse.  but after i waited<br/>
awhile, it worked fine.</div>
