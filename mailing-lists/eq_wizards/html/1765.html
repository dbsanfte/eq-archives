<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379935802">I know there was an Argument about this before but it is starting to bother <br/>
me a little.  It seems that all the classes are getting updated except the <br/>
wizard class.  Could someone please give me news that the Eq people didn&#39;t <br/>
forget about us wizards.<br/>
