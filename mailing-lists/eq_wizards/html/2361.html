<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-902554850">I&#39;ve noticed an alarmingly low amount of information about wizards out<br/>
there (on the net and such). There are several websites dedicated to<br/>
many of the other classes from warriors to rogues and druids to<br/>
necromancers. We need a place for wizards. Hehe, not that I have the<br/>
time or energy to do this, but I have enough to recognize the need!<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas on what to do? Rather than having all the same questions asked<br/>
here over and over again we can have a central repository of information<br/>
(faq?). Like for instance, strategies at certain levels, where to hunt,<br/>
spell combinations, class combinations, etc. Let me know if anyone is<br/>
interested maybe we can make something work :)<br/>
