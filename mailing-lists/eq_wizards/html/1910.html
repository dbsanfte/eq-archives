&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been thinking about a few new spells that Verant should implement, tell <br/>
&gt;me what you all think.  Most of these new spells is to reinforce the ability <br/>
&gt;for wizards to travel, so far it appears that Druids are just as good, or <br/>
&gt;even better then wizards with Spirt of the Wolf for traveling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Summon - Teleports group member inside the zone to your location<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To be sure that this is not one exploit for running from combat he must be<br/>
sitting and be in full health<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Phase - Teleports yourself to location of other group member inside zone<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i like this one<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Greater Summon - Teleports group member to your location, even across zones<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to strong i think it gives a warriors fast transportation and annulate need<br/>
of SOW <br/>
You gate and summon<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Greater Phase - Teleports yourself to a group members location, even across <br/>
&gt;zones<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Group Gate - Slow casting spell which teleports group to your bind spot, <br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t leave anyone behind<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is group teleport anywere as you as a wizard can bind an any place you<br/>
wish so you can cast evacuate from dragon lair heal by others out of group<br/>
and gate back in lair to finish wounded dragon only to mention one example<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Retreat - Evacuate version of group gate<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>same as above<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Haste - Increases movement rate for self only.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this can be nice two attacks, faster movement but same time for casting<br/>
spells self only spell.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to seeing other classes get some or all of these <br/>
&gt;spells, such as magicians getting Summon, Clerics Phase, druids group gate, <br/>
&gt;etc.  As a wizard, with my teleportation spells, I never bind myself in the <br/>
&gt;city anymore, now generally only at a zone border, for quick pick up when I <br/>
&gt;get a bit too active with my burns.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Phase and Summon would be just terribly useful, as quite often the puller <br/>
&gt;sometimes grabs a bit more then he can chew, where the magician, wizard, <br/>
&gt;whatever can pull his bacon out of the fire so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the problem is that varant have fear thay will make advance in game too<br/>
fast if you get too powerfull transportation spells.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Phase also would be quite useful, as the wizard, I generally get delegated <br/>
&gt;to go on town runs (by the way, great way of making money, buy silver/copper <br/>
&gt;for plat, various weapons.  Just gate back to the bank, or the nearest gate <br/>
&gt;to your town and sell sell sell) and sometimes my group wandered off <br/>
&gt;somewhere, or I don&#39;t want to run through nasties to get to my group.  So <br/>
&gt;far I lost about half a level in Najena as I&#39;ve discovered Orges can see <br/>
&gt;invis.  It would be nice not having to deal with them.<br/>
