&gt; Please give your thoughts on this:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Traveling from Queynos to Euridan the boat stops at the Cat island.<br/>
&gt; Frequently adventures bring trains of undead to the boat and we wizards<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; stuck on the stopped boat stunned and unable to cast our offensive spells<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; clear up the situation.  I am lvl 16 and got mauled by 6 undead sailors<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; could not get enough time to figure out I couldn&#39;t cast on the boat, not<br/>
&gt; even shadow step/gate to save myself.  I then ran off the boat with 1 bar<br/>
&gt; health remaining and was killed while trying to cast my spells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some would say this is part of the game...I disagree.  I cannot cast my<br/>
&gt; spells (what wizards do best) on a docked boat to defend myself, yet<br/>
others<br/>
&gt; may attack me.  Not fair, I say.  Maybe Verant should allow us to cast<br/>
&gt; spells once the boats dock for loading and unloading?  That would be fair.<br/>
&gt; I agree with their logic on not casting while boat is in motion (you can<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; folks attacking NPC&#39;s from the boat and causing innocents to get killed).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Looking for inputs as I am petitioning this.<br/>
