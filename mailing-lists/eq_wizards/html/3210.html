&gt; &gt; &gt; Absolutly, as a wizard, you are the groups panic<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; button.  Fighting a steady<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stream of blues, a group that includes a cleric will<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; almost have no use for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; us until the puller yells,  &quot;Oh Shit, I pulled<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; something big guys, get<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ready&quot;  That is when we shine.  With our burns,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; nobody can save the situation<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; faster than a wizard.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I disagree.  That&#39;s the situation where an Enchanter<br/>
&gt; &gt; really shines.  Wizards can help, but not as well.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Our best bet in that situation is Evac.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Enchanters are great for debuffing the mob (When they aren&#39;t resisted) But<br/>
&gt; they really lack in doing damage to a mob.  Keeping in mind that both<br/>
&gt; wizards and enchanters are limited by the 6 Level cap rule, so we are<br/>
&gt; talking low red, high yellows here, I would rather place my bets with a<br/>
&gt; wizard than an enchanter.  Wizards, can burn a mob to down to 1/3 - 1/2 of<br/>
&gt; its life chaining DD&#39;s (Even if they are 1 circle down due to matching<br/>
&gt; cold/fire resists) much faster than an Enchanter can Debuff the same mob<br/>

&gt; work, but 2 enchanters in a group are needed to be completely effective,<br/>
&gt; and again resists are an issue.   Charm is out of the question, because<br/>

&gt; boss is here gotta go :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wizards and enchanters are both valuable characters in most groups.  Sure,<br/>
enchanters improve with 2 in a group, but so do wizards.  (Having two nukers<br/>
in a group totally changes the tempo and style of fighting.)  Having played<br/>
both and grouped with both, I&#39;d have to say that enchanters are far better<br/>
at controlling bad pulls and trains, at mid (20+) and high lvls and have<br/>
vastly higher survivability than wizards (pet, buff, AE stun, charm, invis,<br/>
invis vs. undead, illusion for fighting faction benefits, etc.).  This isn&#39;t<br/>
a case of being better or worse though.  Battles with wizards are short.<br/>
Battles with enchanters are long.  Both styles can be good.<br/>
<br/>
If I may comment on your example, though, wizards attacking mobs within<br/>
their lvl range usually require 3 to 4 (usually 4) full hits to kill the mob<br/>
(and wizards get roughly 6 shots of their top-of-the-line spell on full<br/>
mana, sort of like a revolver).  On a *chain burn*, wizards will pull the<br/>
mob on them usually on the second shot (if not the first) and from then on<br/>
have low probability of getting off two more shots before they are dead.<br/>
You can get away with doing this once in a while, but you will die playing<br/>
this way.  A lot.  And this technique will *never* work for you after lvl<br/>
30.  It&#39;s efficient suicide.  So you have to wait for the tank to build up<br/>
hate, or rely on your root line (which I personally loathe).  Despite our<br/>
high damage and short casting times, we get to do a lot of waiting.<br/>
<br/>
On a more nit picky note, tashan, slow (e.g. languid pace--decrease attack<br/>
speed about 45%), and a single strength debuff will about halve the damage<br/>
of most mobs.  (And tashan isn&#39;t always necessary--i.e. know your mob.)<br/>
Whirl can also be good.  But no matter, because enchanter battles are long;<br/>
time is almost never a problem.  And enchanters aren&#39;t just about decreasing<br/>
damage, but distributing it most effectively.  Ever have a tank getting<br/>
pounded into the last bubble of his health by an agro mob?  If the mob is<br/>
low on health, a wizard may be able to save him.  If not, you&#39;d better have<br/>
an enchanter to perform a mind wipe thereby resetting the mob&#39;s agro list,<br/>
or a cleric to perform the resurrection.<br/>
<br/>
Sign of a wizard saving a group from a horrible situation?  Maybe one or two<br/>
tanks dead, and the rest fairly healthy.  Sign of an enchanter saving a<br/>
group from a horrible situation?  No one dead and everyone with about a<br/>
bubble of health left.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;d group with an intelligent enchanter or wizard any day.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S. Don&#39;t charm a mob outside of the battle.  Why bring one more in when<br/>
you already have plenty in front of you?  If they&#39;re too high lvl to charm,<br/>
you can often call in your pet, or fear one, or AE mesmerize, or use some<br/>
other technique (situation dependent--i.e. don&#39;t fear in dungeons, heh).<br/>
Charm has its place, but it&#39;s not a cure-all.<br/>
<br/>
P.P.S.  If you&#39;re getting a lot of resists with your enchanter, you&#39;re doing<br/>
something really really wrong.  You need to compare notes with other<br/>
enchanters and get it straightened out.</div>
