<div id="ygrps-yiv-36950506">They are guildmasters im sorry and shop for erudin necros. <br/>
But forest is full of necros to kill ther is one heretic necromancer wich<br/>
is connected with a quest in erudin cc 15 lv i think. Also here is one<br/>
realy high necro near skeleton mines zone border but he is better leave in<br/>
pace, also you can kill a necro near boat to kera isle and also on kera<br/>

&gt;Basically I&#39;d like to know, what level are those heretics in the hut on the<br/>
&gt;Erudin entrance side of the Toxxulia forest? As well, how many of them are<br/>
&gt;there? I went there around 5-6th level and was immediately slaughtered. I&#39;d<br/>
&gt;like to go back and administer some chastisement, but what are they? If<br/>
&gt;they&#39;re guidmaster/teacher stuff then there&#39;s no way. However, if they&#39;re<br/>
&gt;just a bunch of NPCs meant to be killed, then....heh heh heh...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot; I dance and spin and all have fun, for my prince&#39;s sake I am undone... &quot;<br/>
