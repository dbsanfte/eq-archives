<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-352519591">I am currently in the process of creating a Wizard Guild on Karana.<br/>
We have half of the members necessary to send in our info to Verant. We have<br/>
many plans on the basis of this guild.<br/>
<br/>
Sick of having to deal with the KS&#39;ing reputation that Wizards have? We will<br/>
help others who are having problems with ANY KS&#39;ers and promote Wizards&#39;<br/>
abilities in a very positive manner.<br/>
<br/>
Sick of having less-than-ideal equipment because no one cares that you want<br/>
to go to location X to get item Y? I have grouped with many Wizards at once,<br/>
we get the items that we want that no one else cares about. We have<br/>
developed very effective strategies that doesn&#39;t have any down time that you<br/>
think a group of wizards would have. Also, I believe that there is anything<br/>
wrong with GIVING fellow Wizards hand-me-downs (making sure that the item in<br/>
question isn&#39;t too powerful for person in question).<br/>
<br/>
We always GIVE extra runes or extra spells (which ever the person prefers)<br/>
to those who need them.<br/>
This is the only problem that Wizards have with joining this guild. Some<br/>
feel that they are given more runes by being surrounded by those who don&#39;t<br/>
need them. I totally agree with them.<br/>
I totally feel, however, that this disadvantage is far out-weighed.<br/>
<br/>
These are just some of the main focuses of our guild.<br/>
If you have any comments or suggestions or desire to join, PLEASE email me.<br/>
I love to hear what people think about this guild.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you want to start a Wizard guild on a different server, email me<br/>
and I will give you all kinds of info and help to get you started.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading,<br/>
