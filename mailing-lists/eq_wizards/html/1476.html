<div id="ygrps-yiv-302327013">The one thing I have never seen in any of the spell guides is the Damage to<br/>
Time ratio.  I think it would be an interesting project to figure these out.<br/>
The way I see it we would need to compile the following information.<br/>
<br/>
1) Spell cast<br/>
2) Your Level / Channeling Skill Level<br/>
3) Actual Time to cast (From button push until the casting bar finishes)<br/>
4) Time for partial recovery (From button push until the next spell can be<br/>
cast)<br/>
5) Time for complete recovery (From button push until the spell can be recast)<br/>
<br/>
So if you are interested, breakout that old shock -o- frost and stopwatch and<br/>
help me with this endeavor.  Any questions, comments, additions or deletions<br/>
please feel free to respond.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Malkin</div>
