<br/>
Firstly, I agree with the root duration indicator, that relly would save<br/>
a lot of our fellow wizards life. Secondly, I dont agree with us getting<br/>
buffing spells like SOW, that really belongs to the Shamans, it&#39;s one of<br/>
the spells that makes them what they are, we need other unique buffers<br/>
like magic resistence and in particular AE defense spells.<br/>
