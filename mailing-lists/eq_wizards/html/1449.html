<div id="ygrps-yiv-1507714093">I would just like to relate a tale from the other day.  I am level 12 and<br/>
found a level 12 necro to group with.  The two of us (and his pet skeleton)<br/>
took on dervishes in the North Desert of Ro and did very well for ourselves.<br/>
I would usually pull the mob with a Lightning spell to soften him up to the<br/>
tune of 78 damage.  The necro would immediately cast some DoT spells and<br/>
have his skeleton attack before the mob got to us.  His skeleton would then<br/>
begin tanking on a mob who had between half and 2/3 life with DoT spells<br/>
whittling away at it.  If we were only fighting a blue we would both usually<br/>
step in and assist in melee to kill the mob.  This would only use up about<br/>
20% of our mana, so we could take on 3 or 4 blue mobs in succession (singles<br/>
of course).  If we took on a yellow mob I would usually cast shock again<br/>
towards the end of the fight (medding in between) and the necro would use<br/>
mend bones to keep his pet alive through the fight.  In each case we would<br/>
both use roughly the same amount of mana and end up having to med the same<br/>
amount of time to regain.  The highlight of our little adventure was when we<br/>
accidentally took on 3 mobs at once, 1 yellow and 2 blues i think.  I blew a<br/>
little extra mana taking the yellow out in a hurry, but still had enough to<br/>
shock each of the blues one time to where we could melee them.  We both had<br/>
low hitpoints and no mana at the end of the fight but his pet was still<br/>
alive.<br/>
<br/>
So basically the point of this message is twofold.  One to show that we have<br/>
about the same downtime as other magic using classes, and two to show how<br/>
well different magic using classes complement each other.  When soloing even<br/>
monsters I will eat up almost all my mana, and the necro would do the same<br/>
having to cast several DoTs and then mending bones to keep his pet alive.<br/>
The necro does a great amount of damage like wizards but it takes time, and<br/>
all that time his pet is getting hammered.  Wizards can blast the monster<br/>
quick, and the time that we save in combat we can use medding.  This holds<br/>
true with the other magic using classes that have pets as well.  They cant<br/>
just blast the monster like we wizards.  They must deal with a longer battle<br/>
and thus are fighting while we have already killed the mob and are medding.<br/>
If you think about it you will see that it all evens out.<br/>
