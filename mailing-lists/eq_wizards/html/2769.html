<div id="ygrps-yiv-740663124">That would be a shame.  Does anyone know the reasoning behind making Sr<br/>
Apprentice robes No Trade/No Drop anyway.  It doesn&#39;t make sense to me.  Its a<br/>
store bought item for crying out loud!  Oh well, time to write another E-mail to<br/>
Verant.  I really enjoy reading their canned responses.<br/>
