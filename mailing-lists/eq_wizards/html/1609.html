<b>Subject:</b> Nice place to hunt at lv 11 - 13 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-395558029">I come to PAW at lv 12 and i found that there are excelelent place to go<br/>
up level from 12 to 13 killing snakes with excelent loot i found in media<br/>
4.5 gold for a kill all time also geting experience ! Every now and then<br/>
comes sombody who wish to group with a wizard and you can lv fast. Much<br/>
much less trains than in other zones and i never seen more then 14 people<br/>
in. As this is also place where can be found a magic runed totem staffs and<br/>
snakeskin armour peaces you can make much money and god experience too. If<br/>
you hunt snakes you are out of a way wich pass a Nixx Nenix a deadly 25 -<br/>
30 ? lv necromancer wich come every now and then to kill all gnolls and all<br/>
players wich he found around. I sugest to come with full food and water as<br/>
nearest place to buy food is gypsy camp in north karana and there is all<br/>
full of patroling giants and griffons.<br/>
<br/>
My tactic in this place is to bind me right out of entrance in paw and then<br/>
work my way to snake nests evoiding fights against more than one gnoll<br/>
guard at a time. if i go in trouble i gate fast right to entrance in s<br/>
karana . it is also nice to gate back after i selled my loot. Just brought<br/>
a Runed totem staff for 15 Plat !! and i have 2 snakeskin jackets and<br/>
gloves to sell. but i dont know wich price can i ask for them.<br/>
<br/>
Ok its all from <br/>
