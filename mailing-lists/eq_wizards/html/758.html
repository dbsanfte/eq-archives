<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802437193">I have heard that it was in lesser faydark...  near the first orc camp..    I looked all around there, and couldn&#39;t find him.  I have heard rumors that there was a giant wasps nest..  could that be it?  What spawns at the Monument?  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks.</div>
