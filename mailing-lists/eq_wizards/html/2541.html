  i was at the docks of freeport waiting for the boat when i started swimming around... i saw a shark and decided &quot;what the hell... i&#39;ll kill it&quot; so i did... i looted it, and there was nothing on it, but then, when the corpse dissapeared i noticed a bag on the ocean floor, i picked it up and it was a &quot;locked chest&quot; and it was a lore item... didn&#39;t know what to make of it so i used the identify spell on it... it says it&#39;s an Ebon mask shipment.... anyone know what it&#39;s for? quest? </span></blockquote></div>
