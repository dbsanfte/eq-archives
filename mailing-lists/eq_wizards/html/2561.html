<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945182904">Hmm we are transport masters and ultimate fast damage dealers! We deal<br/>
damage fast so fast that no other class can competete with us in how much<br/>
damage we can do in same amount of time.<br/>
This is useful when two groups contest a same monster a group with a wizard<br/>
will get it ehehe easy to see around besouse of so called kill stealing.<br/>
But as masters of mana eficents are Necros they with new patch do damage<br/>
twice as fast as before !! And they do much more damage then wizard for<br/>
same amount of mana.<br/>
I think that this is primary reason of fastering our spells in upkoming<br/>
patch to compensate a faster damage dealing by necros.<br/>
<br/>
This comes from reply thet i got from a Verant about similar question.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Magicians get their damage spells every other level when a wizard get them<br/>
every level and they are slower in casting them then wizards are. Wizards<br/>
get many more diferent Direct damage spells class on every turn. Like a<br/>
Area efect AE, personal PAE, Bolts ect<br/>

&gt;I know that the purpose of the wizard class is to do heavy damage quickly.<br/>
&gt;A friend of mine was telling me that mages do almost the same damage plus<br/>
&gt;they have a pet to fight for them.  He does close dmg to me now at lvl 20.<br/>
&gt;He says at lvl 49 mages do lava bolt which does 950 whereas ice comet does<br/>
&gt;1100.  That is almost the same damage as the wizard.  So it seems to me<br/>
&gt;that there isn&#39;t much of a use to be a wizard if you can be a mage and do<br/>
&gt;almost the same amount of direct damage plus you have a pet.  So anyone<br/>
&gt;tell me something good about the wiz class to make it worth playing them to<br/>
&gt;high levels?<br/>
