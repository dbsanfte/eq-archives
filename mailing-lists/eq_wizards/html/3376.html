<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-413116632"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;A friend wishes a nightshade wreath (and from the stats who wouldnt). <br/>
&gt;Another friend had this to say....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Nightshade wreath is in the DEEPEST part of Mistmoore<br/>
&gt;castle&#39;s first level.... TONS of mobs to get by.. yes you can get by them<br/>
&gt;with inviso and if your high enough (48th+ or so) you can solo pull mobs<br/>
&gt;away from her &quot;door.&quot;  But alas shes (Maid Issisi) guarded by 3 mobs and <br/>
&gt;theres a few right nearby.. so its kinda tough... <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, can anyone suggest strategy or spells or classes or levels to go after <br/>
&gt;this thing? Ive never seen one auctioned, but heard that they are trade only.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A very hard place to get to indeed.  Take a Bard, or an Enchanter with you<br/>
for lul or for mez spells.  higher the level the better.  I would of said a<br/>
monk, but as I am sure most monks agree, they would only cause more trains<br/>
than aid.<br/>
I don&#39;t recomend just heading there invis.  It would be best if you can get<br/>
a group all above 40 and clear the place as you go.  A cleric is probably a<br/>
good thing to have here as the damage can pile up quick.  Keep magic resist<br/>
buffs up at all times.<br/>
<br/>
I do believe the wreath is the common drop, but I am not positive.  A<br/>
better item for us is the runed cowel from Lower Guk 2ac 5wis 9int.  It<br/>
happens to be the rare drop, but personally its an easier area to get to.<br/>
Just a much longer camp.  Expect to wait 6hrs min and even then its<br/>
definatly not a sure thing.<br/>
