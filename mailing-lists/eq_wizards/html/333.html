<div id="ygrps-yiv-1380569015">The next root spell comes along at lvl 20.  And no matter what he starting at lvl 12 he will not be able to do more direct dmg than you.  Then as you gain lvls the gap will grow.  Necro&#39;s are better solo fighters than wizards, but nobody does more dmg quicker than a wizard.  Hang in there, it takes a lot of patience to build a good wizard, but when you really start to get good you&#39;ll be one of (if not the) most powerful chars in the game.<br/>

    I have a DE Necro friend, no matter what i do, he can always do it better, he can solo monsters that /con yellow w/o his pet because of the vampiric touch type spells, and he can take on even more WITH his pet! i can&#39;t even catch up with exp anymore! is there ever going to be a point when i can just kick ass? <br/>
    <br/>
    P.S. whens the next root spell come along? level 12?</div>
