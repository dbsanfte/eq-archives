<b>Subject:</b> Re: Whether to Repond to whole list or individual <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-546262210">I have to disagree with this.  Remember, not all people have been on this<br/>
list since day 1.  Even those who have, however, do not always follow every<br/>
thread from the beginning.  It&#39;s a real help to have *at least* the previous<br/>
message quoted (or at least those parts to which the writer is responding<br/>
to).<br/>
<br/>
I agree with trimming them, however.  It&#39;s pretty pointless when a person&#39;s<br/>
response is only a 1-liner, and they insist on quoting the ENTIRE message...<br/>
<br/>
My vote, however, is to keep the one-liners coming.  Sometimes there is some<br/>
useful information in them.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t even begun playing the game yet (don&#39;t have a decent enough system<br/>
to install it on).  However, if it wasn&#39;t for all of the messages on this<br/>
list, I probably would have decided against playing a wizard.  Now, I can<br/>
tell you exactly what race/class combo I&#39;m going to play when I get my new<br/>
system :)<br/>
<br/>
All you have to do, folks, is filter your e-mail.  Of course your going to<br/>
get pi$$ed if your inbox keeps filling up.  Solution:  Don&#39;t let your inbox<br/>
fill up!  Have your client filter the message to a new folder (real mystery,<br/>
I know).<br/>

&gt; I, too, like reading the responses.  What would help tho is if<br/>
&gt; those who reply<br/>
&gt; would (as I have done here) retitle the subject line to reflect<br/>
&gt; what you&#39;re talking<br/>
&gt; about AND delete everything but your reply... in other words DO<br/>
&gt; NOT include<br/>
&gt; original text in the reply.<br/>
