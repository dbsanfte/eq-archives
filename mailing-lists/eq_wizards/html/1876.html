&gt;This is what I was talking about in an earlier post, but was assured by<br/>
&gt;many others that it gets better at higher levels, like in the 20&#39;s to 30&#39;s<br/>
&gt;(I&#39;m 11 now). I thought at the time that this was a ridiculously long time<br/>
&gt;to wait for the game to get better for wizards. Why SHOULD it have to take<br/>
&gt;so long? Now I see from someone with a lot more experience than I that it<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t get better. I think we need to seriously petition Verant about the<br/>
&gt;shortcomings of the wizard class. We need more buff spells to help<br/>
&gt;ourselves and our parties, and spells of protection, like you mentioned. It<br/>
&gt;seems to me that this is the sort of things wizards should be able to do<br/>
&gt;anyway. <br/>
<br/>

Buffs and protections would cause our image to stray away from that... but<br/>
damage shields, now there is a different story.  Radiation needs to be<br/>
seriously revamped or made the first in a series of spells.  <br/>
<br/>
Radiation as it stands does a dinky 2-pts of damage.  I can do better than<br/>
that closing with the mob in melee - an idea which my character finds<br/>
positively abhorrant.  Our melee skills are the worst in the game (or so<br/>
I&#39;ve heard), yet we get more damage out of them than O&#39;Keil&#39;s Radiation?<br/>
What does this say about the spell? Assuming a non-magical weapon, we<br/>
should never have to use a melee skill to do more damage than a spell<br/>
against any critter.  <br/>
<br/>
If there is room for improvements with out upsetting the game balance, make<br/>
them.  I&#39;m playing a low level character right now (3rd circle) and I&#39;ve<br/>
got a long, long way to go.  I just don&#39;t want to get there and find out<br/>
the class is not all I been expecting it to be.<br/>
