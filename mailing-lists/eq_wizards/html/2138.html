<b>Subject:</b> group tactics? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908181933">That&#39;s a good question.  It really depends.  Assuming you have a balanced <br/>
group (ie a healer, a tank or two, and some nukers) more likely than not, <br/>
you&#39;ll have enough time in the group during battles to dictate who needs to <br/>
run and when.  My regular group finds it best to have the tank buffed up <br/>
with SOW so that he/she can run when necessary without jeapardizing (sp?) <br/>
the rest of the group.  If it&#39;s a controlled & organized party, the <br/>
creature(s) will most likely all be attacking your &quot;pulling&quot; tank.<br/>
<br/>
If I find myself in an unfamiliar group I kinda play it by ear.  It&#39;s a lot <br/>
different playing against orcs in Oasis & CB versus training Dry Bone Skels <br/>
in Unrest.  Main thing I found helpful is to call out who you&#39;re assisting <br/>
in a fight so that everybody can zero in on one creature at a time.  /ASSIST <br/>
is our friend. :)<br/>
<br/>
I try not to cast too early as to call attention from a tank.  And I try not <br/>
to cast too little as to have left my tank high and dry.  I think it&#39;s our <br/>
obligation to make sure we are not engaged in melee during battle so as to <br/>
not be interrupted during attacks and so the tanks need not chase the <br/>
creature about.<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes make judgement calls if I feel that my tank is not going to make <br/>
it to zone.  I have sometimes let loose on spells to draw some creatures to <br/>
me....with Shieldskin up, I can afford to absorb some blows where I can then <br/>
choose to run them away from the tank or to keep their attention while my <br/>
tank hits them from behind.  This works OK, but it sometimes results in a <br/>
gory death. :)  But this is no problem if you trust your party...tanks die <br/>
for you...be willing to die for your tanks sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Whoa, I&#39;ve talked too much.  Hope these tips help somebody.  I am by no <br/>
means an expert so don&#39;t expect these to work for everybody.  I&#39;d like to <br/>
encourage everybody to express some of their battle tactics here rather than <br/>
argue all the time! hehe<br/>
