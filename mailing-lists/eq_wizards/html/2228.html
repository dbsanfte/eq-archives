Well I&#39;m back from my much needed long weekend and would like to get the<br/>
ball rolling again.  I made some very minor changes to the petition, and<br/>
unless a lot of people have major problems with it, I think its time to<br/>
start posting it around (maybe Wed, or Thursday).  Since nobody really<br/>
wants to spend the time collecting names I Feel we should post the<br/>
petition to EQ-Vault, Stratistics, alt.games.everquest, etc. and ask<br/>
people that agree with the petition to send an in-game /feedback to<br/>
express their support.  In addition, we can mail a copy to everquest<br/>
with an e-mail address for feedback.  Does this sound okay with<br/>
everybody?  Also, by using the in game feedback you can have the<br/>
opportunity to add examples to the items, if you feel it necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>

Dear EverQuest Staff,<br/>
<br/>
We are a large group of wizards who have come together through a mailing<br/>
list. Through much discussion and debate, we have agreed to send you<br/>
this feedback concerning improvements to the wizard. We would like to<br/>
thank you in advance for your careful consideration of these<br/>
modifications.<br/>
<br/>
1) Spells are 100% resisted by mobs 6+ levels above the caster. In large<br/>
groups hunting big prey this level cap turns a wizard from the main<br/>
dealer of damage to a useless member in the group. Our suggestion is<br/>
that either the cap be raised to 6+ levels of the highest member in the<br/>
group, or the cap be raised to 8+ levels higher than the caster.<br/>
<br/>
2) Spells that both stun and damage targets are often resisted by mobs<br/>
that /con green and blue. If this is the result of the stun effect, we<br/>
would like one spell without this effect at the same level.<br/>
<br/>
3) Many spell suggestions have crossed this list. Here is one that we<br/>
all feel would be a great addition.<br/>
<br/>
Tap Affinity - Teleport targeted group member to their own bind spot<br/>
<br/>
4) O&#39;Kiels Radiation seems that it would be the beginning of a great<br/>
line of spells. Why should it end there? Additional spells of this type<br/>
would be a very welcome addition.<br/>
<br/>
5) Wizards seem to be very neglected when it comes to carrying or<br/>
wearing items that enhance our appearance. In addition, many completely<br/>
different spells have the same visual effects.<br/>
<br/>
We would like to thank you again for your time. Any type of feedback<br/>
would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
The Wizards of Norrath<br/>
