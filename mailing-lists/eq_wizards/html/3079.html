<div id="ygrps-yiv-1883750122">According to Joe Wallace:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I suppose, to some people you would be someone.  But to me, I just can&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; how being lucky enough to find a rare drop makes you someone.  I was lucky<br/>
&gt; enough to get a double-bladed bone axe from a wandering npc, an item a lot<br/>
&gt; of people have never heard of, but it just doesn&#39;t seem so cool.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know.  I guess with everyone looking like clones, people are desperate to<br/>
&gt; look different or be different in some way.  I remember once just walking<br/>
&gt; around wearing nothing, just to be different, since my character in his<br/>
&gt; &quot;gear&quot; looks like everyone else.  Someone wanted to know where I had died.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hehe. I know a little gnomish wizard who walks around looking like a newbie<br/>
or something. Shirt and a doll-figure in hand, so people wonder, what is his<br/>
class and level? Some level 5 cleric, maybe?<br/>
<br/>
Then they inspect him, and find Dragoon Dirk, Skull of Jhen-Thra, loads of<br/>
int/mana jewelry. What they ask, no wizard robe?<br/>
<br/>
No sirree, no dinky bathrobe, whatever the color.<br/>
