<b>Subject:</b> Re: Thinking about adventuring to Guk tonight- advice needed <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2012749483"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Is it possible to make it to Guk alive for a High Elf?<br/>
&gt;I am interested in getting some better armour myself,<br/>
&gt;but do not desire to die at the hands of guards. Any<br/>
&gt;advice would be appreciated.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Most assuredly. There&#39;s no guards to be found around Guk other than near the<br/>
entrance to Grobb. There&#39;s an npc trollslayer wandering about but he ignored<br/>
me, and I know there&#39;s another troll npc called Zipthipple or something but<br/>
didn&#39;t see her. When you enter Innothule swamp from South Ro take a left and<br/>
follow the mountain. This will take you to Guk, cave opening, and quite<br/>
large, can&#39;t miss it. If you continue along the mountain you&#39;ll come to<br/>
Grobb. Don&#39;t go there. Nasty. guards will nail you bad.<br/>
