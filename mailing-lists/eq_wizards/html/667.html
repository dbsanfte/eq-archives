<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604353126">My opionion is wait and see.  I mean, if we KNEW this was going to be in an<br/>
upcomming patch, then feedbacking ahead of time would be fine to ward it<br/>
off.  As it stands right now, we would likely just be filling the feedback<br/>
cues with messages asking them not to do something they weren&#39;t going to do<br/>
anyway and wasting time that would be better spent fixing actual problems<br/>
with the game.  Of course, that&#39;s just my opinion.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; So.. should we all wait to see if its just a rumor?  or should we all<br/>
petition today stating that it would ruin the game for us?    Opinions<br/>
please.<br/>

&gt; &gt; This is nuts.  Wizards have it tough already getting to high levels.<br/>
Until<br/>
&gt; &gt; lvl 12 or so you are effectively a magician with no pet (and therefore a<br/>
&gt; &gt; pretty weak magician.)  If they hurt wizards offensively there would<br/>
have to<br/>
&gt; &gt; be some change defensively to offset it.  I mean, wizards only real way<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; survive is nuke the critter into oblivion fast enough that it can&#39;t take<br/>
&gt; &gt; down your paltry hit point pool through your nearly nonexistant AC.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; seriously think this is just a rumor, though.  EQ is balanced to be PvE,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; a Wizard is, in general, not better off than any other classes.  I mean,<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; &gt; high levels you may be the only one who can solo a Hill Giant, but after<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; &gt; do that a young lion could maul you because it takes all your mana to<br/>
kill<br/>
&gt; &gt; the giant.  I think the drill here is remain calm and then if they gimp<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; wizards flood them with polite feedbacks on why this was bad.  Heck,<br/>
Wizards<br/>
&gt; &gt; were gimped right near the end of beta, too, and feedbacks seem to have<br/>
&gt; &gt; improved that situation.<br/>
