<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-402041745">Like most of you at level 22 and beyond we have trained in Specialize. <br/>
I have a few questions I&#39;m sure you may have the answers to.<br/>
<br/>
1: How do we know if a particular CASTING has utilized the<br/>
Specializatioin Skill of that particular magic type (i.e. evocation,<br/>
abjuration) to see if we got a savings of mana useage?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2:  My Skill in Evocation Specialization is at 51.  I am level 24 now<br/>
and cannot put any training points into it.  Is there something wrong<br/>
or can I not apply any more points until a later level or never?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the support<br/>
<br/>
