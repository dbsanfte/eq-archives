<b>Subject:</b> Wizzards and the assertion that we can solo. (long, sorry) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1549543138">Recently, there has been the raging conversation in regards to our<br/>
merits as a class. I&#39;d like to relate a little experience of mine.<br/>
<br/>
I play a dark elf wizard on Karana. I role play the character as well<br/>
as possible given each situation. This means that I am leveling rather<br/>
slowly as I don&#39;t go straight to a camp and start in.<br/>
<br/>
Dayne(the wiz) is currently 12th level. I started him at retail<br/>
release day one. I have many other higher level characters though that<br/>
I do not rp as much as Dayne.<br/>
<br/>
Dayne IS NOT capable of soloing most blues, nor some greens. It IS<br/>
that simple. Root holds about 50% of the time. BLUES resist about 25%<br/>
of my spells.<br/>
<br/>
My points were split between mostly intel and then a bit to agil. He<br/>
is in partial woven armor and the rest cloth. He has two gator<br/>
earrings, two derv rings and a heart amulet. He wields a RTS for a<br/>
weapon or snake fang(can&#39;t hit a damn thing with the RTS at a skill of<br/>
48).<br/>
<br/>
Dayne met his death at the fangs of a green con asp the other day<br/>
while trying to collect a quest item with a friend. My root failed<br/>
twice, my lightning did around 30 points twice and then I went to<br/>
lower shocks and finally killed the thing. It poisoned me on the last<br/>
hit, which killed me as I only had a sliver of life left. This case is<br/>
not out of the ordinary for solo work(all with no exp I might add, a<br/>
healthy loss for dying by the green). The only times I don&#39;t run are<br/>
on the rare occasions I can&#39;t find a group, is when I get a root off<br/>
on the first shot and I don&#39;t fizzle spells(which thank god is rare).<br/>
<br/>
I played other wizards in beta and never had these problems with them.<br/>
<br/>
I absolutely CANNOT damage any red creatures except with radiation.<br/>
Even when they are just red to me. I can hurt a yellow about 50% of<br/>
the time. I hit blues around 75%. I am very useless to a group of<br/>
similar level. This makes leveling even more slow. I only accept<br/>
invites when I am the highest level char in a group. This leaves me<br/>
fighting blues and some greens and a rare yellow. Any idea how long it<br/>
takes to level this character? The terrible thing is that I have to<br/>
change partners often as they easily pass me up so not even the role<br/>
playing is keeping this character fun. It&#39;s become a little silly when<br/>
I help a lower level group one day and a few days later, I can&#39;t even<br/>
group with them again due to a level spread.<br/>
<br/>
I am not looking forward to the level 20-23 hellish levels I remember<br/>
from beta either.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, please don&#39;t clog the list up with complaints about my whining<br/>
either, this was sent to let all those having an easy time with their<br/>
wizards know that others are not having it so simple. If you read this<br/>
post and see it as a whining about a weak character, I simply don&#39;t<br/>
care. If you have a beef with the post, send it to me, not the list<br/>
unless others will benefit from reading it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I hope that this character is in the minority out there, but I<br/>
see quite a few weak wizards running about and almost none soloing.<br/>
I&#39;d appreciate any constructive advice anyone could give. Please keep<br/>
in mind that I have several high level characters and this is not a<br/>
lack of experience typing here. The other characters can function in a<br/>
group.<br/>
