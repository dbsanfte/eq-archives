<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1454225633">I really don&#39;t see how AE spells are useful at all.  The only way I can see<br/>
it being useful is if I root a group of mobs close together, but how often<br/>
does that happen?  If i am in a party and the tanks are fighting a group of<br/>
mobs, the AE spell will hit my party members too so what is the point?  Can<br/>
anyone enlighten me here, maybe I am missing something.  Thanks.</div>
