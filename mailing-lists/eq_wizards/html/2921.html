&gt;      Subject: [eq_wizards] What is the best way to raise faction<br/>
&gt;      level with the Merchants of Felwithe?Hello, fellow<br/>
&gt;      Wizards! Several weeks ago I participated in a guild war and<br/>
&gt;      slew a High Elf not knowing that there would be a faction<br/>
&gt;      hit as a result. Well, I can no longer purchase or sell<br/>
&gt;      items in Felwithe. I&#39;ve tried everything that I know of to<br/>
&gt;      improve my faction standing with the Merchants there, but to<br/>
&gt;      no avail. My faction standing with the guards is &quot;amiable&quot;<br/>
&gt;      -- It is with the &quot;Merchants&quot; that I need a faction<br/>
&gt;      adjustment. Does anyone have any ideas? Suggestions?<br/>
&gt;      Personal experience? Would appreciate any and all<br/>
&gt;      advice. Wizzy LightseekerL25 Gnome WizardSolusek Ro<br/>
