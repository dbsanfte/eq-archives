<br/>
Sometimes when you attack a Goblin or Orc Centurion a nearby low level (Whelp or<br/>
Pawn) or two will be attracted as well, when this happens O&#39;keils Radiation can<br/>
take them out without you having to pay them any attention at all. Yes it is a low<br/>
level, low damage spell but it effects anything that attacks you each time it<br/>
attacks you, and it&#39;s a pretty cheap spell to purchase as well.<br/>
<br/>
I use O&#39;Keils Radiation to hunt Orc pawns and Goblin whelps, it uses little mana<br/>
and between it and my staff i can usually take one out in a couple of seconds.  By<br/>
the way dont discount these guys, I have found backpacks, good armor, and other<br/>
items of cash value on them.  No they don&#39;t provide exp once you get past the<br/>
early levels but in numbers they can pay for that extra spell you want so badly,<br/>
and its something you can hunt solo.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I have a few questions...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;1.  Spell damage seems to be linked to level somehow, anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt;have any idea how?  Is it just 1 extra point per level?  Is<br/>
&gt; &gt;it spell dependant?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;For example, as a fifth level wizard using Shock of Fire, I was<br/>
&gt; &gt;consistantly doing 13 points of damage.  After going to 6th<br/>
&gt; &gt;level, I am consistantly doing 14 points.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes it does 1 additional damage per lvl but there is a cap. Shock of Fire<br/>
&gt; caps at 15 dmg if i remember correctly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;2.  Also, I have been playing around with the spells, and I am having<br/>
&gt; &gt;trouble getting O&#39;keils Radiation to work.  How does it work and<br/>
&gt; &gt;what is the best way to use it?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; My opinion is O&#39;keils is really a waste of mana, i bought it for my Wiz<br/>
&gt; during P4 (of course it wasn&#39;t working during P4)<br/>
&gt; Since then i have seen it cast on others and people have cast it on me.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s like a shielding spell that does damage to<br/>
&gt; monsters that are close to you. The problem with it in my opinion is that<br/>
&gt; it doesn&#39;t last nearly long enough to make it<br/>
&gt; worth casting. Total time it lasts about 30 secs or so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;3.  Any idea where I can find a Glimpse spell in Freeport?  I have<br/>
&gt; &gt;tried the guild and can not find it for sale.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not that<br/>
&gt; &gt;great<br/>
&gt; &gt;of a spell, but I think it&#39;s the only one I don&#39;t have.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No idea .. sorry ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;                                                        Thanks,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;                                                            Soren<br/>
&gt; &gt;                                                            Wizard Level<br/>
