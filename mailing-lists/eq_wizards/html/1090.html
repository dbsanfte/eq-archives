Subject: [eq_wizards] What level for Invisibility?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi all, this is my first posting to this mail list, but i have read all the<br/>
archives.<br/>
Great info by the way, much better stuff here than other lists I have read..<br/>
<br/>
To my point...  At exactly what level do we Wizards have access to the<br/>
Invisibility Spell?<br/>
<br/>
I have seen some postings which say 8th, but I am fairly sure every time I<br/>
have seen  <br/>
it it says 16th level required !?!<br/>
<br/>
Just confused is all because I am sure it said Level:16 on the spell...  <br/>
Maybe I was looking at another Classes version of the spell???  <br/>
 <br/>
Please help a befuddled Apprentice...I am desperately trying to get from<br/>
Qeynos to<br/>
Freeport to group with some RL friends and have already died trying to get<br/>
there...<br/>
<br/>
Awaiting your collective wisdom with baited breath.... <br/>
<br/>
Alhassim,<br/>
4th Level Erudite Wizard of E&#39;ci<br/>
<br/>
P.S. - Does anyone on E&#39;ci regularly make the trip from Qeynos to Freeport?<br/>
If so, please mention and I can keep an eye out for you and maybe tag along?</div>
