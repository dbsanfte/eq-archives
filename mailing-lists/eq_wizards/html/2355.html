&gt; There is no such thing as bug free software. At least i&#39;ve never seen any<br/>
&gt; such thing. You live with the fact that<br/>
&gt; your operating system (i&#39;m guessing most of you are running some sort of MS<br/>
&gt; Windows) crashes quite often.<br/>
&gt; We were promised plug-n-play and we got plug-n-pray. Yet we still go out<br/>
&gt; and buy these buggy pieces of software.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Why ? because at the end of the day it&#39;s usually better than what we<br/>
&gt; currently have and we are willing to put up with<br/>
&gt; the bugs that are in it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And this should not be tolerated. What you are basically saying is that there&#39;s<br/>
nothing we can do about it, software has always had bugs and it&#39;s relatively ok<br/>
and usable.<br/>
<br/>
What I am saying is that it is so because of the relatively small market. There<br/>
is little competition, so developers allow themselves the luxury of imperfection.<br/>
I mean, what are we gonna do? It&#39;s not like there&#39;s anything else, right? If the<br/>
only people selling bread were selling bad, disgusting bread, we&#39;d still buy it<br/>
and be happy that at least it doesn&#39;t have worms in it.<br/>
<br/>
Same with M$ - they have no real competition so they allow themselves to release<br/>
crap like Windows. And same for Verant. There is nothing better than EQ in the<br/>
RPG department, so they can be buggy and people will still play. The addictivness<br/>
is in all the RPG&#39;s, and it will exist in Asheron&#39;s Call as well. But this time<br/>
there will be competition and less bugs will be allowed.<br/>
<br/>
The adictivness in EQ comes from the socialization and a real sense of<br/>
achievement. When you get to level 30 in computer game then... wow.. you&#39;re level<br/>
30 and who cares? When you&#39;re level 30 in a computer game with hundreds of level<br/>
15s around you, well gee, you feel an accomplishment has been made. A competitive<br/>
environment is always addictive. Especially when it&#39;s pretty much fun.<br/>
<br/>
But it is not Verant&#39;s invention and they will not be the only one&#39;s to benefit<br/>
from it. When Asheron&#39;s Call comes out and other MPRPGs start popping up, we&#39;ll<br/>
(hopefully) see a vast improvement in quality.<br/>
<br/>
This is rather off topic, so I&#39;ll stop it too, as mstokes did. Just remember that<br/>
we SHOULDN&#39;T put up with this.<br/>
