&gt; &gt; I agree.  I like the &quot;eye candy&quot; as well.  It makes the game for me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>   I agree as well, but I think the reason we don&#39;t see more is the same<br/>
reason we don&#39;t see more variation in what our character is wearing (ie.,<br/>
cloth pieces not showing up, lack of modifiable colors, etc). Verant made<br/>
the decision long ago that they wanted to make the game accessible to the<br/>
greatest number of 3d cards possible which includes, unfortunately(1),<br/>
4meg cards. Thus, they had to severely limit the number of textures used<br/>
in the game, and I _think_ that spells may fall under that category. <br/>

(1) Unfortunately for those of us with greater that 4 meg cards, very<br/>
fortunately for those of us that might still have voodoo1 cards.</div>
