<div id="ygrps-yiv-350268050">well, i have heard that killing the freeport guards will raise ur faction,<br/>
but i cant confirm that (they con green, so they should be pretty easy<br/>
pickens for a lvl 20+).  there are also a few newbie quests you can do that<br/>
will raise ur faction, but you have to at least be able to get to the<br/>
warriors guild to complete these (doesn&#39;t do u any good if ur already KOS).<br/>
i think they should make it so that if u are KOS by indigo brotherhood<br/>
(neriak) that you should be able to go kill a few gnomes or haflings to<br/>
raise ur faction (or even some of those other fair-skinned elves).<br/>
personally, i think they really screwed up the PvP server when they put the<br/>
faction system in.<br/>

&gt;Anyone have ANY ideas how to gain faction with the Dark Elves in Nek Forest<br/>
&gt;and Neriak?  Since the implementation of faction hits for PvP I am now<br/>
&gt;regarded dubiously by most of the guards and have some Drow brethren who<br/>
&gt;cannot enter the forest safely anymore.  Yes, it is my own fault for the<br/>
&gt;most part, but how can I fix it?  GMs and Guides can&#39;t help, other players<br/>
&gt;that I have talked with so far haven&#39;t been of much help, either.  I was<br/>
&gt;told to try the Halflings that roam Nek Forest, but that was misleading.<br/>
&gt;Even the Leatherfoot Deputy doesn&#39;t help you gain faction in Neriak.  I<br/>

&gt;many levels and haven&#39;t noticed any gains.  Any advice would be most<br/>
&gt;appreciated.  Thanks.<br/>
