<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754341082">I like this letter of Malkin&#39;s and have made a few additions and<br/>
changes.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dear EverQuest Staff,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We are a large group of wizards who have come together through a mailing<br/>
&gt; list. Through much discussion and debate, we have agreed to send you<br/>
&gt; this feedback concerning improvements to the wizard. We would like to<br/>
&gt; thank you in advance for your careful consideration of these<br/>
&gt; modifications.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   1) Spells are 100% resisted by mobs 6+ levels above the caster. In large<br/>
   groups hunting big prey this level cap turns a wizard from the main<br/>
   dealer of damage to a useless member in the group. Being forced to group<br/>
   with an enchanter in order to reduce magical resistance, and therfore<br/>
making<br/>
   the wizard class almost entirely dependant on enchanters, is a very<br/>
unbalanced<br/>
   solution. Our suggestion is that either the cap be raised to 6+ levels of<br/>
the<br/>
   highest member in the group, or the cap be raised to 9+ levels higher<br/>
than the caster.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 2) Spells that both stun and damage targets are often resisted by mobs<br/>
&gt; that /con green and blue. If this is the result of the stun effect, we<br/>
&gt; would like one spell without this effect at the same level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3) Many spell suggestions have crossed this list. Here is one that we<br/>
&gt; all feel would be a great addition.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tap Affinity - Teleport targeted group member to their own bind spot<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4) O&#39;Kiels Radiation seems that it would be the beginning of a great<br/>
&gt; line of spells. Why should it end there? Cold and Magic based<br/>
&gt; buffs/shields would be a very welcome addition.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    5) Wizards are very neglected when it comes to carrying or<br/>
    wearing items that enhance our appearance. Skulls look like bags.<br/>
    Fine Steel Staffs are still wooden.  Most wooden staffs are identical.<br/>
    In addition many completely different spells have the same visual<br/>
effects<br/>
    or very inappropriate ones. Example: Fire Bolt is the same as Lightning<br/>
Bolt.<br/>
    Shock of Lightning is red, not bluish-white.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    6) The chance of a spell fizzling or resisting has noticably increased<br/>
    over the last few weeks. As an example spells that many have had<br/>
    for 12+ levels are now fizzling and resisting almost as much as when<br/>
    they were new.<br/>
<br/>
    7) Wizard is the only class that is entirely mana dependent.  All other<br/>
    casters are able, through pets and/or buffs, to effect a battle without<br/>
    an ongoing expenditure of mana. Being so entirely mana dependent<br/>
    we feel that wizards should have a *7 modifier for Meditation rather<br/>
than<br/>
    the current *5 modifier.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; We would like to thank you again for your time. Any type of feedback<br/>
&gt; would be greatly appriciated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sincerely,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Wizards of Norrath<br/>
