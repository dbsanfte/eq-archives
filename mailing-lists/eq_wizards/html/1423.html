<div id="ygrps-yiv-941754892">I have had no problem soloing through L14.  In fact, I tend to get exp <br/>
faster that way, it seems.  I do believe that grouping is better for <br/>
enjoying the game, but when you can&#39;t find a competent group, soloing is <br/>
viable for the long haul.<br/>
<br/>
Right now I solo caiman in Oasis.  I still sit near the zone border, but I <br/>
have killed 20 or so and never lost.  Did have to pull out the snake fang <br/>
once, but I still got him.<br/>
<br/>
Groups are better, but with a little practice you should have no fear of <br/>
soloing.  Just make sure you test the creature out near a guard or zone <br/>
before you jump in.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;According to Ken Morris:<br/>
&gt; &gt; For the record, I don&#39;t believe wizards should solo past 5th lvl.  Your<br/>
&gt; &gt; chances of dying increase dramatically when soloing.  Having said that, <br/>
&gt;we<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you know what you take in. For example, I&#39;m now soloing (at 9th) Desert<br/>
&gt;Tarantula, because, by experience, these critters don&#39;t hit me enough. The<br/>
&gt;only time it is borderline is when I get three fizzle in the fight. *Then*<br/>
&gt;I start to sweat. At 10th, I know I&#39;ll get into Sand Scarabs, because these<br/>
&gt;guys are almost doable on my own right now (if I don&#39;t get a fizzle at <br/>
&gt;all).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When soloing, the trick is to know which target to hunt. Pumas are <br/>
&gt;significantly<br/>
&gt;weaker than Tarantulas, but they tend to hit more often (without Poison), <br/>
&gt;so<br/>
&gt;I usually end up with less HP remaining after a fight with a Puma.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; strategize carefully and leave yourself a way to escape if things go <br/>
&gt;bad,<br/>
&gt; &gt; there&#39;s no lvl that you can&#39;t solo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Agreed.<br/>
