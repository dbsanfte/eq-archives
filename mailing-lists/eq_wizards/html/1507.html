<div id="ygrps-yiv-2098258391">This is my strategy and works best outdoors on crits that are walking away<br/>
from you(Bears of all types and even spiders). Get behind your target and<br/>
cast bolt while it&#39;s walking away from you, start backing up until you can<br/>
cast again, cast a shock spell, back up til you can cast again and hit with<br/>
another shock spell(or root if you feel it&#39;s necessary) I found that I could<br/>
take on yellow grizzlies in this manner and get 3 hits in before they got to<br/>
me. If you want to play this dangerous(yellows that is) make sure you stay<br/>
in the area of a guard.....<br/>
<br/>
(I by no means invented this but this is what got me over the level 10<br/>
hump...)<br/>
