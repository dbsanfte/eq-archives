<b>Subject:</b> Plus mana items versus Plus Int and Wisdom <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551107477">Hello everyone,<br/>
    Can anyone tell me the difference between a +mana item versus a +int and wis item. I have a chance to buy the Savants cap for about 30 plat and am wondering why it could be worth that much since I could just a + mana ring for a whole lot less. Also in wearing the cap I would have to give up on my Halo of light.<br/>
    Thanks <br/>
