<div id="ygrps-yiv-821303978">Watch out, I&#39;m not kidding that a big spoiler is coming up.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, to make a new spell, you just need the book, and the proper runes.  No quills, no paper, just the lexicon and runes.<br/>
<br/>
The two spells I have made so far are Project Lightning and Pillar of Fire.<br/>
<br/>
To make Project lightning you use the runes of Periphery and Fulgeration.  For Pillar of Fire you need Proximity and Nagafen.<br/>
<br/>
I can make another of both of these.  Tell me if you are interested in buying one of these two spells, or the unbuyable Project Lightning.<br/>
<br/>
You also need books for other spells, the spells these books contain are:<br/>
Wizards Cannon:<br/>
Identify, Project Lightning, Pillar of fire<br/>
Doctrine of Wizardry:<br/>
Enstill, Fire Spiral of Al&#39;Kabor, Cast Force, Column of Lightning, Tox Portal, Shock spiral of Al&#39;Kabor, Energy Storm<br/>
Ipsors Enlightenment III:<br/>
Nullify Magic, Circle of Force, Lava Storm, Thunderclab, Immobilize, Common Portal, Frost Spiral fo Al&#39;Kabor<br/>
Ipsors Enlightenment IV:<br/>
Gravity Flux, Wrath of Al&#39;kabor, Ice Commet, Super Nova, Paralizing Earth<br/>
<br/>
As you can see the spells you can research vary from level 16 all the way to the ungodly 1100 damage ice commet at level 49.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are other books, but I havn&#39;t found them.  If you come across them, let me know!<br/>
<br/>
These spells were read off with below average in old Erudian.  I&#39;d really love it if someone on the Rathe who has excellent would train me in it.  I&#39;ll pay 20pp for the honor.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what paralizing earth is, my guess is that its along the root line of spells.  I guess you *have* to research Ice Commet, Super Nova, etc or buy them from a wizard who made them.<br/>
<br/>
You didn&#39;t believe me when I said this was a massive spoiler did you?<br/>
<br/>
One last note, I am almost certain that there are more spells you can research.  I have a rune that starts with a &quot;V&quot;, forget the name of it at this instant.  I already translated all the components required to make these spells from these book, and none of them had this rune as a component.<br/>
