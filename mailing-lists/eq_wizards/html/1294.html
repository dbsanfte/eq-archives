<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940795246">I totally agree. One reason I had to get Fire Bolt is that it just looks so<br/>
cool to cast it, even though conventional advice was to stick  with Shock<br/>
of Ice as a better damage/mana spell. As it turns out I am really glad I<br/>
bought it as some monsters are not as affected by the Ice spell as by the<br/>
Fire spell (ie. giant snakes).<br/>
