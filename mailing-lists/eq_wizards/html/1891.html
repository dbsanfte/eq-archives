<div id="ygrps-yiv-1709184225">I know only of one time they made a class lesser good.  It was late in<br/>
phase 3 beta when they took the dmg done by AE spells and divided it by two.<br/>
But the mana amount stayed the same.<br/>
The wizards became less powerfull with this change.<br/>
<br/>
    Think if the wizard AE spells was doing twice the dmg what they are<br/>
doing now, maybe they had been worth using.<br/>

&gt;Are you kidding?  Of course they would ))<br/>
&gt;There is no question they tweak some aspects of the game that aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt;documented.<br/>
&gt;Only recently, after complaints from players, have they begun to give us<br/>
&gt;more feedback on changes... but I still don&#39;t think they tell us everything<br/>
&gt;they change.  Have they notified us of many changes that reigned in a<br/>

&gt;&gt; I started having this problem at Lvl 20 and assumed it was differences in<br/>
&gt;&gt; the level spells but I&#39;m not so sure... Wonder if they snuck a change in<br/>
&gt;on<br/>
&gt;&gt; Wizards that is affecting this..<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am just two bubbles away from 14 and I&#39;ve been experiencing similar<br/>
&gt;effects<br/>
&gt;too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Do you think Verant would do anything like that without letting us know?<br/>
&gt;That<br/>
&gt;would be despicable.<br/>
