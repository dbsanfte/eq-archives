<div id="ygrps-yiv-160273034">For faction with Dark Elves (The Indigo Brotherhood, in particular) try <br/>
going to Lesser Fay and killing certain Wood Elf NPCs that roam around.  <br/>
There&#39;s a camp with quite a few of them and nearby is a ranger (probably <br/>
high 20s) that you can fight solo.  He&#39;s good experience and drops 15pp <br/>
worth of weapons everytime (between his axe and longsword -- if ya sell it <br/>
to an NPC vendor), but you&#39;ll have to kill him a thousand times (or more) to <br/>
gain any significant faction to enter Nek Forest unhindered.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
