There are two easy functions that some people have yet to master, I see.<br/>
<br/>
They are Killfile and Kill thread. Make a Killfile and add anyone you<br/>
don&#39;t want to read (such as me, for instance) to it and you won&#39;t get<br/>
their posts anymore. If a thread sucks, kill thread it and you won&#39;t get<br/>
posts in that thread.<br/>
