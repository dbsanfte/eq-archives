<br/>
I just bought all my level 16 spells that I need, and I still have almost<br/>
30 plat in the bank!  So I should be good to go once level 20 comes around,<br/>
hell, I might even be able to afford to try a little tinkering.<br/>
<br/>
I am a gnome from Akanon, and over the last 2-3 days I&#39;ve been doing a<br/>
little safari work to earn cash.  <br/>
<br/>
I imported several Polar Bear Cloaks, Wolfskin Belts and Wolfskin Boots<br/>
from Qeynos and Halos into Faydwer.  And I must say, the market is<br/>
excellent in Faydwer, what with all the spell casters running around in<br/>
skimpy little bits of armor, I made a tidy little profit and had a great<br/>
time to boot.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight, if all goes well, I&#39;ll collect some materials in Freeport and head<br/>
on back to stock up again.  Yeeee haw!<br/>
