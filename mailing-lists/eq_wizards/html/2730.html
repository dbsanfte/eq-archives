(that a clock can see, so it s surely a change of let s say 0,001 &gt;second or<br/>
something like that.In other words : nothing.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey hey, don&#39;t worry about it.  I&#39;ve been playing both a Shaman & Druid to <br/>
get a feel for it, but nothing compares to a Wizard.  I&#39;m thinking of <br/>
dropping my Druid character because she just plain sucks. Druids are good <br/>
solo and group characters up to about 20level, then that&#39;s it.  All my high <br/>
45+ level friends tell me they never invite Druids in their parties <br/>
anymore...but Wizards are ALWAYS welcome.<br/>
At high levels, a Druid will not have good enough armor to tank...so they <br/>
essentially become weak Wizards.<br/>
<br/>
By that time, a Wizard of equal level will have strong shields and DD <br/>
spells, AND all the teleport spells of a Druid.  So what about a Druid&#39;s DOT<br/>
<br/>
spells, you can&#39;t kite Lady Voxx.  :)  (or can you? hehe)<br/>
Nor will a Druid&#39;s heal spells be worthy of a Cleric.  So why have them?<br/>
<br/>
The grass always looks greener somewhere else, but trust me....other <br/>
characters are envious of a Wizard&#39;s spells as well.<br/>
<br/>
We *maybe* need to be tweaked here and there...but stop comparing us to <br/>
other characters.  It will get us nowhere.  We have a few 50Level Wizards on<br/>
<br/>
our server that have demonstrated the effectiveness of our spells.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I am not sure you know how weak we are.... You tell about dd ? ok. Do you<br/>
know that your best spel at level 50 only does 625 dommage ???? And that the<br/>
best dd spel for DRUID is 615 (and they buy it IN A FUCKING SHOP)????<br/>
Magician get a BOLT who deal 900 dommage at level 49 (AND THEY BUY IT TOO IN<br/>
A FUCKING SHOP!)... ok it s a bolt so dificult to cast by WTF we must have<br/>
the best dd spel no ????? With nearly the same mana/ratio.... Don t speak<br/>
about ice comet, you never never will have it (unless you have 40 friend<br/>
level 50 and who are ready to spare it with you...)... And oh yes : you best<br/>
dd spel is fire based so you can NOT hit fire giant (nothing in solusek b in<br/>
fact)and nagafen (who is one of the mob carrying the rune). So you use you<br/>
level 39 sple at level 50.. that s pretty cool no ?  At level 34 you have a<br/>
dd of 315 .. cool the magician have a bolt who deal 345 at 34 ...... So i am<br/>
sure you realise how weak we are right now :). People ask us to group ? Yes<br/>
cause they THINK we are the best dd caster... And it s not true at level 23<br/>
you use a stupid level 16 spel. From 24 to 29 we are the best dd caster yep.<br/>
But from 34 to the end, no way we are nothing. I have one friend who is<br/>
level 50 dark elfe on karana (menahemen a french speaking guy coming from<br/>
suisse). He just stop playing at level 50 not because he don t like his<br/>
wizzard cause he was really bored about what verant does to us (i mean we<br/>
are undepowere dlike hell so we don t hit the major mob of the game as<br/>
nagafen and lady vox :( ). Some of you may (again) tell me : ohh stop<br/>
spaming, just play another classe if you don t like this one, we are fine<br/>
with it... Ok wait till high level and we will see.. So np continue play but<br/>
never never hope to be (not the strongest) a regular class... Just hope to<br/>
become the weakest class in the game but some like it ! (as i do :) )<br/>
<br/>

level 26 wizzard karana<br/>
<br/>
p.s. a druid is 15 times more useful then me in a group.... People just don<br/>
t know we are so weak....</div>
