<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059891970">wow, that&#39;s pretty low :)  lemme tell u one thing tho, the other members of<br/>
the party, at higher lvls, WILL be able to tell if ur spells r resisted or<br/>
not.  why?  because without our big dmg spells, the fights usually last much<br/>
longer.  and also, many fights hinge on EVERYBODY doing their job.  when i&#39;m<br/>
in a group, everybody is counting on me to take the mob from 1/4 health to<br/>
no health. plain and simple, its my job to finish him.  they dont even<br/>
expect me to start casting until the mob is at least half dead, although<br/>
they r starting to get greedy with my stun spell :)  if somebody doesnt do<br/>
their part, it could result in multiple deaths.  the best thing for u to do<br/>
is to let the party know that the mobs they r pulling r out of ur casting<br/>
range, and that they need to pull lower lvl mobs if possible. u can also try<br/>
different variations of spells (fire, ice, magic) just in case the mob has a<br/>
particularly high resist to any one of the types.  it has worked on<br/>
occassion for me to switch between flame shock, force shock, and frost<br/>
shock.<br/>
<br/>
also, i dont know what lvl u r, but i damn sure dont have room in my VERY<br/>
LIMITED 8 spell slots to put a lvl 1 dd spell :)<br/>
