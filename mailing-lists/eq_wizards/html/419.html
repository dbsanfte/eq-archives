<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-154288032">Greetings everyone. I made the choice, long ago, to use a dagger as my<br/>
melee weapon as opposed to a staff of some sort. Now I am finding that<br/>
everyone is speaking of magical staves, and never see talk of magical<br/>
daggers. Would any of you happen to know where I might be able to find<br/>
myself a runed dagger of some sort?<br/>
Thanks much for the answers!<br/>
<br/>
BTW I think a news group version of this list would be a great idea. I like<br/>
the list alot, but trying to read 100+ messages every morning before I<br/>
leave for classes kind of sucks.<br/>
