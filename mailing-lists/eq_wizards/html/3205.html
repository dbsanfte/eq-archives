Back before I got my j boots. my preffered method of escape was shadow step<br/>
shadow step then gate.  SS casts muxh faster than gate so I would use it to<br/>
try and get far enough away to gate.   When I was hunting in N. Rho, It<br/>
would sometimes put me almost half a zone from th MOB trying to kill me.  In<br/>
oasis it usually put me in the water for somereason if I was on the beach.<br/>
then I&#39;d gate while under water.  Now I just run really fast with the<br/>
journeymans boots</div>
