<div id="ygrps-yiv-1189186799">According to Robert Jones:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have a question about spell books which I could easily test in game for a<br/>
&gt; small fee, but I never get around to it so I figured I&#39;d see if one of you<br/>
&gt; could help (and save my few GP).  Let&#39;s say I did something stupid (this<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t happen) like not buy root at lvl4, and already filled all five slots<br/>
&gt; in my spellbook... can I go out and buy root and scribe it over top of one<br/>
&gt; of my lvl4 spells that I think sucks?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Five slots? Which five slots?<br/>
You may write any spell at any place in your spellbook. How you organise<br/>
it is your prerogative.<br/>
<br/>
Buy the spell, and write it somewhere. You don&#39;t (you even can&#39;t) erase<br/>
other spells. But you can purchase all spells at any level and write them<br/>
down.<br/>
