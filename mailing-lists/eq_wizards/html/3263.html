<div id="ygrps-yiv-8345685">&quot;:)  I guess you weren&#39;t playing EQ that first week they<br/>
released the game.  That message happened everyday&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Very astute observation..I had heard how bad it was in the beginning so i<br/>
wated a whole month agonizing &#39;till i finally broke down and bought it.  My<br/>
problem had gone away for now and I seem to have returened to &#39;normal&#39;<br/>
service.  I just wish i could maintain a good connection without<br/>
interuptions.</div>
