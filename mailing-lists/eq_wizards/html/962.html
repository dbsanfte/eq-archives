<div id="ygrps-yiv-356907126">Thanks for your thoughts.  I will try these theories out soon and let you<br/>
know my progress.  The group memebers (my normal party) would not mind so<br/>
much.  But in a new group some people get irritated with the SPAM&#39;ing<br/>
...just have to know your group you are with at the time.<br/>

I know that as a darkelf or Higelf you start with elder elvish.<br/>
If you sit by them, I dont think you would learn any thing. But maybe if you<br/>
hailed them in Old erudin they would answer you in old erudin and you would<br/>
learn :)  ( this Im not sure off)<br/>
<br/>
And why would it not be fair to the other in the group, ill be happy to<br/>
learn the language. :)</div>
