<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I don&#39;t know what happened but I cant seem to get into the game anymore.<br/>
&gt;After I select my guy, I hit enter world and then after about a minute, I<br/>
&gt;get the &#39;Server not responding&quot; message.  I have reinstalled and repatched<br/>
&gt;the game.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Join the club.  :)  I guess you weren&#39;t playing EQ that first week they <br/>
released the game.  That message happened everyday.  :P  Nothing to do but <br/>
wait it out...either the EQ log-in server is down or some node along the way <br/>
is holding you up.  As much as I&#39;d like to bitch about it when it <br/>
happens...equipment fails so... *shrug*  Time to finally go to the restroom <br/>
then heh<br/>
<br/>
You can also get that EverMon thingie that will ping the EQ servers and tell <br/>
you when it&#39;s up.<br/>
