<div id="ygrps-yiv-537211678">Although this is a splendid idea (I had the same one myself), it falls apon<br/>
one major stumbling block.<br/>
 You have to carry all of them with you.  You cannot store robes in the<br/>
bank, and the combined<br/>
weight will add up on you. Since Wizards are not very strong to begin with,<br/>
you have the strength<br/>
to carry the loot you find.  It can be done, but be aware of the problems<br/>
associated.  (In case<br/>
you were wondering, you can&#39;t put Robes in the bank, even in a container).<br/>

PS: It is my Humble opinion that Rank (When dealing with a spell caster)<br/>
refers to thier Rank of Spell<br/>
not thier level.<br/>
<br/>
Also from What I have seen so far... Green, Blue, Yellow, Red, Gold,<br/>
Black(Grey), Violet.  White&#39;s<br/>
and Flowing Black (Priest of Discord looking) Robes are not &quot;Guild<br/>
Associated&quot;<br/>
