<div id="ygrps-yiv-105088536">Well..i  STAND corrected. Hmmmm...No side effects from LSD...I am glad that<br/>
you corrected that ugly rumor of &quot;flash backs&quot;.  I&#39;ll have to inform some of<br/>
my former patients, that they are must have been affected by bad chicken or<br/>
something.  Sorry all..i thought this was an EQ_Wizards list not the forum<br/>
for recreational drug users .<br/>

Subject: RE: Disappointments with everquest.<br/>
<br/>
Heh, I harvest all of my own indulgences.  I don&#39;t buy them from dealers,<br/>
and I suggest not doings so because they put anything from rat poison to<br/>
embalming fluid on their products to enhance it (killing your brain in the<br/>
mean time).<br/>
<br/>
Now, about trying something new.  How is whoever you got your information<br/>
about drugs so righteous? It seems you have a strong fear against them, I<br/>
would also if they are dealer sold, rat poison LSD is not very good for<br/>
you.Although opium and morning glory LSD have no known long term effects<br/>
(unliketobacco and alcohol).<br/>
<br/>
Also I noticed that my original spelling of disappointments was wrong.<br/>
Anyways what am I rambling at (another fun feature of substances) I need to<br/>
get to school.I give up on whatever we wear arguing about, lets never<br/>
mention it again.&gt;&gt;</div>
