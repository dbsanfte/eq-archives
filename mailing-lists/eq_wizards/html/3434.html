<div id="ygrps-yiv-857993345"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;As for Research, I have never bothered with practice runes.  The &gt;materials<br/>
&gt;for them are a quest in themselves, and I have found it easier to &gt;simply<br/>
&gt;keep research maxed at your guildhouse with one of the trainers for &gt;your<br/>
&gt;class.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been doing that same thing to...I started researching before they made <br/>
those little practice runes to work.  I believe we can dump in about 5 <br/>
training points per level...I might have dumped maybe 20-30 pts in when I <br/>
first started.  It&#39;s the lazy approach. :)  I&#39;ve been about 60% successful <br/>
so far...maybe once I was able to create a spell that was one circle above <br/>
mine; all others included spells that were below my level.  Most of the <br/>
research spells include throw-away spells though...I liked maybe one or two <br/>
of the AE spells.  I guess the main thing to prepare for is the Ice Comet <br/>
down the road.<br/>
<br/>
I liked that person&#39;s tip about the specialization...I had no idea you had <br/>
to chunk a pt into *all* the rest of the specializations.  And all this time <br/>
I thought I did it right...that sucks.  I assume it will catch up pretty <br/>
quickly though since all I do is root and cast all day long. :)<br/>
