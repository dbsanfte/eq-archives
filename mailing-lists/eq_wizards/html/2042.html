<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-806703161">Ok, Just a couple changes I&#39;ll tell rather than sending it to you. My<br/>
20th level Force Shock does 171 damage, not 177 at level 20. Also, I<br/>
hear that the 29th level shock spell does 240 damage. I will also go to<br/>
neriak and record all the wizard spells available there and make those<br/>
changes...<br/>

&gt; Due to the overwhelming response, I&#39;ve sent the file to the group.  If<br/>
&gt; you respond to this message or the digest, please make sure the file is<br/>
&gt; no longer attached.  Feel free to make additions and corrections on the<br/>
&gt; spread sheet and E-Mail them Directly To Me (Save Bandwidth).  I will<br/>
&gt; then compile the changes and E-mail the updated copy to the group.<br/>
&gt; Before opening the spread sheet please note that it is a spoiler.  It<br/>
&gt; contains all the spells I have heard about up to level 49, components<br/>
&gt; needed to research the spell, and I&#39;ve recently began adding which city<br/>
&gt; the spell can be bought.  Most things on the spell list still need to be<br/>
&gt; verified.  There are also several columns for casting time, please only<br/>
&gt; fill in the first column with your channeling skill, and the casting<br/>
&gt; times for the spells you own.  Also, don&#39;t worry about the damage/mana<br/>
&gt; ratio.  I&#39;ll finish that after all the cahnges are compiled.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Enjoy<br/>
