<div id="ygrps-yiv-1813303679">Here  lets solve the root debate:<br/>
<br/>
Goto the cauldron (a zone off of BB mtns),  and poke an aqua goblin shaman,<br/>
if you are under lvl 13  he will root you and bash you like crazy.  You WILL<br/>
stay rooted while taking that beating  but you CAN shadow step while rooted<br/>
(I hope they never fix that :-)). Same thing for a ghoul, I learned that<br/>
lesson multiple times in the befallen .<br/>
<br/>
PS  Speaking of the befallen (unrest-like dungeon in the west commons)  be<br/>
careful just running through doors on lvl 2, there are pits that drop you to<br/>
lvl 3.  Lvl 3 is A LOT harder than lvl 2 !</div>
