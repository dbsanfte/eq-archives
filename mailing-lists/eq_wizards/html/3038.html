<b>Subject:</b> RE: Disappointments with everquest. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075625843">Heh, I harvest all of my own indulgences.  I don&#39;t buy them from dealers,<br/>
and I suggest not doings so because they put anything from rat poison to<br/>
embalming fluid on their products to enhance it (killing your brain in the<br/>
mean time).<br/>
<br/>
Now, about trying something new.  How is whoever you got your information<br/>
about drugs so righteous? It seems you have a strong fear against them, I<br/>
would also if they are dealer sold, rat poison LSD is not very good for you.<br/>
Although opium and morning glory LSD have no known long term effects (unlike<br/>
tobacco and alcohol).<br/>
<br/>
Also I noticed that my original spelling of disappointments was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways what am I rambling at (another fun feature of substances) I need to<br/>
get to school.<br/>
I give up on whatever we wear arguing about, lets never mention it again.<br/>

&gt; First, when did I say the original post was bad? Second, it was mean as a<br/>
&gt; statement to calm down, not a joke but why does a sentence suggesting<br/>
&gt; smoking weed come out so bad?  Third and most important, try something new<br/>
&gt; sometime in your life... maybe any drug would do you some good.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, ok, whatever... &quot;Try something new&quot; :)<br/>
<br/>
Did your dealer use that line on you?<br/>
