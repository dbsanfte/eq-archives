<div id="ygrps-yiv-796491047">something that every one seems to forget is that EQ is a group game,<br/>
every thing I have read and seen in the game makes it clear that past 20 you<br/>
can forget solo play, you are going to need a party of 3 to 6 players to<br/>
make any levels past 20.  the wizard class hits that line even sooner then<br/>
most.  yes a wizard can KS, it is not hard, but you got to remember that<br/>
tanks have very long memory&#39;s,  any wizard with half a brain will start<br/>
building friends and contacts with as many tanks as he can, your reputation<br/>
is going to follow you where ever you go.  when you hit level 25 and want to<br/>
get some powerful magic item, what you going to do, you ask for a party and<br/>
all the tanks say, I remember you , your that @%$#^%$ wizard that set on the<br/>
table in Crush Bone and KS&#39;s all my kills.<br/>
<br/>
    keep in mind, most fighter types group all spell casters as Wizards,  I<br/>
have not seen that many wizards KSing,  but then wizards are a minority,<br/>
lots of ench , necros, and magi running around with there pets.<br/>
<br/>
    When ever a fighter friend of mine complains about some magic users<br/>
KSing them,  I tell them to do something about it, we round up a magi or 2nd<br/>
wiz, and some tanks in a party, and head back,  when the KS&#39;s try to KS a<br/>
mob that one of my tanks found, we start casting and drop the mob and show<br/>
them what a party can do.  they soon leave the area.  the tanks are happy,<br/>
the KS&#39;s learned a lesson, and keep in mind, the tanks have very long<br/>
memory&#39;s,  they remember who helped them and who KSed them.<br/>

&gt; Verant IMHO has done an *outstanding* job of balancing<br/>
&gt; the game and the various classes.  With this in mind I seriously<br/>
&gt; doubt they would &quot;neuter&quot; the wizard class or make any changes at all<br/>
&gt; without serious forethought.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But I do think we might see these kind of downgrades (along with<br/>
&gt; upgrades) pretty often.  MUDs do this all the time, and EQ is<br/>
&gt; a lot like a MUD.  Verant seems to pay much closer attention to game<br/>
&gt; balance than UO ever did, thats a good thing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With all that said, my guess is that if they do lower the high-<br/>
&gt; end wizard damage, then they&#39;ll give wizards something else to<br/>
&gt; make up for it.  I have to admit the kill-stealing thing is a<br/>
&gt; valid complaint - it IS easy for wizards to steal kills.  But<br/>
&gt; looking at the evidence so far, having played in beta, I&#39;d say<br/>
&gt; Verant knows what they&#39;re doing and I trust them not to screw<br/>
&gt; us over.<br/>
