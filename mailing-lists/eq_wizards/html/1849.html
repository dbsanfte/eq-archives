&gt; I am not sure who was laughing or for what reason but rest assured that<br/>
&gt; wizards have no problems finding a group.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One paladin, one mage, and one enchanter.  They were all commenting on the<br/>
uselessness of a wizard, due to the fact that they could not help with any<br/>
monster that &#39;counts&#39;.  They also made comment on the close damage ammounts<br/>
that everyone enjoyed, and how they could buff/debuff as well.  I quote &quot; I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t group with a worthless experience point sucking wizard if my life<br/>
depended on it!&quot;  my reply was &quot;one day you may regret you said that.&quot;  Oh<br/>
well the problem is not wheather it is true or not... just the percepetion.<br/>
That is the problem.  And that needs to be rectified.  Sadly I don&#39;t even<br/>
have a suggestion on how to change that view either...<br/>
