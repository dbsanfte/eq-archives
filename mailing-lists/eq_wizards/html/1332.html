<div id="ygrps-yiv-711325967"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; As a 22nd lvl Wizard, I would like to comment on this &quot;wizards being<br/>
 </span></blockquote>weaker&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; crap (no offense meant).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>none taken... sorta...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t quite understand your point here.  Are you saying that we should<br/>
 </span></blockquote>be<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; able to take out creatures in one or two shots???  That&#39;s crazy, it would<br/>
&gt; totally unbalance the game.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not if the game made us use our mana almost completely in those shots...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;But, as it has been<br/>
&gt; pointed out, the wizard is constantly on his ass meditating.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Of course he is, that&#39;s part of being a wizard, or any other magic-using<br/>
&gt; class.   Sitting on your ass meditating is not any different for a mage or<br/>
&gt; enchanter than it is a wizard, so once again I miss your point here.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was just pointing out that we do spend inordanate amounts of time meding<br/>
when we are with equal level casters (go play with a level 8 mage when your<br/>
level 8)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;1.  Speed up casting time for Wizards.  This would allow us to cast<br/>
&gt; in-between attacks with our newest spells.(the only class that would be<br/>
 </span></blockquote>able<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to do so).&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First off, our casting time IS faster than the other magic-using classes.<br/>
&gt; Secondly, what you purpose about casting in between attacks would<br/>
 </span></blockquote>seriously<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; hinder our class.  As it is now, if we are in a group and attack too<br/>
 </span></blockquote>often,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the creature turns to us and starts ripping us a new one.  Not a good<br/>
 </span></blockquote>thing.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That&#39;s why you spread your attacks out, never blasting them one right<br/>
 </span></blockquote>after<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; another.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here I can honestly say I don&#39;t see your point,  If we casted faster because<br/>
we are suppose to be the supreme casters and we casted too fast then that<br/>
would be on our head...  You disproved your own statement within your own<br/>
statement.  This would give us the ability to make that call ourselves.<br/>
(adding more strategy to the game for Wizards)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;2.  Lower mana cost for Wizards with Specialization in Evocation more<br/>
 </span></blockquote>than<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; for the other classes.(less ass time)&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since specialization isn&#39;t implemented yet, there&#39;s nothing saying they<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t done this.  We won&#39;t know until it gets added.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>True, remember these were suggestions to Verant...  So I thought the<br/>
suggestion to be timely.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;3.  Put stun chances on all of our spells( thus giving us a chance to not<br/>
&gt; HAVE to Root every mob we come across) [no yelling that it is there on<br/>
 </span></blockquote>upper<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; level spells, cause I just read that they changed it to disrupt casting<br/>
 </span></blockquote>not<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; stun]&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You need to do a little more research about your higher lvl spells.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have researched them quite completely... I was talking a SMALL chance of<br/>
stun tacked on to our usual damage (like what force stun was suppose to do).<br/>
I know well about Tishna&#39;s Clash....(for the 2 seconds that it works) btw,<br/>
does it work every time? *thinks he knows this answer*<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Once again, you totally lost me on this thread.  We ARE sought after for<br/>
&gt; that extra little kick, although there is nothing &#39;little&#39; about being<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to deliver 175 dmg in one shot.  A warrior of the same lvl with a 2-h<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of mana.  I&#39;ve been hunting Bosuns and Shamans, both of which are blue to<br/>
&gt; me, in the Cauldron and can usually take 2-3 of them before I have to med.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then i&#39;m on the wrong side of the world... one blue G spider on the west k<br/>
plains and I must med....(level 10)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; All in all, your post has confused me.  I mean no offense to you and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>realize<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I really don&#39;t believe<br/>
&gt; you have thought this out too well.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>On the contrary, I have thought it out quite well.  None of your replys<br/>
actually swayed me in my view point and only one had a solution (go find<br/>
Bosuns and Shamans)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Part of the reason is because you are<br/>
&gt; still pretty low lvl.  The wizard class doesn&#39;t really start standing out<br/>
 </span></blockquote>on<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; its own until around 16th lvl, in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is your best piece of advice... and on that note I&#39;ll keep plugging.<br/>
But as I orgianally stated, I wish that Wizards were not so weak that many<br/>
give up on them because you HAVE to reach 16+ level to become a equal....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  But, not everyone can be<br/>
&gt; happy playing a wizard.  From what I have read, I think you expect too<br/>
 </span></blockquote>much<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; from this class.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If I came in with expectations, it came from Verants Manual on the game.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  For myself, I&#39;m very happy with the wizard class.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh don&#39;t mistake my rant for unhappyness... i live to blast something to<br/>
bits.  I was just pointing out what I thought were critical issues(and still<br/>
believe so)(I shouldn&#39;t have to go find Bosuns and Shamans in part Y of the<br/>
world.  It should be balanced no matter where you start.)<br/>
