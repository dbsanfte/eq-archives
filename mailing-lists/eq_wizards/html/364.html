<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717932512">I was hoping that one of you could shed some light on research,  such as:<br/>
<br/>
1.  What language is the wizards tome in?<br/>
<br/>
2. Where near Freeport can you find a lexicon<br/>
<br/>
3.  what are the best places to find the desired scroll making components?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know this is a tall order,  thanks in advance for trying</div>
