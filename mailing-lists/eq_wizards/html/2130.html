couple of seconds!!! maybe every six minutes like mend. i think a better<br/>

concentrate would not be able to be interrupted (ever heard &quot;soandso<br/>

Never in my life  =).  It&#39;s a pretty much unspoken rule, that if anything<br/>
connects with my character, my spell is interrupted.  What stat determines<br/>
this anyway?  I&#39;ve heard people say wisdom, but I can&#39;t picture how eq<br/>
would connect wisdom and the ability to focus on a single task.  &lt;shrug&gt;<br/>
Anyway, whatever it is, I&#39;m going to plink some points down in it with my<br/>
next casting character.<br/>
