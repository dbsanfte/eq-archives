<div id="ygrps-yiv-325270257">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;So, can anyone suggest strategy or spells or classes or levels to go<br/>
after this thing? Ive never seen one auctioned, but heard that they are<br/>
trade only.<br/>

One full group of early 40&#39;s can waltz through straight to her(you can<br/>
actually just pull to the music room). You need to be sure that your group<br/>
knows what they are doing because if you just take the first 5 40+ people<br/>
you can then you may end up with a very tough corpse recovery. Here are my<br/>
thoughts on what you want for classes:<br/>
<br/>
1 Wizard(because we rule, heh)<br/>
1 Cleric<br/>
1 Shaman<br/>
1 Warrior<br/>
1 Enchanter/Bard(depending on whether you are tank heavy or caster heavy)<br/>
1 Paladin/Magician(depending on which one you took above)<br/>
<br/>
Now this is a similar composition to what I hunt with on a regular basis and<br/>
we have no problem going deep into Mistmoore, granted we have been hunting<br/>
together since level 12 but if you all understand your roles you should be<br/>
fine.<br/>
