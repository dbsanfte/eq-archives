&gt; Well i&#39;m almost level 16 now and I&#39;m starting to look around for info on the<br/>
&gt; research skill and so far whound up with useless info, nothing concrete yet.<br/>
&gt; So what i wanted to know is there anyone on this list who has a good list of<br/>
&gt; the runes and the location to get them or a website who has a good list.<br/>
&gt; Thank for the help.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You need to go to the Wizards guild, buy a Lexicon and the tome of<br/>
Wizardry and any other book sold there. These books all have the rune<br/>
combinations for researchable spells. When you get the runes you put<br/>
them in the lexicon and hit Combine, and hope you get the spell.<br/>
<br/>
The runes you&#39;ll have to get yourself or buy from other players.<br/>
