<div id="ygrps-yiv-627045558">For low twenties, a group is needed.  I have seen pairs of 23s pulling, but<br/>
I only succeeded in making trains when I tried that.<br/>
<br/>
Camp in the lake area on the hill or in the alcove on the other side of the<br/>
tower from the Lesser Faydark zone.  Then have someone pull from the<br/>
coutyard and lake or from the canyon leading to the graveyard.  If you are<br/>
in a balanced group try pulling some stuff from the graveyard.<br/>
<br/>
Watch out for the Ssynthi (floating NPC book behind the morgue in the GY) ,<br/>
it drops the robe of the keeper, but it also is a nasty faction hit against<br/>
the temple of Sulusek Ro to kill it.<br/>
<br/>
Also, avoid standing right next to the tower.  I have been told that is<br/>
where Mayong Mistmoore himself spawns, and the tower can be pulled<br/>
accidently if you are careless.<br/>
<br/>
Spell wise I use Tishan&#39;s Clash to stun runners (almost all familiars run<br/>
when hurt) and casters.  I help out the melee guys with a shock of flame or<br/>
force shock here and there.  Be sure to nuke gargoyles hard, they seem to<br/>
have a high AC which makes all melee fights long.  If you can group with an<br/>
enchanter make sure they use tashani and mes frequently as it is easy to get<br/>
swarmed and magic resistance seems high on some of the spawns.<br/>
<br/>
Great exp, 1-2pp per kill at times, fast spawns, but VERY dangerous.<br/>

&gt; I had the same problems as you with levels in the low 20s<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hard to get groups for Evil Eyes, Najena, Wooly Mammoths, and Permafrost<br/>
&gt; Aviaks are way camped.<br/>
&gt; Treants kill faction and you have to wait in line<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My eventual solution an it promises to be good as so far is has taken me<br/>
&gt; from 21-almost 24 is Mistmoore.  Dangerous place and the trains make<br/>
Unrest<br/>
&gt; seem like an evening stroll in Qeynos Hills, but the exp is awesome, loot<br/>
&gt; decent, and the people all seem to know each other there and there are no<br/>
&gt; shortages of group positions.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Im here. Fighting my way out of Lvl 21. Or trying to... So few good<br/>
places<br/>
&gt; to hunt, so few people to group with. *sighs*<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Piecemealing it is taking awhile. Spent a morning camping Emperor Crush<br/>
&gt; and Dvinn, afternon at the Gorge slaying Eyes, Evening Aviaks. So boring,<br/>
&gt; and this stuff will be green at 22 I suspect (well, not the aviaks, but<br/>
&gt; those are Soooooo camped).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Im on 3 wizard lists, cant tell them apart honestly.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I was also wondering where everyon went.  Maybe the are all still in<br/>
&gt; turkey<br/>
&gt; &gt; stupor.  Tonight I will try again for the Inferno Goblin Wizard&#39;s heart.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Then my first  big quest will be compleated.<br/>
