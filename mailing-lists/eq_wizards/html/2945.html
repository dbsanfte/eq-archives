&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Tactic:  if a group pull 2 or 3 darkies i wait until they build some &gt;hate<br/>
&gt; &gt;against fighters and then i cast a Ligting storm on them. If casted &gt;in<br/>
&gt; &gt;right moment it will not make them agresive and i will do much more &gt;damage<br/>
&gt; &gt;then using only DD spels.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for the tips.  Question....I would assume you&#39;d need to have your<br/>
&gt; group attack each of the Mobs to get their attention eh?  I would assume any<br/>
&gt; Mobs that have not been attacked would suddenly turn aggro on you if you<br/>
&gt; suddenly dropped balls of flame on their heads?  :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, no. I use the research spell Column of Fire that does 130 AE.<br/>
I can get two hits in before they turn to me (only the ones that are not<br/>
damaged by others yet) and it is usually easy fort the group to take<br/>
them off me.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;Pulling with eye... Eye is nice thing to pull a mobs first they don  &gt;get<br/>
&gt; &gt;agresive to it until it is realy near. and when they hit you can pull &gt;only<br/>
&gt; &gt;this room of monsters as target is already killed and they go after a<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll give this tactic a try.  Do you just let them kill the eyeball and wait<br/>
&gt; for them to find you?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
