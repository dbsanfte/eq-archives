<b>Subject:</b> Re: Yet another &quot;Where Should I Hunt?&quot; question.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-660264701">South Karana. Hunt aviaks, centaurs and elephants until you can get into outside Paw Groups. Ive levelled from 22 to nearly 28 (last night) in about 3 weeks at Paw. The loot is good (FS weapons, whips sell for 30-50, gloves for 300-500, other Paw armor 10-15) and the money isnt bad, plat, gold and silver.<br/>
<br/>
Also try Crushbone Throneroom, aviaks in Rathe, Rathe Mountains (Gt skels), OOT Aviaks and possibly gargoyle, Unrest, Sol A, Najena, Everfrost mammoths (tusks sell amiable cha 100 for over 10 plat), Perma by the zone... Dunno if Befallen is still an option but Highpass maybe, and if you get sow or a druid hunting partner you can kite some of the griffs in EKarana, or try the spiders there if no Sow.<br/>
<br/>
Also Pickclaws in HighHold Keep maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily you can travel around, and you will need to. 20 wasnt TOO bad for me, but 22 I couldnt find open hunting spots anywhere, till Paw was revamped. Pretty much havent left there since except to bank... Bind spot is at the merchant by the Bank, Gate to NK, run back. 5 minutes away time.<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting<br/>

Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
As you know I just hit lvl 20 a little while ago.  However, I&#39;m having a<br/>
real hard time finding hunting grounds.  Everywhere I go is either too hard<br/>
or too easy.  Any recommendations?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
