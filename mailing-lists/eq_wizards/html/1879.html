<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-70863183">Basically I&#39;d like to know, what level are those heretics in the hut on the<br/>
Erudin entrance side of the Toxxulia forest? As well, how many of them are<br/>
there? I went there around 5-6th level and was immediately slaughtered. I&#39;d<br/>
like to go back and administer some chastisement, but what are they? If<br/>
they&#39;re guidmaster/teacher stuff then there&#39;s no way. However, if they&#39;re<br/>
just a bunch of NPCs meant to be killed, then....heh heh heh...<br/>
