<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-609953512">Yea, i did the cloak quest, it&#39;s pretty easy,<br/>
<br/>
firescale croc in lava in the NE corner of zone (there is only one so u<br/>
have to camp):(<br/>
<br/>
Saltwater croc in Guk, they spawn at the Aincent croc spawn<br/>
<br/>
and Deepwater croc in oasis prety common, just /auc to the zone that ur<br/>
lookin for one, and you should have one soon enough<br/>
<br/>
the firescale and saltwater had the rune on the 1st kill for me but im<br/>
told i was lucky, ck out graffe&#39;s (www.graffe.com)for more detailed<br/>
write up on all of our quests)<br/>
<br/>
Lizscale cape from CT is the last item u need, i did the whole quest in<br/>
less than 2 hours, the reward isd a 3 int, 3 dex, 4 or 5 ac cape (no<br/>
drop)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thunder strike does like 10-20 more damage BUT gets resisted lots like<br/>
force shock, i never use it unless i am fighting resist to fire MoB&#39;s<br/>
like in Sol A.<br/>
