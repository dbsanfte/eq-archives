&gt;&gt; Same effect i have seen in mistmore .. grouping with many people i have<br/>
&gt;&gt; seen what diference can make overpowered items... warrior hitting for 70 a<br/>
&gt;&gt; hit it is 140 - 160 counting a bash ... without mana use a turn!!<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Warriors hitting for 70 when they are in their mid twenties is extremely<br/>
&gt;rare. They might sometime get a critical hit that high. Or, maybe, if<br/>
&gt;they are twinked with the best of items, I might believe it. Otherwise,<br/>
&gt;I think you probably saw something rare and consider it a regularity.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right what i wished to say &quot;TWINKED WITH THE BEST OF ITEMS&quot; if you read<br/>
carefuly me post it was what i wished to say i again excuse as my english<br/>
is not yet maxed so what i wish to say and what i realy write can sometimes<br/>
require 2 reads to get into :).<br/>
<br/>
The problem on wich i wished to point is that strongest items on older<br/>
servers like fenin ro where i play start to become common and lost much of<br/>
price in time as evryone can heve them from a higer lv friend or somone<br/>
sell powerful item as he have found somthing better ect.... It is rare but<br/>
nothing strange to see a warrior under 20 in full crafted or rubicite with<br/>
powerfull weapon. Or druid with Pawn weapon and fear armour on 28! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;You know, sometimes root holds all the battle and let&#39;s you med and fire<br/>
&gt;some more. Rarely, but sometimes. A warrior seeing this would go and<br/>
&gt;complain about the overpowered wizards. You have to take things with a<br/>
&gt;perspective.<br/>
