<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-170928228">Anyone who has travelled near Qeynos and ventured to Highpass has probably <br/>
gone through the zone of North Karana home of the Griffons.  A fellow wizard <br/>
and I, him being level 22 and I 20 at the time, decided that we really didn&#39;t <br/>
have anything to lose so lets have fun.  Griffawns can be fought solo at <br/>
level 16, if your root sticks, so we decided to try out the Griffennes which <br/>
conned red to both of us.  The best way to take one on we found out was to <br/>
stand at opposite sides of the bird, and have one damage it, and another <br/>
enstill it, and then damage it.  When the enstill wore off, and the stupid <br/>
thing charged me, I ran in a circle around my friend, far enough out so it <br/>
would not attack either of us it enstilled again.  Once its rooted/enstilled, <br/>
you can repeat the process!  Damn fine loot, good exercise from the running, <br/>
and nobody gets slain.  (No guarantees on this one, but neither of us ever <br/>
took more than 70 damage without SOW on us)  Go out, and kill some <br/>
griffennes, get some runes, and make the other classes jealous of the might <br/>
of a wizard or two. )<br/>
