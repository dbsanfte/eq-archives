&gt;I agree thet our spells need a lower resistance against reds, but i dont<br/>
&gt;know how we work in combination with enchanter wich lower resistance to<br/>
&gt;higer reds and us nuking after this? maybe this was idea of vereant crew,<br/>
&gt;anyone have experience with combat of wizard 16 or more lv with similar lv<br/>
&gt;enchanter wich cast debuffs to lower resistance on high reds to confirm this?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This works very well.  I hunt occasionally with an enchanter friend.  She<br/>
would cast the inital debuff to lower magic resistance, the critter<br/>
charges, the pet blocks, I root and we both blast.  If we get into trouble,<br/>
the pet blocks, I root and we both Gate.  Great system.<br/>
