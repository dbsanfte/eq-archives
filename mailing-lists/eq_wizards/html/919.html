<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262782968">I dont think that would work, before you can do the research and spell you<br/>
have to know the language, in which case you can not create the spell if you<br/>
dont know the lang.  Just having the &quot;formula&quot; is not enough.  I for one<br/>
would not want to see that posted on this list in any case, even if it was<br/>
possible.<br/>

  Speaking of research spells. How do you know what language a book is in?<br/>
And could we just trade spell formulas over the list without buying the<br/>
books?</div>
