<div id="ygrps-yiv-66008654">&lt;&lt;Example last night I was laughed at when I asked if any one wanted a level<br/>
12 wizard. (by 3 people over shout no less)  If that is the opinion of the<br/>
majority of the populace in a game that is suppose to be group only, then I<br/>
say we need something to make us more valuable...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure who was laughing or for what reason but rest assured that<br/>
wizards have no problems finding a group. I can&#39;t count the times that my<br/>
group(I have a few people I constantly group with) will not pull critters<br/>
while I am AFK, they recognize that I do most of the damage in a big fight<br/>
and they have died without my help many times. I think the problem is that<br/>
at your level people tend to think that any of the other spell casters are<br/>
just as good as you(or better because they can buff) but what they don&#39;t<br/>
understand is that you are the supreme damage dealer. You can and will make<br/>
the difference in a lot of fights. You need to find people who understand<br/>
what a wizard is meant to do and those that appreciate what you bring to a<br/>
group. Keep looking because those people are out there and they become much<br/>
more prevalent at levels 16 and up.<br/>
<br/>
