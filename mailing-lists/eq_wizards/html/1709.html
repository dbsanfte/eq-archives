&gt;  It does effect me and my<br/>
&gt; character cause it will lead to every other player having to twinkle just to<br/>
&gt; play on even ground.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Explain, exactly, how does it affect you? You will go at your normal rate<br/>
anyway, right? So why do you care if someone else goes at a higher rate than<br/>
you? So, tell me, are people who play all day long and get ahead while you are<br/>
left behind twinking too? Is it an offense to surpass you in any way?<br/>
<br/>
Just give it a rest, the only harm done to you is that you are jealous and<br/>
pissed. That&#39;s not an offense.<br/>
