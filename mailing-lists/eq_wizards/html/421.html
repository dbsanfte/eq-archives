<div id="ygrps-yiv-439129773">Keep in mind that whoever you are trying to assist has to have auto attack<br/>
on. If someone is targeting a creature but isn&#39;t in melee you won&#39;t target<br/>
said critter(like a wizard casting spells on a creature but not actually<br/>
attacking it with a weapon). This doesn&#39;t really matter when you are using<br/>
your tank as the target for assist but if you are trying to help your mage<br/>
friend out he may or may not be using auto attack.<br/>
