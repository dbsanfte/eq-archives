<div id="ygrps-yiv-567009198">It all depends on how you hunt. If you are a solo wizard(which is not<br/>
impossible at 16th) then Shieldskin is better, if you hunt in groups then<br/>
just stick with Shielding. Shieldskin will absorb 100 points of damage but<br/>
it does have a time limit(I am not sure how long). Shielding only gives half<br/>
the bonus(+50 HP for this spell) but it also helps you with Magic Resistance<br/>
and a better AC. All in all they are both good spells but it is up to you to<br/>
decide which one fits your style better.<br/>
