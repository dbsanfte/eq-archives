<div id="ygrps-yiv-111310353"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I am level 10. I spent 1 point in Old Erudin and 1 in Gnoll<br/>
&gt; (the only two<br/>
&gt; new languages I have available at the moment). I only tried<br/>
&gt; at my own<br/>
&gt; guild hall in Erudin, since I won&#39;t talk magic with those<br/>
&gt; thieving humans.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ha, I love this.  I do the same thing.  Humans have such a snobby<br/>
attitude towards Erudites (where it should be the other way round, of<br/>
course).  Also, they tend to overcharge tremendously.  My Level 12<br/>
spells are 1p 3g cheaper in Erudin!  So I decided to leave the crappy<br/>
Wizard Guilds of other towns alone.  I&#39;m travelling to Erud for<br/>
training and purchases from now on!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anyway, I DO have those languages available in my languages<br/>
&gt; window, so I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t think it&#39;s a matter of skill.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>About the language thing: you&#39;re right, but if you only have a few<br/>
points in the language, I don&#39;t think people will be able to<br/>
understand you.  I think it&#39;s the EQ equivalent of speaking broken<br/>
English - the chance of being misunderstood is bigger if your language<br/>
skill is very low.  Just a conjecture , of course.<br/>
My friends have started practicing languages during my increasingly<br/>
longer meditations.  Just start chattering away in your race language,<br/>
and in a few minutes you will see some gain.<br/>
