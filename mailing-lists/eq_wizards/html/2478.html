According to Tom Bratina:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;update... i just read a post on stratics that says u can lose faction on <br/>
&gt;all<br/>
&gt;of the servers by killing other PC&#39;s (ie. duels).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I went exploring with a fellow ally over in Lake Rathe today and stumbled <br/>
across the Arena across the way.  Since we were there, we thought &quot;what the <br/>
heck&quot; and decided to duel.  We were both virgin duelers and thought it would <br/>
be interesting, him being a level 20 Bard.  I&#39;m the same level.<br/>
<br/>
Hehehe.  I just laugh when I think about it now.  He couldn&#39;t touch me.  <br/>
Shadow step....zap....shadow step....zap.  :)  He was down with 3 hits of <br/>
force shock.  :)   (flashes of my old Quake fests come to mind)  We both had <br/>
fun anyway...he vowed to get me back another day.  I&#39;ll have to keep looking <br/>
behind my back. *snicker*  Now I know why some of you chose the PVP server.<br/>
<br/>
This just came to mind on this thread because I remember my elf faction went <br/>
down a notch.  Sure hope I&#39;m not KOS when I get home.  ;)<br/>
