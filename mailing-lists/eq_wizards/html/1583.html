I believe mesh is not wearable by mage types.  Woven armor is though it<br/>
typically is 1AC less than leather, and each piece weighs less than 1.  You<br/>
get can get woven armor off of the Frogloks of Guk.  These are the types<br/>
that carry it Sentry, Sentiel, Guards, Tuk Warrior, Apprentice, Novice,<br/>
Neopyte, Witch Doctor, Tuk shaman, and a couple of the other frog types.<br/>
Mesh armor is on Gaz Frogloks and higher.  Guk is a dungeon near Grobb.  As<br/>
far as price depends on how close you are to Guk.  Normally you can get it<br/>
for 1 - 2 plat a piece at Guk.<br/>
