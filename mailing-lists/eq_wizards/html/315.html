higher rank spells if you fall back below the level (i.e. 12th level wiz<br/>

If you just made level 12, buy some spells, go out and die, lose a level<br/>
(back to 11)...   Are you still able to cast those spells?<br/>
<br/>
This has never happen to me, but I was wondering what happened?  Would you<br/>
simply not be able to memorize the higher level spells?   Or would you be<br/>
able to memorize them, just not be able to cast them? or would you be able<br/>
to cast them because you have been to that level?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any responses.<br/>
