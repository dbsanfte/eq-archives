<br/>
I realy only can see that you are in bad mode maybe you can think a bit<br/>
before replying, and if you dont have to say anything useful take a break.<br/>
Only useful was that you say about your warrior at 3 lv but other things<br/>
are realy dont help any discusion and your tone is realy arogant.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;According to Wizard:<br/>
&gt;&gt; many people trying all classes and it was funny, but as game advance new<br/>
&gt;&gt; specialized tactics come out and in many times Verant is a last one to see<br/>
&gt;&gt; exploit and not a first one as it have to be. Now i have seen that at 5<br/>
&gt;&gt; newer servers first to reach a higest lv are druids !! at valos zek pvp<br/>
&gt;&gt; server it is a same reason is of course kiting and dot spells wich they<br/>
&gt;&gt; have. This is something wrong !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So what? Well, except on PvP, why are you compelled to outlevel (because<br/>
&gt;that&#39;s what you want?) the powerlevelers?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Second thing i noted was farming of glowing stain wich we have seen in last<br/>
&gt;&gt; 2 weeks from nowere to see there are now nearly every higer lv caster have<br/>
&gt;&gt; one! It is funny for my glowing black stone wich was a hard to get item is<br/>
&gt;&gt; now nearly underpowered item :) This was stoped unfortunatly to late and<br/>
&gt;&gt; now we wich dont get a stain will never get it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Why? If you&#39;re on Tunare, I can probably arrange to get you one for a<br/>
&gt;very &quot;reasonable&quot; sum.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Now i start to see one other problem.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So what?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; So what hapends .. to make example i spend some time building a wizard and<br/>
&gt;&gt; a warrior to 6 lv and i twinked them with items to make a probe.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Warrior with nearly full large bronze and fine stell sword .. Wizard with<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Loot dropped from level 25+ mobs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; full woven, rts skull, +10 mana earings ect.. Normaly warrior dies on 3<br/>
&gt;&gt; high blues 100% on this lv .... wizard dont have mana to kill 2 high<br/>

&gt;Loot dropped from level 10-20 mobs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But you&#39;ve hit the nail there. A warrior&#39;s prowess is directly linked to the<br/>
&gt;items he uses, so, even barring the skill levels (which means that a level 1<br/>
&gt;full of rubicite still cannot take on a level 3 mob and survive, except by<br/>
&gt;the best of flukes), this helps. A wizard&#39;s prowess is directly linked to<br/>
&gt;the skill he has (includes spells available), so a wizard cannot be twinked<br/>
&gt;overly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Which means WE are the balanced class. Nerf the fighters! :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; My warrior take against 8 !!! BLUES and survived .... so he realy have been<br/>
&gt;&gt; affecter imensly... Wizard tryed against same 2 blues and he died in same<br/>
&gt;&gt; mode as before.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Once, as a level 3 warrior, with 2 cloth, guild tunic, and one patchwork<br/>
&gt;and a tarnished long swords, I was *locked* in place (=1.5 bubble of health,<br/>
&gt;can&#39;t run or you die) against a stream of level 2 mobs. I killed almost<br/>
&gt;10 before being overwhelmed :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;No need to twink :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Same effect i have seen in mistmore .. grouping with many people i have<br/>
&gt;&gt; seen what diference can make overpowered items... warrior hitting for 70 a<br/>
&gt;&gt; hit it is 140 - 160 counting a bash ... without mana use a turn!!  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ok, get a warrior and shut up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Wizard at 27 lv can do only 178 damage and he will be out Of mana in 6 - 7<br/>
&gt;&gt; hits a warrior can go without end and with god items he will alos need less<br/>
&gt;&gt; cleric healing!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ok, get a warrior and shut up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Can your warrior gate? Can your warrior save the whole party without dying<br/>
&gt;(evacuates)? Can your warrior root its ennemy and kill him safely?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;With &quot;god&quot; items (i.e. the best in line before planar items), your warrior<br/>
&gt;can no more solo an unending stream of blue monsters than a wizard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I see this as a very big problem wich will get worse as time pass if<br/>
&gt;&gt; something is not done. What are yours opinion on this are there any<br/>
&gt;&gt; possible solution wich you see for this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What problem? Do the groups reject you as being a weakling? Do they say to<br/>
&gt;you &quot;sorry, we want to keep up our average of 5.3 minutes per mob, and <br/>
&gt;you&#39;re slowing us down?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If so, the problem is not your class, it&#39;s the people you group with.<br/>
