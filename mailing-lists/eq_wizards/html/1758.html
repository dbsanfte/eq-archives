<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-49199162">i agree. when it gets to the point where it&#39;s sickening how many twinkers<br/>
there are i trust John Smedley and his Crew to lay the smack down. and the<br/>
entire time there will be a few golden boys and girls who never twinked and<br/>
we&#39;ll laugh when the twinkers get screwed and are all standing around naked<br/>
;-)<br/>
<br/>
(just a theory dont flame me ;-)<br/>

&gt;I agree, I think we are arguing at cross-purposes here.  Different posts<br/>
&gt;aren&#39;t even using the same definition of twinking.  One thing we all agree<br/>
&gt;on--there&#39;s nothing we can do about twinking, however you define it.  It<br/>
&gt;will be up to the designers to decide what, if anything, needs to be done.<br/>

&gt;&gt; I have to agree with Sergey....Twinking (whoever thought up this stupid<br/>
&gt;&gt; word, wonder if Websters will add it to the dictionary next time they<br/>
&gt;&gt; publish), is not taking away from everyone or even ANYONE, other than the<br/>
&gt;&gt; person who is twinking...they don&#39;t earn the item.  Twinking is making<br/>
&gt;&gt; someone elses game time more enjoyable for them.  I have a  hard time<br/>

&gt;a<br/>
&gt;&gt; full level in no time at all because of similar situation.  Yeah I won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt; ever worry about it so much again, and probably the people who have lost<br/>
&gt;&gt; multiple levels won&#39;t go there again either...first time for everything<br/>

&gt;the<br/>
&gt;&gt; other gamers, all the items continue to spawn, it isn&#39;t like they appear<br/>
&gt;one<br/>

&gt;&gt; would then be guilty of twinking yourself?  Or is it only if you ask<br/>
&gt;someone<br/>
&gt;&gt; to get something for you or you have another character that is high level<br/>
&gt;&gt; sharing things with your lower level character...it seems the folks who<br/>
