<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248469666"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Just got the Staff of the Wheel and Star of Eyes. Was wondering about others <br/>
&gt;experience with researching Ice Comet in terms of failing to make spell. I&#39;m <br/>
&gt;not planning on trying anyway until level 50, almost level 49 now. Has <br/>
&gt;anyone failed to make the scroll or know of anyone who has failed? Would <br/>
&gt;hate to  have to collect all those rods again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, anyone know of any good places for experience at levels 48-50 other <br/>
&gt;than sol b or lower guk? Those places are way too camped. I go to Kedge when <br/>
&gt;I can, but need a group for that. Verant waited far too long to make more <br/>
&gt;higher level places to hunt. I do not like guard hunting because I hate to <br/>
&gt;be KOS in places I may want to visit later. Any ideas appreciated.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ive herd some stories of people failing on the actual research part of the<br/>
quest multiple times.  Ive seen auctions from people now for IC scrolls<br/>
(premade) in a few zones, even have gotten a tell or two from people trying<br/>
to sell IC spells to wizards.  Kinda weird I got my first tell asking if I<br/>
wanted to buy an IC scroll not 5 min after I hit 46.<br/>
Personally I&#39;ll probably go the route of buying the spell from someone<br/>
else.  I am not that crazy about doing the quest again to get the staff.<br/>
Ive herd that its Unwise to attempt to research level 49 spells unless you<br/>
have about 140 in research skill.  Im at about 130 now, and assuming I can<br/>
find Astral Runes I&#39;ll train the extra points and just do the work myself.<br/>
