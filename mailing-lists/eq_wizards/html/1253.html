 </span></blockquote>Same here.  I enjoy the animations and sounds of spellcasting, because they are mysterious-looking and interesting.  I still frequently flip to another camera angle to see myself cast the spells.<br/>
What is also very cool-looking is casting Firebolts from a high place.  You can actually see the bolt fly and curve down and slam into the victim.  I always do this, also because the high position is safer (avoid melee combat).<br/>
Anyway, I second the motion for more spell animations.<br/>
