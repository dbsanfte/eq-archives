&gt;According to Dan Alexander:<br/>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;ll have to remember /ASSIST.  I got whacked last might (again =).  My<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s a hot button on the same button set as my offensive spells:<br/>
&gt;	Hit Fx (whatever position the tank is), 6 (assist), 1 (big nuke)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; companion and I were jumped by three cents, and we pretty much just took<br/>
&gt;&gt; whichever happened to be closest to us.  If mana had held out, we would<br/>
&gt;&gt; have made quick work of them, but such is life.  Thinking back on it now,<br/>
&gt;&gt; maybe it would have been better if we&#39;d both focused on the same one until<br/>
&gt;&gt; it dropped, then regroup on the next one.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Assuming you have 3 peoples dealing the a fixed amount of damage over time<br/>
&gt;vs 3 mobs dealing a fixed amount of damage, check what happens if:<br/>
&gt;	1) you engage each other 1-on-1<br/>
&gt;	2) all 3 engage 1, then switch to the next<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Basically, you can see that it will take the same time to kill them in both<br/>
&gt;circumstances (you need the same amount). However, if you use tactic 1, the<br/>
&gt;all mobs deal damage over the full time, while using tactic 2, only one mob<br/>
&gt;deal damage over full time, while one will do damage over only 1/3. Since<br/>
&gt;mobs do the same damage at all time, unless almost dead :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you forget one important thing about tactic one as all MOBs get hits on all<br/>
casters there is also VERY BIG probability that they will interupt at last<br/>
some spells so a.) battle will be longer and MOBs will deal more damage b.)<br/>
You will use all mana on interupts and fizzles and ........ MOBs<br/>
will....... You.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;How this is done is by having the combat leader doing the targetting. Once the<br/>
&gt;leader says &quot;I have a target&quot;, all click /assist. The combat leader is<br/>
&gt;usually the main tank - not necessarily the group leader.<br/>
