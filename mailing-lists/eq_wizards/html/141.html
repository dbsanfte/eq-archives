<div id="ygrps-yiv-710906719"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Just wondering how other people feel about our Wizard<br/>
&gt; class. It seems to me<br/>
&gt; that we are short-changed compared to magicians and<br/>
&gt; necromancers, whose<br/>
&gt; spells seem a lot better, and can have &quot;pets&quot; fight for<br/>
&gt; them. It&#39;s also<br/>
&gt; hard to make signifant amounts of money to buy spells. I<br/>
&gt; still like the<br/>
&gt; game, just wondered if anyone else felt the same way.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that the wizard becomes much more powerful at higher levels.<br/>
Up until level 8 you&#39;re very weak.  After that it gets a little<br/>
better, and at level 12 you really start to become impressive.  My<br/>
advice is to stick with it, continue to grow and explore.  At level 12<br/>
you get &quot;Bind Affinity&quot;, which makes travelling around a lot easier.<br/>
You will get high damage spells which cast faster and easier as you<br/>
advance.  As soon as you pass that mark, you&#39;ll be able to deal<br/>
300-400 hitpoints of damage in a few seconds.  At level 20 you&#39;ll be<br/>
able to teleport to certain locations, and if I am not mistaken,<br/>
you&#39;ll be able to gate your party members.<br/>
Stick with the wizard for now.  Before you know it, you will have a<br/>
very powerful character that many people will want to have in their<br/>
party.<br/>
