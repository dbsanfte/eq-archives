<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632900271">Thats a thought...<br/>
<br/>
I shepherded a novice Erudite to Freeport over the weekend, it was my first time in Erud and Tox.... Erud is very beautiful! I port to Felwithe to do my selling now, but my faction with merchants there is apprehensive. Ive only found 1 thing that will help that faction, releasing elf prisoners in Crushbone. <br/>
<br/>
Are there any other ways to get faction with Felwithe merchants, Erudin merchants or as last resort, Kelethin?<br/>

According to PHAEDRA WHITLOCK:<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Piecemealing it is taking awhile. Spent a morning camping Emperor Crush and Dvinn, afternon at the Gorge slaying Eyes, Evening Aviaks. So boring, and this stuff will be green at 22 I suspect (well, not the aviaks, but those are Soooooo camped).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Honestly, I don&#39;t fully remember how I spent level 21, but, if I think I got<br/>
this right, I was hunting gnolls at Highhold, mainly for the good faction hits.<br/>
Most of these were still blue, so they gave good xp, at least until people<br/>
started to appear and camp them too.<br/>
	(unlike orc side, gnoll side cannot support more than three-four people)<br/>
