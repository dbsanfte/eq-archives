  You couldn&#39;t be more wrong.  The faction system makes you explore different areas of the game to find ways to improve your faction.  If they just told you how to improve or destroy your faction with any races then why have it.  Why would a DE be allowed to enter or even buy from venders of Good diety?  The faction system allows for a person to create their own destiny by choosing which faction they wish to increase and hunting that method out.<br/>
<br/>
      In Guk there are two factions of Frogloks, Good and Undead (Ghoul).  At the begining if you do not harm any Good frogloks and head into Guk and get attacked by a Ghoul froglok, you can run to a good froglok and he will protect you just like a guard would in your city.  This of course depends on your starting faction with them.  Without a faction system then you will get attack by everyone of them.<br/>

    well, i don&#39;t have an answer for u, but i think Verant royally screwed up with the PC faction system they implemented.  anyway, i say if Verant is going to continue with this patsy faction crap, they need to at least post how u can alter ur faction in a positive manner.  or just totally remove the stupid friggin PC faction system.<br/>

    just my rant.<br/>

      Hello, fellow Wizards!<br/>
       <br/>
      Several weeks ago I participated in a guild war and slew a High Elf not knowing that there would be a faction hit as a result. Well, I can no longer purchase or sell items in Felwithe. I&#39;ve tried everything that I know of to improve my faction standing with the Merchants there, but to no avail. My faction standing with the guards is &quot;amiable&quot; -- It is with the &quot;Merchants&quot; that I need a faction adjustment. Does anyone have any ideas? Suggestions? Personal experience? Would appreciate any and all advice.<br/>
