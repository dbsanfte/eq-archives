&gt; I think that only getting spells every 4 lvls is stupid.   I think that<br/>
&gt; we (or everybody) should get spells every lvl or every other lvl.<br/>
&gt; Especially for wizards.  My friend who is a lvl 5 enchanter almost has<br/>
&gt; more spells then I do.  They gave us so many useless spells.  Like the<br/>
&gt; low lvl Sphere of light.  I havent had the need for any other damage<br/>
&gt; spell besides shocks or bolts.  Then again I am also at a low lvl.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Enchanters have a ton of useful spells and this gives them a great deal of<br/>
versitility.  A lvl 8 enchanter can run and &quot;nuke,&quot; or they can Fear and<br/>
DOT, or they can mesmerize a group, and let their pet take mobs one at a<br/>
time.  This makes them a blast to play.  And of course, they pay a lot more<br/>
in the end.  Spells aren&#39;t free.  A Wizard generally only needs about 3<br/>
spells per lvl until they get teleports, the rest are optional.  Nice on the<br/>
wallet.  Another benefit to being a wizard is that the 8 spells slots is<br/>
usually (almost) enough.  For enchanters, it never is.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there&#39;s nothing subtle about wizards.  Bomb, Bomb, Bomb.  About the<br/>
only question is, How much damage do I want to do this strike?  I don&#39;t see<br/>
how changing spell distribution (say, 2 or 3 every level instead of 8 to 10<br/>
every 4 or 5) would change anything, unless you&#39;re imagining that they&#39;d<br/>
give us even more spells as well.<br/>
<br/>
If in the end you want a spell every level, you might consider playing a<br/>
bard.  If you just envy the enchanters line of spells, you might consider<br/>
playing an enchanter (though they definitely have their drawbacks).  You<br/>
have 8 character slots.  Play, have fun.<br/>
<br/>
One last thought:  Spells such as Sphere of Light are not entirely useless<br/>
as they also serve as trainer spells.  They are low mana cost spells that<br/>
let you practice a skill without blowing a chunk of mana at each attempt.<br/>
They have a small amount of functionality, but their real benefit is in<br/>
preparing you for higher lvl spells (e.g. Sphere of Light and Sense Magic<br/>
both train for, say, Invisibility).<br/>
