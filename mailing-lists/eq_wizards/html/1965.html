<b>Subject:</b> Mana calculation for int... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429094576">I don&#39;t know if the different spell casters use different formulas for mana<br/>
gain, but on an enchanters web page I found table that I could enter<br/>
different int values and find out how much mana I should have at a<br/>
particular level.<br/>
<br/>
So just for grins I did all my calculations at level 50, and made an<br/>
interesting discovery.<br/>
<br/>
For 130 int I would have 1400 mana.<br/>
For 110 int I would have 1200 mana.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There must be a formula that more directly determines mana gain per level,<br/>
but it seems to be just a bit under 11 mana per int per level.  Something<br/>
like 10.79 mana per int per level.<br/>
<br/>
Another interesting discovery I made is in the int modifiers.  For example,<br/>
if I put in 130 int, I of course get 1400 mana, but if I put in 130 int and<br/>
a 10 point modifier, I end up with 1500 mana, which is exactly 10 points of<br/>
mana for each point of int modification.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the big points that are to made here are:<br/>
<br/>
*  Int modifiers help you get mana per level, so gather anything that is<br/>
+int that you can get your hands on.<br/>
<br/>
*  There really isn&#39;t to much difference between having 130 int and having<br/>
110 int.  So all you humans out there should do just fine.<br/>
<br/>
*  The benefits to having a much higher int aren&#39;t apparent until very high<br/>
levels, and even then its not that much.  Comparing 1400 mana to 1200 mana<br/>
I imagine just means the difference between casting a single spell.<br/>
