<div id="ygrps-yiv-578150208">What trade skills are best for a Wizard to get into?  I realize the<br/>
trade<br/>
skills are used for role-playing purposes also, but are there trade<br/>
skills<br/>
which are more useful for Wizards?  For example, jewelcraft is good for<br/>
an Enchanter since they can enchant the metal to make magic rings.<br/>
<br/>
If there are not some which are suited for a wizard, which have people<br/>
had the most fun with?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
