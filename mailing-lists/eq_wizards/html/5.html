<div id="ygrps-yiv-2066410662">Hail everyone I am a Erudite Wizard on the Bristlebane server, I saw this list<br/>
and think it is a great idea.  Just wondering if this is going to be a list for<br/>
ooc stuff for tips and such or will it be a more in character advice list?  Just<br/>
wondering.<br/>

Opps: I had hit reply earlier and sent this to just one person, sorry about <br/>
that, to whoever recieved it I realized my mistake to late.  This is my fourth <br/>
mailing list for EQ and it still doesn&#92;&#39;t help the withdrawl while at work. <br/>
