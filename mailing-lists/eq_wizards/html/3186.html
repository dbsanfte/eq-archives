<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But, if I chain cast with my short recovery time (even <br/>
&gt; with 4 fizzles in a<br/>
&gt; row) I get mauled fast and interrupted until it leaves <br/>
&gt; me alone, or one of<br/>
&gt; us is dead.<br/>
&gt; How do you all get around that?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You learn burn control. <br/>
in short, in a well balanced group you should only be <br/>
putting 2 casts on each critter. one should be at the <br/>
beggining after the tanks have had a chance to get it <br/>
good and pissed at them(1/8 or so of the critters hp <br/>
gone is when i hit &#92;&#39;em) and then another at the end to <br/>
finish them off(this you gotta kinda learn to <br/>
eyeball...and relearn each time you get new spells)<br/>
<br/>
now this will change for diffrent critters, spell <br/>
casters you just nuke the hell out of since a lot of <br/>
their spells don&#92;&#39;t interuppt you and your MR should be <br/>
high enoguh that you don&#92;&#39;t get burned too bad by them, <br/>
there are other times when going &#92;&quot;flamethrower&#92;&quot; is a <br/>
good thing, but most of the time you don&#92;&#39;t want to throw <br/>
too much on them....<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and somethign to think about, since one of our <br/>
functions is for those emergancy situations, it&#92;&#39;s not <br/>
bad to finish a fight with mana left...<br/>
<br/>
anyway, a lot to think about, but burn control is one of <br/>
the most important things to learn as a Wizard(or caster <br/>
in general...seen too many druids die needlessly cause <br/>
the never learned it...but for wiz&#92;&#39;s it&#92;&#39;s vital to <br/>
learn, or you will die often..)<br/>
