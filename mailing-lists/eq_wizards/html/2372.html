<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826778758">According to Sergey Bukhman:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Thing is, they released buggy software. I paid good money for it, and keep paying every<br/>
&gt; month.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>[OOLT = Out Of List Topic]<br/>
<br/>
If people paid only for bugless software, the computer industry would crash down<br/>
overnight :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Have you ever seen a TV released that only shows prime number channels, with a promise<br/>
&gt; to come fix it some time? Ever seen a stove that only heats to 50 degrees with a promise<br/>
&gt; to come fix it some time? Ever see a car that only turns left with a promise to come fix<br/>
&gt; it some time? No. This happens only in computer software, especially high profile games.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Software industry faces two choices:<br/>
<br/>
- Refine their products until nothing can be done, release it after three years,<br/>
	and ask $300 per copy<br/>
- Release a working product, release it after a year, and ask $50 per copy<br/>
<br/>
Another problem is that, if you want to release a product that will be used by 100,000<br/>
persons, and want it bugless, you need to use 100,000 beta-testers over a period roughly<br/>
equal to the product lifetime... or people will find bugs.<br/>
<br/>
(non-regression testing also delay fixing, yadda, yadda)<br/>
