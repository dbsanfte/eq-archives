<b>Subject:</b> Re: Different color ROBES, and how to get them.. .. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-112744234">I&#39;m kind of curious about something...if you have to put the robe in a<br/>
bag...then get killed...then give &quot;/consent&quot;<br/>
to a player to loot your corpse.  Would just putting the robe in a bad and<br/>
giving the bag to another player work?<br/>
I Haven&#39;t tried it, but I was just curious.<br/>
