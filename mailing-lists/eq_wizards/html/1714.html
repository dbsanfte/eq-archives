<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556905385">I have to agree with Sergey....Twinking (whoever thought up this stupid<br/>
word, wonder if Websters will add it to the dictionary next time they<br/>
publish), is not taking away from everyone or even ANYONE, other than the<br/>
person who is twinking...they don&#39;t earn the item.  Twinking is making<br/>
someone elses game time more enjoyable for them.  I have a  hard time with<br/>
the points everyone is making against this...what IF you had rightfully<br/>
earned the items you have, only to be KOS in an area that you have one hell<br/>
of a time getting your body from, and you try and try and try as you might<br/>
to get your body and items back, and when all told, you have lost 3 or 4<br/>
full levels.  This does happen, I have read posts, I have personally lost a<br/>
full level in no time at all because of similar situation.  Yeah I won&#39;t<br/>
ever worry about it so much again, and probably the people who have lost<br/>
multiple levels won&#39;t go there again either...first time for everything and<br/>
hindsight IS 20/20.  So, whats that person going to do if they are accused<br/>
of twinking?  Who can say that these folks (other than level 1-6 or so with<br/>
high level stuff) hasn&#39;t earned it and had a turn of REALLY bad luck?  I<br/>
would not venture down that path myself.  And what should they do??   Give<br/>
up the items they have rightfully earned just because someone else is going<br/>
to get their panties in a bunch because they don&#39;t think this person should<br/>
have a given item?  Get real.  Twinking is not taking anything away from the<br/>
other gamers, all the items continue to spawn, it isn&#39;t like they appear one<br/>
time every 3 weeks in the game or just once and never again.  The stuff<br/>
still appears.  The guild camping might be a more important topic to argue<br/>
rather than the occasional person who has a special item or two.  If someone<br/>
came up to you and offered to give you a flowing black robe, a runed totem<br/>
staff, or something else special because they like you or felt sorry for<br/>
your current situation, can you HONESTLY say, without hesitation, and<br/>
without being untruthful that you would NOT accept this item because you<br/>
would then be guilty of twinking yourself?  Or is it only if you ask someone<br/>
to get something for you or you have another character that is high level<br/>
sharing things with your lower level character...it seems the folks who are<br/>
really against this have problems with tripping over themselves when<br/>
confronted with real situations.<br/>
I think this whole topic is way out of hand and really needs a rest.  Lets<br/>
gripe about the guild stuff for a while...<br/>
And there really is no purpose in name calling that I can see here.  People<br/>
need to discuss things in a reasonably respectful manner or if the topic is<br/>
too hot for you to respond to without name calling, etc, then just leave it<br/>
alone and stew until you can remark in a constructive manner.</div>
