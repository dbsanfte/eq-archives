<div id="ygrps-yiv-349567100">I agree, those are the only spells that I bought when i hit lvl 8. Others<br/>
are fun and nice to have<br/>
if you have the Extra $$ , but i wouldn&#39;t waste $$ on them at lvl 8 . Save<br/>
all the platinum you can<br/>
because come lvl 16 Spells get very very expensive. I dropped over 50 plat<br/>
for my level 16 spells.<br/>
Of course i just had to have most of them :) <br/>

&gt;By rank three I am assuming that you mean lvl 8.  That is one of the best<br/>
&gt;lvls for spells  you will definitely need the following:<br/>
&gt;Shock of ice (34dmg for 30 mana), Fire Bolt(45dmg for 40 mana)  be careful<br/>
&gt;with the fire bolt as it requires a direct line of sight to hit, lesser<br/>
&gt;shielding is a must as we are very vulnerable and this will be your shield<br/>
&gt;until lvl 16, resistant skin is good against rat plague disease and spider<br/>
&gt;poison.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hope this helped<br/>

&gt;	Greetings and Good day.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	I am Gaedin, a 5th level High Elf Wizard on Veeshan who spends his<br/>
&gt;days <br/>
&gt;	wandering around Kelethin sniping at Orc Centurions.  I do actually<br/>
&gt;have a <br/>
&gt;	question.  Could one of you 8+ levelers out there tell me which Rank<br/>
&gt;3 <br/>
&gt;	scrolls are worth buying?  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	Many Thanks and drop me a line sometime if you want to go hunting...<br/>
