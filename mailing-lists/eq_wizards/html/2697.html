<div id="ygrps-yiv-745427183">Is it just me or is this list slowing down lately?  :)<br/>
<br/>
In the interest of getting some discussion going again, anybody know any <br/>
good mid-level quests suitable for 20ish Wizards?  Things have been slowing <br/>
down for good &#39;ol LimDul lately and I&#39;m looking around for something else to <br/>
do besides all the senseless killing.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I wish Verant had more items for us to find...we all know the <br/>
items everyone wants (ie.  Observer Robe/Staff, Shimmering Orb, etc)  Too <br/>
bad there weren&#39;t enough variety of items so that we don&#39;t have to all camp <br/>
for the same things.  Imagine if there were several different varieties of <br/>
Observer robes or Different colors of Orbs? Maybe just adjust the stats just <br/>
a fraction to allow for different combinations.  It&#39;s a shame everyone has <br/>
to keep butting heads looking for the same things....only to find you look <br/>
like everyone else once you get it.  :(  I would think the above types of <br/>
changes wouldn&#39;t drastically be difficult under the current game <br/>
engine...nor would they ruin game balance...or would they?<br/>
<br/>
I can see their rationale in limiting &quot;rare&quot; items to only 1 NPC.  But <br/>
placed in the perspective of 1500 on a server, that poor NPC is typically <br/>
going to be camped by everyone who wants that item.  It would be nice to <br/>
provide other items that one might choose that would work in lieu of camping <br/>
for days for an item.<br/>
<br/>
*sigh*  Just dreaming to myself. ;)<br/>
