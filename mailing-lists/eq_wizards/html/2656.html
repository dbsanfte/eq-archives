&gt;I&#39;m just wondering i saw a Magician on the Mithandril Marr server the other <br/>
&gt;day dueling a wizard.  The Magician was of the 13th level and the Wizard was <br/>
&gt;of the 9th level.  The wizard won because of his quick spell casting.  The <br/>
&gt;Magician had his pet out but the pet wouldn&#39;t attack.  I am just wondering<br/>

&gt;So far the Magician guy told me that it wouldn&#39;t respond to him when he told <br/>
&gt;it to attack the 9th level Wizard.<br/>
