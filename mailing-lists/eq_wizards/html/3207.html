<div id="ygrps-yiv-1727115812">Well, if I am soloing I get around it with root or enstill or bonds of<br/>
force.  If I am in a group I usually help out at first with Tishan&#39;s clash<br/>
to stun the creature, and since it only does about 40 the mob won&#39;t turn on<br/>
me.  Then, after the others in the group are higher on its hate list, I<br/>
blast it good once, and then once more to finish it a little while later.<br/>
Once in a while, I can chain cast on something, and it won&#39;t turn on me--<br/>
usually because for some reason another party member has frenzied it or<br/>
something, and it just won&#39;t turn off of them, taunt notwithstanding.<br/>

&gt; I have gate and bind, and they are a blast!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But, if I chain cast with my short recovery time (even with 4 fizzles in a<br/>
row) I get mauled fast and interrupted until it leaves me alone, or one of<br/>
us is dead.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How do you all get around that?<br/>
