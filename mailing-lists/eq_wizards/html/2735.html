<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695433451">I don&#39;t know who to believe about this.  But I was chatting with a GM<br/>
yesterday, and he kept repeating to everyone there that Wizards can deal<br/>
more damage in less time than any class in the game, regardless of level.<br/>
He also said that his level 50 wizard could do 4000 points in less than 20<br/>
seconds.  Now, maybe he meant ice comet, I don&#39;t know.  But no one I&#39;ve<br/>
talked to has any problem with high level wizards, nor have I ever heard<br/>
anyone say they are weak.  Until now, that is.<br/>

&gt; I am not sure you know how weak we are.... You tell about dd ? ok. Do you<br/>
&gt; know that your best spel at level 50 only does 625 dommage ???? And that<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; best dd spel for DRUID is 615 (and they buy it IN A FUCKING SHOP)????<br/>
&gt; Magician get a BOLT who deal 900 dommage at level 49 (AND THEY BUY IT TOO<br/>
IN<br/>
&gt; A FUCKING SHOP!)... ok it s a bolt so dificult to cast by WTF we must have<br/>
&gt; the best dd spel no ????? With nearly the same mana/ratio.... Don t speak<br/>
&gt; about ice comet, you never never will have it (unless you have 40 friend<br/>
&gt; level 50 and who are ready to spare it with you...)... And oh yes : you<br/>
best<br/>
&gt; dd spel is fire based so you can NOT hit fire giant (nothing in solusek b<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; fact)and nagafen (who is one of the mob carrying the rune). So you use you<br/>
&gt; level 39 sple at level 50.. that s pretty cool no ?  At level 34 you have<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; dd of 315 .. cool the magician have a bolt who deal 345 at 34 ...... So i<br/>
am<br/>
&gt; sure you realise how weak we are right now :). People ask us to group ?<br/>
Yes<br/>
&gt; cause they THINK we are the best dd caster... And it s not true at level<br/>
23<br/>
&gt; you use a stupid level 16 spel. From 24 to 29 we are the best dd caster<br/>
yep.<br/>
&gt; But from 34 to the end, no way we are nothing. I have one friend who is<br/>
&gt; level 50 dark elfe on karana (menahemen a french speaking guy coming from<br/>
&gt; suisse). He just stop playing at level 50 not because he don t like his<br/>
&gt; wizzard cause he was really bored about what verant does to us (i mean we<br/>
&gt; are undepowere dlike hell so we don t hit the major mob of the game as<br/>
&gt; nagafen and lady vox :( ). Some of you may (again) tell me : ohh stop<br/>
&gt; spaming, just play another classe if you don t like this one, we are fine<br/>
&gt; with it... Ok wait till high level and we will see.. So np continue play<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; never never hope to be (not the strongest) a regular class... Just hope to<br/>
&gt; become the weakest class in the game but some like it ! (as i do :) )<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; yakos<br/>
&gt; level 26 wizzard karana<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; p.s. a druid is 15 times more useful then me in a group.... People just<br/>
don<br/>
&gt; t know we are so weak....<br/>
