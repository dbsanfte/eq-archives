&gt;<br/>
&gt; I believe that the email as it stands should be cut down a bit...<br/>
&gt; I took the org. letter and trimmed out some of the spells and suggestions<br/>
so<br/>
&gt; it is more concise.  I also clarified some points that might be vague.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We, the Wizards of the Onelist.com Eq_Wizards mailing list, feel the<br/>
Wizard<br/>
&gt; class requires revision and have compiled the following list of<br/>
suggestions:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; New Spells( to enhance our group desirablility)<br/>
&gt; [suggested levels are between 8 and 29]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Summon -     Teleports group member inside the zone to your location<br/>
&gt; Phase -         Teleports yourself to location of other group member<br/>
inside<br/>
&gt; zone<br/>
&gt; Tap Afinity -  Teleport group member to their own bind spot<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Changes to existing spells:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Root -             Minimum time duration, with random maxium time<br/>
duration.<br/>
&gt; Fade              Useless, remove completely<br/>
&gt; Shadowstep   Change to line of sight, with minimum travelled distance and<br/>
&gt; random max. distance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Skill Changes<br/>
&gt; Meditation skill max for level for wizard (Level +1) * 7.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We also request your continued efforts on implementing the Specialization<br/>
&gt; skill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Game Mechanics<br/>
&gt; -Investigate the increase of spell failures (fizzles) of lower level<br/>
spells<br/>
&gt; as Wizard class advances in levels.  Should &quot;simpler&quot; spells fail more<br/>
often<br/>
&gt; as the Wizard increase in levels, regardless of appropriate skill?  (ie.<br/>
&gt; Root, Shielding etc.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Resolving the problem of high resistence of Level 20+ DD spells by<br/>
greens,<br/>
&gt; blues and higher (if this is the result of a stun effect we wish one spell<br/>
&gt; without this effect at same level)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Resolving the balance problem of other magic-using classes still able to<br/>
&gt; affect Monsters  (in a group situation) that are 6+ above their own levels<br/>
&gt; (Necromancer - Lifetap & pets, Enchanters and Magicians - pets, buffs,<br/>
etc)<br/>
&gt; while Wizard DD spells are 100% resisted by 6+ level MoBs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - We wish real official feedback on planned changes or problems which you<br/>
&gt; have with balance in game on an official page which exists but never seems<br/>
&gt; to be updated (eg. id&#39;s Quake .plan files)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We feel the Wizard class has been overlooked far too long and that there<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; nothing that is truly unique about our characters anymore.  We feel the<br/>
&gt; above changes would go a long way towards rectifying some of the classes<br/>
&gt; shortcomings.  Thanks for your consideration.<br/>
