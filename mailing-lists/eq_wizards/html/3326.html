<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328085887">Hey, any of you other Veeshan wizzies up for maybe finishing some quests <br/>
together sometime?  maybe this weekend?<br/>
<br/>
As nice as friends and guilds are...I often find everybody is out for their <br/>
own class-specific stuff.  Would be fun to get a bunch of spell-casters <br/>
going around town to get some stuff for ourselves.  Nuke-fest!  I&#39;m out to <br/>
try to for anything from the jboots, oracle robes, acumen mask, etc.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?...hehe.  Are there even enough of us Veeshan Wizzies in <br/>
this list for a group? ;)<br/>
