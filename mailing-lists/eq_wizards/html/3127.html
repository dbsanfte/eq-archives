<b>Subject:</b> back after 3 months and need some help <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-556227043">I went away for the summer and am finally back, but to my regret, when I<br/>
updated my EQ, it only listed the most recent updates and I have no clue<br/>
what has gone on in the past 3 months! I also decided to join a pvp-teams<br/>
server but I don&#39;t even know the teams! Anyone know where I could get a list<br/>
of all the updates? Thanks, Lott.</div>
