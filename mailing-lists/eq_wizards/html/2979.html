<div id="ygrps-yiv-598285566">I dont like puting a level limit on items but i think that much better way<br/>
will be to have all special items quest only. So you can colect one quest<br/>
item, log off colect another one log off and when you have all you go to<br/>
NPC and he will make a item for you. This will also be much more in spirit<br/>
of everquest. All normal items can be found on one of mobs of same level in<br/>
one dungeon, so if you wish one item you have to harvest all dungeon to<br/>
find it! <br/>
<br/>
Other thing is to make a items wear so after some time you have to buy a<br/>
new one.<br/>
<br/>
This will end with a spot hunting will give more interesting things to do<br/>
in game. Only problem is that it will give more job for verant guys in<br/>
creating quests, at wich they are very slow .... (broken quest, practice<br/>
research quest....)<br/>
<br/>
I have also read a veri interesting article by a 50 lv wizard Samir from<br/>
Fire of heavn guild wich say that a problem with balancing magic classes is<br/>
that we are no more balanced with mele and wisdom clases as they are much<br/>
more item dipendent and they start to be significaly stronger as stronger<br/>
items are vidly disponible, much more then any int casting class wich are<br/>
more dependent on lv and spell dispnibility.<br/>
<br/>
example my warior with full bronze armour have win a fight against 8 blue!<br/>
at 7 lv he also can take freely against any yelloy , wizard twinked with a<br/>
FBR and RTS skull int rings  with full woven (wich is a same lv items as<br/>
bronze armour) will lost against 3 blue 100% and will lost against any<br/>
yellow. So it is ovius that items help much more mele classes to past low<br/>
lv but not nearly as much a int classes. hmmm There is something wrong for<br/>
my opinion.<br/>
