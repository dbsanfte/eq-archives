<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1953943827">Here is important info for those mages that still care about weapon skills.<br/>
The normal skill maximum for wizard weapon skills is &quot;(lvl+1)*3&quot;, but the<br/>
maximum skill rank for throwing skill is &quot;(lvl+1)*5&quot;.  Normally you can gain<br/>
weapon skill by simply using a weapon (under certain conditions).  The<br/>
proper conditions are:<br/>
1) You are fighting a creature which is &quot;BLUE&quot; or tougher.<br/>
2) You using a weapon wich is not already maxed in skill.<br/>
***3) You are fighting a monster that is comparable lvl to your weapon<br/>
skill.<br/>
<br/>
The throwing skill can be improved by fighting any monster, any lvl no<br/>
matter what your lvl diference is.  Basicly it is not concidered a weapon<br/>
skill.<br/>
<br/>
*** THIS IS DEBATEABLE--skills seam to improve much quicker when you work on<br/>
them every lvl, but I have had skills improve fighting &quot;GREEN&quot; monsters.<br/>
