<div id="ygrps-yiv-435631100">Ok, I have posted on this list before talking about various idea/suggestions for improvements/tweaks on the Wizard class.  I also posted new spell ideas and complimented others on their spell ideas.  Then I kept getting these &quot;if you dont like wizards dont play them&quot; kind of posts directed at me.  Well, for a while I didn&#39;t post, because noone seemed interested in the idea that Verant might not know what the hell they are talking about when it comes to Wizards.  I see now a bit of backbone creeping into this list and I say hurrah!<br/>
<br/>
Everytime a new patch comes along I cant wait to read the assoiciated patch text, hoping against all hope that something will come along that will make our class UNIQUE.  Hasnt happened yet.  I cant think of much that makes Wizards special (except for extremely high level Plane Travel spells to Planes that dont exist yet).<br/>
<br/>
How about this people.  How about we try and get ONE (1) thing changed about Wizards.  Just one thing.  Seems pretty simple and would prove that Wizards actually wield something approximating REAL power.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest it be Specialization.  Its there, doesnt work, but its there.  Verant doesnt seem to think its important (which is scary when Verant thinks that way).  Its also reasonably attainable by all Wizards, whether they solo or group (16th level, yes?).  It would benefit all Wizards if it works as Verant claims and if throws out game balance, well, I guess the other classes would have to adjust around Wizards for once!<br/>
<br/>
So come Wizards of Norrath, lets show our true Power.  Get truly Offensive for once.  Lets bombard Verant with /bugs, /feebacks and email demanding they improve our class.  /Ignore the people on this list who say the class doesnt need change!<br/>
