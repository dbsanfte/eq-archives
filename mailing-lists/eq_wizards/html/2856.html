<div id="ygrps-yiv-851714431">i have created identify with the rune. on the scroll it&#39;s written for WIZ<br/>
only, but a friend of mine (enchanter) was able to scribe it. She research<br/>
levitate for me (enchanter only) and i could scribe it. To bad this doesn&#39;t<br/>

&gt;A note on Research.  Whenever you make something with runes, no matter what<br/>
&gt;the spell is, it will be a wizard only scroll that you produce.  I<br/>
&gt;researched Enstill as well as Identify, which are both used by other<br/>
&gt;classes.  But, the scroll I created was only memorizable by wizards. </span></blockquote></div>
