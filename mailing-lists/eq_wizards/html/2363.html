<div id="ygrps-yiv-1672557594">Naw dude. I&#39;m not arguing with you the right to exploit a bug or not.<br/>
All I&#39;m saying is that most bugs are easily recognizable as bugs.<br/>
Therefore when you use them to gain advantage, you are exploiting them.<br/>
Exploits and bugs are similar. <br/>
<br/>
Now if you go exploiting bugs, that&#39;s your prerogative. I for one will<br/>
report any that I find. They are not punishing you until they ban you<br/>
from the game. Obviously they haven&#39;t yet, so don&#39;t complain to me. Go<br/>
exploit away! Have a ball!<br/>

Now about wizards...<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hm. Methinks you can &quot;Exploit a bug&quot; and call it cheating :P<br/>
&gt; &gt; But usually when you take advantage of a good situation, that situation<br/>
&gt; &gt; was not intended by the designers. Actually talking about really good<br/>
&gt; &gt; situation, like where you find bronze stuff on decaying skel or<br/>
&gt; &gt; somesuch. And I&#39;d call that cheating and exploiting.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hm, guess I don&#39;t really differentiate. Give an example where exploiting<br/>
&gt; &gt; is not cheating...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, tough! They (Verant) made the game, and now they are trying to punish US<br/>
&gt; for playing it the way it is! They designed it and they have the bugs in. So let<br/>
&gt; them fix the bugs and not tell us &quot;no you can&#39;t do this&quot;. That&#39;s stupid. They<br/>
&gt; created the game and I&#39;m playing it the way it is.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; furthermore, nowhere on their site do they have a list of exploits that should be<br/>
&gt; avoided. They do not give us a list when we log in to the game. Yet, we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; supposed to just know them? How stupid is that?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; THEY made the design error / bug, and now they expect us not to &quot;exploit&quot; it<br/>
&gt; without even letting us know what&#39;s an exploit and what&#39;s not! They are punishing<br/>
&gt; us for their laziness / un attentiveness!<br/>
