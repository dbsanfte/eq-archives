<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Im here. Fighting my way out of Lvl 21. Or trying to... So few good &gt;places <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, I did aviaks around that time too.  Highhold is a good suggestion.  For <br/>
some of the more mature servers, these spots aren&#39;t as camped as they were <br/>
before.<br/>
<br/>
If you are brave, you might start trying Cazic.  You&#39;ll spend a few days <br/>
getting used to the MoBs trains there...but you will be speedily getting xp <br/>
through level 30+ over there.  My xp was crawling when I was getting Aviaks <br/>
through level 23...I headed to Cazic and in one night I almost got 2 levels. <br/>
  21 might be a bit low, but I&#39;ve definitely seen people there at that <br/>
level.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The Graffe site message board is pretty interesting...loads of info on how <br/>
to people have been doing quests and such.  I guess a lot of wizzies are <br/>
spending time there...too bad it loads like a slug. :)  (www.graffe.com)<br/>
