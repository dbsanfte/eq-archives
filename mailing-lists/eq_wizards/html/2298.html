&gt;Hey, another question I have for everybody out of curiosity:  now that <br/>
&gt;specialization has kicked in...what does everybody have in mind for that?  I <br/>
&gt;would think it the most popular approach to specialize in nuking <br/>
&gt;abilities...but would any of you have the need to specialize in something <br/>
&gt;else and why? ;)<br/>

fizzles? More mana efficiency?<br/>
