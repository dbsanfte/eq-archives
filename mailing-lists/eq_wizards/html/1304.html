&gt; brains..........but other party<br/>
&gt; members need brains and have to think like that too. We<br/>
&gt; KNOW we are useful<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Proof by example is the best way to go.  After saving my party a few<br/>
times, and also saving some strangers that were getting beat up, I<br/>
have convinced a good amount of people that a smart wizard is<br/>
valuable.<br/>
But I know that a lot of our class aren&#39;t great proof...<br/>
