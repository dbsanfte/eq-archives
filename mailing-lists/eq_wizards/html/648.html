<div id="ygrps-yiv-489648227">As your skill in whatever spell you cast improves.. you&#39;ll get better at that.  It happens to me all the time, while gating..  All I have to do is get the first two bubbles of my gate spell off without being interrupted.. and the last 4 bubbles always completes, whether or not I&#39;ve been hit.  I&#39;ve even actually been hit for over 100 damage and still regained concentration enough to finish the spell and gate.<br/>
<br/>
This has been this way for about a week or two now..  so it couldnt&#39;ve been that last patch.  (my opinion of course)  <br/>

&gt; Well I think they have taken some of this in to consideration because it<br/>
&gt; seems they added somehting new to last nights patch.  During the game last<br/>
&gt; night I received a message while in combat taht stated &quot;You regained<br/>
&gt; concentration&quot; and it cast my spells after it told me I lost concentration.<br/>
&gt; Could be the first steps...?  Who knows.<br/>
