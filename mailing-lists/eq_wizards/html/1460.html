<div id="ygrps-yiv-843662129">well it&#39;s very hard at the beginning but i must say that level 4 is a very<br/>
useful level. you get two of you most used spells (i still use them at 15th<br/>
level) which are root and gate. at level 8 you get your first spell that<br/>
really deals damage. to compare, the level 4 direct damage spell does 15 and<br/>
the level 8 does over 40! not to mention other spells. but the wizard really<br/>
starts coming into power at level 12. you get your money making spell (many<br/>
people will flame me for this) which is Bind Affinity. and you&#39;re new spell<br/>
does 80 damage. you also get some more utility spells. I&#39;m not even at level<br/>
16 yet but i&#39;ll tell you that those spells are incredible. now there are two<br/>
types of wizard spells. Bolt spells and Shock spells. Bolts do more damage<br/>
but they MUST have a clear path to the target. if they hit anything in<br/>
between they stop. Shock spells are generally weaker but hit the target<br/>
instantly. Both can be useful. i still use Fire Bolt (lvl 8 spell) when the<br/>
target is far away because that gives me time to cast root before the target<br/>
gets hit. Now that i&#39;ve talked about spells let me give you advice for<br/>
hunting.<br/>
<br/>
levels 1-8 or 9 (to be safe) you want to stay in Nektulos forest and East<br/>
commons. at level 8 or 9 you&#39;re ready to go to the place that you&#39;ll<br/>
probably be in for at least 3 - 4 levels. the Desert of Ro. North Ro is the<br/>
easiest place in the desert. in between Northern and Southern Ro is the<br/>
Oasis or Marr. that is a pretty hard zone and has some powerful monsters. I<br/>
still spend a lot of time in Ro and i&#39;m 15.<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s about it. i&#39;m sure once you realize how good the exp is in Ro<br/>
you&#39;ll stay for a while then start exploring, maybe going to Felwithe (if<br/>
you can stay invis long enough to get to the docks in freeport.<br/>
<br/>
good luck on your new character!<br/>
