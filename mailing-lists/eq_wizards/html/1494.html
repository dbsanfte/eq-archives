<div id="ygrps-yiv-70504244">This train aspect is a possible use of the spell.  Theoretically, there may<br/>
be good situations to purposefully use this as a fetching tool when you know<br/>
the area.     ...but I agree it is certainly useless as a scouting tool.<br/>

		Also the other thing to take into consideration when<br/>
purchasing/using this <br/>
		spell is that if you send the eye out to look around you<br/>
have to be <br/>
		prepared for monsters to train to you.  I have not<br/>
personally experienced <br/>
		that happening (because I use it very rarely if at all), but<br/>
I have heard <br/>
		of others who have used it in the dungeons only to pull a<br/>
bunch of nasties <br/>
		out on themselves, and everyone else, in the process.  It is<br/>
kind of a <br/>
		novelty spell, if you ask me, with no real use at this<br/>
point.  If they made <br/>
		the eye an entity that monsters would not train on it would<br/>
be worthwhile, <br/>
		otherwise I would just wait.   Had I known I wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
purchased it myself.</div>
