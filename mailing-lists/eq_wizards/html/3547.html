<div id="ygrps-yiv-1242966894"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">Hello my name is Debra. &nbsp;I joined this list and a few others to learn some things about wizards. &nbsp;I am writing a book and one of the main characters is a wizard. &nbsp;He has been an outcast for his whole life. &nbsp;Deceived by those whom he trusted and locked away in a frozen state for centuries. &nbsp;I want to try to find an attitude for him. &nbsp;So I thought I would spend some time finding out what a wizardly attitude really is before I go making up some stereotypical one.
<br>I will probably lurk for a while and then ask questions when something strikes me as curious. &nbsp;I hope no one minds.
<br>Debra
