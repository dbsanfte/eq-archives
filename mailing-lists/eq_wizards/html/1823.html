<div id="ygrps-yiv-298503306">Hey!  I second that motion! :)  We need *something* to help out in <br/>
situations with large parties.  In such instances, it is most fun to plan a <br/>
large assault on a tough creature... we gotta be able to contribute in some <br/>
way.  I think your idea is great...a weak but reliable spell seems to be a <br/>
reasonable compromise.<br/>
<br/>
Forget the money and items....the best fun in EQ is taking out the named <br/>
NPCs!  hehe. Dvinn and Dorn will fall many times before I will get sick of <br/>
watching them die.<br/>

Now I won&#39;t just cite a problem but also suggest a solution.  The solution<br/>
is either to give us weak spells that cannot be resisted (the necros already<br/>
have one it&#39;s the lifetap series), make our DD spells less resisted, but do<br/>
less damage against higher level creatures, or even better still give us<br/>
some utility spells (buffs?  damage shields?  spheres of protection?) that<br/>
can be cast on party members.<br/>
