&gt;According to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:dayne@...">dayne@...</a>:<br/>
&gt;&gt; Dayne IS NOT capable of soloing most blues, nor some greens. It IS<br/>
&gt;&gt; that simple. Root holds about 50% of the time. BLUES resist about 25%<br/>
&gt;&gt; of my spells.<br/>

&gt;I beg to differ. I&#39;m not 12, I&#39;m 11th, and I can solo and take:<br/>
&gt;	Orc Centurions, Lions, Lioness (East Commonlands)<br/>
&gt;	Sand Scarabs (North Ro)<br/>

How can you beg to differ? This is not an opinion. It is experience<br/>
and fact. If you re-read the above statement. &quot;Dayne IS NOT capable&quot;,<br/>
should be self explanatory enough. I make no arguments that other<br/>
wizards are not capable of soloing. I only offer proof that there is<br/>
some kind of problem with the class.<br/>
<br/>
This was not meant to be a flame, I think you may have just<br/>
misunderstood the post.<br/>
<br/>
I will make a guess that there may be some type of algorithm with<br/>
success at the carious checks that needs some tweaking by Verrant.<br/>
This is just opinion, but it is really the only logical explanation<br/>
for the varied experience on this list that I can come up with.<br/>
<br/>
Like I stated before, my other wizards did not have any problems like<br/>
these and neither do my other characters.<br/>
