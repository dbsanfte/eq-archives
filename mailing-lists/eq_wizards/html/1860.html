&gt; If you are in a group that is fighting<br/>
&gt; RED mobs and your spells are being resisted then I say you shouldn&#39;t be in<br/>
&gt; that group to begin with.  Those mobs are 5+ levels above you and your<br/>
&gt; skills as a WIZARD can not help.  Go back to that spot after a few more<br/>
&gt; levels and try again, don&#39;t whine that you couldn&#39;t do anything to help.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    That is ridiculous, why exactly should I not be able to help in a fight<br/>
against a 5+ level mob that melee classes EQUAL and LOWER to me can fight<br/>
against?  As a level 18 wizard I shouldn&#39;t have to group with 14&#39;s - 16&#39;s,<br/>
just so I can contribute in the fight.  One of the points of groups is to be<br/>
able to take on mobs that are higher than your group.  The least they should<br/>
do is to make our spells hit proportionally the same as a same level melee,<br/>
taking into consideration the amount of mana that we must expend for a<br/>
&quot;hit&quot;.<br/>
    One way would be to give us a lower mana/low damage (proportional to our<br/>
level) that either cannot be resisted or has an extremely low chance of<br/>
being resisted.  They could even balance it so that it would take a slightly<br/>
higher mana/damage ratio.  For example, you could have a spell that used the<br/>
same mana as say, shock of lightning, but instead of doing ~80 points of<br/>
damage it does ~60 but can&#39;t be resisted or will rarely be resisted.  But<br/>
then again if they just wanted a quick fix they could give us the enchanter<br/>
spell that lowers resistance. We shouldn&#39;t have to base our existence in a<br/>
group on whether or not they have an enchanter, or limit our grouping to<br/>
levels lower than our own.<br/>
