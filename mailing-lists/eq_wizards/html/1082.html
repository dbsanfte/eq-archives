    ok... I&#39;m a lvl 8 wizard (almost 9) and I just lost my SR. apprentice robe to 3rd lvl befallen, since I followed my friend down the well entrance and I got killed. I asked a friendly high level shaman if he could get my stuff and he did, except he couldn&#39;t get the robe since it&#39;s a sr apprentice robe. I don&#39;t really mind being without a robe, but was wondering if I should buy another sr. apprentice robe (that&#39;d mean leaving antonica and heading back to ak&#39;anon to get one that fits me) or just wait till I&#39;m strong enough to get the other robe that you speak of?<br/>

        Do you have to be the one to LOOT the robe from him in befallen or can a TANK loot the body then give you the robe???  Cus it would stink to have to try to kill him again if a TANK accidentaly looted his body . . .  (I you do kill him for his robe right?)<br/>

            There is no better robe than the Sr. Aprentice robes that you can buy.  From now on you&#39;ll have to quest to get a better one.  I&#39;d suggest starting with the thermateugist (sp?) robe you get from the necro thermateugist (sp?) on the third floor of befallen.  Have fun..<br/>

                What is the next step up from the Sr. Apprentice robes, where can I buy it, and how much does it cost? Thanks, Lott. </span></blockquote></div>
