<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533317161">The bolt spells require that the bolt be able to fly from you to the target<br/>
without obstruction. For instance, if people are standing in the way of your<br/>
target the bolt will miss and will not do any damage. Bolt spells do more<br/>
damage than normal direct damage spells, which are not affected by<br/>
obstructions.<br/>
 <br/>
AE is an area effect that can be cast at a certain range from your target.<br/>
PB is point-blank affecting only those creatures that are close to you.<br/>

What is a bolt and is it stronger than normal direct damage? Also, what is<br/>
the difference between AE and PB?</div>
