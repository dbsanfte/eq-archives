<div id="ygrps-yiv-1680742871"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">Tarew, thankyou for the information. &nbsp;No, a game is not what I am looking for. &nbsp;I am looking for people who study the mythological history of or practice the art if wizardry. &nbsp;I want to create from information I gather my own wizard, not use someone else&#39;s. &nbsp;I want to get to know attitudes, and blend them all together in my imagination and come up with a resentful character that somehow gets over it and becomes good again. &nbsp;But not in the usually Disney and they lived happily ever after style. &nbsp;I need to create someone who is a freak in the head who learns to get along for the sake of whatever. &nbsp;
