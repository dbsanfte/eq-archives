<div id="ygrps-yiv-1859808923">Wizards, by trade alone, are a selfish group.  Now before you rant and<br/>
flame me...hear me out.  I am a 19th wizard.  From our early lives we<br/>
study magic, alone in arcane colleges.  We concentrate on being our<br/>
best, to better our mind and intelligence.  This means little time for<br/>
socialization (at most arcane arts schools).  So yes, we do not<br/>
concentrate on buffering other players, we concentrate on causing as<br/>
much damage in as little time as possible.  This leaves only us to<br/>
think about in the way of shielding.<br/>
<br/>
(roleplay the thoughts folks...its easy...)<br/>
<br/>
My school was a serious school and one which I enjoyed my time at,<br/>
however I enjoyed flirting with the other students and frequently dated<br/>
the young lady clerics in the guild across the street and partaking in<br/>
good elven wines and ale.  I am much older now (145 years old) and<br/>
still am looking at by the high elven wizards as somewhat of an outcast<br/>
by their standards...but they never question my power and skill.  Maybe<br/>
they are just jealous.  Good looks (yeah a little gray hair, but for<br/>
145, close to middle age for me, that nnot bad), powerful magic...i do<br/>
ok.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I am sort of a Rogue Wizard.  I never liked their rules and<br/>
strict policy.  I decided to make my own policy and rules which led to<br/>
my dismissal from the school early in my education of arcane arts.  A<br/>
wizard hermit in the area of felwithe approached me and offered to<br/>
train me.  He said I reminded him of himself when he was young.  This<br/>
old mage turned out to be my father whom I thought killed by Emperor<br/>
Crush, long ago.  He trained me well and polished my skills and told me<br/>
of my true lineage in the &quot;MageStorm&quot; family.<br/>

&gt; Dear Ken,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Firstly, I agree with the root duration indicator,<br/>
&gt; that relly would save<br/>
&gt; a lot of our fellow wizards life. Secondly, I dont<br/>
&gt; agree with us getting<br/>
&gt; buffing spells like SOW, that really belongs to the<br/>
&gt; Shamans, it&#39;s one of<br/>
&gt; the spells that makes them what they are, we need<br/>
&gt; other unique buffers<br/>
&gt; like magic resistence and in particular AE defense<br/>
&gt; spells.<br/>
