<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679795707">Wizards are deff very nice for doing a quick amount of damage..but It seems people are looking at the wizard as this all powerful godly char..we start hitting a mob too soon and it turns on us and we can be quickly running for the hills or adding another notch on our tombstone. Personaly I hope that the later spells are going to be very hard to get..I dont know what all spells can be bought etc, but I hate seeing every wizard just like another..thus it will come a point where every x level Wiz wont have the same spells because some just either dont know where (doubtful due to spoiler information) or just for one reason or another cant get the spell..im all for eliteism in games like these. Know ill probably get flamed to hell for this one..just my opinion..I like to make things very hard in multi player games.<br/>

I have to say I am a little confused.  Verant has specifically designed the <br/>
game with a group in mind, yet we are arguing the value of a wizard <br/>
according to his solo ability.  I find that odd.<br/>
<br/>
All I can say is, give me a tank, then a target, then the location you want <br/>
me to dispose of the remains.  If you worry about a creature beating on you, <br/>
bring a wizard along.  It won&#39;t hit you for long.<br/>
<br/>
I am a wizard.  I kill things.  I do it well.<br/>

&gt;interupts, and no resistance..Im not sure what a warriors HP is like at <br/>
&gt;that level, as I have never played one myself (anybody help here?) but I <br/>
&gt;could see you being In a lot of trouble when dueling one..if you get a root <br/>
&gt;of and manage to take him down from afar with remaining mana all well and <br/>
&gt;good but wizards are a very feeble class one on one when it comes to <br/>
&gt;fighting face to face, you end up exhausting your mana trying to get a <br/>
&gt;quick root in and then backing off to cast dmg spells again..<br/>
