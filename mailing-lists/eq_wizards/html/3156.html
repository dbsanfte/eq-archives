&gt; With all the changes to Mages, Enchanters and Necros does anyone know of any<br/>
&gt; changes for Wizards coming up?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I mean Enchanters seem to be ruling the game now, with all the Enchanter<br/>
&gt; only quests and new abilities they are the most powerful class in the game.<br/>
&gt; At this rate they may have to change the name of this game to<br/>
&gt; &quot;EnchanterQuest&quot;. Now I know they added the Tarton&#39;s Wheel quest for us<br/>
&gt; wizards but that isn&#39;t going to help me until I get closer to 49th and can<br/>
&gt; actually use the runes.<br/>

quit between L20-24 because of the lack of solo ability between those levels.<br/>
Its not impossible to solo at those levels, but it very difficult and time<br/>
consuming</div>
