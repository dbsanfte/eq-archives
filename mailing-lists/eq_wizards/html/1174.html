<div id="ygrps-yiv-1773954525">I would believe you have to do at least half the damage to the MOB before<br/>
you can get the XP for it.  Seems logical that this would have to happen.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is a nifty idea.  Are you getting the experience for it?  I&#39;ve seen<br/>
&gt; NPC&#39;s fall from high places and die before and have never been able to get<br/>
&gt; any experience for it.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	This weekend I was experimenting with an interesting new tactic to<br/>
&gt; cause<br/>
&gt; 	damage to monsters.  The problem was that I really couldn&#39;t verify<br/>
&gt; how well<br/>
&gt; 	it works, because I&#39;m not certain if monsters take damage from<br/>
&gt; falling or not.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	But what I would do is hit a monster from long distance with a<br/>
&gt; spell, then<br/>
&gt; 	run up a VERY VERY steep cliff.  Once at the top of the cliff I wait<br/>
&gt; till<br/>
&gt; 	the monster hits me, then I hit the fade button.  9 times out of 10,<br/>
&gt; fade<br/>
&gt; 	takes me to the bottom of the cliff.  The monster then jumps off the<br/>
&gt; cliff<br/>
&gt; 	to get me, and I&#39;m assuming it takes some damage from the fall.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	I did this a couple times... the biggest problem is finding suitable<br/>
&gt; cliffs<br/>
&gt; 	to fade from, and the second worst problem is being careful not to<br/>
&gt; fall in<br/>
&gt; 	myself.<br/>
