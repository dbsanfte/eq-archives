for cash?&lt;&lt;<br/>

I don&#39;t know about others, but I haven&#39;t found a ready source for cash that I can <br/>
survive hunting.  I generally hunt with a similar level warrior.  By scrimping and saving <br/>
tho I have gotten a full set of cloth armor and most of my level 8 spells.  Currently am <br/>
level 10.  Now begins the scrimping and saving to get level 12 spells.  I know that <br/>
some others have taken up smithing, etc to make money.. but I chose to save my <br/>
money for the spells themselves rather than spend the little I made on supplies for a <br/>
skill like smithing.  I&#39;d love to find a money tree but since I think that&#39;s unlikely will just <br/>
play patiently and save up slowly.  As others have pointed out here, I suspect that <br/>
getting cash will be easier at higher levels.<br/>
