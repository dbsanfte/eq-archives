<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926184830">Thanks for the information, though I cant see the problem becouse all the monsters can go in there and then it is not a safe zone. In beta there where places the monsters didnt go to even if U were attacking them, you could just go to safe zone and the monster run away.<br/>
<br/>
I will stop doing it until I hear something else.<br/>

    Apparently, it is considered not okay to cast from the doors in lavastorm by najena OR from the mountainside or from atop rocks ... I am now aware the gms/guides consider it exploitation and they will chew you for it.  I am told the doors are considered part of a safe zone, although I don&#39;t see how the side of the mountain qualifies, I was made aware of that as well.  Just news for us magic users since we are the &quot;worse exploiters&quot; in their eyes.<br/>
    There are people who do this, but for those of us who don&#39;t do things purposely and try to play fair, I thought this was a good informative post.  Ya never know what they are going to change next.<br/>
    This needs to be made public because they aren&#39;t going to for fear of exploitation.. at the same time though, people who have been playing since the start and are not aware of this limitation/rule are going to be accused of exploiting a safe zone, so I feel that the only way around that is for people to share this information so the average honest player does not get in trouble for doing the same stuff they have always done in the game.</div>
