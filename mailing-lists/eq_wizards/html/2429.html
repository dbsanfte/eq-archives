<b>Subject:</b> KS tricks + Grouping for XP <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-950571085">Why does everyone keep telling me &quot;come to server blah blah and see how<br/>
your tricks works&quot; .  I am on Tunare server and i&#39;m gona stay here and KS as<br/>
long as i think its giving me more XP than doing  something else.  Anyways, ppl<br/>
on every server are just humans, some are stupid, some are smart.  Some ppl<br/>
can&#39;t do dick all about me KS their kills and some will take action.  So it<br/>
doesn&#39;t depend on which server you play on, you can always KS.  On Tunare, not a<br/>
lot of KSer out there, i&#39;ve only met 2 others who also KS on a regular basis, so<br/>
its pretty rare too.  The more rare it is, the better actually, cuz most ppl<br/>
don&#39;t know how to deal with it instead of just crying how i&#39;m taking all the xp<br/>
and challenge me to duals hahaha.<br/>
<br/>
     If grouping is better for XP, i will group.  I power game and want to get a<br/>
few lvl 50 characters before the expansion comes out.  Some of you keep saying<br/>
&quot;when your lvl 25, see how your KS tricks work&quot;.  well if they dont fucking<br/>
work, i won&#39;t use it !! are you stupid or something ? situations change, you<br/>
must adapt to gain higher XP.  everything is about XP, i dont&#39; give a shit if KS<br/>
or grouping is better. I just care if KS gives me more XP or not.   i have<br/>
gaiend 4 lvls in the past few days and my RL friend only gain 1 lvl. and he<br/>
played same amount of time as i did.  We were both at lvl 10 and now i am 14,<br/>
while he is only 11.   We actually grouped at lvl 10 for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
     Even if your in a group, doesn&#39;t mean you should stop KS.  I KS anytime i<br/>
have mana, when i&#39;m in a group, i let the group fight and give me XP, but while<br/>
thats going on, i see someone else fighting then i take their kill too. then i<br/>
get more xp than if i was to wait for the group to med up and shit.<br/>
<br/>
     When i get to lvl 20 and see that KS is no good, then i will stop.  Simple<br/>
as that.   If it gives no XP , why do it ??<br/>
<br/>
PS. if they give player bonus XP cuz they role play and make the game better, i<br/>
will role play as well.<br/>

Re:<br/>
come KS on RZ and u&#39;ll be eating dirt after the first cpl tricks :)  I don&#39;t<br/>
even know if anybody knows what kill stealing is on RZ cause it just doesn&#39;t<br/>
happen.<br/>
<br/>
and if u read my post, i said it&#39;s fine to do what ur doing with melee at<br/>
lvl 13 (hey, its actually effective up to a certain point). but once u hit<br/>
the mid 20&#39;s and higher ur little trick just won&#39;t work.  u will either have<br/>
to root or run...  or get u a good tank and cleric (it&#39;s called a balanced<br/>
group, something required at higher lvls :)<br/>
