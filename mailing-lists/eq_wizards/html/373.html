<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970130443">I have attained the 4th rank of spells and would like some advice on <br/>
which spells to get next. I buy new spells as a get the money ( My <br/>
Runed Totem staff cleaned me out) Now I have Shock of lightning, Bind <br/>
Affinity, and just purchased spiral of frost. I am intrigued by halo <br/>
of light and resistant skin. Any advice one the order of spells I <br/>
should purchase and reasoning why would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
TIA<br/>
