Hey, it was too tempting. I&#39;ve found that it works on pretty much anything<br/>
that cons blue. This includes, Emperor Crush, Ambassador Dvinn, a whole host<br/>
of orcs, Crag spiders. Yeah I&#39;ve fizzled but never twice in a row. I&#39;ve had<br/>
it resisted ONCE by a blue. I wouldn&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;m not casting it<br/>
more than once a fight anyways. Takes forever to be able to cast it again,<br/>
and eats up a TON of mana. I wouldn&#39;t worry about other people&#39;s<br/>
experiences. Have your own, and take it from there. Like your mother said,<br/>
if you friend jumped off the bridge you would have to as well? Seems to me<br/>
it&#39;s all in perspective. I&#39;ve had a blast with Force Shock.<br/>
