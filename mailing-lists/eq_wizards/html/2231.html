Incorrect incorrect. I believe I saw a posting here not too long ago saying <br/>
other classes (Druid?) get more powerful DD spells than we do at one of the <br/>
higher levels.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Enchanters and magicians can cast beneficial buffs on party members, debuff <br/>
mobs, and have summoned creatures to fight for them. Hell, their creatures <br/>
can even cast now!  Clerics can heal party members, as can Rangers, Druids, <br/>
and Shamen. All we can do is cast O&#39;Keil&#39;s radiation on a tank for a paltry <br/>
2 points per melee hit.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">                &gt;to go against high reds as well.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With a level spread of *2* in the party, if something cons red to the tank <br/>
but is known to be only a few levels above the highest level char, groups <br/>
will often engage for the extra exp, esp if they&#39;re mostly <br/>
warrior/paladin/melee types. In a well-balanced party of melee, healers and <br/>
casters, wizards are the least useful in this situation if they&#39;re a couple <br/>
levels lower than the main tank ppl. And against &quot;medium&quot; or &quot;low&quot; reds, <br/>
yeah I love burning a bubble of mana on a creature and only do a 15% of the <br/>
damage it should, when it is not completely resisted. This means more <br/>
downtime for the wiz and embarassment because your spells suddenly suck. <br/>
Worse-case, the mobs get irritated that you&#39;re even TRYING to shoot them, <br/>
and you die very, very quickly.<br/>

I&#39;ve followed the teachings of Zaeq, North Karana beetle-kiter <br/>
extraordinare. What ends up happening is I run to the beetle, hit it, get it <br/>
down, then some damned animal jumps me and I have to zone.  There&#39;s no place <br/>
else I can solo in the queynos/karana area that&#39;s not overly camped. Even <br/>
wisps give me little exp anymore, many con green at 15th.<br/>

<br/>
               &gt;You have doubts that specialization and the planes will be <br/>

<br/>
Did I state that? No. Now that you mention it, they&#39;ve promised it since <br/>
retail release, nothing has come of it so far.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As an update: I finally got sick of my wizard after reaching 15th 3 times in <br/>
6 hours of play, and having extraordinary bad luck at every turn. I&#39;ve <br/>
examined the amount of time I&#39;ve invested in playing, sometimes at the <br/>
expense of fresh air, exercise and a social life out &quot;in the world&quot;. It&#39;s a <br/>
lot of time, 8 days total. While I&#39;ve made some friends in the game, and <br/>
seen some interesting sights, I don&#39;t think a wizard suits my play style (my <br/>
20th level name would have been &quot;The Suicidal&quot; as when in group I like to <br/>
melee a little). I have given all my worldly possessions to &quot;Clarkie&quot;, a 2nd <br/>
level Erudite wiz at Queynos. Please don&#39;t harass him for his good fortune <br/>
as my successor. I&#39;ll be unsubbing from this list after a couple of days. I <br/>
wish everyone luck in their endeavors, and hope your petition to Verant is <br/>
met with success.<br/>
<br/>
Safe journey,<br/>
