&gt; As far as is my experience I have never been able to loot the robe off of a body<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; that I have been given consent to.  So I don&#92;&#39;t see how the plan to take it from<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; a dark elf would work.   Just my two cents.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also as a newbie to the 8th level, should I get shock of ice or firebolt? I am <br/>
&gt; am broke and saving to buy my first new spell. I actually have had luck with <br/>
&gt; parties and explain my role so they understand. Buffing the warriors with <br/>
&gt; Okeils, does make them apprieciative too.  Most like the fact that monsters get <br/>
&gt; hurt when hitting them, fits right into the warrior ego/mentality of hurt, <br/>
&gt; crush, bash, cut. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hey, I love the one line remarks but could you maybe just trim all the quote <br/>
&gt; crap out except the last message you are one lining, I recently switched to the <br/>
&gt; digest version and 90% of that message is quoted spam and headers.  Oh well it <br/>
&gt; is better than trying to read 110 messages, when only halfway through the first <br/>
&gt; you get 10 more. I really didn&#92;&#39;t care but took to long to read that way, easier<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; in digest (after all I need to read these quick so I can play more EQ). I am on <br/>
&gt; 4 other EQ lists too :P still can&#92;&#39;t get enough. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway I am off on another journey. <br/>
