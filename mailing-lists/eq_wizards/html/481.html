<b>Subject:</b> tip for lvl 8 wiz.  **spoiler** <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087222971">Wow, I&#39;m a little behind on the mail.  (so MANY posts to this list! =)<br/>
But anyway Cornn, I just wanted to give a fellow Wiz encouragment.  I <br/>
think lvl 8-10 was my toughest levels as well.  Slow going and you <br/>
don&#39;t have enough punch to survive on your own much.  I just recently <br/>
achieved 12 and it&#39;s getting to be a LOT more fun.<br/>
<br/>
Head over to the Felwithe area instead of Freeport.  Crushbone is a <br/>
good key area and the goblin camps in ButcherBlock are good too.  I <br/>
don&#39;t know what it is, but it seems the people in Freeport are not <br/>
quite as friendly (no offense =).  Not to mention the Sand Giants and <br/>
Madmen can get downright dangerous for a Wiz over there, IMHO.   If <br/>
you have a strong, trusted party, you might venture to Steamfont for <br/>
hunting Minotaurs.  They give you Mino Axes with will fetch you ~10pp <br/>
over in Queynos or about 5pp in the local area.<br/>
<br/>
It was real dangerous for me to travel to Queynos, even in an <br/>
experienced party.  I don&#39;t regret seeing new sites, but I should have <br/>
stayed home till at least 12 lvl.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ok I have a problem....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am a level 8 Human Wizard in Freeport, Xegony server. My problem is <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do not have any friends playing EQ. My game so far has been solo. <br/>
The levels are coming very slow. I have grouped up with people several <br/>
times. This turns into a nightmare. Most of the time we all just run <br/>
around aimlessly, it takes so much time just to get sometime going its <br/>
not really worth it.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone have any suggestions? I have a friend who is going to buy the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>game soon, its just hard to wait. It took me 1 week to level up from 7 <br/>
to 8.<br/>

&gt;Sorry for the long winning post.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, I have no good news for you. I found lvl 8 and 9 to be my <br/>
 </span></blockquote>hardest thus<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;far simply because when you go solo everything is either too hard, or <br/>
 </span></blockquote>too<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;easy.. there aren&#39;t many in betweens.  (at least that is what I found <br/>
 </span></blockquote>for<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;tons of problems solo.  The only advice I can give you, is keep <br/>
 </span></blockquote>trying in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the parties.. eventually you will find some good people who play <br/>

 </span></blockquote>who to<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Sorry I have nothing really conforting to say.. but grouping is a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>major part<br/>
