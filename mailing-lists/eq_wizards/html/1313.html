<b>Subject:</b> Re: Root vs Enstill <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-70839872">I think root and enstill are the same spell, they are just different <br/>
levels...they name them differently when they have different <br/>
strengths..i.e. minor shielding, lesser shielding, greater sheilding.. <br/>
while all shielding spells, obviousl,y they have different strengths but do <br/>
the same thing to their different degrees...  That is my educated guess <br/>
from looking at my book.  I am not to level 20 yet.  I can tell you in a <br/>
month or so for certain when I get up there...(with a little luck)<br/>
<br/>
They keep the npc from approaching any further for a limited time...IF they <br/>
don&#39;t resist it.  I seem to cast it on a lot of monsters that resist and I <br/>
don&#39;t know if it is level related or what the difference is.  Maybe they <br/>
really don&#39;t like the little inky wizzys :) heh<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else who has experience with this directly might want to confirm or <br/>
deny this.<br/>

&gt;Dear Cristie<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Therefore Root and Enstill are the same spell? Root stops your feet moving<br/>
&gt;while Enstill stops your whole body moving?<br/>
