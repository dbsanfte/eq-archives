<div id="ygrps-yiv-817177188">Wrong idea...YOu are saying to allow the wizard to be able to SOLO<br/>
better.  Again, this is not SoloQUEST (although its not really Quest<br/>
anything yet with alot of quests broken).<br/>
<br/>
Tanks have same trouble with even fights sometimes...I play a tank and<br/>
a wizard.   The tank is easy at low levels, but I remember taking on 3<br/>
black wolves and two orc pawns all at once with my wizard...he killed<br/>
thma all and begged for more.  <br/>

&gt; I gave up my wizard quite some time ago, they really<br/>
&gt; are quite weak, only<br/>
&gt; good for two things, grouping and stealing kills. <br/>
&gt; What do other spell<br/>
&gt; casting classes have that we lack?  Pets of course. <br/>
&gt; The steel skin, leather<br/>
&gt; skin line of spells should be altered in such a way<br/>
&gt; that wizards from low<br/>
&gt; lvl&#39;s (perhaps 8) can summon a sort of wall.  This<br/>
&gt; wall would be sort of<br/>
&gt; like a pet (graphically how it would show does&#39;nt<br/>
&gt; concern me) but without<br/>
&gt; offensive capabilities, it would simply soak damage<br/>
&gt; and allow a wizard to<br/>
&gt; not be interrupted.  For example, wizard A wants to<br/>
&gt; solo an even fight orc,<br/>
&gt; so he summons his wall of whatever, that soaks 50<br/>
&gt; damage without the wizard<br/>
&gt; actually being hit, the wizard can skip the risky<br/>
&gt; root opening shot and get<br/>
&gt; right to damage.  This would put wizards on an even<br/>
&gt; playing field with other<br/>
&gt; magic classes, they NEVER root for their opening<br/>
&gt; shot, that&#39;s what their<br/>
&gt; pets are for, we should&#39;nt have to rely on root<br/>
&gt; either, we need something<br/>
&gt; more definite like this wall idea.  It&#39;s the only<br/>
&gt; thing that would get me to<br/>
&gt; play the wizard class again.<br/>
