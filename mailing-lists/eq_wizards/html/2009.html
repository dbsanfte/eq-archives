<div id="ygrps-yiv-328428723">I think it&#39;s safe to say you can count us all in. Thanks for your all work<br/>
on our behalf. <br/>

I also wanted to say I had a great experience today. Within a few minutes<br/>
of logging on I got a /tell asking me to join a group. They really<br/>
appreciated my talent as a wizard for taking down gnoll elites and<br/>
commanders quickly while they tanked. That was a great change of pace. I<br/>
needed that!<br/>
