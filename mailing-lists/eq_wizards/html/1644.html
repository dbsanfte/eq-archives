increase in bare hand skill (still at 10 or 11)!  <br/>

What is going on am I to start on /con blue creatures at level 9.  If so<br/>
and had I known (ie if the manual had any value at all) I would have been<br/>
training 1H skills much early when the creatures could not kill me in 2 or<br/>
3 blows!<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone confirm this and/or give suggestions on how at this point (9th)<br/>
I can improve my 1H fighting skills?&lt;&lt;<br/>

I had been doing the same thing until recently.  After reading the <br/>
recommendations on this list, I picked up a cracked staff and got a Snake <br/>
Fang out of mothballs...err...the bank where it had been gathering dust.  I went <br/>
to the Goblin Warrior camp in butcherblock with my level 9 hunting partner (I <br/>
was level 10 at the time) who, luckily for me, is a cleric.  I was able to bring 1h <br/>
blunt form 0 to max of 33 in 2 days of playing, then I did the same for my <br/>
piercing skill.. tho that was at 17 when I started so didn&#39;t take as long.  It&#39;s <br/>
definitely doable.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck. :)<br/>
