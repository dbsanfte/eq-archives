<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088154085">Whoa. Hold on there, Iggie didn&#39;t say YOU, he said that there are a lot<br/>
of +pvp players that are jerks. There are also a ton of -pvp players that<br/>
are jerks as well. I&#39;ll tell you about Elyas the loser Paladin on Solusek Ro<br/>
sometime. Enabling +pvp or -pvp is a choice you make, and because Verant has<br/>
decided to offer you this choice, it is also up to them to protect players<br/>
that don&#39;t share a +pvp view. They&#39;ve given you &#39;free zones&#39; where even -pvp<br/>
players are fair game, they&#39;ve given you an entire +pvp server. I don&#39;t see<br/>
what more they can offer? Are thee bugs, yes that&#39;s true, but I think that<br/>
fixing global bugs that affect everyone will be more of a priority than bugs<br/>
that affect a single class. So you have restrictions that I do not have as<br/>
a -pvp wizard. It was your choice, so live with it. Learn to get around it,<br/>
and I&#39;m sure that you&#39;ll have a much better experience for it.<br/>
<br/>
    You also have to remember that it&#39;s THEIR world  you&#39;re in, so you have<br/>
to conform to them, they don&#39;t have to conform to you, even though a lot of<br/>
player suggestions have been implemented. I&#39;m still waiting for a patch that<br/>
will save the choice of how I view servers. Why would anyone want to view by<br/>
number of players once you&#39;ve created and levelled your characters is a<br/>
mystery to me. : )<br/>
<br/>
    Try and remember that there&#39;s nothing that they&#39;ve done is to be<br/>
intentionally harmful to the -pvp class, but given a choice the majority has<br/>
to rule, and that majority is -pvp. Their priorities concerning +pvp will<br/>
always come first. However, non combat spells you should be able to cast on<br/>
others. Bind Affinity, O&#39;Keils radiation, Invisibility, great spells, and<br/>
I&#39;m behind you 110% in that you should be able to use them on others. I&#39;m<br/>
sure they&#39;ll change it in the future, but how long depends on how hard it is<br/>
to code.<br/>

&gt;There you have it, even players say &quot;screw you, +PvP people.  You aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt;worthy of a good game experience.&quot;<br/>

&gt;&gt; Actually I don&#39;t believe it was done to make PVP players harder but to<br/>
&gt;protect<br/>
&gt;&gt; those who choose not to PVP.  I can understand why you say these things<br/>
&gt;&gt; make your lives harder tho.  However, I have to say that I support Verant<br/>
&gt;on this<br/>
&gt;&gt; one.. there are just too many jerks out there who give PVP a bad name<br/>
