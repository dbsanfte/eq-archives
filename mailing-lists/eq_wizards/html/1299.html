<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986758177"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Well said Jay. Parties cant be bothered with wizards, they<br/>
&gt; cant buff, cant heal<br/>
&gt; and cant really help parties that much...&quot;we were supposed<br/>
&gt; to be heavy<br/>
&gt; artillery&quot; but that just is not correct. I think a wizard<br/>
&gt; would be most parties<br/>
&gt; last choice if they could choose from all the classes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Let me just throw in the fact that this is not my experience.  A<br/>
wizard can be a great help to a party if it is organized well and if<br/>
the wizard has brains.<br/>
What do I mean by brains?  Well, some wizards immediately start<br/>
casting on a monster when the fight starts.  They do a good chunk of<br/>
damage so the monster runs for them.  From then on, the whole party<br/>
has to scramble to keep the wizard alive.<br/>
If played well, the wizard can make the difference between a tough<br/>
fight and an easy one.  Throw in spells to take out nice chunks of<br/>
hitpoints once in a while.  If things go wrong, blast away and do<br/>
300-400 damage in a few seconds, saving the party.  If the monster<br/>
runs, root it and finish it off, saving time.<br/>
A smart wizard can be a great asset to any party.  The key is, don&#39;t<br/>
put yourself in a position where everyone has to go out of their way<br/>
to save you.<br/>
