language, or parhaps a bit less (seems logical that you can not teach them<br/>
to speak better than you can). That&#39;s too bad, I&#39;d have loved raising my<br/>
Old Erudian just talking with someone who also only put 1 point in it :)<br/>

Do you get one new language every two levels to train with, or is this<br/>
random ? Or perhaps it depends on what critters you encounter ?<br/>
