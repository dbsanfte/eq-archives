<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020021978">Hello folks,glad i found this community, here is the rant i sent to eq<br/>
god GZ and his response (he responded today).<br/>
All Notes are are my thoughts only,they werent sent in my original<br/>
email.<br/>
<br/>
ME:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;1/Radiation shield:<br/>
&gt;Our radiation shield is the only combat related spell that we can cast<br/>
&gt;on others,and yet it is worthless past newby initiation.<br/>
&gt;I am lvl 34th now,i see other casters doing slightly less damage than<br/>
&gt;myself with slightly lower damage/mana ratio (magiciants come to mind) ,<br/>
&gt;when i was 24th it was the same with necros ect...even enchanters do<br/>
&gt;have very decent damage/mana ratio<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(Note: i wasnt entirelly correct on this one,i realized that only after<br/>
it was too late, but we do get cancel magic that is castable on others<br/>
and is a combat related spell.)<br/>
<br/>
GZ:<br/>
        Wizards should not actually get damage shields - this one was<br/>
kept<br/>
in because it was in our origional design doc, and people liked it. <br/>
Wizards<br/>
to have the best damage ratios, the quickest spell casting times and the<br/>
best variety of damage of any class in the game.<br/>
<br/>
ME:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Since these classes can do a whole lot more than just damage, isnt it<br/>
&gt;fitting for wizards to have a slight upgrade to our radiation shield? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(Note:GZ didnt answer me on that last one, my point was certain classes<br/>
do almost same damage as us (magiciant do almost same, think, its 7%<br/>
difference at my lvl) but they can do much more than dd,i was pressing<br/>
for anything extra &lt;grin&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ME:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2/Gates and evacuates:<br/>
&gt;Is there any difference at all between the mass gate and the evacs?? the<br/>
&gt;duration of the cast seem to be identical,is this a bug that will be<br/>
&gt;fixed?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>GZ:        Evac is quicker to cast.  It also has a chance of leaving<br/>
people<br/>
behind (about a 1% chance).<br/>
<br/>
ME:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Mass gates: Many wizards are very diasapointed with the locations of the<br/>
&gt;gates,i know i am. Why have 2 gates in the karanas 2 min from each<br/>
&gt;other?? why are all 3 other gates ro,neriak,and common so close to each<br/>
&gt;other while a vast expense of land is unreachable?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> GZ:       Teleportation cheapens the game - it makes it easy to get<br/>
around<br/>
(look at UO).  We wanted to keep our world big.  That is why so few<br/>
classes<br/>
get teleportation.<br/>
<br/>
(note: Druid locations are far superior to ours and much better located,<br/>
guess that is to compensate for the lack of the dimensional planes.also<br/>
and i am not sure if this is true but i hear druid mass gates sometimes<br/>
drop party in a random loc)<br/>
<br/>
ME:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Now understand we love mass gating, it is a lot of fun to have special<br/>
&gt;abilities that not many others enjoy, but there are large portion of the<br/>
&gt;norath world that far far from our gates,i wish our gates were more<br/>
&gt;strategically placed. Also i surelly hope you will not forget to include<br/>
&gt;a gate to all future continents.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> GZ:       Future continents will have gates for sure.  :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ME:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;3/Eye of Zomm: this is the most fun in my inventory i get a kick out of<br/>
&gt;using it everytime,but for the life of me i do not understand why it is<br/>
&gt;of such short duration.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> GZ:       It has a short duration to prevent players from mapping<br/>
dungeons<br/>
with no risk.<br/>
<br/>
(note: i am wondering if he realizes it only last like 15 seconds)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ME:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;4/bind sight: another great fun spell, its only problem is imo way way<br/>
&gt;too short range on pcs, i think it must be bugged that is the only<br/>
&gt;explaination i can come up with. if i binded sight on a player and the<br/>
&gt;player walks away just a short distance all i can see is a static<br/>
&gt;display.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> GZ:       Hmm - i will check that out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ME:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;5/Root: wile enchanter whirl seem to have been fixed in such a way as<br/>
&gt;not to break while the mob is taking -bash-damage, i could also point<br/>
&gt;out that root certainly seem to behave the way whirl used to prior to<br/>
&gt;patch.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;From my own experience root seem to last a lot longer if the mob is not<br/>
&gt;taking damage but would tend to break after nuking. If in fact this is<br/>
&gt;true,then doesnt root also need to be fixed in the same way that whirl<br/>
&gt;was? As far as i can see both spells have the same purpose more or less.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>GZ:        Root has a % chance of breaking when the creature takes<br/>
damage - the<br/>
same as we changed whirl to.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;6/Finally my rant would be that wizards arent set that far apart in<br/>
&gt;damage dealing nor in damage/mana efficiency then any of the other<br/>
&gt;casters save maybe shamans (i am only 34th though i havent seen yet what<br/>
&gt;is to come). Yet these other classes can do magical damage and much much<br/>
&gt;more. I must say at this point, only mass gating make me continue to<br/>
&gt;want to be a wizard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>GZ:       Try another class for a bit and see the difference in the<br/>
amount of<br/>
time that it takes you to deal out similar damage.  :)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Note: well GZ seem to think that because we cast the nukes slightly<br/>
faster that puts us way ahead of the pack, well he is entitled to his<br/>
opinion of course,mine is that the fact that i can cast spells 1 sec<br/>
faster than everyone else is totally worthless.The only advantage that i<br/>
can see is for soloing and i quit doing that long time ago. <br/>
<br/>
He also seem to think that wizard having -almost- same damage/mana<br/>
efficiency as magiciant is quiet ok as long as our damage is dealt<br/>
slightly faster. This really bugs me. i see no purpose whatsoever in<br/>
myself doing a mob 1000 damage in 4 shots vs a magiciant doing it in<br/>
5.With both of us having used the same mana spent. That is suppose to be<br/>
a big asset??<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, glad i took the whine of my chest, now at least i know he is<br/>
aware of some of our grivences.)<br/>
