<b>Subject:</b> Buying advice needed... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-234062595">If this question isn&#39;t appropriate for this list, let me apologize in<br/>
advance.... I don&#39;t see many questions like it....<br/>
Anyway,<br/>
I&#39;m a lvl 12 Gnome wizard, have cloth armor, worn great staff, Sr.<br/>
Apprentice Robe and pretty much all the spells that I want (that I can buy).<br/>
I&#39;ve got 25 plat or so in the bank and don&#39;t know what to spend it<br/>
on....invest in better armor? better staff? magic items? if so, what? don&#39;t<br/>
know what&#39;s smartest. Would very much appreciate any advice anyone can give<br/>
me that wish&#39;s they&#39;d bought or didn&#39;t buy at my level. Thanx for any help<br/>
you can give me.</div>
