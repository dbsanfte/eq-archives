<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368197811">I just logged on at lunch to kill a few Bandits and noticed that my<br/>
Specialize Evocation went to 103.<br/>
I do know that my Evocation is maxed at 125.<br/>
<br/>
I was under the impression that the Primary specialization would stop at 100<br/>
and the rest at 50.  My other Specialized abilities have not reached 50 yet<br/>
so I am interested to see what happens.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else notice this or am I just lucky?<br/>
