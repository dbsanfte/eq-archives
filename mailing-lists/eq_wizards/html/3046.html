<div id="ygrps-yiv-697971989">I am not one to complain about class abilities and levels, but found an<br/>
interesting piece<br/>
of information a few days ago.  I have a regular group where myself and a<br/>
magician in the<br/>
group both turned 34th level.  We immediately scribed our new spells and began to<br/>
<br/>
test them.  At 34th level, my direct damage shock spell does 306 (might have been<br/>
<br/>
307, but it was very close to this).  The magician&#39;s did 287.  Not much<br/>
difference, but<br/>
that is fine.  My second direct damage spell, which is research only and I have<br/>
heard is bugged and does not work, I did not have.  The magician had a 34th level<br/>
<br/>
bolt spell which did 326 points of damage.<br/>
<br/>
So basically at 34th level, a magician can do more direct damage than me (true it<br/>
is<br/>
a bolt spell, but not a large issue) and has a pet that double attacks for over<br/>
20 points<br/>
a hit.  Hmmm, really made me wonder.  I know at 39th level I will again surpass<br/>
the<br/>
magician damage, but still a little annoying.<br/>
<br/>
