<b>Subject:</b> Inn Key&#39;s & Backpack makeing <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372748490">In the Inn in Felewithe the inn keeper sells keys. I forget what they cost <br/>
but in addition to the purchase cost there is a 1 copper per month fee on <br/>
it. Does any one know what these keys are for? I bought one to try and when <br/>
I tried to sell it back the Inn Keeper told me &quot; I don&#39;t want your house <br/>
keys!&quot; <br/>
Also does anyone know what size sewing kit and what kind of pelt or hide <br/>
are required to make a backpack?<br/>
thanks for the help <br/>
