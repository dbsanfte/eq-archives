Actually, what I&#39;ve noticed is that all new spells fizzle, and get resisted<br/>
a lot. Haven&#39;t made 20th just yet, but this happened with 12th shock of<br/>
lightning, and 16th flame shock and lightning bolt. I think it&#39;s more of a<br/>
&#39;I just got a new spell, not how does it work&#39; thing. I was in Permafrost<br/>
with Azymodin a 21st high elf wizard, and he was casting force shocks left<br/>
right and centre with no resisted and lots of dead goblins.<br/>
<br/>
Which brings up another point. Has anyone ever noticed that once you hit<br/>
that last bubble before next experience your spells fizzle, don&#39;t do as much<br/>
damage, things break root all the time, annoying, but I&#39;d like to know if<br/>
it&#39;s just me or a general thing.<br/>
<br/>
Something else more in keeping with this mailing list.<br/>
<br/>
1. Where do I find runes? I haven&#39;t found any at all. I think I asked this<br/>
before but no one answered it. I&#39;m dying to start researching, but my old<br/>
erudin is below average only.<br/>
<br/>
2. How the heck do I make money ?<br/>
