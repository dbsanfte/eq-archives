<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154797931">Aue, I ave noticed this as well..I have it memorized to use that lst bit of<br/>
mana in an emergency..it seems to not be resisted(im in Unrest right now) as<br/>
much as anything else andis fast and mana efficient and is doing about 80<br/>
something per cast...combine that with Stun and Shockforce we take them down<br/>
nicely..<br/>
<br/>
Next time you are in a group try this combination..in order:<br/>
Stun<br/>
Root<br/>
Cast force<br/>
(pause to watch the bad guys health go down)<br/>
and by that time the critter is usually down for te count or close to it<br/>
then cast Burst of fire or Shock of Lightning to finish it off..I usualy<br/>
have about 70% mana left over using this technique<br/>
<br/>
Now lets talk about specialization<br/>
what do you people have in specialization that you are being resisted all<br/>
the time?<br/>
I have alteration as my primary and Evocation as my secondary..<br/>
I&#39;m in unrest and rarely do the Yellow creatures resist root and Direct<br/>
damage spells.<br/>
<br/>
As to the fact that noone likes wizards because of kill stealing..well..I<br/>
worked hard to get a name for myself as a good person to have in a group and<br/>
usually do not have a problem finding one..the minute I call out looking for<br/>
a group I usually get 3 or 4 tells and I get to have my pick..whats going on<br/>
where you are?  Perhaps you should Roleplay more? I roleplay all the time i<br/>
am on ;-)<br/>

&gt; I was messing around with some friends (whom are all casting classes and<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; as a wiz) tonight and discovered(from a tip) something very interesting...<br/>
&gt; At higher levels everyone&#39;s DD spells take a while to cast...  Our secret<br/>
&gt; weapon is our level 12 DD spell shock of lightning.  It is hardly ever<br/>
&gt; resisted, casts extremely fast AND interrupts casting.  You can chain cast<br/>
&gt; this sucker so much faster than other casting classes it&#39;s sick.  Unless<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; buddies went to their lower level spells, I would interrupt them every<br/>
time.<br/>
&gt; Hoping you others out there will share your tips as well.<br/>
