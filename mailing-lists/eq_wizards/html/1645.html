&gt;&gt; i hope you guys understand that just about all of the high level<br/>
&gt;wizards don&#39;t even HAVE weapons. i would much rather have 2 shimmering<br/>
&gt;orbs than a staff i barely hit with, but that&#39;s at high level, now i&#39;m<br/>
&gt;very much content with my newly bought Runed Totem staff.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yes this is true at high level.  Until then you must melee.  So my<br/>
&gt;question stands what weapon is best?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; oh and about the making money issue: sometimes your lucky. I was at<br/>
&gt;the dervish camp in Northern Ro on Fennin Ro and for some reason for<br/>
&gt;about 6 turns every derv that was on my turn had a BRONZE weapon! i<br/>
&gt;got 3 bronze rapiers! (3pp per rapier) i made 30pp in two hours !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am truely happy for you.  However, I went to NRO (with my bard I<br/>
&gt;will take Guile soon) and was squished twice fortunately exp loss is<br/>
&gt;inversely proportional to the creature level that kills you so other<br/>
&gt;than leaving an ugly mark there was no big problem with it.  On the<br/>
&gt;issue of luck, I have received 2 bronze weapons in all my time in NRO<br/>
&gt;and 1 or 2 gems.  How much time have I spent there you ask?  I have 5<br/>
&gt;thats FIVE backpacks in the bank filled with derv rings that I cannot<br/>
&gt;pay people to take FROM me!  So please don&#39;t tell me about LUCKY ways<br/>
&gt;to make money.  I need real advice on tried and true ways to earn<br/>
&gt;money to equip my character.<br/>
