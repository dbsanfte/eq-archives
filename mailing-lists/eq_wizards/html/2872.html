<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; While visiting Halas, I successfully researched the Levitate spell several <br/>
&gt; times and gave them to shaman friends of mine.  They were thrilled since that <br/>
&gt; spell is a Level 16 spell, I believe, for them, and costs a few plat at that <br/>
&gt; level.  I then turned around after finding out how expensive Root was for a <br/>
&gt; shaman to purchase (I think I was told 8 plat...don&#39;t really remember now) <br/>
&gt; and gated back to Felwithe and spent 4 gold and some odd coins each on 10 <br/>
&gt; root spells and handed them out to shamans who gave me sow :).  I NEVER have <br/>
&gt; to worry about being SoW&#39;d while in Halas or Permafrost now.  A little <br/>
&gt; kindness and thoughtfulness towards others can go a long way and many people <br/>
&gt; do NOT forget things like that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That surprise me.<br/>
Not the gratitude, the prices.<br/>
All spells that are common to various classes, are, so far, priced at the<br/>
*lowest* level they can be gained by someone. That is why I could purchase<br/>
the summon drink spell at my level 5 of shaman for 1g, while the rest of<br/>
the level 5 spells were a little over 5g each. Or getting invisibility<br/>
at a price much much lower than the level 16 for wizard it suggested.<br/>
