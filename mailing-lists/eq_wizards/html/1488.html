<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435009718">The light blue one with gold trim is the Observer robe.  EqVault had a group <br/>
shot of the guild &lt;fire of the heavens&gt; who made level 50.  There&#39;s a couple <br/>
mages there wearing those robes.  I met a wizard last night who was wearing <br/>
this and confirmed it with me.  Believe it or not, he was a level 1 Wiz.  <br/>
Apparently, he got it from his other character 46lvl Paladin.<br/>
<br/>
He says he got the robe off of a 30ish lvl (?) guard in the Ocean of Tears.  <br/>
Must be one of the islands there.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen the chainmail-looking one although I&#39;ve heard rumours on <br/>
this list that one exists?<br/>

&gt;Trim<br/>
<br/>
&gt;The other night I noticed a couple new robes that I hadnt seen before. The <br/>
&gt;first<br/>
&gt;was a Blue looking robe with fancy trim like the black robe has. Anyone <br/>
&gt;know<br/>
&gt;where to get that and the stats on it? Second I saw a char with a robe that<br/>
&gt;looked like it was chain mail. I am not sure if this char was a Wizard(was<br/>
&gt;playing anon and would not talk to me when I asked about the robe). Anyone <br/>
&gt;know<br/>
&gt;what that was and where it is found?<br/>
