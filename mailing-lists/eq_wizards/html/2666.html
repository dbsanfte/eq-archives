&gt; Pet gets experience ONLY if it is to give a killing blow if you time right<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;DD spell when a mob is hitting him?  Heh.  Heh Heh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Even though we run a lot, we don&#39;t split the xp with a pet.  I&#39;ve matched<br/>
&gt; &gt;other spell casting classes on xp earning rate hour after hour.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; same race same class casters all get same amount of experiencce, dark elf<br/>
&gt; wizard, magician, necro and enchanter get same amount of exp for killing<br/>
&gt; same monster if they are all grouped and same lv.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are correct, but that wasn&#39;t what I was arguing.  Pets do take xp.  Not<br/>
all the time, but some.  Rate depends on the level of the pet summoner and<br/>
the pet and the skill of the summoner in controling who gets the kill.  At<br/>
any rate, when they summon or charm a pet, the spell caster is not actually<br/>
soloing.  Therefore, they shouldn&#39;t run as often as wizards.  Just as you or<br/>
I don&#39;t run very often when we pair with another player.  And when they have<br/>
their pets, these spell casters really don&#39;t level faster.  I know, I&#39;ve<br/>
read the enchanter sites that talk about how to solo with a pet and I&#39;ve<br/>
watched magicians jumping in with that last DD spell to get the XP, but for<br/>
some reason, hour after hour, regardless of their tricks, I manage to match<br/>
them with XP gained (note: I&#39;m talking only about when we are both<br/>
ungrouped).  I tend, therefore, to be very skeptical of people who talk<br/>
about all of the advantages of having a pet.  Yes, it contributes to<br/>
differences in playing style and, heck, it may even help them earn xp<br/>
faster.  But we&#39;re not talking about huge amounts.  We&#39;re not even<br/>
approaching the differential we see with, say, druids (I met one a couple of<br/>
days ago at lvl 20 with less than 7 days playing time).<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, when a magician, enchanter, or necro decides to drop<br/>
their pet (either because of the xp, or because they have cross zones a lot,<br/>
or they are low on reagents, etc.) then they are not as effective as<br/>
wizards.  When it comes to pure soloing, we beat them hands down as we<br/>
should.  As for the pet stealing or not stealing xp bit, I assure you that I<br/>
used to pull to guards and let them be my pets.  We only have to get last<br/>
blow in then also, and with a little practice we can play that game too.<br/>
(Fun way to tackle yellow beetles in N Karans, btw, when one Guard comes out<br/>
of the tower.  Just have to learn to time that last shot.)<br/>
<br/>
On another topic entirely, we also beat other spell casters (usually) in DD<br/>
when it comes to grouping.  Many groups don&#39;t like pets for XP reasons, so<br/>
our ability to perform a bit more damage a bit quicker comes into play.  Are<br/>
these benefits actually useful?  IMO, yes.  Most of the time, it&#39;s not a big<br/>
deal, but wizards 1) provide great protection against kill stealers, and 2)<br/>
our ability to rain damage down faster than anyone is extremely appreciated<br/>
when a tank is low on health, about to die, and a mob is going agro on it.<br/>
I can&#39;t tell you the number of times that my ability to inflict 300+ points<br/>
of damage in 4 secs meant life or death to a party member.<br/>

&gt; efficent mana to damage spells ! ! !<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, you may be correct here.  I&#39;ve heard other classes complaining (I was<br/>
next to a lvl 24 enchanter yesterday who wouldn&#39;t shut up about it, for<br/>
instance), so I&#39;ve assumed that the problem is a general one.  However, I<br/>
haven&#39;t played the other spell caster classes to really make a fair<br/>
comparison (if in fact that is possible, with how much the engine gets<br/>
tweaked from one week to the next).  I will give you this:  Wizards are<br/>
extremely difficult at low levels.  We generally are shunned, have low<br/>
offensive skills and no defensive capabilities, etc.  I started a cleric<br/>
recently and couldn&#39;t believe the difference in how people treated me, and<br/>
how easy things were.  Things are a bit better for me now as a lvl 24<br/>
wizard.  I can almost always find a group, but it is sort of a grudging<br/>
acceptance thing--i.e. they know I&#39;m valuable but aren&#39;t in the habit of<br/>
admitting it (setting aside grouping with friends, of course).  It is a real<br/>
pleasure though to hear them say, &quot;pulling mob,&quot; and to give them my mana<br/>
report (of, say 30%) and to hear the rest of the group start shouting,<br/>
&quot;DON&#39;T PULL.&quot;  Hehe.  Finally, some respect.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt; 3.)     Resistance of high lvl mobs BUT also low lv ones<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Resistance of low level mobs is annoying, but something which I&#39;ve heard<br/>
&gt; &gt;other classes complain of as well.  In my case, it doesn&#39;t happen that<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;especially big problem.  The wizard just has to have an escape route<br/>
&gt; &gt;planned, or know how to get help.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Many times you pass by higly aggresive low lv mobs wich start a little<br/>
&gt; trains of jet lower lv mobs on you especialy thrue in dungeons and wizard<br/>
&gt; to get rid of this annoying and no exp no loot guys have to spent much if<br/>
&gt; not all its mana. PAE spells are not effective and fast enough to get off<br/>
&gt; without interupton and they use too much mana in any case. So your only<br/>
&gt; solution is to gate as gate probably will get off. Only other tactic is<br/>
&gt; root all move and kill with DD spells as you cannot use AE spells for not<br/>
&gt; risking to get all rooted bobs get a chance to break root. So it is very<br/>
&gt; dificult and anoying time dealing with green guys.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t had problems with this, personally, but then I&#39;ve stayed out of<br/>
doors mostly.  After I left GFaydark and Butcherblock (lvl 9ish), I went to<br/>
N. Karanas (to lvl 14ish), Oasis (17) then to High Hold Pass (18), then to<br/>
East Karanas (19), Lake Rathtear (23), and now S. Karanas (24).  And I&#39;ve<br/>
seen players lvl to 30 in S. Karanas, so I may stay awhile.  I did make<br/>
visits to Blackburrow, Paw, Crushbone and Befallen, but I usually didn&#39;t go<br/>
into them until most of the lower lvl mobs would leave me alone.  I agree<br/>
though that PAE spells are increadibly useless.  Here we have this,<br/>
supposed, last line of defense that has an increadibly high mana consumption<br/>
to damage ratio, long cast times and does little damage.  (And don&#39;t give me<br/>
#@%!@ about good damage ratio when you have 3 mobs on you.  Due to casting<br/>
times, you&#39;re lucky if you can ever get a PAE off twice.  You will never<br/>
kill dangerous mobs with them).  Great way to suicide, Verant.  But of<br/>
course, since I always try to dungeon crawl as the highest lvl player in my<br/>
group, in those cases I&#39;m not usually the one who gets jumped.  And that<br/>
changes everything, IMO.<br/>

I use shock of lightning as my low lvl spell.  The damage ratio isn&#39;t great,<br/>
but it&#39;s not bad.  I can get it off, sheez, 12 times in a fight, maybe???<br/>
Usually, if my group is training high level mobs that we can&#39;t kill by my<br/>
11th shot, we&#39;re all dead anyway.  Anything less than 3 reds, we can take,<br/>
usually.  Anything more and we should be running like girly girls anyway,<br/>
IMO.  If things get really bad, I&#39;ve always bound within zone next to border<br/>
and will gate there to med and wait for the retreating party.  Then I can<br/>
fire off 2 to 3 more shots and maybe turn the tide when they reach me, or<br/>
zone as required.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; spells you first are not any more a class wich can deal most damage in<br/>

&gt; enugh and you can only hit it for only as much damage as it heal alone in<br/>
&gt; that time then you ask yourself about why i cant use a high lv spell to<br/>
&gt; simply kill it right in place?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know that feeling.  Btw, I almost never root.  I let the rangers and such<br/>
use their low lvl snare.  Works much much better.  Mobs that are snared can<br/>
be successfully hit in the back, attacks don&#39;t disrupt snare (unlike root),<br/>
and the mobs never turn to fight.  I think you are correct though in asking<br/>
why not just use a high lvl spell to simply kill it.  I almost always do<br/>
exactly that.  I time my last (and usually second) blast of Shock of Frost<br/>
to coincide with the mob hitting about the 160 hp mark.  80-90% of the time,<br/>
it kills the beast.  If that fails, my group always has some redundent<br/>
strategy in action (such as the snare).  And sometimes it all fails and we<br/>
run screaming :)<br/>

that they are making changes to Lady Vox right now.  Unless you are lvl 40+<br/>
right now, I think you are worrying prematurely.  We really don&#39;t know what<br/>
fighting Vox is going to be like, for any of the classes.  Also I&#39;ve been<br/>
wondering if the 6 lvl magic casting limit gets pushed up at higher levels.<br/>
Can anyone answer this for certain?<br/>
