<div id="ygrps-yiv-616615225"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; From: &quot;Jan Sterken&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jsterken@...">jsterken@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can anyone help me with a language question?<br/>
&gt; I spent one training point on the languages Dwarven, Gnoll, and Erudian (sp)<br/>
&gt; when at the Academy of Sciences in Freeport but these languages do not show<br/>
&gt; up in my skills when training at other trainers, and they also are not<br/>
&gt; available as languages in my chat window. Anyone have any idea why? Also<br/>
&gt; assuming I figure out how this can be fixed how can I improve my skill in<br/>
&gt; these easiest.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am level 10. I spent 1 point in Old Erudin and 1 in Gnoll (the only two<br/>
new languages I have available at the moment). I only tried at my own<br/>
guild hall in Erudin, since I won&#39;t talk magic with those thieving humans.<br/>
Anyway, I DO have those languages available in my languages window, so I<br/>
don&#39;t think it&#39;s a matter of skill.<br/>
