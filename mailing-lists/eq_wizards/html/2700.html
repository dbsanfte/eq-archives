<div id="ygrps-yiv-115756789">I understand your pain.  Do not be so pesamistic (spelling wrong im<br/>
sure).  Enstill works well enough because when it holds....it hold for<br/>
a DAMN long time.  Do you remember way back when you first got root. <br/>
It did not work for a damn.  Now it works nicely on most white and blue<br/>
critters....some yellow and red as well.  Give Estill another level to<br/>
work better.  It does get better.  I agree the DD spell at level 24 was<br/>
rotten...although a bit better in way of mana consumption.  I am going<br/>
to make the Cast Force spell and Column of Lightning to try them out.<br/>

&gt; Hi all guys,<br/>
&gt; it seems that OR we are all on hollidays OR we know<br/>
&gt; all about wizzard :). I<br/>
&gt; don t receive more then 1 list all 2 days now :(<br/>
&gt; Come an guys, we need to wake up ! :)<br/>
&gt; On another point, i just read the new patch<br/>
&gt; message.. Damn.... From the<br/>
&gt; begining, nothing as been change for the wizzards...<br/>
&gt; They just change during<br/>
&gt; the patch , the casting time . I have tested BEFORE<br/>
&gt; and after : no change<br/>
&gt; (that a clock can see, so it s surely a change of<br/>
&gt; let s say 0,001 second or<br/>
&gt; something like that.In other words : nothing.<br/>
&gt; All patch just power up the race... Now the druid<br/>
&gt; dot spel are fast like<br/>
&gt; hell, necro same. And us ?? From the beginning, we<br/>
&gt; have major bug who are<br/>
&gt; not resolved and they do nothing for us...<br/>
&gt; Force shock is bugged cause he is resisted too much<br/>
&gt; (and i am ok that he get<br/>
&gt; resisted so much IF he stun like he must do). The<br/>
&gt; enstill spel doesn&#39;t work<br/>
&gt; (i have tested with root : root is 10 times more<br/>
&gt; effective). I am a playing<br/>
&gt; a shaman and i think i will stop my wizzard... We<br/>
&gt; have nothing funny : we<br/>
&gt; just level and wait for what ? Our dd spel nothing<br/>
&gt; more, no buf, no pet, no<br/>
&gt; life tap, no shield,no dot, no sow, nothing cool<br/>
&gt; except some gate spel...<br/>
&gt; That s so boring.. For solo from level 8 to 50 you<br/>
&gt; root nuke nuke root nuke<br/>
&gt; nuke dead... Wow that s pretty funny :( :( :(.<br/>
&gt; What about our ae spel ? and pe spel ?? Did someone<br/>
&gt; here use them ????<br/>
&gt; NOBODY...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So guys, we were talking some weeks ago to<br/>
&gt; petition.. Nothing has be done or<br/>
&gt; you just don t send the letter ???<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; See you on karana<br/>
&gt; yakos level 25 wizzard AND dabou level 13 shaman<br/>
&gt; (playtime for wizzard : 20 days, for shaman , 2<br/>
&gt; days....)<br/>
