<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-487480767">Good tips everyone!  I tried using Tishan&#39;s Clash as recommended by some of <br/>
the posts here and I must say that it DOES work pretty well in a group <br/>
situation.  It&#39;s a nice spell to start a fight off with as it&#39;s small enough <br/>
damage as not to attract attention from the MoB, yet it gives enough stun <br/>
time for the tanks to do their work.  I&#39;ve noticed that it&#39;s pretty safe <br/>
casting my big spell right after recovery from casting TC....I have yet to <br/>
test all the situations.  I&#39;ve alternated TC & nuke spells on the MoBs to <br/>
good results.<br/>
<br/>
Nice to know this Wizard list is actually providing good information again!  <br/>
:)<br/>
