<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446696227">Just in case this hasnt been answered yet, all you do is spend alot of<br/>
time listening to someone (anyone) speak that language.  It doesnt<br/>
matter what they say, they could repeat the same line over and over and<br/>
you would still increase you skill in that language.<br/>
<br/>
But realize it does take time.<br/>
