<b>Subject:</b> runed totem? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-987889676">I purchased a runed totem staff from somebody last night for 20pp.  I <br/>
was disappointed to find it was not the BIG staff I see some mages <br/>
carry around.  It looked no different from the cracked great staff <br/>
or fine steel great staff I was using.  The one I&#39;m looking for has <br/>
the crooked knot on top?  Anybody know what that staff is?<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, the runed totem staff is great and I think I got a <br/>
fairly good deal.  But I&#39;ve been jealously looking at other cool mages <br/>
with this big staff in their hands.  I&#39;ve got a list of creatures I&#39;d <br/>
love to give a good WHACK on the backside to with this staff. :)<br/>
<br/>
Good day,<br/>
