&gt; money and still have spells to buy, I would not ask for or accept any sort<br/>
&gt; of payment for using my talents.  Does anyone else agree with me or do you<br/>
&gt; all think that you SHOULD rightfully earn a profit from using your skills?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>   Binds, etc., charging is probably not worthwhile. However, if you<br/>
charge to do it and people are paying, who cares? For things like the<br/>
languages he is offering... that is something that takes time to do. It<br/>
isn&#39;t a one shot thing like binding someone. In return, he asks that you<br/>
pay in runes which _also_ take time to acrue. It seems quite a fair trade.<br/>
Obviously, he took the time to learn the languages, and if the cost in<br/>
runes is too high you can always learn them on your own as well. :)<br/>
