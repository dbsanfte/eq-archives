<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279663316"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Does anyone know about the faction hit involved in killing the oracle to<br/>
&gt; get the robe?  Which faction gets lowered by killing him and his paladin<br/>
&gt; guardian?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of the sites I visited.. I think it was Everlore said the faction hit is with high <br/>
elves.  I searched everywhere and that&#39;s all I was able to find.  Let me know if <br/>
you find out more.<br/>
