There is no question they tweak some aspects of the game that aren&#39;t<br/>
documented.  <br/>
Only recently, after complaints from players, have they begun to give us<br/>
more feedback on changes... but I still don&#39;t think they tell us everything<br/>
they change.  Have they notified us of many changes that reigned in a class?<br/>
I can&#39;t recall one.  Everything they&#39;ve told us &#39;improves&#39; a classes<br/>
ability, not diminishes.  Do you think they aren&#39;t making changes to a class<br/>
that might &#39;negatively&#39; affect them?  I&#39;m sure they are if they think there<br/>
is an imbalance.<br/>

Do you think Verant would do anything like that without letting us know?<br/>
That<br/>
would be despicable.<br/>
