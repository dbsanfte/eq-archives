<br/>
Regarding the Murderous merchant of Ak&#39;Anon:<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;Anyways, I saw 2 elves die, there is a Elf KoSer merchant at the VERY<br/>
FRONT of Ak&#39;Anon, there is no way around it, right &lt;&lt;when U enter the city<br/>
part(after the zone by about 4 steps) you hit a wall, this merchant is right<br/>
by the wall, the only way I see to &lt;&lt;get in Ak&#39;Anon around this crazy<br/>
merchant is to: <br/>
&lt;&lt;1) Have Someone get it for you that is not an ELF(High Elf or Wood Elf,<br/>
not sure about Half-Elves, but I dont believe thise affects &lt;&lt;them) <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;   A wood elf friend of mine was recently KOS immediatly upon entering<br/>
Akanon by a Merchant. He wasnt able to get the name &lt;&lt; of this npc though.<br/>
Does anyone know the name of this npc so I can steer clear of him. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
The merchant is a clockwork merchant--it doesn&#39;t have a personal name.  It<br/>
stands just inside the zone entrance of Ak&#39;Anon, usually very near, if not<br/>
right on top of, a clockwork jeweler.  <br/>
 <br/>
It is true that the murderous merchant does NOT like elves at all, but race<br/>
is not how it decides who to kill.  It is a question of deity.  I have<br/>
observed the clockwork killing people, and it yells something about &quot;pagan<br/>
religion&quot; when it strikes.  It will attack any character (elf or not) who<br/>
has chosen TUNARE as deity.  This includes ALL High elf clerics and<br/>
paladins, since Tunare is their only deity choice.  The same is true of Wood<br/>
elf Druids or Rangers, since they, too, have only Tunare to choose from as<br/>
deity.  Other races and classes either cannot choose Tunare at all (like the<br/>
Gnomes) or have other choices available to them.  <br/>
 <br/>
So, the upshot is, if you chose Tunare as deity, you will be attacked the<br/>
instant you enter Ak&#39;Anon.  You can try running away into the city, but I<br/>
have never witnessed anyone successful at that.  Also, I have once observed<br/>
this merchant running into a wall farther into the city, but that was only<br/>
one time.  Every other time I have been into Ak&#39;Anon, it has been right<br/>
there at the entrance.</div>
