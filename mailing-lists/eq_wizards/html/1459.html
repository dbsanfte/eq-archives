<div id="ygrps-yiv-379644772">Hello all, I`ve just started a new wizard, after decided that my old <br/>
character wasnt fulfilling enough for me...I am a DarkElf on the E`Ci server, <br/>
at level 3 right now....any advice for me through the ranks?  Not just for <br/>
the low levels, but also for higher levels regarding wizards....Any <br/>
strategies youve learned to be useful?  Any particular targets for particular <br/>
levels?  Tips and Tricks?  Thanks in advance for any help you can give!<br/>
