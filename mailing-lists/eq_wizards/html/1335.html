<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064243496">I have no way of confirming this, so take it with a grain of salt.  Since the<br/>
majority of Verant designers are old-time MUD / D&D players, my guess would be<br/>
that when you cast root the creature gets a savings throw.  If the mob makes<br/>
the throw the spell is resisted and if not he&#39;s rooted.  Every round after<br/>
that, the creature gets another throw until he&#39;s dead or free to move.  My<br/>
guess is that Enstill just has a higher savings throw than root.  My only proof<br/>
of the &quot;savings throw&quot; idea is that I&#39;ve had root resisted by /con greens, I&#39;ve<br/>
successfully rooted reds, and one time I managed to root a yellow long enough<br/>
to unload my mana on him, run to the guard,  and meditate for one or two<br/>
bubbles before the guard killed him.  That root lasted a good minute or two.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Dear Cristie<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Therefore Root and Enstill are the same spell? Root stops your feet moving<br/>
&gt; &gt;while Enstill stops your whole body moving?<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; Root means the NPC you cast it on doesn&#39;t move... of course if it doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; resist the spell..which happens.  You get this at level 4.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Enstill means a stronger version of Root, it looks like.  Same<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; definition.  You get this one at level 20.  I would venture to guess the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; NPC&#39;s can still resist it if they are able to.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; You can always try to cast when you are getting bashed...sometimes you<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; pop your spells off and other times you are interrupted and lose<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; concentration and sometimes you get bashed and regain concentration and<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; continue casting.  Try to shoot your spells off while the NPC isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; smacking you.. a lot of it is in your timing, unless you have a bunch of<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; monsters on you.<br/>
