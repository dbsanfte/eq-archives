<b>Subject:</b> Looking for spoiler info on Sulgar! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-272907233">(I&#39;m going to try to leave out details here so as to not give out<br/>
spoiler info if people dont want to see)  To any /all who have tried the<br/>
ice comet quest - I tried to speak with the person you are supposed to<br/>
to start this, and get the brush off.  Seems my faction with him is not<br/>
high enough.  Unfortuntaly, his race is other than you would expect for<br/>
his location, so I&#39;m not even sure what faction I need to raise.  Before<br/>
I go killing hundreds of newbie creatures, could anyone out there let me<br/>
know what I should work on (faction-wise) to make him at least speak to<br/>
me?  Thanks in advance.<br/>
