<div id="ygrps-yiv-380731490">Actually I did find an item there.  I think I found a page for the<br/>
Enchanter research.  At the time I was only level 7.  So I am still hanging<br/>
onto it, since my enchanter is still only level 2. :)  Yeah some day.....<br/>
Level 50 wiz, level 50 necro, level 50 enchanter, level 50 magician.<br/>
<br/>
Ok ok so I play on playing EQ for the rest of my life.  Or at least untill<br/>
something better comes along.<br/>
<br/>
My point is that they are out there.  I had a friend find a rune on a<br/>
crocidile in oasis and one on a Orc in high hold.  So as far as I can tell<br/>
they are probably rare finds on the low level creatures.  As we get to<br/>
higher level sutff  they are probably more common.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve killed many warriors there and haven&#39;t gotten any runes.. i&#39;m lvl 16<br/>
&gt;and they&#39;re much lower, do you know if creatures have to be of a close lvl<br/>
&gt;to give runes or doesn&#39;t it matter?<br/>
