 </span></blockquote>Well, for player made stuff the IT items are<br/>
ring,necklace,necklace,ring(silver, electrum, gold, plat) and the plat is<br/>
really expensive...if it&#39;s any good to you i&#39;m lvl 21 and i&#39;m going to be<br/>
getting a set of silver +2 int rings to replace my silver mana rings (at<br/>
~20 the extra mana from the added int is greater than what the mana rings<br/>
give you)<br/>
 <br/>
If i were you i&#39;d see about getting a pair of silver INT rings and a<br/>
electrum INT necklace...<br/>
<br/>
oh, and check out www.graffe.com for a good listing of helpful wizard<br/>
items..(it&#39;s also probibly the best wizard site out there...thoguh<br/>
eq.castersrealm.com is also good)<br/>

&gt; mentioned, the amulet, and a blackened wand (15 magic resistance)  <br/>
&gt; and given out gifts of pelts and various items I came across. But you<br/>
&gt; dont get a lot of cash this way.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, i do that too...though it does come back to you eventually...i just<br/>
recently benafitted from the same thing on a higher level...got a shear<br/>
bone mask (+3 int and a decent ac) from a really nice really high level<br/>
enchanter...<br/>

ask..true you dont&#39; make much from it, but sometimes you get lucky...and<br/>
sometimes you make a friend..believe it or not a lot of folks will rember<br/>
little things like binding them for free...reputation does mean something,<br/>
especially when you get to higher levels..<br/>

 </span></blockquote>not counting the player made jewlery i&#39;d say in your 20&#39; up...<br/>
at least that&#39;s the point where you start to really be able to kill stuff<br/>
that drops decent magical items...you&#39;ll probibly start making enough coin<br/>
to buy magical stuff from the mid teens on..oh, and a suggestion, get a<br/>
dragoon dir instead of a runed totem staff...while you don&#39;t melee much<br/>
at higher levels, your better off having your decent melee skill being<br/>
somthing one handed(piercing would be my choice if i had it to do<br/>
again...)<br/>
