<div id="ygrps-yiv-1356809852">Sorry guys for the misinformation about combat skill caps. I was not aware that a wizards and a fighting class skill caps where different in combat. I was going on comformation of that formula from playing a wizard, monk, and rogue. Oh well thats how we learn. Sorry again.</div>
