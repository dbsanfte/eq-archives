<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887466798">I have never charged for binding services or casting invis on someone.  I<br/>
will accept donations if they wish to give them, but I never require a<br/>
payment.  However, languages are a whole new ballgame.  It takes a lot of<br/>
time and effort to learn these languages, especially Dragon and Combine.  I<br/>
see nothing wrong with expecting some compensation for your time and effort<br/>
in teaching someone a language.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that not eveyone feels the same way I do.  I have no problem<br/>
with that and I wish them well.  But to me, it makes no sense NOT to charge<br/>
someone for something that has taken a lot of time and effort to achieve.<br/>
