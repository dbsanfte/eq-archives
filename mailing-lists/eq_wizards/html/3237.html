<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990719955">Just turned 29 and was so looking forward to using Bonds of Force spell<br/>
to &quot;kite&quot; mobs (well, blast and run anyway), but I am getting a lot of<br/>
resists with blue griffenes,and when it is not resisted it only seems to<br/>
hold few seconds, unlike druids or rangers low level snare spell which<br/>
lasts a long time.  Can anyone else with more experience with this spell<br/>
give any advice? Thanks.<br/>
