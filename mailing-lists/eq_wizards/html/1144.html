<div id="ygrps-yiv-1124721594">This is the exact reason I have been working on both 2h blunt and<br/>
piercing.  My luck, I would have gotten to level 44, and found that<br/>
there is this cheaty combo of a dagger and some off hand weapon, and I<br/>
wouldnt have any piercing skill.  I recommend to everyone to work up two<br/>
skills!!<br/>
