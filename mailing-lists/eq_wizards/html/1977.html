Wizard look stupid in those robes anyway, so at least let us have a cool<br/>
skull in our hand to impress our big weapon, shiny armor wielding<br/>
friends. It&#39;s not like there aren&#39;t any skulls in the game. I mean,<br/>
there are dozens of different undead skeleton types. But still we are<br/>
screwed over. When I hold the skull now, it looks like I have a lump on<br/>
my wrist. They just use the usual bag placeholder object, but a little<br/>
enlarged.<br/>
<br/>
This is downright embarrassing, folks. It looks like all the non magical<br/>
classes got all the cool toys, and we are left to the dogs.<br/>
<br/>
Also, ask them to implement more varied spell animation. It&#39;s laughable<br/>
when both lighting bolt and fire bolt look the same. And Shock of<br/>
lightning looks red. Come on, it&#39;s really hard to get in to the game<br/>
with such lame repeating effects.<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t overlook this, because if looks really didn&#39;t matter, why<br/>
are we playing a 3D MUD, when we could play a regular one?<br/>
