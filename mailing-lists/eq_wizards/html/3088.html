<div id="ygrps-yiv-1259180617">Hey, I remember somebody posting a couple days ago about our lack of melee <br/>
ability.  I agree more often than not, we have to turn tail to run to the <br/>
zone.  I&#39;ve always thought it would be cool to have that spell those <br/>
Tentacle Terrors have in Najena...you know, the ones that knock you back ten <br/>
billion feet. :)   It wouldn&#39;t even need to give damage...but if it was able <br/>
to knock a whole mob of creatures away from your body for a few secs...that <br/>
would aid a whole lot in terms of survivability.  Would make a good escape <br/>
combo with Shadow step.<br/>
