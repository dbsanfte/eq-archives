times by jerks *mutters millificents name* well there was antoher power <br/>

loved to run in right when we were fighting the kobold champion with 5 other <br/>
greater kobs (level 40 mob and champ is like 45) when we were level 40 or so <br/>
and sk then  train more on us....we needed lotsa casters the best combo is <br/>
the 4 different casters together we would make a group like that and we would <br/>
be in charge wed get the enchanter to take like 5 things out with his <br/>
memorize spells then wed just blast verything (it was great we get mad xp)and <br/>
