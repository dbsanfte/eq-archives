<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717602199">Heh heh heh... Your local herbage store should know where it is. Ask any<br/>
enchanter where they&#39;re gettine their malachite for their pets. That vendor<br/>
will most likely have bounteous quantities of the stuff. I got a huge wad of<br/>
them in the school of magic in Freeport. Any vendor that has gems should<br/>
have this item as well.<br/>
