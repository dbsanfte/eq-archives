<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869275132">Bah! As I read your post I can&#39;t help but crack up in laughter.  I can&#39;t <br/>
believe how this bothers you SO much!  Do you realize this is only a game?  <br/>
Play your druid and be happy.  Granted, my druid and wizard are not 50 yet <br/>
so I can&#39;t confirm your remarks....you might be right, but I&#39;ll stick to <br/>
what I enjoy and play my little wizzie.  I thank God I don&#39;t work at Verant <br/>
where I actually have to read and take responses like yours seriously.<br/>
