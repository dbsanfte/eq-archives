<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880637596"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; Could I elicit opinions as to what is the next best spell<br/>
&gt; to get after<br/>
&gt; &gt; Shock of Lightning and Bind Affinity? Thanks for any advice.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The three I have apart from these are (in order of usefulness)<br/>
<br/>
1. Lesser Shielding.  As a Wizard you will want to buy any shielding<br/>
spells you can get your hands on.<br/>
2. Halo Of Light.  Creates a headband which has AC 3 and gives better<br/>
light than a Greater Lightstone.<br/>
3. Resistant skin.  Improves resistance vs. poison and disease.  Only<br/>
use it when you&#39;re fighting creatures that can poison or disease you,<br/>
of course, but very useful then.<br/>
