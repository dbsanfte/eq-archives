<div id="ygrps-yiv-189977921">All I can say is yep yep... I&#39;m also a level 10 enchanter and if that mob is<br/>
yellow or red there is about a 1 in 7 chance that it is fully resisted on<br/>
both my enfeeble spell and my mez(until I Tashan the creature, after which<br/>
it is about 1 in 10).  I do have a incredible ability to control the flow of<br/>
battle as long as I have a group that is willing to take a few hits from a<br/>
monster until I can target the monster and unleash a mez.  If they don&#39;t<br/>
wait and attack any way my mez has no effect because after the creature<br/>
takes damage it reactivates...(DOT&#39;s break the mez too... figured that out<br/>
last night with a shaman that poisoned one before I started trying to mez<br/>
it)  so far I can say this... It comes down to whether I want to draw out<br/>
the combat or cut it off quickly.  The wizard can end a combat in 7 seconds<br/>
of spell casting... the enchanter can draw out the battle but make it much<br/>
safer.  Both have advantages and minuses, but here is my sticking point:<br/>
<br/>
Wizards are penalized at early levels (1-28) because they are suppose to be<br/>
so good above that.  However, I feel, enchanters AND ALL classes balance out<br/>
at the upper levels.  (Is this due to incredible amounts of whining about<br/>
how much more powerful x is than y?  YES)  Therefore, Wizards are just a<br/>
valuable as any other class above 28, but we pay a penalty of being not so<br/>
valuable at a lower level.  Is this fair?  NO.  Is this life?  yes...<br/>
sadly...  Will GZ ever see the error of his way&#39;s?  I doubt it.<br/>

&gt; &gt;  Also talking to the enchanter<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mesmerize and MemBlur has never been resisted, He even used it on a Hill<br/>
&gt; &gt; Giant when he was 20th just to check.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thats a crock.  It gets resisted all the time.  One of an Enchanters<br/>
biggest<br/>
&gt; drawbacks is their resistability.  Imagine, every single spell is magic<br/>
based, and<br/>
&gt; is therefore about as reliable as root.  Of course, they get tashen(i) to<br/>
make up<br/>
&gt; for this, but that spell benifits all in a group, not just the Enchanters.<br/>
On a<br/>
&gt; side note, Tashen(i) does not have a savings throw, and will not be<br/>
resisted by<br/>
&gt; either Resistance or level limitations.  Perhaps this was the spell he<br/>
used on th<br/>
&gt; HG.  Other enchanters spells are capped the same as a wizards.<br/>
