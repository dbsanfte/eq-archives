<br/>
There are a few sets of armor that wizards can wear, bear hide is one of<br/>
them. This is armor that is about like leather but can be worn by all<br/>
classes. Unfortunately you have to quest to get any pieces other than belt<br/>
and boots but if you happen to the Qeynos area look for Chanda Miller and<br/>
she will tell you what to do.<br/>
