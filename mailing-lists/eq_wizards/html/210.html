<b>Subject:</b> 836pts of damage in under 10 secs from a 14th wizard <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892883640">PCs can&#39;t interrupt monster spells. Well, not that I&#39;ve ever seen. If<br/>
someone can refute this, then let me know. So I&#39;m not sure if your ROOT<br/>
example is really a good one.<br/>
<br/>
Now, while on the subject of killing things, I thought of something that I&#39;d<br/>
like to try.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to form a 6 player all wizard party. I&#39;m on the Solusek Ro server,<br/>
14th Wizard, would like to have about the same level.<br/>
<br/>
Verant, and everyone is always saying that you need to mix classes to level<br/>
and go up the fastest. Here&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Form group.<br/>
Everyone target same large honking creature.<br/>
One person shouts &quot; NUKE! &quot;<br/>
Everyone clicks on shock of lightning<br/>
BLAM<br/>
456 pts of dmg.<br/>
1 Shot.<br/>
1 Kill<br/>
Thank you for shopping at Wizzie mart.<br/>
<br/>
Even if it&#39;s still alive and not running away, next volley should be for an<br/>
additional 380pts<br/>
<br/>
(assuming that 1 person is attacked and spell is interrupted).<br/>
<br/>
End result after 2 rnds: 836 pts of damage in I figure about less than 10<br/>
seconds. A Hill giant takes longer than that to kill me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;l stand in front of ANYTHING for 10 seconds. With bind abilities, the<br/>
entire group is pretty safe for escaping, you don&#39;t have to go far if you DO<br/>
die, which is highly unlikely.<br/>
<br/>
How fast do you think this kind of group is gonna level taking out things<br/>
like griffawns, griffons, etc...<br/>
<br/>
Only problem I can see is some things have a big magic resistance. I was<br/>
with a 15th barbarian in North Karanas, and we were feeling brawny. He<br/>
wailed on a Scythe beetle and brought it back to me and another 13th wizard.<br/>
My shock of lightning was only doing 30-35 pts of dmg. The 13th wizard did<br/>
0, nil, zip, zero pts. of dmg.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone wanna try out my idea, and you&#39;re on Solusek Ro let me know.<br/>
<br/>
