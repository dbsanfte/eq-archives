    I&#39;ve seen alot of discussion lately about how to stop a spell once<br/>
you&#39;ve started casting.  There is a sure-fire method that NEVER (at least<br/>
for me it hasn&#39;t, and I&#39;ve been using it for the last 10 levels) fails that<br/>
a friend of mine discovered.  Takes a little while to get used to it (muscle<br/>
memory, and all that) AND you don&#39;t have to move a step.  Not moving around<br/>
comes in handy when your fighting next to lava and/or near a place where<br/>
moving a little bit forward could aggro more mobs.  What&#39;s the secret you<br/>
ask?  DUCK!!!!  Works every time without fail.  Seems &quot;You must be standing<br/>
to cast a spell&quot;.  Try it, it works.  Yes, yes, I know, I rule.<br/>
