<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031741425">SWEET!! Thanks!! dang!  I didn&#39;t even thing it would be in the Gnome City, I<br/>
was in there last night casting BIND on some little guy.   Guess I am just<br/>
foolish for not going to the wiz guild there.<br/>
<br/>
Is is easy to find the wizard&#39;s guild in that city I never really explored<br/>
it . . .</div>
