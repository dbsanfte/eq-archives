<div id="ygrps-yiv-1817605255">ok.... i&#39;ll give up my secret. I spent a day at Verant. I met the guy who<br/>
made ALL the spells in the game. His EQ name is Geoffrey the ArchMagi. he<br/>
has a staff with a skull on it and i asked him if that was a RTS with a<br/>
skull attached he laughed his ass off (i&#39;m not making any of this up i<br/>
promise... you don&#39;t have to believe me, i know it&#39;s true and that&#39;s all<br/>
that counts) he entered EQ and showed me what it was. The Geoffrey Staff!<br/>
designed by the same guy that gave Aradune his green armor! it&#39;s just for<br/>
him! and the priest of discord&#39;s staff is called the Staff of Discord. I<br/>
imagine you get it when you kill him and it probably gives some cool bonus<br/>
like making you PK when you equip in and regular when you unequip it. that&#39;s<br/>
it<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s a rumor.<br/>
<br/>
PS: that was the best day i ever spent anywhere it was really fun and if any<br/>
of you live in San Diego you should really email someone and ask if you can<br/>
visit for a day. it was a great experience for me<br/>

&gt;Ruined Totem Staff...and what NPC combines them for you?<br/>
