&gt; &gt;You should be going for the staff of the wheel. I already got that &gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt;the acumen mask and the runescale cloak. I&#39;m now trying to get the<br/>
&gt; &gt;temperate flux staff, but it&#39;s not easy since Sol A and Permafrost &gt;are<br/>
&gt; &gt;completely horrible dungeons (ever wonder why they are virtually<br/>
&gt; &gt;empty?).<br/>

&gt; Hey I salute you Sergey. hehe.  You&#39;re pretty good at the quests...tell me<br/>
&gt; you didn&#39;t solo all of them?  :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I soloed all of the staff of the wheel except lower guk where after 3<br/>
deaths, a high level cleric helped me get it but ended up dead himself.<br/>
All in all I died 4 times doing this quest, the fourth being in oasis.<br/>
<br/>
Acumen mask I did with the help of a high level wizard, but there was<br/>
nothing there I couldn&#39;t <br/>
have done with another someone of my level. Ditto for the cloak.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m one rune away from the Runescale<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Cloak, I&#39;ve been camping crocs in Guk but haven&#39;t found one yet.  The staff<br/>
&gt; of wheel rod stories kinda scare me so I might wait till I can find a group<br/>
&gt; to do that one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You won&#39;t. Not for all of them. The only ones who would help you are<br/>
real high levels who know lower guk and who can pull the deepwater gobs<br/>
out of the way in oasis while you get the rod. All the other rods are<br/>
easy. A group of your level would only end up dead. At best, someone<br/>
will die and you will get away with the rod.<br/>
<br/>
In any case - good luck! questing is much more fun than just camping for<br/>
exp/items.<br/>
