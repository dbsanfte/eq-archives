<b>Subject:</b> frustration getting xp? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1694716994">Come on people, let&#39;s not get into a &quot;wizard&#39;s suck&quot; thing again.  I&#39;ve been <br/>
reading this kind of thread since the first digest here.  Yes, the Wizards <br/>
can use a little bit of tweaking here and there, but as a whole I cannot <br/>
think of another class I would rather be.  Yes it&#39;s slow, and yes, it can be <br/>
frustrating at times....but where&#39;s your sense of challenge?<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t offer help to you if you go solo.  I&#39;ve found it most slow and <br/>
frustrating when I tried solo back when I was younger.  Not to mention <br/>
staring at your book during meditations can get old if you have nobody to <br/>
talk to. :)<br/>
<br/>
If you can find good allies, you can hit all of the good xp spots around <br/>
Norrath.  Unrest, Northern Ro, Oasis, Highhold Pass, Crushbone, BlackBurrow, <br/>
Befallen, etc.   All of these spots are great xp...granted NOT good solo <br/>
areas.  If one area is not working for you...try another.  No sense beating <br/>
a dead dog.  It&#39;s funny how it works...but once you get a group that trusts <br/>
you, you can get all the xp and money your heart desires.  I got 50pp+ and 1 <br/>
bub of xp just playing a little over an hour of play at Highhold last night. <br/>
  The 50pp came from my group members sharing me their wealth no strings <br/>
attached.  This is not a bunch of folks I knew either...just folks who <br/>
appreciated the help.  So please don&#39;t keep up this whining...if you want to <br/>
change things about the class, offer *positive* suggestions instead.<br/>
<br/>
Basic things I&#39;ve learned in the many groups I&#39;ve been with:<br/>
-- don&#39;t use area effects...use assist and DD<br/>
-- know your limits...run if you have to and let your tanks know you are <br/>
running.  You are no help to the group if you die...then they have to wait <br/>
for you to recover your corpse too.<br/>
-- be honorable...it does no good to our class to start kill stealing.  A <br/>
pox on all you Wizards who hide behind the efforts of others for personal <br/>
gain.<br/>
-- if your new spells are not reliable...use the old ones.  They will be <br/>
more efficient for you anyway until you&#39;ve comfortably leveled enough to use <br/>
the new ones.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t make these suggestions to sway all your opinions about the class if <br/>
you are negative about it anyway.  I offer these tips to younger Wizards <br/>
looking ahead to the future.<br/>
<br/>
Safe journey,<br/>
