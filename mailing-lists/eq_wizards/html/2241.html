<b>Subject:</b> which spellcasting class to be? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945376655">To his defense, I am level 20 now and also disillusioned with the wizard<br/>
class. I stubbornly keep my Force Shock memorized *just in case* even<br/>
though it is resisted most of the time. I have hunted in unrest ( which<br/>
often has 80 people and feels crowded at 40 people ) with people around<br/>
or below my level and it is very slow. I have yet to go to Lake Rathe<br/>
although I hear it is getting crowded now too.<br/>
<br/>
Either way, if I were to start over, I would have created a Druid or<br/>
Shaman. Of course hindsight is 20/20 but I&#39;ve invested over 6 realtime<br/>
days into my wizard and am too stubborn to give up on him. The spells of<br/>
the wizard are very limited. Sure we can do the most damage in the<br/>
shortest amount of time, but it&#39;s not THAT much more. But other than<br/>
that, we can teleport like the druid, and that&#39;s all!<br/>
<br/>
So I guess, if you like to BLAST, MED, BLAST, MED, BLAST, MED then<br/>
wizard is for you. If you like to enchant stuff, summon pets, mess with<br/>
monsters minds, mess with NPC&#39;s minds, buff your party members,<br/>
transform into cool creatures, speed up mana regen, AND blast with a<br/>
little less damage than wizard then be an ENCHANTER!<br/>
<br/>
Heres hoping that the patch adds some unique/interesting stuff to our<br/>
class :P Did anyone play a wizard in the beta? Did they always have<br/>
teleport stuff? just curious...<br/>

&gt; &gt; Let me explain - Verant hasn&#39;t implemented specialization skills or the<br/>
&gt; &gt; alternate planes,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yet.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; we have almost nothing for armor or hitpoints,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Are you saying there is something wrong with this, or that Enchanters<br/>
&gt; have more?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; our melee<br/>
&gt; &gt; skills are pathetic<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ditto.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; and our powers don&#39;t become greater than other classes<br/>
&gt; &gt; until 40-somethingth level.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Incorrect. Wizard&#39;s DD spells are the best at any given level.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Plus, the single greatest way of leveling up -<br/>
&gt; &gt; killing har red mobs - is unavailable to us, because our spells are often<br/>
&gt; &gt; resisted completely by these creatures. So, instead of grouping with<br/>
&gt; &gt; powerful warriors to beat up on mobs that will actually give EVERYONE in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; group decent experience, we&#39;re relegated to trying to solo weak blues or<br/>
&gt; &gt; fight white and yellow creatures in a group for pitiful experience because<br/>
&gt; &gt; WE CAN&#39;T TOUCH HARD MOBS LIKE EVERY OTHER CLASS CAN!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Totally FALSE! All spells are resisted when they are cast on creatures<br/>
&gt; that are more than 5 levels higher than you. Enchanter&#39;s and Magician&#39;s<br/>
&gt; too. And cleric&#39;s and shaman&#39;s too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You can cause damage to mobs that are not more than 5 levels higher than<br/>
&gt; you, it&#39;s very simple. As far as colors - 4 levels above your should be<br/>
&gt; red. So you CAN fight Reds. And don&#39;t forget that the melee classes will<br/>
&gt; miss so much and be hit so hard that it is not very profitable for them<br/>
&gt; to go against high reds as well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve watched every group I&#39;ve run with pass me up in level. I&#39;ve watched<br/>
&gt; &gt; characters started while I was at level 12 PASS ME at level 13. It&#39;s not as<br/>
&gt; &gt; though I never play, it&#39;s just that I CANNOT GAIN MORE THAN HALF A BUBBLE<br/>
&gt; &gt; EXP PER HOUR, on average. That&#39;s powergaming, soloing in the Karanas vs.<br/>
&gt; &gt; blue beetles and the occasional white/yellow.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No offense, but maybe you&#39;re just not that good. Yes, there is the<br/>
&gt; chance that you make wrong choices or get stuck in bad groups. As I<br/>
&gt; said, a bubble an hour is possible. And the Karanas are a really bad<br/>
&gt; place for a level 12-16 alone. Especially wizard.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your anecdotal case is not viable as an argument as to the Wizard&#39;s<br/>
&gt; capabilities.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Needless to say, I&#39;m very frustrated in playing this class right now. The<br/>
&gt; &gt; only reason I remain a Wizard is stubbornness. Everyone says it gets better<br/>
&gt; &gt; at higher levels, but the fact of the matter is that we&#39;ll always be a<br/>
&gt; &gt; second-rate class unless Verant fixes specialization, plane travel and<br/>
&gt; &gt; spell-resistances of higher-level mobs.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You have doubts that specialization and the planes will be fixed?<br/>
