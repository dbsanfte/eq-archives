It&#39;s just a game and i don&#39;t consider it anything major or ilegal she didn&#39;t <br/>
dupe the stuff or dupe some gold so live and let live.<br/>

&gt; &gt; i know a 30 day suspension is a really bad punishment but twinking is a <br/>
&gt;bad<br/>
&gt; &gt; offense<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What exactly is so bad about it? How ever easy or hard it is on her, has<br/>
&gt;no effect on you, so why don&#39;t you just mind your own business and stop<br/>
&gt;being so uptight. She&#39;s done nothing that brakes the rules or bothers<br/>
&gt;other players in any way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The only bother, is pure green jealousy, isn&#39;t it? You&#39;re just upset<br/>
&gt;that she gets an advantage you didn&#39;t, right? Well, life is tough like<br/>
&gt;that. Whether she gets an advantage or not, is none of your business<br/>
&gt;because it doesn&#39;t really affect you. And remember, she had to work her<br/>
&gt;way to level 22 before that as well, so she is only giving her other<br/>
&gt;Char something she rightfully earned.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just concentrate on your own character and stop being a jerk about it.<br/>
