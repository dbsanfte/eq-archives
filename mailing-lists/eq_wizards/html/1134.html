<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506289062">The only problem with the Root and Shoot strategy is in places like<br/>
Crushbone or other open areas as soon as you root something a fighter or<br/>
other class will charge the monster and start fighting it. This is usually<br/>
not a problem because the damage our spells deliver can easily outmatch a<br/>
fighter of similar level.  However the fighter will swear you stole his kill<br/>
and you&#39;ll get a 20 min rant about how wizards are just a bunch of kill<br/>
stealers.  It use to bother me at first but now a say what the hell I&#39;m a<br/>
Wizard.<br/>

Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
I have heard about this &quot;Root and Shoot&quot; strategy and I am greatly curious<br/>
about what it is.  I have all the RANK 2 spells except Glimpse and I need a<br/>
good way to kill things as I am getting nowhere towards my next level (Level<br/>
7).  I currently reside in Qeynos (Human), and I am looking for some way to<br/>
get to Level 7 without getting slain by Holly Crosstree or whatever her name<br/>
is.<br/>
<br/>
I am also looking to learn some new languages but it&#39;s hard to do as I have<br/>
none to trade in return.<br/>
<br/>
So, for those of you are confused, what is thr &quot;Root and Shoot&quot; strategy?<br/>
<br/>
(The strategy I use sometimes is to cast Root then Icestrike, back away, and<br/>
watch the enemy get pelted, then finish them with my staff when Icestrike or<br/>
Root ends.)<br/>
