<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839540725">This is unbelievable.. you are blaming other people for your kill stealing?!<br/>
First off, this game is more than about powerlevling.  That&#39;s probably why <br/>
you can never find a group.  Maybe because you are so socially retarded that <br/>
you don&#39;t know how to communicate with people in groups.  I rarely have <br/>
problems finding a group, and if i spend 30 mins or more and can&#39;t find a <br/>
group, i&#39;m going to log and do something in RL for a change.<br/>
&quot;IT IS BECAUSE WE CANNOT FIND GROUPS&quot; wah, wah, poor baby.  Suck it up, <br/>
you&#39;re a loser and nobody wants to group with you.  Continue to KS. What do <br/>
i care? i&#39;m beyond those lvls where it happens.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;      You guys don&#39;t seem to understand why some of us (such as myself) <br/>
&gt;kill<br/>
&gt;steal all the time.  IT IS BECAUSE WE CANNOT FIND GROUPS !!!  simple as <br/>
&gt;that.<br/>
&gt;no groups, KS !  thats it.  I don&#39;t feel like sitting on my ass for 30 - 40 <br/>
&gt;min<br/>
&gt;waiting for ppl to group, while shouting all the time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) people hate us for shouting so much<br/>
&gt;2) people don&#39;t message us even if they need group member (weird)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      You ppl who are against kill stealers by shouting their names out so <br/>
&gt;no one<br/>
&gt;will group them are so god damn stupid, all you have to do is group with <br/>
&gt;them<br/>
&gt;and BINGO !! no more kill stealing.   If i am getting good xp , why kill <br/>
&gt;steal<br/>
&gt;??  there is no point for me to risk my life trying to get xp from some <br/>
&gt;monster<br/>
&gt;6 others are beating up on.  I rarely die in a group since I stand so far <br/>
&gt;back,<br/>
&gt;but while kill stealing if i beat them up too much, the mob might run to me <br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt;no one else helping.   If you really want to stop kill stealing, then just <br/>
&gt;group<br/>
&gt;with those people so you guys can take on higher mobs together.   I would<br/>
&gt;happily stop KS anytime during the day to Group with ppl passing by.  I <br/>
&gt;only KS<br/>
&gt;while waiting for groups and i do shout for groups while i KS as well.<br/>
&gt;People are stupid and don&#39;t know how to stop a problem,  oh well... what <br/>
&gt;can you<br/>
&gt;do ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
