<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379266922">Something I didn&#39;t see mentioned in any of the mails sent out..<br/>
<br/>
Bolt is a trailer. You need to have a clear path to your target and when the<br/>
spell is fired off it takes off and chases your target down. As a comparison<br/>
someone said in a mail the other day that he fights only blues and root is<br/>
always used, if he can get 2 spells off he knew he would win the fight, if<br/>
not he SS and gated.<br/>
<br/>
I solo blues, whites(black), and even yellows, am currently level 11 and<br/>
have been doing this since level 8. Bolt is a good lead off spell since it<br/>
chases. While bolt is tracking down your victim from behind you are<br/>
gauranteed getting off 1 more spell(shock) and sometimes 2. Best case<br/>
scenario you have just got 3 spells to hit the crit and didn&#39;t have to use<br/>
the mana for the root. I do not suggest doing this on every opponent you<br/>
face since some are faster than others(I have learned a few of them the hard<br/>
way). Also this is more of an outdoor strategy.....young Wizards should stay<br/>
away from dungeons and the horrors called trains!!<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re a powerhouse! Don&#39;t let fear be your guide.<br/>
