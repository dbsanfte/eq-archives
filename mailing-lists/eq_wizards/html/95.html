<div id="ygrps-yiv-944838864">There is better armor out there for wizards.  Damask armor is magical leather armor that can be worn by wizards.  I have found a few pieces in Befallen on the third lvl off of the necromancers.  I would advise that you be around 16th lvl or so with a full party before traveling this far down in Befallen though.</div>
