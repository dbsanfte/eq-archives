<div id="ygrps-yiv-589051885">Well, your skill in 2h blunt will rise...just keep swinging away every<br/>
chance you get (you have the right idea).  Runed Totem Staffs (RTS) are<br/>
auctioned alot for around 20pp.  I sold my last one for 18pp.  Staff<br/>
mounting?  who knows...that is a great mystery so far.<br/>
<br/>
I do not know any bakers...keep on fishing.  Fishcakes are great food to<br/>
take withyou as they weight little and cost little (although you consume<br/>
them quicker).<br/>

Hey ppl, I was just wondering if you could tell me something about the<br/>
following...<br/>
Oh, and BTW, how the frick to get my 2Handblunt skill better? Group up<br/>
and fight things that con yellow to me only using my staff but then use<br/>
mana when it starts getting tough?:<br/>
1) Where do I find the Runed Totem Staff<br/>
2) Where do I find any Staff mountings for this staff(I hear they have<br/>
GREAT bonuses!)<br/>
3) Are there any other magic rings than the Cutthroat Insignia rings or<br/>
Onynx Earrings, and if so, what do they do and where the heck do I get<br/>
them?<br/>
4) Is Cooking a hard skill? seeing I am a fisherman, is it easier(money<br/>
wise) to sell the fish(or whatever I catch) to the merchant  and buy my<br/>
own food, or is it less expensive to just learn the cooking skill and<br/>
cook it up myself(oh, yeah, do I even usually get fish? eheheh, if my<br/>
skill goes up do I catch better fish or some rare items or what?)<br/>
Thx for all your help!<br/>
