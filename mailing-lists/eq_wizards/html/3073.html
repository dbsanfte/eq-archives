<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;PS. Does anyone know of a good guild on Veeshan ? i play on CET time and <br/>
&gt;most of<br/>
&gt;my in game friends live in USA so for me to play with them i have to stay <br/>
&gt;up all<br/>
&gt;night almost and it dosent agre with my work any more :-((<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just look at the people you play with everyday and see what guilds they are <br/>
in.  I think that&#39;s the best approach...otherwise, you&#39;ll be stuck in a <br/>
guild where you don&#39;t know anybody.  That isn&#39;t going to help much either.<br/>
<br/>
Veeshan has a LOT of guilds...biggest of which I think are FoH, the <br/>
Companions, and Aradani I think.   I&#39;m beginning to overhear people saying <br/>
their guilds are a little TOO big now. ;)<br/>
