&gt;Hi all guys,<br/>
&gt;it seems that OR we are all on hollidays OR we know all about wizzard :). I<br/>
&gt;don t receive more then 1 list all 2 days now :(<br/>
&gt;Come an guys, we need to wake up ! :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are right many wizards need to wake up. I have tryed to start<br/>
discusions and i also send test of petition what we write before to Verant<br/>
and to some boards only one wich post something was  Notcrazy Network. <br/>
<br/>
First i wish to state a wizard is playable class, it is hard to play at<br/>
start but a problem is if it stay so hard also on last lv? and on lv 24 i<br/>
realy feel nice, new shield, new leather skeen, new damage spell, But<br/>
wizards can be improved in many areas it is nice idea of a damage dealing,<br/>
teleporting explorer. Only we dont have where to use more then half of our<br/>
spells they are useles you will use them once or twice nearly all time as<br/>
you buyed them or if you research them and never more.<br/>
<br/>
I have visited many boards in all i see that there are wizards complainig<br/>
about our class. Some of most valid things is that our class is boring,<br/>
there is problems with lv 20 force shock spell wich is resisted too much,<br/>
you will get at lv 24 one spell wich hit for less damage, cast faster and<br/>
is nearly never resisted. We are class wich are false king of damage, we<br/>
are surpased with necros wich are more mana efficent, combination of<br/>
magician and pet do more damage than we can do for less mana,  we without<br/>
any doubt do more damage in unit of time than any other class but this is<br/>
best suicide mode in game. We have less spell lines then other classes and<br/>
this fey wich we have are nearly all screwed. Who use Area damage at 20<br/>
lv?, or better personal centered version of it? ( they have potencial use<br/>
for cleaning green mobs . . . but i never seen it used), excelent sight<br/>
spells wich are best to vaste you money on so you can take a look at beeach<br/>
girls from other side ... only girls here go in water with full platemail<br/>
if they can, also there are 2 portals wich are one near other ( west karana<br/>
and north karana), not to talk about our problem when we have to fight<br/>
something red +6 lv from your lv. Now verant give you possibility to group<br/>
with somone 8 lv higer then you he fight something blue so it is  6 lv up<br/>
from your lv and you cant do anything ... cast a damage shield on warriors<br/>
and boldly hach with your mighty weapon if you stel have it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;On another point, i just read the new patch message.. Damn.... From the<br/>
&gt;begining, nothing as been change for the wizzards... They just change during<br/>
&gt;the patch , the casting time . I have tested BEFORE and after : no change<br/>
&gt;(that a clock can see, so it s surely a change of let s say 0,001 second or<br/>
&gt;something like that.In other words : nothing.<br/>
&gt;All patch just power up the race... Now the druid dot spel are fast like<br/>
&gt;hell, necro same. And us ?? From the beginning, we have major bug who are<br/>
&gt;not resolved and they do nothing for us...<br/>
&gt;Force shock is bugged cause he is resisted too much (and i am ok that he get<br/>
&gt;resisted so much IF he stun like he must do). The enstill spel doesn&#39;t work<br/>
&gt;(i have tested with root : root is 10 times more effective). I am a playing<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>enstill have a little bit diferent use then root i use both when i solo but<br/>
it is funny that it is resised by green guys. I dont know how you tested<br/>
enstill against root?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;a shaman and i think i will stop my wizzard... We have nothing funny : we<br/>
&gt;just level and wait for what ? Our dd spel nothing more, no buf, no pet, no<br/>
&gt;life tap, no shield,no dot, no sow, nothing cool except some gate spel...<br/>
&gt;That s so boring.. For solo from level 8 to 50 you root nuke nuke root nuke<br/>
&gt;nuke dead... Wow that s pretty funny :( :( :(.<br/>
&gt;What about our ae spel ? and pe spel ?? Did someone here use them ????<br/>
&gt;NOBODY...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So guys, we were talking some weeks ago to petition.. Nothing has be done or<br/>
&gt;you just don t send the letter ???<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>as i say before i send a letter to verant and to all major boards but who<br/>
else done it? We must create a web page where we can concentrate effort<br/>
also of other wizards wich are not in this group.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that you will at last coment this problems wich we noted up here.<br/>
<br/>
