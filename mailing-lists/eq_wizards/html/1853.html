<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961101177">I have a 21st lvl wizard.  I can log in and spend 20 - 40 mins trying to find a group to play with. But no one<br/>
ever wants a wizard.  About the only time I can get in a group is if my friends that I know in real life are on.<br/>
Which isn&#39;t every time I play. How am I to lvl up and play the game, if this is a grouping game as they (verant)<br/>
say, when I can&#39;t find anyone to group with?<br/>
<br/>
As far as I can tell the wizard is pretty much useless and I have put him on the side because I can&#39;t solo (tried<br/>
many a time) and I can&#39;t find a party that wants me.<br/>
<br/>
I have a bard, necro, and SK as other chars and find groups all the time with no problem. Either we need to <br/>
start a petition or wizard will just continue to pretty much suck.<br/>
