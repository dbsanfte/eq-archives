<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-906118665">I just obtained 12th level and was wondering if it would be worth it to get<br/>
Al&#39;Kabor&#39;s Frost Spiral?  I have seen the mana cost at 100! and I have never<br/>
seen a damage code for it....  Any one want to help me on this one?  So far<br/>
I have picked up Shock of Lightning, Halo of Light, and Bind Affinity.<br/>
