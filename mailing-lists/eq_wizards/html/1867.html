<b>Subject:</b> What do you think about a few new spells <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1442937875">I&#39;ve been thinking about a few new spells that Verant should implement, tell me what you all think.  Most of these new spells is to reinforce the ability for wizards to travel, so far it appears that Druids are just as good, or even better then wizards with Spirt of the Wolf for traveling.<br/>
<br/>
Summon - Teleports group member inside the zone to your location<br/>
<br/>
Phase - Teleports yourself to location of other group member inside zone<br/>
<br/>
Greater Summon - Teleports group member to your location, even across zones<br/>
<br/>
Greater Phase - Teleports yourself to a group members location, even across zones<br/>
<br/>
Group Gate - Slow casting spell which teleports group to your bind spot, doesn&#39;t leave anyone behind<br/>
<br/>
Retreat - Evacuate version of group gate<br/>
<br/>
Haste - Increases movement rate for self only.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to seeing other classes get some or all of these spells, such as magicians getting Summon, Clerics Phase, druids group gate, etc.  As a wizard, with my teleportation spells, I never bind myself in the city anymore, now generally only at a zone border, for quick pick up when I get a bit too active with my burns.<br/>
<br/>
Phase and Summon would be just terribly useful, as quite often the puller sometimes grabs a bit more then he can chew, where the magician, wizard, whatever can pull his bacon out of the fire so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
Phase also would be quite useful, as the wizard, I generally get delegated to go on town runs (by the way, great way of making money, buy silver/copper for plat, various weapons.  Just gate back to the bank, or the nearest gate to your town and sell sell sell) and sometimes my group wandered off somewhere, or I don&#39;t want to run through nasties to get to my group.  So far I lost about half a level in Najena as I&#39;ve discovered Orges can see invis.  It would be nice not having to deal with them.<br/>
