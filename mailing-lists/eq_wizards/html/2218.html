<div id="ygrps-yiv-43157140">If that is the case, and someone is standing on your gate destination, its <br/>
too bad they don&#39;t have a message that your gate is blocked rather than <br/>
collapses.. I like the collapse thing...its a nice addition (imaginitive <br/>
wise.. but not when I want to get the hey out fast and lose my last bit of <br/>
mana trying to gate and failing), but I would also like the reason to be <br/>
stated if someone is blocking where you will gate to...on that note though, <br/>
I do remember ending up right on top of people when I gated/ended up at my <br/>
home point so I don&#39;t know if that holds true or not in this game.  It did <br/>
in UO but I don&#39;t think EQ runs the gating the same way.  I haven&#39;t tried <br/>
to gate in water yet, have had no cause to at this time.<br/>

&gt;I have zoned from Qeynos South to Erud&#39;s Crossing by swimming. you can zone<br/>
&gt;while swimming. i swam all the way from Qeynos to Erud&#39;s isle.  and i <br/>
&gt;teleported<br/>
&gt;many times underwater without problem. i think the gate collapse only happens<br/>
&gt;when someone is STANDING on your gate position.  because the gate collapse<br/>
&gt;happen to me only 4 times and those 4 times happen ALL together within a <br/>
&gt;period<br/>
&gt;of 1 min. where all my gate just either fail or collapse.  but after i waited<br/>
&gt;awhile, it worked fine.<br/>
