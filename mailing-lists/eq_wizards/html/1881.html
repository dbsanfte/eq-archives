<div id="ygrps-yiv-601200583">Ok, so i am on this mailing list from digest 3 :). And it s really amusing<br/>
to see how people change their mind.. At the beginning everyone was happy<br/>
with the wizzard class. Now many of ours come to level 20 and more and find<br/>
they are useless vs RED con creatures... Here is my 2 cents :<br/>
<br/>
First of all, never, never say a wizzard is useless : i am hunting at HHP...<br/>
And everytime i go there and i say EVERYTIME i get a toons of tell from<br/>
people to group with . Why ? simple. I am not a god but when there are, let<br/>
s say 15 people, at a spawn point with blue to yellow con creatures and that<br/>
everyone engage any creatures coming.. they need me :). Cause if i want, i<br/>
get the kill.. No way others will have it if i start casting as hell. NO<br/>
WAY. I never never stealth kill, but if no group want with me np, as soon as<br/>
i see a monster i cast (if i am full and that the monster i not already<br/>
engaged of course).. all warrior type run on it, all casters cast.. And i<br/>
get the kill.... What i never do : some wizzard  (many sigh :( ) see a<br/>
monster, many people run to fight it... They just cast two spel or so... and<br/>
then meditate again... The people fighting the monster kill him after 40<br/>
secondes and the wizzard get the kills... that s what i call &quot;kill stealer&quot;.<br/>
When i begin to cast, i cast, using all my mana if needed but i kill it<br/>
myself or do a REAL more dommage then others . But as i previously said, as<br/>
soon as i come and ask for a group all people ask for me cause they know i<br/>
can help them to kill monsters AND to get the kill... One good (and bad in<br/>
fact:) ) example : yesterday was a wizzard level 23 at hpp, i don t<br/>
appreciate this guys (only cause he is a dark elf:) ) : we were something<br/>
like 10 players my group 5 people, one other group 3 people, and this guy<br/>
with a tank...I was level 19... AS soon a someone see him casting on a mob,<br/>
nobody and i say nobody try to get the kill :)))) they all know he can do<br/>
175 dommage per cast and he can cast 2 or 3 time without having the mob on<br/>
him :) So he is absolutely sure to get the kill :). That was funny to see<br/>
players say : STOP. The wizzard already get it, don t try :).<br/>
About the resisting fact, i get the same problem as you guys : sometimes<br/>
monsters resist my spells... Sometimes blue do (not often hopefully), white<br/>
too but yellow and red resist a lot... You say : but all others class hit<br/>
him, we can not ! Ha come on, i have seen many times a full group of level<br/>
14 -15 warrior type being killed one per one by a red orc mercenary level<br/>
23-24.... They were missing ALL the time, and the mob hit them for 45+ . So<br/>
i am sorry to say if we are useles vs red creatures others are too :).<br/>
Sometimes a spell hit a red mob with full dommage.. Who can hit a monster in<br/>
2 sec for 175 dommage ??? With a good weapon 2h slashing (i mean a REAL GOOD<br/>
WEAPON) a warrior level 20 hit for one attack at 35... ok he can double<br/>
attack sometimes. But if he don t miss it takes 8 seconde between each<br/>
try... So if he never miss  and that he sucessfully double attack (at level<br/>
20 they don&#39;t :) ), he deals 70 dommage for 8 secondes.. IF the monster get<br/>
hit for the max dommage..... So take 20 seconde to do 170 hp dommage IF he<br/>
double attack all the time and hits all the time and is not stunned or<br/>
bashed :). Come an, if our spel were never or less resisted we are going to<br/>
be god :). <br/>
Finally ( sorry for this long post:) ), i think that wizzard are really not<br/>
useless vs creatures and if you think they are, just go and take a monk or<br/>
whatever :). But i want to see your face when at level 20 you do 18 hp max<br/>
for each attack :). Oh and yes, i solo let&#39;s say 5 or 10 minutes per day no<br/>
more : after that people ask me to join them :). I also never (or nearly<br/>
never) try to kill red con creatures with 5 other friends.. yellow yep<br/>
sometimes but no red cause it take a biggg time to rest after the fight and<br/>
the xp is really not very better then a white (kill 2 dark blue, you get<br/>
more xp then one red..).<br/>
