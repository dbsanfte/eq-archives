&gt; Martar Icebear.  No luck with that so far.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have made an acquaintance with him the other night.<br/>
My friends and I were hunting mammoths, when suddenly<br/>
I see &quot;you are punched for 98&quot; (don&#39;t remember the<br/>
exact number, but it was quite high) several times,<br/>
tried rooting, was resisted twice, tried<br/>
shadowstepping, got chased down quickly, and died.<br/>
<br/>
So yes, he is out there :)<br/>
