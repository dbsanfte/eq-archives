<div id="ygrps-yiv-210302160">Well your words have inspired me to stick w/ it until 16th  . . .<br/>
I am in a lull at lvl 14, any suggestions on places to hunt that are good<br/>
eps for my lvl?   I have 2 tanks (ranger and paladin both 16th) I am always<br/>
w/  . . .<br/>
<br/>
I was 8th when the 16th lvl Paladin started and he is 16th now and I am 8th!<br/>
grrrrrrrr   I think Early lvls is just hard as a wizard.    I am confused on<br/>
one point.    I hear 1/2 the people saying we SOLO BETTER at high lvls and<br/>
1/2 the people saying we can ONLY solo at low lvls.    Any high lvl wizards<br/>
out there have any thought on this?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
