<div id="ygrps-yiv-409461498">Yes a +10 INT staff is fine but its 10/100 so unless I get an enchanter to<br/>
cast haste on me its not much use in combat. I currently have a Writhing<br/>
Staff and would only use a Tarton Staff if I needed the extra Mana.<br/>
<br/>
Also the groups I&#39;ve been in lately in Cazic and Mistmoore do not require<br/>
that I expend large amounts of mana. Most groups consisted of a Cleric,<br/>
Enchanter, Shaman and 2 tanks. Also most if not all of my spells were<br/>
resisted by the Red MOBs they were pulling. I spend most of my time casting<br/>
some low damage spells that don&#39;t get resisted, try to get a root to hold<br/>
and take a few whacks with my staff.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t even get me started about Root/Enstill. Last night in Cazic I would<br/>
enstill a Liz when it got to 30-50%% health so it wouldn&#39;t run and 7 out 10<br/>
times it would resist or break before the liz died. After and hour I was<br/>
sick of it so I got the ranger to snare at the beginning of the fight and he<br/>
was never resisted and it lasted until the Liz died. In fact the only high<br/>
damage spell I used was when the cleric yelled for someone to pull a<br/>
sentinel off him, the DD spell was more reliable than trying to root it.<br/>
<br/>
The Enchanter we had in our group saved the lives of the party more times<br/>
than I can remember. We&#39;d pull too many or get sideswiped by a train and<br/>
he&#39;d just mesmerize them and they&#39;d stand there for 30 to 60 secs and the<br/>
fighters would finish one and go to the next. Also talking to the enchanter<br/>
Mesmerize and MemBlur has never been resisted, He even used it on a Hill<br/>
Giant when he was 20th just to check. Makes you fell kind of useless. At<br/>
29th I get Evac and that will give me a purpose but until then being masters<br/>
of DD is not all its cracked up to be.<br/>

Now I know they added the Tarton&#39;s Wheel quest for us wizards but that isn&#39;t<br/>
going to help me until I get closer to 49th and can<br/>
actually use the runes.<br/>

So, I take it a +10 INT 1HB staff is of no use to you?<br/>
