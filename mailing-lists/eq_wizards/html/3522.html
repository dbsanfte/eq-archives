loot money over in Cazic.  You can get up to about 1-3pp off of the lizzies <br/>
there and they even drop fine steel weapons.  If you&#39;re too lazy to stand <br/>
around auctioning FS weapons, they can usually be redeemed to NPC merchants <br/>
for around 2-3pp as well.  It&#39;s not uncommon before for me to get upwards of <br/>
100pp a night there.  Of course, the best situation is to group yourself <br/>
with a couple of folks playing their tweaked secondaries...they usually <br/>
don&#39;t care about loot and you can wrack up the dough. :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not too rich myself, but I can usually do enough each night to cover the <br/>
costs of all the reagents and spells I use. :)<br/>

*IF* rumours are true about the Oracle Robe becoming *no rent*, it would be <br/>
a good idea to buy a pre-patched Robe now before the market picks it up in <br/>
price.  Otherwise, don&#39;t worry about it...there are better robes than the <br/>
Oracle Robe now to look forward to.  I know a 50 Wizzie who volunteered to <br/>
wear only the FBR through level 50 only because he liked the color <br/>
better....he kicked arse anyway. =)<br/>
