&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have started my quest for the Staff of the Wheel and currently have 8 of<br/>
&gt; the 10 rods.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am missing the one in Guk and the one from the Everfrost caves. But I have<br/>
&gt; a few questions since I have spent no time in Guk in 32 levels.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; GUK<br/>
&gt; 1. I need to know the easiest or quickest path to the hand room?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Zone in at the dead side and yell for someone to guide you. The hand&#39;s<br/>
spawns are well timed so  if it&#39;s camped, you&#39;re ok. You also will need<br/>
invis vs. undead and the bedroom to be camped (vampiric bats see through<br/>
both invis). BTW, the hand is not undead so she will see through invis<br/>
undead. And you CAN&#39;T stack both. So if the hand spawns and you&#39;re<br/>
there, don&#39;t even think about anything, you&#39;re dead 100%. Just try to<br/>
grab the rod before you die so you&#39;ll drag your corpse with the rod.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2. Is the room on the Live or Dead side?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3. Will I encounter any Undead frogs along the way?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hehehe. Yes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; EVERFROST<br/>
&gt; I know that the rod is surrounded by 3 IBS and that an NPC is in the area. I<br/>
&gt; can get by the IBS with Invis to Undead but the NPC could be a problem.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This was really easy. Nothing there can see through invis except the<br/>
IBS&#39; who are all too green to attack anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 1. Is this NPC within range of the rod?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I will not have a group with me and am only going to attempt this when the<br/>
&gt; Hand room is being camped. I may however try a suicide run depending on how<br/>
&gt; brave I feel.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Any suicide run through Guk will only end in death. There is 0 chance of<br/>
you just running through since the place has a lot of spellcasters, and<br/>
many are on your way to the hand room. Most of them are inside.<br/>
