<div id="ygrps-yiv-803239503">I have successfully made both Piller of fire and project lightning through research.  There really wasn&#39;t much to it, put the two *right* runes in the Lexicon, hit combine, and get the message, you have successfully fasioned these items into something new.  Of course those two spells are worthless, but hey; I researched something.<br/>
<br/>
Problem is that I have all the useful spells (including alot of useless ones) for level 16 and 20, so right now I&#39;m in rune collection mode for 24 and 29.  I&#39;m also looking for someone to get me above Below average in old erudian.  I saw someone auctioning that they will train up to excellent for 20pp (train 4 others for the more reasonable price for 5pp and I&#39;ll make it back), didn&#39;t have enough.  Such is life.<br/>
<br/>
For your information you can train up to your level + 1 in research.  You start off with 17 points after one training I beleive.  After you level a few times you can keep pumping points in there.  I presume with the level 49 spells you will be failing alot.  <br/>
