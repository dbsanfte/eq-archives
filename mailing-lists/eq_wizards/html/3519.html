&gt; Youre around the levels you can start making money, but yeah its still<br/>
hard. I did the mail quests a lot, Bound at Freeport by the bard in<br/>
question, Hotkey the phrase, and have a FayGate/Gate combo memmed. At the<br/>
Wiz spires in GFay, go straight north, not the long way following the path,<br/>
and you get to Kelethin in about 2 minutes. Round trip, 7 minutes, 1 and a<br/>
half plat. If you only have a half hour or so, its a nice little trip.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Go to Highpass tho. On Tunare you can ALWAYS get in a group for orcs, and<br/>
the zone is right there. The guards are useless as protectors, but theres a<br/>
bank, merchants, and orc spawns plentiful. You should be able to level<br/>
there, then go to SKarana for SplitPaw outer. I power levelled from 22 to 30<br/>
there in no time, and loot isnt bad either.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you dont care about your faction, you can start joining treant groups<br/>
in a bit, or instead of Highpass you can go do Unrest or Everfrost.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Treants are excellent money, and a lot of treant campers have SO much<br/>
silver and copper and gold they literally cannot move. Gate over to SK and<br/>
do money exchanges (rounding in your favor).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I always made money off Binding, and tailoring Shadow Silk for necros, and<br/>
now off of group teleporting. The server overcrowding and necro population<br/>
make the bone chip market lucrative as well, 3pp/20 is regular, but you can<br/>
get away with 5-10pp/20 as well if you look for the high lvl necros in your<br/>
zone. I am also a Master Smith. This takes 250 plat to master, but you can<br/>
make 50 pp profit off a full suit, or at the standard price, 1 pp+1 per AC,<br/>
you make a plat-4 plat each piece, depending. With your High base INT,<br/>
Smithing would be a breeze to learn, ditto Tailoring.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good luck and may the /randoms be with you...<br/>

&gt; &gt; I once watched a lvl 50 Wizard Gate in, pull the Oracle around the<br/>
&gt; &gt; hill and burn him dead with one Ice comet. Guardian never budged.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Heh.. so all I have to do is find a level 50 wizard or a high level druid<br/>
&gt; who&#39;s willing to take the faction hit.. or pay 1000 plat.. LOL I have<br/>
&gt; about 100 plat in the bank which is probably as high as my bank<br/>
&gt; account ever is.  Bottom line for me is that unless they fix the<br/>
&gt; quest for the robe it&#39;s unlikely that I&#39;ll ever get one.  Tho truthfully<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m having so little luck getting groups at 22 that I&#39;m not playin my<br/>
&gt; wiz very much these days.  I actually got tossed out of a group I<br/>
&gt; was invited to when the warrior discovered (uhhh how could anyone<br/>
&gt; NOT know this) that I couldn&#39;t buff or heal him.<br/>
