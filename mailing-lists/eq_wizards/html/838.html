<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262216353">Ok lets put some logic to this, what happens when you are in a Dungeon and<br/>
you do an area spell to a mob near a door?  Well whatever is behind the door<br/>
opens the door and attacks you of course.  As a programmer I can say that<br/>
the technique used for this is the same they would use for buildings, but<br/>
choose not to.  From my conversation with a GM they told me the programmers<br/>
left it that way as a joke, sort of their backdoor if you will.  Things like<br/>
can be taken advantage of if you think about so they have not fully<br/>
implemented it yet.<br/>

&gt; &gt;limits.  To implement that code for every creatures AI would have been a<br/>
&gt; &gt;large task and due to time constraints was not implemented<br/>
