<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082641216">Interesting... I&#39;m pretty darn sure that my swimming skill always maxes out.<br/>
I used to swim A LOT from Erudin to Kerra Isle (which is a longer than<br/>
average swim), and always saw my skill stop rising until I leveled - then it<br/>
would take off another 5 pts quite quickly then stop again.  <br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t speak for the trade skills.<br/>

		Trade Skills I know for sure do not have a level cap for<br/>
skill.  I have a<br/>
		friend who is a Dark Elf Necromancer on Fennin Ro.  At level<br/>
17 he has a<br/>
		Smihting skill 126.  By the level+1 times 5 rule he should<br/>
be maxed at 85.<br/>
		However, this is not the case.  Any of the trade skills as<br/>
well as swimming<br/>
		(yes I am counting Fishing as a trade skill) have a 255<br/>
skill cap but none<br/>
		other based on level that I have seen.<br/>
