 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t seen the resist problem yet (but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me--snaring<br/>
and rooting spells seem to have been pretty much nerfed).  However,<br/>
regarding the short holding time, I&#39;ve never timed it but Bonds of Force<br/>
always has a very short duration (like 10 seconds).  Enough time for you to<br/>
cast once, and cast Bonds again safely.  Be very careful with the spell,<br/>
especially while (say) hill giant hunting.<br/>
