<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104693493">Good point.  Personally, I usually spend twice as much mana as they lose <br/>
health, up until 60% mana.  Then I save for root or nuke if there is <br/>
trouble.  That way I med up before they heal up.  I like them to see me <br/>
help, but not have to wait on me.  Of course, if there is a cleric, you have <br/>
to modify things.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I always have to modify things.  Communication is the most <br/>
important attribute of the wizard.  When you group, play things your way a <br/>
little, then ask opinions about your mana burn.  You may be suprised at the <br/>
answer.<br/>

&gt;When you are finished Meditating and stand up the warriors are just <br/>
&gt;finished<br/>
&gt;resting back there HP&#39;s. This means that if they must wait for you then you<br/>
&gt;are casting too much. I only start nuking if I see a targeted warrior drop<br/>
&gt;below 1/2 his health, and we do not have a healer. Then when the party is<br/>
&gt;healing themselves I am Meditating and we tend to finish at same time. This<br/>
&gt;way they do not feel I am a burden but rather a savior when I really let<br/>
&gt;lose my power to save them.<br/>
