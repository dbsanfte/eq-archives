 </span></blockquote>WHOA.  Hold on there.  Snare is not random duration and never has been.  I<br/>
have a lv 35 ranger in addition to my Wiz and snare ALWAYS lasts right about<br/>
1 min 45 seconds.  I can time snare with a stopwatch and never have to worry<br/>
about snare failing.  Root on the other hand seems to be nearly completely<br/>
useless in all its froms.  High resist rate and has a random hold duration<br/>
from 0 to 5 seconds.  In beta it wasn&#39;t like that.  You could root and nuke<br/>
a mob at lvl 6 without concern for root failing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, this sounds about right.  For some reason BoF has the root duration<br/>
calculation instead of snare.  For a lot more mana.<br/>
