I&#39;m a level 11 wizard about to turn 12.  Well my friend is a shaman who just<br/>
turned 14. Well he just brought<br/>
his new damage spell and he said it does 77 damage, to which i replied kewl<br/>
my next spell does that amount<br/>
too. That was a mistake he started laughing and saying things like &quot;why<br/>
would anyone want to play the wizard<br/>
when they can play the shaman&quot;.  &quot;the shaman can stand toe to toe like the<br/>
warrior and do the same damage<br/>
as the wizard, Ha HA HA HA .....&quot; . Then he went on saying crap like now he<br/>
knows the shaman is the best<br/>
class in the game. All he could talk about before was the sow spell, and now<br/>
it is he does the same damage<br/>
as the wizard.  My question is this, i thought i picked the wizard so i<br/>
would not have to hear stuff like this?<br/>
I thought level 12 was when the wizard started to leave other mage class<br/>
behind.  Know i have to hear alot<br/>
aggraviating crap from this shaman, laughing at the wizard class. Dam that<br/>
is going to suck.  Someone<br/>
please tell me there is hope out there as far as the damage spells go.<br/>

Does your friend have Root spell?  Or does he have to stand there and try<br/>
to beat the monster to death?  Can he gate if the going gets tough?  At<br/>
level 16, and level 20 will he start getting all kinds of cool gating<br/>
spells?  Stuff like, &quot;Well, I&#39;m in freeport and I&#39;d really rather be in<br/>
Feydwit, so ZAP! POOF!  Here I am!&quot; kind of stuff?<br/>
<br/>
I think not!<br/>
<br/>
You should also note how long his spell delays are, and how many he can<br/>
cast before he is out of mana??  And how many offensive spells can he cast<br/>
without having to save mana to heal up because he can&#39;t root the monster?<br/>
I would suspect the answer to these questions would provide feedback as to<br/>
why Wizards are the #1 damage dishers in the whole game.  <br/>
<br/>
I know that as a level 15 gnome wizard, I can cast shock of lightning,<br/>
which hits for 81 points of damage and costs 60 mana, I can cast this spell<br/>
at least 5 times and STILL have some mana left over for a couple roots and<br/>
even a shock of ice if I still need to blast a little bit more!<br/>
<br/>
So yeah, shamans are kind of buff, they have healing, SoW, and some other<br/>
stuff thats really pretty cool, but I SERIOUSLY doubt a shaman can dish out<br/>
300-360 points of damage with his/her spells, they just don&#39;t have enough<br/>
mana for it.<br/>
