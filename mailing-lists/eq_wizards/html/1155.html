<div id="ygrps-yiv-1955619225">They used to NOT disappear.  I had about 10 of them a tone time (during<br/>
commercial release).  I think since it is part of a quest, they only want<br/>
you to get one at a time.<br/>

You say the Skull is a lore item, and that you can only ever have one of <br/>
them in inventory? This would go along with the items carried by the bandit <br/>
sisters in Lesser Faydark. They sometimes have pearl necklaces, non-magical <br/>
but are listed as lore items. These necklaces also disappear if you already <br/>
have one in your inventory. Could we draw the conclusion that all lore items<br/>
<br/>
are considered to be &quot;unique&quot; for any given PC?<br/>
