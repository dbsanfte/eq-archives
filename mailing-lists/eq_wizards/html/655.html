<div id="ygrps-yiv-2013570730">Just to inform everyone.  This behavior where monsters can attack through solid object is not a glitch.  It is a choice they have made, the code to turn clipping on for monsters is there.  It would be very easy for them to make it so that monsters cannot attack through things, but they have chosen to allow this.  I personally can&#39;t think of any reasons why they would allow this to happen, but I&#39;m sure they have their reasons.<br/>

    Err.... not to be a party pooper, but ever seen Jaws? They can explain shark attacks any way they want. But probably the most glaring example of this is the inn just off the road in Western Karanas near the border to Northern Karanas. Was messing around with 2 other fellows looking for grizzlies back when I was 10th lvl. We stopped in the inn to resupply when a lioness strolls through the wall in the corner and starts to maul me. Then a lion started mauling another person so we finished off the lioness and proceeded to kill the lion. Suddenly I saw the text a hill giant hits Kebik for 90 pts of damage....a hill giant bashes Kebik for 50 pts of damage...dead. Then this guy starts in on me. hits me twice and I&#39;m still running, opened the door....he misses me...Take 5 steps and then I see the LOADING PLEASE WAIT..<br/>
     <br/>
    Me dead. Alright, I can understand a hill giant ripping off a roof and beating the crap out of us. That&#39;s acceptable...sort of...but the lions walking through the wall is just wrong. Am I making a point here? No. Probably not. I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is, yes there&#39;s glitches and bugs. I knew everything would not be totally worked out, because there&#39;s always new things that crop up and they&#39;ll eventually be worked out. I&#39;d still rather play with all the bugs and all, than not play is what it boils down to.</div>
