<div id="ygrps-yiv-1006276257">Well I am hoping that this is not so as my level 10 wizard is developing<br/>
more.  I do know that we will be highly useful to a group once we get our<br/>
escape and portal spells.  I am pretty sure that any high level group will<br/>
have a cleric (to cast group divine aura) along with a wizard (to cast group<br/>
teleport) in sticky situations.<br/>
<br/>
Other things I have seen is that wizards (at least at level 12 with<br/>
lightning shock) can be superb kill stealers.  In crushbone there is<br/>
commonly a level 12 wizard camping the trainer for his coveted shiny brass<br/>
shield.  In 3 or 4 lightning shocks the trainer is dead and no group can<br/>
hope to get the kill that quickly unless they have a level 12 wizard as<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
I am sad that wizards dont get any additional damage shields after o&#39;kiels<br/>
radiation at level 4, and other than that dont really have any group buff<br/>
spells at all.  I don&#39;t really know about the higher levels very much, but<br/>
wizards dont seem to have a whole lot to offer the group than teleport<br/>
spells and a bit of direct damage.  Other classes might very well be more<br/>
useful in a group.<br/>
<br/>
More feedback would be appreciated fellow Wizards.  Please post.<br/>

Well said Jay. Parties cant be bothered with wizards, they cant buff, cant<br/>
heal<br/>
and cant really help parties that much...&quot;we were supposed to be heavy<br/>
artillery&quot; but that just is not correct. I think a wizard would be most<br/>
parties<br/>
last choice if they could choose from all the classes.<br/>
<br/>
Its very easy to demonstrate the wizard immbalance; get into an arena with a<br/>
dual wield barbarian warrior of the same level and see how you do!<br/>
Hmm doesn&#39;t sound too promising eh?<br/>
<br/>
I have always played a wizard character class in AD&D and UO but I regret<br/>
playing one in EQ. I think EQ were nervous about the power wizards in UO and<br/>
didn&#39;t want to unbalance the game. I think they swung the pendalum too far<br/>
the<br/>
other way. Root &#39;n&#39; Shoot, if that fails death, thats about it.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully e-mails will pour in and tell me how wrong I am. Great, show me<br/>
its<br/>
not the case so I feel I have a character with a future!<br/>
