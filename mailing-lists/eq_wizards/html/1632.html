<b>Subject:</b> [Q] advancing fighting skills at higher levels <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-958458180">I have a 9th level wizard that has been using 2H blunt for her entire <br/>
life.  I would like to try some 1H weapons to free a hand for useful <br/>
items in the future so I went to the newbie area and started wacking <br/>
/con green critters.  I found I could hit several run to a un <br/>
populated area and then stand and punch one creature until it ran <br/>
away. Then started working another until it ran away eventually <br/>
comming back to the original one.  I did this with one group of 3 <br/>
crits for over an hour and got absolutely 0 increase in bare hand <br/>
skill (still at 10 or 11)!  <br/>
<br/>
What is going on am I to start on /con blue creatures at level 9.  If <br/>
so and had I known (ie if the manual had any value at all) I would <br/>
have been training 1H skills much early when the creatures could not <br/>
kill me in 2 or 3 blows!<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone confirm this and/or give suggestions on how at this point <br/>
(9th) I can improve my 1H fighting skills?<br/>
