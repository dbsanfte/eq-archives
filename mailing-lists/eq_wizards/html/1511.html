<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760645958"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; No, eye of zom is conjuration that s right but halo of<br/>
&gt; light is divination<br/>
&gt; (as sense magic). A question for all of you guys :<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s funny though, I just checked it again and my Conjuration goes up<br/>
when casting the Halo of Light spell.  Is it possible it checks<br/>
against both?<br/>
My Conjuration was at 0 before I got Halo, because I never used (never<br/>
got Eye of Zomm).  Since I started using Halo it&#39;s gone up a few<br/>
points, very slowly, to 7 now.  So my guess is it checks against both<br/>
Divination and Conjuration.  That&#39;s the only explanation I can come up<br/>
with.<br/>
