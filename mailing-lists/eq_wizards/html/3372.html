    For levels 6 to about 9 try the gnoll guards and scrawny gnoll guards, not in<br/>
Blackburrow, but on the Everfrost side in the tunnel leading to Blackburrow.  I think<br/>
there are 4 spawns (if I remember correctly), two at the entrance, one at the 2nd corner,<br/>
and one more in a little nook a ways down the hall.  The only bad part is that if you have<br/>
to zone into BB you may run into a train. A good thing is that passersby may be able to<br/>
help if you get into trouble and they drop fairly decent loot.  Good luck.<br/>
