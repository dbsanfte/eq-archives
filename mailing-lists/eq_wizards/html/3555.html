<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-97572011">Um, hi everyone *waves*.  I just joined the group and thought I&#39;d say <br/>
hi.  My main is a wizard (obviously), though he&#39;s only mid-level.  I <br/>
mostly play characters over on the E. Marr server.<br/>
<br/>
I have a couple of questions though.  Is it normal for wizards to die <br/>
about every five encounters?  I have a definite tendency to get <br/>
killed.  Also, anything that cons over light blue is almost <br/>
impossible for me to solo.  Is this normal, or do I need to rethink <br/>
my strategies?  I am having a lot of trouble finding a group since <br/>
LDON came out, so this is a pretty important question for me.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the lame questions, but the only other wizard I know is <br/>
even lower level than I am, so we aren&#39;t much help to each other info <br/>
wise.<br/>
