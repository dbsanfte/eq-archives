<div id="ygrps-yiv-526674306">Hail all.  I answer the question of wizards being a weak class as I play my<br/>
game...in character.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of sniveling going on in the apprentice ranks of our mighty<br/>
class.  No pets, no buffs, too much meditating.  Ours is not a class for<br/>
those looking for the easy road.  Find a sword or a mace and go punch a<br/>
critter if that&#39;s your cause.  Ours is a class of discipline.  The road is<br/>
hard, but so are the rewards.  The magics we wield allow us to do one thing<br/>
that few classes can.  Solo the entire realm.  I&#39;m currently of the tenth<br/>
level, and while I have adventured with a few for fun, 97 per cent of all of<br/>
my time has been alone.<br/>
<br/>
Occasionally I even bail out the weak swordslingers, shaking at their<br/>
fifteen point hits, while I send ice or fire raining down upon my enemies<br/>
(and sometimes theirs) for double or even triple their damage.  So there are<br/>
few things I fear in this world of Norrath.  There are few things you should<br/>
as well.  Use your head.  Attack with caution and strategy.  And use your<br/>
spells in combinations that will win you the day.  Yes we spend much time in<br/>
meditation, but we are the scholars, the students, and the finders of lost<br/>
power.<br/>
<br/>
Adopt the right attitude and use your head in stead of your staff and you&#39;ll<br/>
agree.<br/>
