I hate to be a negative nelly but you have a long road ahead.  The <br/>
wizard class is not designed to solo.  I agree with that design <br/>
decision by the way.  After all we are physical weaklings wondering <br/>
the landscape in a night robe with a stick.  <br/>
<br/>
To survive eventually you will have to learn to hit without being hit. <br/>
 However, up through 12th I find you will have to fight (melee) to <br/>
conserve mana.  This is the case even if you are grouped in some cases <br/>
especially when your grouped as I will describe below.<br/>
<br/>
Here lies the conundrum.  Up through 12th your offensive spells are <br/>
weak or use nearly all your mana.  Your melee talent will not be much <br/>
confort to tank types that will have to endure severe beatings as a <br/>
result of your inability to wade into the fight thus reducing your <br/>
desirability as a team member. Your desirability as a team member is <br/>
further impared by the fact that if you do open up and burn critters <br/>
to the ground you&#39;ll use much of your mana forcing the rest of the <br/>
party to wait for you to regenerate it reduciong the rate that <br/>
everyone in the group levels or aquires bootie (the real reason most <br/>
are there in the first place).  The game should actually be called <br/>
GREEDquest or everGREED.  Anyway I digress.<br/>
<br/>
In short verant has designed a class that must group to survive but <br/>
until higher levels you will find it difficult (at least I have on <br/>
Mithaniel Marr) to find a reliable groups to band with you as there <br/>
are much better choices than wizards available to them.<br/>
<br/>
So your back to soloing.  This means competing with the guilds and <br/>
tanks types for the occasional straggling blue critter. You will have <br/>
no choice but to burn baby burn.  Using up hordes of mana and having <br/>
to rest or run most of the time.  This means the going will be very <br/>
slow.<br/>
<br/>
I have a bard that went from 1 to 14 in one quarter of the time my <br/>
wizard has taking to go from 1 to 9!  My bard has 90pp in the bank <br/>
full banded, 54 skill in blacksmithing, magic shield and magic weapon. <br/>
 And yes he freaking fought for every single piece of it.  This is not <br/>
to say I am fond of the Bard type.  I really prefer my wizard.  But I <br/>
can fight and kill more effectively as a bard then a wizard through <br/>
the first 20 levels at least. I find it much easier to find groups to <br/>
band with my bard.  As a low level wizard (lvl 9 just recently) I feel <br/>
like the fat kid at the baseball field.  You know the one.  Last to <br/>
get picked and usually plays the catcher.<br/>
<br/>
I have not found a solution to the problem short of finding a regular <br/>
player or players to band with or joining a guild.  As a wizard if you <br/>
are not connected (in the click) on your server plan on taking forever <br/>
to lvl.  I have seen other wizards go from 3 lvls below me to 6 lvls <br/>
above me.  How?  Band baby band!  They have found a way to band on a <br/>
regular basis.  <br/>
<br/>
Or they are cheating twinks that use their tank types or friends to <br/>
give them weapons, armour, magic items and cash to be more effective <br/>
at soloing thru the early levels.  I have seen one level 7 wizard in <br/>
full netted with a glowing crook and what I am sure are 2 +15 mana <br/>
bracers and 2 +5 mana rings.  Come on!  At 9th I can&#39;t even afford all <br/>
the useful spells through 8th level and am stuck worth a junky worn GS <br/>
but this yahoo is walking around in 200 to 250pp worth of stuff and <br/>
he&#39;s earned every piece.  SURE! <br/>
<br/>
So if you want to advance in levels quickly as a Wizard band, twink or <br/>
plan on watching other people make 4 lvls to your 1 and live with it.<br/>
<br/>
