<div id="ygrps-yiv-1488421312">You are a Wizard so you will want to go with a weapon that is going to give<br/>
some magic bonuses. A lot of the good magic weapons for wizards will be<br/>
staffs so you will probally want to pick a weapon that uses one or two<br/>
handed blunt<br/>

&gt;Hail fellow Wizards!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would like to inquire as to your preferences of melee weapon.  I am a<br/>
&gt;level 9 right now and am at the point where I am thinking about seeking a<br/>
&gt;magical weapon.  I am sure at higher levels I won&#39;t even want to get NEAR<br/>
&gt;the monster I am fighting to melee, but at this point I can still get some<br/>
&gt;decent damage and save mana finishing off creatures with melee.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So as far as magic weapons go, what should I be setting my sights on and<br/>
&gt;what choices do i have available in the next couple levels?  Also, should I<br/>
&gt;in general try to use daggers (for speed but low damage), 2h blunt (for good<br/>
&gt;damage but low speed), or 1h blunt (holding a nice magic item in offhand --<br/>
&gt;like what?).  As much or as little info as ye have I would be grateful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks!<br/>
