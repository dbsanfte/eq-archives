 </span></blockquote>I wish it were, but it isent. IMHO _ALL_ spells beyond level 12 should be <br/>
research only. Of course they should make it a bit more easy to get the <br/>
runes then. They are loaded WAY to seldom, but I hear that they are going to <br/>
fix that :).<br/>
<br/>
*SPOILER starts here*<br/>
<br/>
All wizard spells up to and including level 20 can be found somewhere in <br/>
erudin. If you cant find it in the wizard guild or the palace or the library <br/>
try looking in the temples around the palace and other places inside the <br/>
erudin city.<br/>
I have also seen ALL our DD spells up to and including level 44 in Erudin <br/>
and most of our AE spells up to and including level 49 (some in between <br/>
where missing i think ... i just briefly looked at them since i couldnt <br/>
afford them anyway ... but the level 49 AE spell was there).<br/>
<br/>
*SPOILER end*<br/>
<br/>
Well i hope this helps people who want to be helped and that Verant soon <br/>
will remove these spells and make them research only (if they load more <br/>
runes).<br/>
