<div id="ygrps-yiv-933010820">Yes the Magician (as stated by Verant) is supposed to be the second most<br/>
powerful DD caster in the game (second only to the wizard of course).  But<br/>
as noted by the fellow below, they only get DD spells every other circle<br/>
whereas we get them each circle.  So at level 8 both me and my magician<br/>
friend did almost the same damage (I think his shock spell did 31 while mine<br/>
did 36 and his bolt spell did 40 where mine did 45 for the same mana cost).<br/>
BUT...  At level 12 he is still using his old DD spells for 35 and 44<br/>
damage, where I have a new spell that does 78.  By level 15 he will STILL be<br/>
using his level 8 DD spells for 35 and 44 damage, while my lightning will do<br/>
81.  <br/>
<br/>
At level 16 he will get a new DD shock spell (the same one which we wizards<br/>
get) which will bring him again close to the damage that we do (lower by 13<br/>
points though).  Something to keep in mind is that at level 16 we also get a<br/>
DD bolt spell that the magicians do not get, lightning bolt, which starts at<br/>
118 damage or so (not sure exact figure), so compared to his 91 damage shock<br/>
spell we can still do almost 30 more damage.  And again keep in mind that at<br/>
level 23 he will still be using this level 16 spell while we will have<br/>
gotten a new and more powerful one at level 20.<br/>
<br/>
So all in all magicians at times come near (but not close) to the damage<br/>
that we can inflict, but most of the time they are quite far behind.  And it<br/>
of course makes sense seeing that they have a pet to protect them and do<br/>
damage.  We have only ourselves to rely on and I must say that I like it.<br/>

The Mage&#39;s 16th lvl spell is not as powerful as ours, but it is close.  They<br/>
start off at 91 dmg we start off with 104 dmg.  Also, they don&#39;t get another<br/>
DD spell until 24th, where as we get one at 20th and 24th.<br/>

&gt; During my adventures over the past weekend I happened to group with a<br/>
&gt; very nice magician and his pet &quot;Gonaker.&quot;  We did very well together<br/>
&gt; and had fun.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The problem was that he made claims that he can strike a target for DD<br/>
&gt; equal to mine.  We were both level 19 and sad thing is, I think he is<br/>
&gt; right!  Can anyone tell me how much mana is used and damage delivered<br/>
&gt; for the magician DD spell (16th level) equivelant to Fire Shock?  I<br/>
&gt; have a feeling it will be the same which is sad really.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Before I rant on my class I will need to know the truth on this matter.<br/>
&gt;  I love being a wizard and believe the long road to true power is a<br/>
&gt; long one.  But we should be doing more damage than a damn magician and<br/>
&gt; plus he gets a pet.  Let me know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
