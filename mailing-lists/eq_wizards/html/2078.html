&gt;Bah! But the necro has the pet that will last for almost 45 seconds. So<br/>
&gt;no damage taken by necro, and he can choose to run should it get close,<br/>
&gt;and most likely get away. All he lost is? Time, and 1 sp (bone chips)<br/>
&gt;Whereas wizard can&#39;t cast anymore as that 15 seconds got the mob right<br/>
&gt;on ya and pissed as all Plane of Hate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Plus, if wizards were balanced against all magi, and they are improving<br/>
&gt;other magi, then you have an unbalance starting. Also, it has been shown<br/>
&gt;that Verant hasn&#39;t spent much time balancing the higher levels. Who<br/>
&gt;knows whats going to happen?<br/>

&gt;&gt; Here are reply which i received from a     Geoffrey C. Zatkin<br/>
&gt;&gt; Arch-Magi of Norrath because i have mailed this first letter also to<br/>
&gt;&gt; verant<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Lets say we have possibility to petition for things which he commented<br/>
&gt;&gt; Probably i included a full comments<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; a.) better run from combat teleport spells - shadow step with<br/>
&gt;&gt; minimum range - faster gate - second bind point (in zone only) it can<br/>
&gt;&gt; be some type of faster gate for run from combat spells<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;     Probably won&#39;t happen.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; b.) Better exploration spells like invisible eye of zoom with longer<br/>
&gt;&gt; duration.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;     Probably won&#39;t happen.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Note: i see one post that if we get a longer duration eye of zoom we<br/>
&gt;&gt; will be in grade to explore dungeons without risk<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; c.) Item locator. As we are item hunters we can have a spell which<br/>
&gt;&gt; can function as ranger tracker for items in zone so we can see all<br/>
&gt;&gt; items in zone and we can turn in direction where item is !!<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;     Won&#39;t happen for sure.  Come on - if there is no risk...<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; d.) faster mana recovery then other classes - ( or by higher<br/>
&gt;&gt; meditation limit lets say (level +1) * 7 or by specific items wizard<br/>
&gt;&gt; only later in game) - why this you can ask. because in combat other<br/>
&gt;&gt; classes have a mana battery<br/>
&gt;&gt; which is a pet it can defend, attack and also sacrifice and many more<br/>
&gt;&gt; long duration buffing spells.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;     Won&#39;t happen.  Wizards are balanced against every other magic<br/>
&gt;&gt; class. Giving them more mana would remove 1 year worth of beta<br/>
&gt;&gt; testing.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; e.) one thing which is not wizard specific but influence us, is to<br/>
&gt;&gt; make a meditation more diversifying I wish to play a game not to stay<br/>
&gt;&gt; looking all time in same page or go in WC, kitchen when I meditate it<br/>
&gt;&gt; will be nice to have<br/>
&gt;&gt;  - internal email system<br/>
&gt;&gt;  - two chat windows so that I can access general all server chat same<br/>
&gt;&gt; one which we can go in from server screen in one window and to hear<br/>
&gt;&gt; what going on in game in other window<br/>
&gt;&gt; - in game class oriented mailing lists<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;     We probably will be adding something to Med to make it a bit more<br/>
&gt;&gt; enjoyable.  Up until the end of  Beta, you couldn&#39;t even talk or tell<br/>
&gt;&gt; in Med.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; - He is a weakest class in all Norath looking at hit points,  but he<br/>
&gt;&gt; is a major destructive power in game also.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;     Same hp as a Magician, Necromancer or Enchanter.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; - Wizard casts Direct Damage DD spells faster than anyone else and<br/>
&gt;&gt; with more force than anyone else. We as a class get a DD spell EVERY<br/>
&gt;&gt; level and we have a best mana damage ratio on them.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;     Yep.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; - Wizards have a experience diminution I don&#39;t know how much for<br/>
&gt;&gt; sure but it is near 10 - 15 %.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;     Ummm - no.  Wizards, Magicians, Necromancers and Enchanters all<br/>
&gt;&gt; get exactly the same xp gained from each fight, needed to level, etc.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; - Wizards are very weak at start and at lv 20 start to be traveler<br/>
&gt;&gt; and only at lv 34 + start to be a force in all ways from solo to group<br/>
&gt;&gt; play with all line of plane travel and group rescue spells. ( you see<br/>
&gt;&gt; that a spells go from a 5 (1 lv.)- 15 (4 lv) - 35 (8 lv)  80 (12 lv) -<br/>
&gt;&gt; 105 (16 lv) all times mana gives you cc. 5 shots before go out of mana<br/>
&gt;&gt; OOM when you go up in lv you get a some additional roots in)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;     All magi are weak at the start.  Nothing specific to Wizards.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; - Wizard combat definition is major damage in shortest time!<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; - Enchanter goes with more suptile tactic with pet, weaking enemy or<br/>
&gt;&gt; charming<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;     An Enchanter can weaken, but has a hard time doing damage.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;         - necromancer rely on his strong pet and Damage Over Time<br/>
&gt;&gt; spells DOT where he is a master this spells do in time much more<br/>
&gt;&gt; damage then DD spells of wizards but..)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;     True - over time, a necro does more.  For him to do the damage<br/>
&gt;&gt; that you do in 15 seconds, he would need 1 min.  Even if his mana to<br/>
&gt;&gt; damage ratio is better, do the math.  45 seconds less means that you<br/>
&gt;&gt; have 45 seconds less damage taken.  That is huge.  Wizards get quick<br/>
&gt;&gt; kills.  This makes them GREAT in a party or SOLO.<br/>
