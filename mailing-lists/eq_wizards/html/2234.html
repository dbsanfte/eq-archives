&gt;Hello all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have a 21st Lvl Dark Elf Wizard.  I&#39;ve fought many places with many<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I tend to get<br/>

 </span></blockquote>spell.  I&#39;ve noticed<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;that a lot of the time Force Shock is reisisted (grumble grumble).  Then it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is a toss up to enstill<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;them or &quot;nuke&quot; them again. Either way seems to work well and hopefully they<br/>
 </span></blockquote>are dead.  If they<br/>

 </span></blockquote>hits me I usually regain<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve found that it the best<br/>

&gt;Grouping can be hard for a wizard. There are not many tells, &quot;Looking for a<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;other class that asks gets a group.  But once in a group things can go<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well.  The main thing I have<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;noticed is when your party pulls something I can cast a DD 83 - 125 damage<br/>
 </span></blockquote>spell and the mob will<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;NOT turn and come to me.  It is always the first thing I do. I&#39;ll usually<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;that blast. As long as you hit the mob from time to time you will be fine.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But if you unload your mana like<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;a crazy manic your party will not beable to get the mob off you even with<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the most furious taunting skills.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;In a place like Cazic &#39;Thule I tend to use my level 12 and 16 spells<br/>
