<b>Subject:</b> Wizard and time efficent play? Re: [_EQ_Magic] Random magic duration do you like it? wizard looser? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1662159431">In my first post i don&#39;t explained it good so i try to explain it better. <br/>
I like to play a wizard as i play wizards in all games for more than 12<br/>
years now, but if we talk about balancing all magic users to same lv then i<br/>
see some problems with  a wizard class, i wish to see your comments on this<br/>
and other ideas to make a game more playable without throwing a balance out<br/>
or tring to make a overpowerfull class.<br/>
<br/>
First positive things<br/>
<br/>
-  wizards are great for plane(after 34+ lv), group travel (druid is best<br/>
in individual and nearly as good in group)<br/>
-  wizards are best in DD damage spells (but not in damage to mana ratio DOT)<br/>
-  wizards spells are less resisted and it damage at last for one part<br/>
moust other class spells are resisted full<br/>
-  wizard is fastest to deal a massive damage in shortest time (but a price?)<br/>
<br/>
Negativ things<br/>
<br/>
- Wizards have lowest defence, hit points and ac of all classes (lowest<br/>
combat survivel)<br/>
- wizard spells do massive damage but also use masive mana but when wizard<br/>
uses it mana it is useless. 	Fighting is not a wizard strong side, wizard<br/>
dont have pets, dont have buffs, dont heal, they dont run well.<br/>
- Wizards risks very very much in combat agains only 2 blues<br/>
<br/>
First i don&#39;t wish to say that a wizard is not good or playable class it is<br/>
nice but it is also a class with most downtime of all clases so as a result<br/>
a 2 equaly expert people playing sametime will never get equal play time,<br/>
wizard will most time be in his book. Why this hmm lets see<br/>
<br/>
All other Magic users have better mana usage then wizard, why pet is a best<br/>
mana use it damages, it defend, it tount and it never expires until it dies<br/>
( i personaly dont like this pets i wish to have a cat or dog od mouse :-)<br/>
not for combat but as familiar ) . Buffs as result do more damage and DOT<br/>
spells are much more mana efficent then our DD spells. <br/>
<br/>
So what can be done to make a wizard a time efficent to play as other<br/>
classes are. I suggest a faster mana recovering ratio not too much but a<br/>
1.3 or 1.2 faster times can help and its easy to implement one number<br/>
change in formula and go go go.<br/>
<br/>
Here i dont put in effect of specialization as for now it is not in game (<br/>
long beta ) and i dont know if in later levels exist any only wizard mana<br/>
regeneration booster but i heared of &quot;mana stone&quot; but noone knows what it<br/>
is and when you find it. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks all for reading and as i live in italy my english is not maxed yet,<br/>
but i please you to join a discussion and to not take to hard my spelling<br/>
mistakes. <br/>

&gt;for Necromancers.  If I had to do it all over again I would definitely  <br/>
&gt;play one.  Personally I think the ranking is necromancer, enchanter,  <br/>
&gt;magician, and then wizard last.   <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Necro&#39;s rate number one because they get a pet, can do good damage, can  <br/>
&gt;heal themselves and others, can do dark pact.<br/>
&gt;Enchanters rate number two because they are almost a complete hybrid  <br/>
&gt;between magician and wizard.  Plus they can make magic items.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Magicians are number three because they can do decent damage and get a  <br/>
&gt;really good pet series.<br/>
&gt;Wizards in my opinion aren&#39;t that great.  They do some more damage with  <br/>
&gt;their spells then the other classes but not that much more.  In my  <br/>
&gt;opinion their inability to have a pet really hampers them.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;thats not really true- i believe most people dont group with necros  <br/>
&gt;because  <br/>
&gt;they arent really aware of what they can do.  with our dot spells we  <br/>
&gt;can  <br/>
&gt;actually do the most damage to a creature, although it isnt as  <br/>
&gt;impressive as  <br/>
&gt;a wizard hitting with one spell for 50 damage or whatever; but if i can  <br/>
&gt;cast  <br/>
&gt;three dot spells on a creature at the beginning of the fight, that is  <br/>
&gt;some  <br/>
&gt;tough damage.  the problem is that its effects are mostly unseen, so  <br/>
&gt;people  <br/>
&gt;dont give it credit.  also, necros have some pretty versatile spells,  <br/>
&gt;such  <br/>
&gt;as dark empathy (healing), dark pact series (gives us more mana- good  <br/>
&gt;for  <br/>
&gt;extended fights), and such.  we also get many spells that cannot be  <br/>
&gt;resisted.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;belphenor<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;ps. with a pet, i have killed 3 skels by myself.  it was close tho, but  <br/>
&gt;my  <br/>
&gt;mana supply was good to kill 2 skels with ward, and i helped my pet  <br/>
&gt;beat the  <br/>
&gt;last.<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;i have not heard anyone necro who can solo 3-4 blues AT THE SAME  <br/>
&gt;TIME...w/<br/>
&gt;&gt;ward undead , i can keep soloing 3 blue skelly until i have to  <br/>
&gt;meditate but<br/>
&gt;&gt;never the same time. Past level 15 and blue creature generally hit you  <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;&gt;25-40 dmg+, and there is no way u can take 3-4 blues cuz ur spell will  <br/>
&gt;keep<br/>
&gt;&gt;getting interrupted and u aren&#39;t gonna survive giving the puny hp a  <br/>
&gt;necro<br/>
&gt;&gt;has( of course we know wizard has the least hp in the game).<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;IMO, at later levels, necro will has a hard time becuz grouping will  <br/>
&gt;shine.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Wizard is sough after by everyone but nobody wants a necro in their  <br/>
&gt;group<br/>
&gt;&gt;becuz necros aren&#39;t really that useful .<br/>

&gt;&gt;�D�(r): [_EQ_Magic] Random magic duration do you like it? wizard  <br/>
&gt;looser?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;From: Wizard &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:wizard@...">wizard@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;One big everquest problem is too much random effects, in magic it is  <br/>
&gt;&gt;realy<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;deadly Verant aplied a random duration and effects in many things.  <br/>
&gt;Lets  <br/>
&gt;&gt;say<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;for example spell SHADOW STEP and FADE hmm it teleports you in random<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;direction and random way from a casting place. It teleports you in  <br/>
&gt;lower<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;position so you can finish under water. But it is magic user last  <br/>
&gt;defence<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;when something comes in his directionhe can cast this and take at  <br/>
&gt;last a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;fast stert running from enemy but .. as you cast it you have realy  <br/>
&gt;nice<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;probability to A. dont move at all b. teleport near your enemy and  <br/>
&gt;util  <br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;you<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;understand where are you many times is too late.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Second example is INVISIBILITY hmmm duration is random thing and you  <br/>
&gt;&gt;never<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;know how long it will stay you can find yourself in half of enemies  <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;death.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Maybe i miss something but i used a shadow step for some time now  <br/>
&gt;and  <br/>
&gt;&gt;after<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;i died some times becouse it not function and it teleports me 1 step  <br/>
&gt;from  <br/>
&gt;&gt;a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;place where i was before and until you get oriented where are you  <br/>
&gt;end a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;monsters are all over you.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;my suggestion is to make a shadow step with at last some minimum  <br/>
&gt;radius  <br/>
&gt;&gt;and<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;second to put a limitation in lets say 40 grades from a point of  <br/>
&gt;view.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;do you have other problems with too much inprevedible random efects  <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;&gt;game?<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Wizard looser?<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;From all classes a wizards have worst mana use as i see it no buffs  <br/>
&gt;but<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;strong damage but also too much mana used for this DD. Look at pets  <br/>
&gt;they<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;can stay as long as you wish around and all time do damage and serve  <br/>
&gt;as a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;shield. i heared of many magician and enchanters not to talk about<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;necromancers wich can alone take 3 or 4 blue monsters some of them  <br/>
&gt;can  <br/>
&gt;&gt;take<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;also on a yellow alone. as a wizard i never know of any who can take  <br/>
&gt;3<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;blues alone after a 12 lv. In a group you must all time meditate for  <br/>
&gt;mana<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;all other have much longer battle use before remain OOM. If a group  <br/>
&gt;fight<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;red then a lower resistance of wizard spells can be used but after  <br/>
&gt;hard<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;fight as persons with more mana then others wizards take a too long  <br/>
&gt;time<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;meditating and all others will be ready to fight another battle  <br/>
&gt;before a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;wizard. I hope that a specialiation will help and i heared of items  <br/>
&gt;wich<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;help mana regeneration wich are wizard specific.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Please help me to explain why a wizards are not a worst mage class?<br/>
