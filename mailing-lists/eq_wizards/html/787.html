<div id="ygrps-yiv-395019391">I don&#39;t know about spell research, but I find meditate excellent for regaining mana quickly.  I think I trained in at once and since then I have been increasing in skill by simply meditating after battle.  The better you get, the faster you can regain mana - and mana is all we got!<br/>

    Subject: [eq_wizards] training points and spell research<br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I&#39;m currently level 6 and have only used one of my training points to train in meditation. I assume that once I hit a certain level I&#39;ll realize what&#39;s lacking and then train alot in that, but any suggestions would be helpful. I was also saving up for spell research. Is spell research a skill that goes up quickly? Also, what does raising the spell research skill improve? All help is appreciated. Thanks, Lott.</div>
