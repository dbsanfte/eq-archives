<div id="ygrps-yiv-51819584">Hello all.  As welcomes seem to be the order of the day, I will add mine =<br/>
to the list.  I am Shadowwalker, High Elf Wizard on the Karana server, =<br/>
currently at level 11.  I have been spending time around the Steamfont =<br/>
Mino cave with my guild, though we recently went exploring a bit in =<br/>
Dagnot&#39;s Cauldron, which is intimidating to say the least.  Really neat =<br/>
looking though.  We also spend time in Butcherblock and Lesser Faydark =<br/>
occationally as well.<br/>
<br/>
I do have a question in case someone here knows.  Does anyone know of =<br/>
quests in Faydwer that can be taken on, besides the wolf pelt one?<br/>
