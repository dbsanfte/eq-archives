<div id="ygrps-yiv-578527662">Have you noticed how all the spell casters have been visually screwed?<br/>
Only robes, and that&#39;s it. You look like your grandma in her bathrobe.<br/>
Oh well, I can live with that. What really annoyed me was that the Skull<br/>
of Jhen&#39;Tra doesn&#39;t show up in our hands! There are many types of skull<br/>
pictures in the game, even a staff with a skull! So why when I hold my<br/>
skull does it look like a bag of s***?<br/>
<br/>
Add that to the complaints list, if you don&#39;t mind.<br/>
