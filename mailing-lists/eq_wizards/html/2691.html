&gt; actually, it only takes about 3-5 kills to be KOS in ur own home town<br/>

one dark elf, and can no longer go in the neriak bank because the guard is<br/>
KOS to him in there now (WOW! 1 kill i asked him...  he said &quot;yep&quot;).<br/>

don&#39;t push ur opinions and style of play on others...  many others want to<br/>
kill everything in site...  even when roleplaying (think of the evil dark<br/>
elf who doesn&#39;t even like his brethren or the mad ogre who thinks other<br/>
ogres are traders because they befriend the dark elves).<br/>

<br/>
Sinlaru, the problem here is that whatever style Verant chooses ultimately<br/>
effects all players.  You can&#39;t have your way without affecting me, and I<br/>
can&#39;t have mine without affecting you.  Let&#39;s consider your argument:<br/>
<br/>
You speak of role playing mad ogres and anti social elves?  Can we play<br/>
them?  Certainly.  Should they be tolerated by their own races?  There is<br/>
nothing even remotely realistic about butchering your own people, regardless<br/>
of alignment, and getting away with it.  So do it and be KOS in your own<br/>
city.  That&#39;s role-playing.  Anything else is mindless nonsense.  Being evil<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean being stupid.<br/>
<br/>
On a related subject, people have also argued that duels shouldn&#39;t result in<br/>
faction hits.  Stop and think for a moment how many societies you can name<br/>
that smiled on dueling.  In western culture, it has generally been an<br/>
illegal (but sometimes tolerated) practice limited to aristocracy.  You<br/>
often risked execution if caught.<br/>
<br/>
What I would agree with you on is that the faction system is far too<br/>
simplistic.  Dueling ought to raise your faction with the enemies of your<br/>
antagonist, and with certain others within your own group who favor that<br/>
sort of behavior.  General militia ought to hate duels, and elite guards (in<br/>
some societies) ought to favor it.  But, personally, I think that faction<br/>
ideally should be an order of magnitude more complex than even this.  Did<br/>
you power game to level 15 attacking low blues?  Then perhaps you&#39;ve earned<br/>
the respect of conservative factions, but those who consider themselves true<br/>
warriors ought to scoff at you.  Did you always throw yourself into battle,<br/>
taking massive damage, on your march up through the levels?  Then maybe you<br/>
are adored by the plebes and chum with the guards, but the rest of the world<br/>
considers you an idiot.  And, of course, in duels, the assailant ought to<br/>
incur the brunt of the faction adjustment.  And, also, if no one sees it and<br/>
no rumor gets out, it didn&#39;t happen, etc.  Very tricky thing to implement<br/>
correctly.<br/>
<br/>
The ideal is ultimately very simple.  NPC&#39;s should treat you--based on your<br/>
behavior--just like a PC would of similar station.  Here&#39;s an example for<br/>
you to chew on.<br/>
<br/>
The other day in S. Karanas, a PvP player assisted in an attack on Grimrot.<br/>
At the end of the fight when everyone was healing, another PvP player came<br/>
in and attacked, without warning, eventually killing the PvP player.  Many<br/>
non-PvP players were upset because they couldn&#39;t do anything to help and<br/>
simply had to watch their comrade die.<br/>
<br/>
You think the PvP assailant lost &quot;faction&quot; with the PCs?  You bet.  Should<br/>
he therefore have lost it with certain NPCs?  Of course.<br/>
<br/>
There are problems with faction right now.  And of course that&#39;s why Verant<br/>
announced that they had eliminated faction hits on PvP kills as of yesterday<br/>
and are working on a more elaborate system, including (possibly) an<br/>
aggressor flag.<br/>
<br/>
The thing you need to keep in mind is that many of us non-PvP players would<br/>
love to play PvP if the system were set up with realistic consequences.<br/>
Why?  Because we like to role play and the non-PvP system makes it very<br/>
difficult to do so under certain situations.  Persistent kill stealing, for<br/>
instance, and severe twinking of characters (you know, the 4th lvl wizard<br/>
with observer&#39;s staff and oracle&#39;s robes?) are not things that could persist<br/>
in a realistic gaming environment.  But to argue for a system of no faction<br/>
hit on PvP kill just encourages the mindless butchering of PCs in the so<br/>
called name of &quot;role-playing.&quot;  And it is something I will argue against<br/>
anytime someone advocates it.<br/>
