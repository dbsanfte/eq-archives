<div id="ygrps-yiv-1817012887">Well, spell reaserch lets you combine components to make spells.  The higher your skill the more likely you are to succeed in this combination.  If you try and do it before you have even 1 point in the skill it will either take your materials and tell you that you&#39;ve failed each time, or it will just tell you that you don&#39;t have the skill.<br/>

    I&#39;m wondering what the skill Spell Research is. I know what it does, but what is the skill, and what does raising the skill do? Also, what prevents me from conducting spell research at my current lvl 7 besides not being able to use the spells for awhile? Thanks for your help.<br/>
