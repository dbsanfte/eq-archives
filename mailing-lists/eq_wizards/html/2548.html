I don&#39;t know about you, but i have NEVER been kicked out of a group for<br/>
being<br/>
resisted.  mainly because i don&#39;t tell them i&#39;m resisted :).    Just cast ur<br/>
lvl<br/>
1 shock and since its only 6 dmg. the mob will NEVER (at least never for me)<br/>
come after you.  and your group can&#39;t tell the difference in the color of<br/>
the<br/>
spells since all of them look the same. they think ur casing some high lvl<br/>
shock<br/>
heehhe.<br/>
<br/>
Works fine for me so far, i sit there, no danger, no mana loss, and i get XP<br/>
and<br/>
follow their loot order just fine.  I made 50 plat and gained 2 lvl in 3<br/>
days<br/>
and died only once.  From the skeleton monk i mention in previous post.<br/>
When<br/>
group leader ask for mana status, just say what others say.  (ie. if cleric<br/>
says<br/>
20% mana, u say 15%)  that way  they don&#39;t think ur doing nothing hehe.<br/>
<br/>
its good trick and works well to keep our mind off how they block up at 6<br/>
lvl.<br/>
Since verant make us team up, i don&#39;t see much else we can do about it<br/>
except to<br/>
abuse the fact that others cannot see what we cast and what our mana is at<br/>
:)  [<br/>
maybe this is why they don&#39;t let others see?]<br/>

just<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then, in the middle of Unrest, you suddendly are ejected from the group. Ok,<br/>
time to Gate :(<br/>
