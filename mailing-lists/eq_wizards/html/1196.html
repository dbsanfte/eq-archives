<div id="ygrps-yiv-743773459">Hail fellow Wizards!<br/>
<br/>
I would like to inquire as to your preferences of melee weapon.  I am a<br/>
level 9 right now and am at the point where I am thinking about seeking a<br/>
magical weapon.  I am sure at higher levels I won&#39;t even want to get NEAR<br/>
the monster I am fighting to melee, but at this point I can still get some<br/>
decent damage and save mana finishing off creatures with melee.<br/>
<br/>
So as far as magic weapons go, what should I be setting my sights on and<br/>
what choices do i have available in the next couple levels?  Also, should I<br/>
in general try to use daggers (for speed but low damage), 2h blunt (for good<br/>
damage but low speed), or 1h blunt (holding a nice magic item in offhand --<br/>
like what?).  As much or as little info as ye have I would be grateful.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
