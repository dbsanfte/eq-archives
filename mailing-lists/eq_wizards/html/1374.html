<div id="ygrps-yiv-949231949">Heheh, good points ;)  Heres a few replies.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Not if the game made us use our mana almost completely in those shots...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I now see what you&#39;re saying here, but still have to disagree with yas.  If<br/>
we are in a group and take out a creature in say 2 shots, but use most of<br/>
our mana doing so, then the group has to wait for us to med before they see<br/>
any more action.  Not to mention it would make them feel kinda useless.  So,<br/>
lets say we only cast at it once, take half its life, let the group finish<br/>
it.  We still just lost half our mana and they will have to wait a bit for<br/>
us to med up again.  So, while your suggestion would make us great soloist,<br/>
if they didn&#39;t resist us, it would make us a little unpopular with some<br/>
groups.  Just my opinion of course ;)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Here I can honestly say I don&#39;t see your point,  If we casted faster<br/>
because<br/>
we are suppose to be the supreme casters and we casted too fast then that<br/>
would be on our head...  You disproved your own statement within your own<br/>
statement.  This would give us the ability to make that call ourselves.<br/>
(adding more strategy to the game for Wizards)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I do apologize for not making myself a little clearer.  We do cast faster<br/>
than other classes as far as our offensive spells are concerned.  But, not 2<br/>
times as fast as I believe you are suggesting.  And, if we cast too fast,<br/>
then yes, we can be in trouble, cuz the monster will most certainly will<br/>
come after you.  If I hit a monster 3 times in a row without pause, he&#39;s<br/>
coming after me and I had better be prepared or else.  So, the strategy is<br/>
already in place without having to speed up our casting even more.  I don&#39;t<br/>
believe there is any need to speed up our casting from what it already is.<br/>
Once again, just my opinion though ;)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I have researched them quite completely... I was talking a SMALL chance of<br/>
stun tacked on to our usual damage (like what force stun was suppose to do).<br/>
I know well about Tishna&#39;s Clash....(for the 2 seconds that it works) btw,<br/>
does it work every time? *thinks he knows this answer*&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Tishan&#39;s Clash has a variable timelimit on the stun, sometimes 2 secs,<br/>
sometimes 8 secs, ect.  And like every other spell we cast, there is always<br/>
that chance that the creature will resist it.  I have found though, that it<br/>
works quite well ;)  Besides, you said &quot;put stun CHANCES&quot; on spells, not<br/>
stun everytime. ;)  So, to answer your question, no it doesn&#39;t work EVERY<br/>
time, but it does work most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Then i&#39;m on the wrong side of the world... one blue G spider on the west k<br/>
plains and I must med....(level 10)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s your answer right there, lvl 10 ;)  I will be the first to agree<br/>
that at the lower lvls, we are definitely the weaker class compared to<br/>
others, but show me what game makes the wizard all powerful in the lower<br/>
lvls??  As someone mentioned in another post, it helps to separate the wheat<br/>
from the chaffe.  Not everyone is meant to be a wizard, but if you can stick<br/>
it out through the lower lvls, then you will reap great rewards at the<br/>
higher lvls.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;On the contrary, I have thought it out quite well. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I can see that you have and I apologize and retract my previous<br/>
statement, but once again, I think you came in expecting to start out a<br/>
powerful wizard when in reality, you have to grow into it.  I have a theory<br/>
on this, so bear with me.  Anyone can learn to swing a sword and become a<br/>
warrior, but not everyone can learn the discipline and have the mental<br/>
compacity to become a magic-user.  I think the reason its so hard at the<br/>
lower lvls, is because its like a test.  If you have the determination and<br/>
desire to perserver though the lower lvls, then you have what it takes to<br/>
become a great wizard in the higher lvls, but if you lose interest and<br/>
become bored with it, well, then being a wizard probably isn&#39;t for you and<br/>
you should look at taking up another occupation.  Again, just my opinion ;)<br/>
<br/>
Good post<br/>
