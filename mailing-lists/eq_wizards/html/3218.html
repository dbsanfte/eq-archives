<b>Subject:</b> Re: Stein of Moggok Bug <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-651127045">According to Gregory Egan:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Ok, has this happened to anyone else? I died and when I went to loot my corpse my Stein of Moggok had mutated into Chitin Shell Armor. Not quite an equitible trade. I petitioned a GM, who at least answered quickly, but his advice was to sell the armor for a new stein, as if they were of equal value. No other help or advice offered (surprise, surprise). Bought a new stein and sold armor for a loss of almost 200 pp. Anyway, is this a known bug? I will petition <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:EQbugs@...">EQbugs@...</a>, but don&#39;t expect help there either.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The mutating equipment bug has been there under one form or another for<br/>
ages. Usually, it happens when you get charmed or get linkdead in<br/>
bad situations.<br/>
<br/>
When you have to loot, you&#39;re screwed. When it mutates in your hands, DO NOT<br/>
unequip or anything else, petition immediately. The GM will see that this<br/>
is indeed the mutating bug, and restore the item. Otherwise, the GM cannot<br/>
distinguish (they DO NOT have the tools while on-line to look at the backups)<br/>
between a case of cheating (honest, I had a robe of oracle and it mutated into<br/>
this lousy cloth shirt) and a real bug, and act under the &quot;unless otherwise<br/>
proved innocent, you&#39;re guilty&quot; rule that befits a medieval mentality.<br/>
