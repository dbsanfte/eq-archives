<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548842073">According to Tyson Schoepflin:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He also seem to think that wizard having -almost- same damage/mana<br/>
&gt; efficiency as magiciant is quiet ok as long as our damage is dealt<br/>
&gt; slightly faster. This really bugs me. i see no purpose whatsoever in<br/>
&gt; myself doing a mob 1000 damage in 4 shots vs a magiciant doing it in<br/>
&gt; 5.With both of us having used the same mana spent. That is suppose to be<br/>
&gt; a big asset??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. They want us to be kill stealers. I can see it, written on the wall.<br/>
