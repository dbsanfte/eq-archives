&gt;Subject: runed totem?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I purchased a runed totem staff from somebody last night for 20pp.  I <br/>
&gt;was disappointed to find it was not the BIG staff I see some mages <br/>
&gt;carry around.  It looked no different from the cracked great staff <br/>
&gt;or fine steel great staff I was using.  The one I&#39;m looking for has <br/>
&gt;the crooked knot on top?  Anybody know what that staff is?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Don&#39;t get me wrong, the runed totem staff is great and I think I got a <br/>
&gt;fairly good deal.  But I&#39;ve been jealously looking at other cool mages <br/>
&gt;with this big staff in their hands.  I&#39;ve got a list of creatures I&#39;d <br/>
&gt;love to give a good WHACK on the backside to with this staff. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The staff your thinking of is a crook.<br/>
I haven&#39;t seen damage and speed factors for it.  I assume its probably<br/>
slower and for more damage than a standard Great Staff.  The really nice<br/>
Crook that people have been carrying around is the Glowing Wooden Crook<br/>
that can be found on Lockjaw in Oasis.  Level 20 Crocodile.  However this<br/>
particular crook is not usable by Enchanters, Mages, or Wizards.  Its only<br/>
usable by Druids, Shamen, Clerics and everyone else.  I am not sure if<br/>
wizards can use normal crooks, but this particular one they can not.<br/>
<br/>
In the upper teens and mid 20s the ruined totem is probably one of the<br/>
better staves to have.  Since it can hit magical creatures.  Very nice to<br/>
have if you want to take out a ghoul.  Root Nuke and if he is still alive<br/>
at least you can hit him without the ghoul being INVULNERABLE.  Same for<br/>
Air Elementals.<br/>
