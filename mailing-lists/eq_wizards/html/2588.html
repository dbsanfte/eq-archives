<div id="ygrps-yiv-1748909417">To get armour you must first hail her in name of her brother and then you<br/>
must have a faction with karana residens high ! Other thing to be careful<br/>
about is quality   of skeens what you give to her. Hmm anyone knows if she<br/>
accepts platinun or i can pay only with gold. It is anoying to have all<br/>
time all thet gold on you i have been there and as i have only plat i<br/>
midded ocasion to buy all armours. <br/>

&gt;I have tried to get bear hide belt and boots from Chandra Miller twice, but<br/>
&gt;she just takes my money and bear pelts, and says something like &quot;Oh thank<br/>
&gt;you, but I still need the other thing&quot;. Has anyone gotten the boots and<br/>
&gt;belt from her (I already have a polar bear cloak so don&#39;t need the bear<br/>
&gt;hide cloak)? Talking to her is not the problem, she tells me what she needs<br/>
&gt;to make the stuff. Thanks.<br/>
