<b>Subject:</b> large group observance fighting deep red mobs <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039105024">Just a small observance I made over the weekend after playing quite often in<br/>
a large group in Cazic TR.<br/>
<br/>
Our usual group consisted of a paladin, 2 clerics, a necro, an enchanter,<br/>
and me...  all in the 22-26 range (I was actually the highest at 26...<br/>
remember that as you read further).  Me, the necro, and enchanter stayed<br/>
back most of the time.  The two clerics and paladin would melee/heal<br/>
alternating.  We were a little short on tanks (could have replaced the necro<br/>
and been a little better off, but it worked out ok cause we had three<br/>
healers).  Anyway, we pulled lots of defenders and sents and protectors<br/>
(most in the 22 to 27 range), and we pretty much cleaned them up pretty<br/>
quickly.  But then, our puller decided we needed something tougher (and<br/>
rightfully so, as we should be fighting 30ish mobs with 6 of us).  So he<br/>
started pulling zealots and justicators.  Well, these things conned pretty<br/>
much deep red every time (4, maybe 5 lvls higher than me), and we took a<br/>
pretty good beating most of the time (nobody died except for the necro<br/>
once).  But the main point of this msg is to say that most of the time, I<br/>
was useless in these tougher battles.  How can I go from being one of the<br/>
most important members (well, we were all important, I just felt like I was<br/>
helping the entire group one way or another with my auto-taunt *frost<br/>
shock*, stun, and enstill) of the group when fighting defenders and sents,<br/>
to being totally useless when fighting the zealots and justicators???  Well,<br/>
there was one fight with a zealot where it resisted 2 frost shocks, 3<br/>
tishans, 1 enstill, and 1 flame shock (the flame shock was a last ditch<br/>
effort to try something different)...  Not one single spell went through.<br/>
And same goes for the justicator...  Funny thing is, the mobs reacted like<br/>
they went through for full dmg!!!  That really sucked, because even though I<br/>
cast two frost shocks without a bit of dmg, the mob comes running after me.<br/>
I don&#39;t normally complain about our class, because I&#39;m very happy with what<br/>
we have, but it was really embarrassing half way through the night when I<br/>
had to tell our tank to quit pulling the tough stuff.  He told me that the<br/>
other stuff was just too weak, and that there just weren&#39;t enough of the<br/>
weak stuff to pull to continue getting good exp.  So, I pretty much was<br/>
useless many of the fights.  I would do group tells during the fights asking<br/>
if the enchanter had done his thing to the mob (lower resist), and he would<br/>
tell back &quot;yes, yes, yes&quot;.  I finally quit asking.  He was doing his job.<br/>
And my spells just weren&#39;t going through... And everybody else&#39;s spell were<br/>
going through part of the time  (yeah, it&#39;s well known that we have<br/>
something like a 6-lvl cap on some of our spells, but I don&#39;t think we<br/>
fought any mobs lvl 32+, maybe a zealot here and there, but other members<br/>
were casting just fine most of the time).<br/>
<br/>
Just an observation.  A very sad and unpleasant observation...<br/>

ps. any of you high lvls out there that can tell me it going to be different<br/>
later on, or that we just aren&#39;t going to be effective in large groups<br/>
because of the tougher stuff that they pull, please respond.<br/>
<br/>
pss. nvr got the templar. man, it was a mad rush for him every time he<br/>
spawned...  hehe. and there was some pretty good fights after he died too :)</div>
