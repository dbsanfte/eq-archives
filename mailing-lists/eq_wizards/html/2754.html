<div id="ygrps-yiv-862737428">I agree with you in many things, if i think that you are a little to hard<br/>
in some points to wizards it is mainly as other classes have strong Direct<br/>
Damage DD spells but are not so mana efficent and dont cast so fast, you<br/>
cannot look only at damage done our main caracteristics are that we deal<br/>
most damage in unit of time. It is also a dangerus task if you miss and<br/>
burn one second before time, you die. <br/>
<br/>
Our role as a major damage dealer is rapidly changing with last patchs<br/>
where other Damage Over Time DOT spells have halved time and  doubled<br/>
damage done in unit of time. This spells are much more mana efficents then<br/>
our DD.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion on wizard class many of you have already read but to make it<br/>
short i like it and i play it but it needs many improvments to regain a<br/>
playebility wich have other classes it WAS one of balanced classes but is<br/>
now worst of all int casting classes.<br/>
<br/>
- It is starting INTELIGENCE casting class and it remain mostly unchanged<br/>
in patches and main problem is monotony of play, look at group health bar,<br/>
root, burn, meditate, meditate and again meditate. <br/>
<br/>
- We are only casting class wich is useles once we used all mana all other<br/>
classes have long lasting buffs, pets, items. and all this work when a<br/>
caster is Out Of Mana OOM.<br/>
<br/>
- We are most feared and potencialy unbalancing group as we can deal damage<br/>
faster than any other class so we are from Verant side looked as a thing to<br/>
leave in pace. They think that it is beter to leave us underpowered then to<br/>
have wizards rampaging around. <br/>
<br/>
- Many low lv players (what is majority now) have seen a wizard steal a<br/>
kill, or gate around and think we are too powerfull, they dont know or<br/>
understand a weaknas of wizards. This also have e great side that many wish<br/>
to have a powerfull wizard in group eheheheheh only becouse they dont know<br/>
a truth.<br/>
<br/>
- wizard is simple to play burn, med, root for solo and not too much<br/>
diferent in group play so many people who find a two of 3 possible tactics<br/>
think that wizard is a great class until they get a new spells. or some<br/>
belive in a wizard is weak at start and at end ... (sucks more then rest)<br/>
<br/>
- and we are great for group fighting a group of blue MOBs (dont even thing<br/>
to fight a red at higer levels  but  at high levels we are underpowered so<br/>
that we dont unbalance a game,  fast created patchs that dont work well<br/>
like ice comet spell, or hiden spells what you can hear that somone think<br/>
thay exist.<br/>
<br/>
In last patches there is a 2 important things as i see one is a root spell<br/>
change i dont understand whet they say about it but as wizards are main<br/>
rooters in game this affect us more than any other class and there is also<br/>
new 39 lv spell wich i think is ultravision but im not shure for now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
p.s. in nearly all major games table or computer a high elfs are kings of<br/>
magic waht a hell verant wish to introduce a erudites they are god only as<br/>
a necro race! hmmmm i have one idea :)<br/>

&gt;&gt;i just read the new patch message.. Damn.... From the<br/>
&gt;begining, nothing as been change for the wizzards... They just change <br/>
&gt; &gt;during<br/>
&gt;the patch , the casting time . I have tested BEFORE and after : no &gt;change<br/>
&gt;(that a clock can see, so it s surely a change of let s say 0,001 &gt;second or<br/>
&gt;something like that.In other words : nothing.<br/>
&gt;&gt;All patch just power up the race... Now the druid dot spel are fast like<br/>
&gt;&gt;hell, necro same. And us ?? From the beginning, we have major bug who are<br/>
&gt;&gt;not resolved and they do nothing for us...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hey hey, don&#39;t worry about it.  I&#39;ve been playing both a Shaman & Druid to <br/>
&gt;get a feel for it, but nothing compares to a Wizard.  I&#39;m thinking of <br/>
&gt;dropping my Druid character because she just plain sucks. Druids are good <br/>
&gt;solo and group characters up to about 20level, then that&#39;s it.  All my high <br/>
&gt;45+ level friends tell me they never invite Druids in their parties <br/>
&gt;anymore...but Wizards are ALWAYS welcome.<br/>
&gt;At high levels, a Druid will not have good enough armor to tank...so they <br/>
&gt;essentially become weak Wizards.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;By that time, a Wizard of equal level will have strong shields and DD <br/>
&gt;spells, AND all the teleport spells of a Druid.  So what about a Druid&#39;s DOT<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;spells, you can&#39;t kite Lady Voxx.  :)  (or can you? hehe)<br/>
&gt;Nor will a Druid&#39;s heal spells be worthy of a Cleric.  So why have them?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The grass always looks greener somewhere else, but trust me....other <br/>
&gt;characters are envious of a Wizard&#39;s spells as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We *maybe* need to be tweaked here and there...but stop comparing us to <br/>
&gt;other characters.  It will get us nowhere.  We have a few 50Level Wizards on<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;our server that have demonstrated the effectiveness of our spells.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am not sure you know how weak we are.... You tell about dd ? ok. Do you<br/>
&gt;know that your best spel at level 50 only does 625 dommage ???? And that the<br/>
&gt;best dd spel for DRUID is 615 (and they buy it IN A FUCKING SHOP)????<br/>
&gt;Magician get a BOLT who deal 900 dommage at level 49 (AND THEY BUY IT TOO IN<br/>
&gt;A FUCKING SHOP!)... ok it s a bolt so dificult to cast by WTF we must have<br/>
&gt;the best dd spel no ????? With nearly the same mana/ratio.... Don t speak<br/>
&gt;about ice comet, you never never will have it (unless you have 40 friend<br/>
&gt;level 50 and who are ready to spare it with you...)... And oh yes : you best<br/>
&gt;dd spel is fire based so you can NOT hit fire giant (nothing in solusek b in<br/>
&gt;fact)and nagafen (who is one of the mob carrying the rune). So you use you<br/>
&gt;level 39 sple at level 50.. that s pretty cool no ?  At level 34 you have a<br/>
&gt;dd of 315 .. cool the magician have a bolt who deal 345 at 34 ...... So i am<br/>
&gt;sure you realise how weak we are right now :). People ask us to group ? Yes<br/>
&gt;cause they THINK we are the best dd caster... And it s not true at level 23<br/>
&gt;you use a stupid level 16 spel. From 24 to 29 we are the best dd caster yep.<br/>
&gt;But from 34 to the end, no way we are nothing. I have one friend who is<br/>
&gt;level 50 dark elfe on karana (menahemen a french speaking guy coming from<br/>
&gt;suisse). He just stop playing at level 50 not because he don t like his<br/>
&gt;wizzard cause he was really bored about what verant does to us (i mean we<br/>
&gt;are undepowere dlike hell so we don t hit the major mob of the game as<br/>
&gt;nagafen and lady vox :( ). Some of you may (again) tell me : ohh stop<br/>
&gt;spaming, just play another classe if you don t like this one, we are fine<br/>
&gt;with it... Ok wait till high level and we will see.. So np continue play but<br/>
&gt;never never hope to be (not the strongest) a regular class... Just hope to<br/>
&gt;become the weakest class in the game but some like it ! (as i do :) )<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;yakos <br/>
&gt;level 26 wizzard karana<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;p.s. a druid is 15 times more useful then me in a group.... People just don<br/>
&gt;t know we are so weak.... <br/>
