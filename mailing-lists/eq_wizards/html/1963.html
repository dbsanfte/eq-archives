<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691610584">The rumor is that bloodstone rings double the healing rate for Warriors and <br/>
warriors only, since they are the PURE melee class... Well we are the PURE <br/>
magic class. We&#39;re the only ones that basically have no melee skills or no <br/>
pet to melee for us. Maybe a faster mana regen could be put in, but I like <br/>
the meditation idea better.<br/>

 of healing at high levels! &gt;&gt;</div>
