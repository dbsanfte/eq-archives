<div id="ygrps-yiv-897708720">According to Alan Charity:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yes a +10 INT staff is fine but its 10/100 so unless I get an enchanter to<br/>
&gt; cast haste on me its not much use in combat. I currently have a Writhing<br/>
&gt; Staff and would only use a Tarton Staff if I needed the extra Mana.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At the levels you should have the Tarton Wheel Staff, you should rarely,<br/>
if ever, go in melee. And if you do, that&#39;s because you have two or three<br/>
tanks bashing a creature into pulp, and the damage from any staff a caster<br/>
wield will be negligible.<br/>
<br/>
Treat the staff as a kind of book of silver runes. It&#39;s in your main hand,<br/>
but does not serve as a combat.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also the groups I&#39;ve been in lately in Cazic and Mistmoore do not require<br/>
&gt; that I expend large amounts of mana. Most groups consisted of a Cleric,<br/>
&gt; Enchanter, Shaman and 2 tanks. Also most if not all of my spells were<br/>
&gt; resisted by the Red MOBs they were pulling. I spend most of my time casting<br/>
&gt; some low damage spells that don&#39;t get resisted, try to get a root to hold<br/>
&gt; and take a few whacks with my staff.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then you are not employed efficiently. That&#39;s bad. I understand the lure of<br/>
pulling red mobs for quick burst of experience, but I still think that a<br/>
steady stream of blues/light yellows can bring in as much experience as the<br/>
single red, followed by a longer pause, and is a lot safer.<br/>
<br/>
When you join people pulling reds, be sure you are at the top of the<br/>
experience range. But, if they are willing to have you along for the ride...<br/>
why not :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The Enchanter we had in our group saved the lives of the party more times<br/>
&gt; than I can remember. We&#39;d pull too many or get sideswiped by a train and<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Never underestimate an enchanter. I&#39;ve been grouping with an enchanter<br/>
that routinely &quot;play with the food&quot; (as he says), and the enchanter makes or<br/>
break the group. One group I&#39;ve seen has a shaman, druid and enchanter (plus<br/>
me as wizard). No tank. Why use tanks, where you root all mobs on the spot,<br/>
then play the DOT/DD song before they can break it.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we&#39;re not hunting deep reds. But the short duration of a root doesn&#39;t<br/>
matter then.<br/>
