<div id="ygrps-yiv-593583542">was wandering around that island the other day and only the guardian was<br/>
there.  He conned blue to me and I considered playing with him &lt;G&gt;  Was<br/>
told that he gives you a serious faction hit.  Anyone know what that is?<br/>

&gt; Well, to help you out the robes are obtained by killing the Oracle. He&#39;s on an island straight ahead and to the right of the sisters island if you&#39;re facing the ocean on the dock.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, his 40th lvl paladin buddy might have something to say about you beating on his pal. Take a group to whomp on them. P.S. this is the same island with the goblins.<br/>
