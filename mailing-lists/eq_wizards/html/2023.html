<b>Subject:</b> Wizards Magic Resistance - a change ....` <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937103701">I think almost EVERY wizard on this board has ran into this situation<br/>
<br/>
- you are in a full group<br/>
- you want to take on a &quot;big red&quot;<br/>
- you sheeply say &quot; ... sorry guys I cant fight that &quot;<br/>
<br/>
.. as you disband your group and wander off for a group killing blue-yellows<br/>
... or sit back and watch your group get smacked down and sucking up exp.<br/>
<br/>
It is rather depressing, almost every other class can help in some way<br/>
<br/>
- Rouges can backstab and melee<br/>
- Warriros can soak up damae and hit it with melee and taunt<br/>
- Enchanters can buff the warriors<br/>
- Druids can heal and melee<br/>
- Clerics can heal<br/>
- Necros get no-resist spells<br/>
- SKs can HT (resistant at times), tank and melee<br/>
- Monks can melee<br/>
- Rangers can melee buff and to a lesser extent heal, asell as tank<br/>
- Shamans can melee and buff and heal<br/>
- Paladins can tank heal and have LOH when things get ugly<br/>
- Bards can melee and keep the group &quot;buffed&quot; up, increase healing rate and<br/>
all other sorts of nifty effcts<br/>
- Wizards can sit back suck up EXP and cast a cruddy lvl 4 damage shield<br/>
that does 2 damage<br/>
<br/>
.. So basicly everyone is usefull in &quot;deep red fights&quot; in one way or another<br/>
except wizards. At low lvls you can jump in there and whack it with your<br/>
staff for a bit, but when a mob starts hitting for 60-70+ damage you DO NOT<br/>
want to be in melee range.<br/>
<br/>
So here is my idea. It could apply to all magic casters, but would be nice<br/>
if it was a wizard-only type thing. Seeing how lvl 20 - 23 is a pretty much<br/>
crap lvl. Due to unreliable spells etc, for every 3 lvls you gain, you gain<br/>
1 lvl that you can cast on. For example<br/>
<br/>
- at lvl 19, you can cast on mobs upto 6 lvls above you (normal)<br/>
- at lvl 20, you can cast on mobs upto 7 lvls above you<br/>
- at lvl 23, you can cast on mobs upto 8 lvls above you<br/>
- at lvl 26, you can cast on mobs upto 9 lvls above you<br/>
- at lvl 29, you can cast on mobs upto 10 lvls above you<br/>
<br/>
.. and so on and so on.. Sure, this will not help much pre-lvl 20. While<br/>
sitting in unrest you will still be saying &quot;Sorry guys, I cant cast on that<br/>
carrion ghoul&quot;, but at lvl 20 it could start to be the rise of &quot; the masters<br/>
of damage &quot;, and make you much more usefull in groups doing deep reds. I<br/>
know during my EQ life ( 1 buble from lvl 29 ) I still find my self in the<br/>
&quot;Sorry I cant cast on that guys&quot; situation, and it gets worse.<br/>
<br/>
For example one day I was fighting in Cazic, I was lvl 25 or 26, and my<br/>
friend was lvl 30ish, and we were pulling from the maze, which was still<br/>
good exp for me at the time,. but he was getting very little exp. And he is<br/>
like &quot;Hey, do you want to go do gators?&quot;, since that is what gave him good<br/>
exp. But from my previous exp with gators in Cazic (casting on the odd one<br/>
in trains, etc) they still resisted me alot. So I said &quot;sorry, cant&quot;... so<br/>
he basicly left the group and ditched me, since he could no longer get good<br/>
exp fighting with me, and I could not damage the things that he would of<br/>
been fighting.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, comments on the idea?</div>
