 </span></blockquote>What exactly is so bad about it? How ever easy or hard it is on her, has<br/>
no effect on you, so why don&#39;t you just mind your own business and stop<br/>
being so uptight. She&#39;s done nothing that brakes the rules or bothers<br/>
other players in any way.<br/>
<br/>
The only bother, is pure green jealousy, isn&#39;t it? You&#39;re just upset<br/>
that she gets an advantage you didn&#39;t, right? Well, life is tough like<br/>
that. Whether she gets an advantage or not, is none of your business<br/>
because it doesn&#39;t really affect you. And remember, she had to work her<br/>
way to level 22 before that as well, so she is only giving her other<br/>
Char something she rightfully earned.<br/>
<br/>
Just concentrate on your own character and stop being a jerk about it.<br/>
