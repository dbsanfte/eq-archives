<div id="ygrps-yiv-90891764">its easy to get to But I fell its not that good xp cause hes a slow spawn <br/>
always camped and quick kill.  Therfore you kill him with half mana,   Little <br/>
xp,   And you have to wait 7 mintues for him to spawn again.  Sometimes if <br/>
you find a group of 4 you can pull from cave and tis great.   Your better off <br/>
doing gaurds or soemthing imo.<br/>
