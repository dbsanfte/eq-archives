    Hmmm, why do you go through all that hassle?  I walk through Freeport myself.  I haven&#39;t had any problems there.  Unless it has something to do with necs or sks, I can&#39;t imagine why... I suppose if ya spent a lot of time whacking the guards down it might matter, but apparently my faction is fine and I can zip right through town with no problems whatsoever.<br/>
    I haven&#39;t done any special faction bumping.. no quests, no killing any one type of monster to raise my faction with the Freeport residents either... <br/>

        i don&#39;t know about faydark but to get onto the boat in free port is pretty tricky... until you find the magic secret. start going straight towards the west gate of freeport, then take a right... follow the wall while walking into it (walk diagnally into the wall) just keep going... it&#39;s a little while away... anyway you should soon find an invisible wall to walk through. finally, keep...etc...&quot;</div>
