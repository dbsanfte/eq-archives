<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364398595">I had the same effect.  It doesnt attack me and I worship Tunare.  Just<br/>
doesnt sell to me.  Did this person CAST any spells around the NPC?  If you<br/>
practice ROOT on another person (NPC or PC) they will attack you.  I have<br/>
learned this lesson the hard way...via death.<br/>

Not true!  I am a high elf wizard who worships Tunare.  The merchant hates <br/>
me, will not sell to me, but will not attack me either.  This was before I <br/>
started hunting in Steamfont, so my faction was not improved the first time <br/>
I entered.<br/>
<br/>
There is something we are missing in this puzzle.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The merchant is a clockwork merchant--it doesn&#39;t have a personal name.  It <br/>
&gt;stands just inside the zone entrance of Ak&#39;Anon, usually very near, if not <br/>
&gt;right on top of, a clockwork jeweler.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, the upshot is, if you chose Tunare as deity, you will be attacked the <br/>
&gt;instant you enter Ak&#39;Anon.  You can try running away into the city, but I <br/>
&gt;have never witnessed anyone successful at that.  Also, I have once observed<br/>
<br/>
&gt;this merchant running into a wall farther into the city, but that was only <br/>
&gt;one time.  Every other time I have been into Ak&#39;Anon, it has been right <br/>
&gt;there at the entrance.<br/>
