<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193552496">The quest starts in Ogguk. It isn&#39;t difficult for a wizard to get all of the<br/>
components BUT you have to have a 20+ level enchanter in order to complete<br/>
the quest. Also you can not receive the quest(unless you are a darkie, in<br/>
which case you can&#39;t get the next step in Freeport) because the ogres will<br/>
kill you on sight. Basically the quest goes like this...<br/>
<br/>
You talk to a bartender in Ogguk and he says he is missing his recipe<br/>
book(or some such nonsense) and that he gave it to a bartender in Freeport.<br/>
You go to Freeport and talk to the bartender on the docks and he says he is<br/>
trying to make some wonderful drink and that if you get him the items he<br/>
will give you the book back. He wants 4 things. A kiola nut from OOT, JumJum<br/>
Juice from Rivervale, Fish Scales from Qeynos, and 1 thing from Erudin which<br/>
I forget right now. Anyway after you collect all of these things you return<br/>
them to him and IF your faction is high enough you get the NO DROP<br/>
compendium(this is why you have to have an enchanter because you have to<br/>
have good standing with both Freeport and Ogguk). After you get the book<br/>
return in to the ogre and you will get the coveted glowing stein. This is a<br/>
rather crude over view of the quest but it really is pointless unless you<br/>
know a trustworthy enchanter. Even if you offer 100 platinum to a stranger<br/>
you could get ripped because the stein is currently going for around 750<br/>
platinum(I am SOOO glad I know a friendly enchanter). Now if you are friends<br/>
with an enchanter this a good way to make money because, as a wizard, you<br/>
can collect the items and the enchanter can finish the quest. All told about<br/>
3 hours work for 750 plat, not too bad.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
Yours,<br/>
