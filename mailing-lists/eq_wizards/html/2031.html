&gt; I would like to thank everyone for their comments and inputs to the<br/>
&gt; petition.  We seem to have reached a majority of people agreeing on it.<br/>
&gt; I realize that many people would like to have things added to it, but my<br/>
&gt; fear is that the longer it gets, the less we will agree on it.  Also, I<br/>
&gt; intentionally left out specific examples for the sake of brevity<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wasn&#39;t finished and hit the send button.  Oops :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway,<br/>
<br/>
I think we should change  #4 to this<br/>
<br/>
4) O&#39;Kiels Radiation seems that it would be the beginning of a great line<br/>
of spells. Why should it end there? Cold and Magic based buff / damage<br/>
shields would be a very welcome addition.<br/>
<br/>
Druids are kings of damage shields, and enchanters are the king of buffs.<br/>
We get both, although weaker, in one spell<br/>
<br/>
and #5 to this<br/>
<br/>
5) Wizards seem to be very neglected when it comes to carrying or wearing<br/>
items that enhance our appearance. In addition, many completely different<br/>
spells have the same visual effects.<br/>
<br/>
(In addition sounds better than &quot;also&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
My feeling is that we should all sign one petition.  Mass E-Mails just<br/>
anger people.<br/>
What I would like is a volenteer to collect the screen names, and character<br/>
names of the signers to append to the list.<br/>
<br/>
ex<br/>
<br/>
Halfpintzz aka Malkin of Fennin Ro, Wizard 3rd Rank<br/>
<br/>
Verant wants screen names not charater names<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.</div>
