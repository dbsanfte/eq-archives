You have to register to post, which seems to discourage flamers.  The <br/>
threads are also persistant, so you get less repeats.  This is my favorite <br/>
site for indepth discussions, and has separate forums for just about every <br/>
topic, from solo strategies to in game dating.  I definately recommend it.<br/>
<br/>
In all fairness, the discussions are not usually as specific as a single <br/>
spell, but I would like to see how the group responds to some of your <br/>
thoughts.  Just don&#39;t yell about &quot;broken classes&quot;, as you will likely get <br/>
nowhere.  Start from a solutions point of view, and I think you would be an <br/>
asset to the site.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Thanks Cristie and others for the nice words, but I think I know the <br/>
&gt;problem.  This is my first (and probably last) mailing list and I didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt;realize that they are only for one-shot answers to questions.  Does anyone <br/>
&gt;know of a good forum (or whatever they are online) where I could go to for <br/>
&gt;Everquest spell complaints/suggestions?  Besides having beta tested for UO, <br/>
&gt;playing Everquest and various info searches, I dont really spend any <br/>
&gt;&quot;social&quot; time online and didnt realize that I was breaking Netiquette rules <br/>
&gt;here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>
