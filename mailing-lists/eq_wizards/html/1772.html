<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832728749">I personally have seen GMs come to answer a petition about twinking, and say, <br/>
and I quote, &quot; Twinking is Pointless, and thus, not illegal.  We have no way <br/>
of verifying or controlling it.  Continue enjoying the game, as if the person <br/>
who YOU have a problem with does not exist. Everyone will be happier that <br/>
way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
THAT is verants stand, not Suspending people</div>
