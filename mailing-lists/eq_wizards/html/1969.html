<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307356221">I believe that the email as it stands should be cut down a bit...<br/>
I took the org. letter and trimmed out some of the spells and suggestions so<br/>
it is more concise.  I also clarified some points that might be vague.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We, the Wizards of the Onelist.com Eq_Wizards mailing list, feel the Wizard<br/>
class requires revision and have compiled the following list of suggestions:<br/>
<br/>
New Spells( to enhance our group desirablility)<br/>
[suggested levels are between 8 and 29]<br/>
<br/>
Summon -     Teleports group member inside the zone to your location<br/>
Phase -         Teleports yourself to location of other group member inside<br/>
zone<br/>
Tap Afinity -  Teleport group member to their own bind spot<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Changes to existing spells:<br/>
<br/>
Root -             Minimum time duration, with random maxium time duration.<br/>
Fade              Useless, remove completely<br/>
Shadowstep   Change to line of sight, with minimum travelled distance and<br/>
random max. distance.<br/>
<br/>
Skill Changes<br/>
Meditation skill max for level for wizard (Level +1) * 7.<br/>
<br/>
We also request your continued efforts on implementing the Specialization<br/>
skill.<br/>
<br/>
Game Mechanics<br/>
-Investigate the increase of spell failures (fizzles) of lower level spells<br/>
as Wizard class advances in levels.  Should &quot;simpler&quot; spells fail more often<br/>
as the Wizard increase in levels, regardless of appropriate skill?  (ie.<br/>
Root, Shielding etc.)<br/>
<br/>
- Resolving the problem of high resistence of Level 20+ DD spells by greens,<br/>
blues and higher (if this is the result of a stun effect we wish one spell<br/>
without this effect at same level)<br/>
<br/>
- Resolving the balance problem of other magic-using classes still able to<br/>
affect Monsters  (in a group situation) that are 6+ above their own levels<br/>
(Necromancer - Lifetap & pets, Enchanters and Magicians - pets, buffs, etc)<br/>
while Wizard DD spells are 100% resisted by 6+ level MoBs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- We wish real official feedback on planned changes or problems which you<br/>
have with balance in game on an official page which exists but never seems<br/>
to be updated (eg. id&#39;s Quake .plan files)<br/>
<br/>
We feel the Wizard class has been overlooked far too long and that there is<br/>
nothing that is truly unique about our characters anymore.  We feel the<br/>
above changes would go a long way towards rectifying some of the classes<br/>
shortcomings.  Thanks for your consideration.<br/>
