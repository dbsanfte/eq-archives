<div id="ygrps-yiv-728562232">i wouldnt say that this happens on muds alot for the main reason is that in <br/>
muds your equipment directly determines your ability to servive in a mud your <br/>
lvl plays a role.  Of course but overall your armor and items will determine <br/>
if u stay alive in a fight as it affects your stats much more than EQ&#39;s stat <br/>
modifying equipment a +3 to 90 isnt a big dip compared to a +3 to stats that <br/>
normally get maxed at 25 and start at 14.  but in a mud there is also the <br/>
ever popular donation pit were anyone in the game can chose to just type &quot; <br/>
donate (name of item)&quot; and then it sits in a pile were anyone can take it. <br/>
this would be almosst imposible for verant to think about implementing due to <br/>
the fact that it goes against the boreing camping sessions.  personally the <br/>
items should be always spawned on npcs  not for the reason that i want items <br/>
but for the fact that it would stop some abuse of zone camping items, allow <br/>
alot of players to get item and enjoy the game more with out sitting ina room <br/>
stairng at a wall.<br/>
