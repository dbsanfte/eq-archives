&gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Welcome to the EQ_Wizards List.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This list is intended to let Wizards help Wizards. There are no hard and<br/>
&gt; fast rules here, just try to keep postings some what on the topic of<br/>
Wizards<br/>
&gt; and Everquest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This list is NOT moderated so there are  a couple of things i would like<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; ask of the community when posting to this list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) Please keep the language clean.<br/>
&gt; 2) NO question is a dumb question so please don&#39;t flame or harrass people<br/>
&gt; that ask questions which you might feel is stupid.<br/>
&gt; 3) Some people consider posting information about Quest&#39;s , unique items<br/>
etc..<br/>
&gt; to be Spoilers. So to respect the rights of those people, if you should<br/>
send in<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; anything that is or may be considered a Spoiler please add **Spoiler** to<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; subject so that anyone who doesn&#39;t want to read information on Spoilers<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; just delete the mail.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s pretty much it. Have fun and let me know if there is anything i can<br/>
do to<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; help you enjoy your stay more in this community.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
