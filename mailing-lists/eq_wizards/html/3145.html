<div id="ygrps-yiv-2007930664">I think if they implemented this idea, they would probably do what they did<br/>
with the gate potions-- make them ridiculously expensive at something like<br/>
1200 plat for one.  That would squelch any ideas of having infinite mana.<br/>
Although I admit, it seems a little excessive to me.<br/>

&gt; I still think that they should have something that restores some mana<br/>
&gt; that you could buy at the stores.  I told this idea to a friend of mine<br/>
&gt; and he said that would make Wizards have infinate mana.  So I said what<br/>
&gt; if there was something like a &quot;Wizards Pouch&quot; and It could hold like 10<br/>
&gt; of these mana restoring items and the items can only be placed in this<br/>
&gt; bag.  And a wizard can only have one bag.  That would limit the amount<br/>
&gt; of these items to 10.  Therefore making us better at soloing but wouldnt<br/>
&gt; let us have infinate mana.<br/>
