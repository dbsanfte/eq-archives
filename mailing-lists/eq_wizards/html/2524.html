<div id="ygrps-yiv-1954617755">I don&#39;t know about you, but i have NEVER been kicked out of a group for being<br/>
resisted.  mainly because i don&#39;t tell them i&#39;m resisted :).    Just cast ur lvl<br/>
1 shock and since its only 6 dmg. the mob will NEVER (at least never for me)<br/>
come after you.  and your group can&#39;t tell the difference in the color of the<br/>
spells since all of them look the same. they think ur casing some high lvl shock<br/>
heehhe.<br/>
<br/>
Works fine for me so far, i sit there, no danger, no mana loss, and i get XP and<br/>
follow their loot order just fine.  I made 50 plat and gained 2 lvl in 3 days<br/>
and died only once.  From the skeleton monk i mention in previous post.    When<br/>
group leader ask for mana status, just say what others say.  (ie. if cleric says<br/>
20% mana, u say 15%)  that way  they don&#39;t think ur doing nothing hehe.<br/>
<br/>
its good trick and works well to keep our mind off how they block up at 6 lvl.<br/>
Since verant make us team up, i don&#39;t see much else we can do about it except to<br/>
abuse the fact that others cannot see what we cast and what our mana is at :)  [<br/>
maybe this is why they don&#39;t let others see?]<br/>

 </span></blockquote>died<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Once from a skeleton monk that killed someone else and then came after me from<br/>
