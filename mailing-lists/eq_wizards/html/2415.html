<div id="ygrps-yiv-148500876">well, don&#39;t know about offense and defense, as mine are only in the high<br/>
80&#39;s at lvl 25, but my dodge hit 75 a while ago, and hasn&#39;t moved since (and<br/>
it was going up pretty regularly too).<br/>

&gt;Hi all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been lurking on this list for awhile and have a question to ask you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>all.  I read awhile back, a posting from someone who said that a Wizard&#39;s<br/>
Offense and Defense skills max out at (Level *4).  This seems to hold for me<br/>
in Offense, as my Offense skill at 25th level topped out at 100.  For some<br/>
reason though, my defense skill is stuck at 90...  Is this what everyone<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;else is exeriencing?<br/>
&gt;(Last night, I finally gained 26th level and my Defense went up to 91, so I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>know it was stopped at 90 until I leveled.)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, my Dodge and Throwing skills have stopped advancing at 75.  Is this<br/>
 </span></blockquote>our limit in these skills as well?<br/>
