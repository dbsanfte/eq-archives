<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105715888">With this problem you, as a gamer, are in a unique position to state<br/>
your right. From now on ASSUME that a game will not be perfect upon<br/>
release, wait a few months, watch the message boards, until people<br/>
aren&#39;t complaining as much. The companies will understand when they<br/>
don&#39;t get the sales figures until the games are &quot;done&quot; and the dinner<br/>
bell rings.<br/>
<br/>
I see your point but we gamers are shooting ourselves in the feet by<br/>
buying the games right on release. The anticipation is ours. The hype is<br/>
ours. Unfortunately the willpower is NOT ours :P The companies are not<br/>
forcing us to buy the games, and they certainly are not claiming they<br/>
are &quot;perfect&quot; at release as they continue to update them.<br/>
<br/>
Theres no use complaining to us! We didn&#39;t make the game :P The gaming<br/>
magazines all recognize this yet the gaming companies still do it. Go<br/>
figure.<br/>

PS I usually wait until games are 20 bucks at Electronics Boutique<br/>
before buying them. I used to get burned a lot by the unfinished but now<br/>
I get the cool games, and all the patches, in one fell cheap swoop.<br/>
*sigh* Some you just can&#39;t wait for though...<br/>

&gt; &gt; Two things.<br/>
&gt; &gt; First, you will never have a project of this magnitude without having some bugs<br/>
&gt; &gt; making it to release undiscovered.  Software is inherently buggy, its a fact of<br/>
&gt; &gt; life, get used to it, you will see it happen more and more.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Being a software designer, I tend to notice that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Second, they have stated that people found exploiting a bug will be warned.  If they<br/>
&gt; &gt; continue to exploit the bug, then they will be punished.  Its painfully obvious why<br/>
&gt; &gt; they don&#39;t list bugs.  They don&#39;t want to be forced into policing them 24/7.  If you<br/>
&gt; &gt; stumble onto something that is a blatent bug, report it so that it gets fixed, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; move on.  If you find something that could go either way, enjoy it until a GM/Guide<br/>
&gt; &gt; tells you to stop.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thing is, they released buggy software. I paid good money for it, and keep paying every<br/>
&gt; month.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They should take care of it. Their game. My money. Their problem, not mine. As a<br/>
&gt; consumer, I shouldn&#39;t even have to think about these things. What happens is that the<br/>
&gt; game designers are aware as to how much the gaming public is involved in the process of<br/>
&gt; making designing games, so the EXPLOIT us.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Have you ever seen a TV released that only shows prime number channels, with a promise<br/>
&gt; to come fix it some time? Ever seen a stove that only heats to 50 degrees with a promise<br/>
&gt; to come fix it some time? Ever see a car that only turns left with a promise to come fix<br/>
&gt; it some time? No. This happens only in computer software, especially high profile games.<br/>
