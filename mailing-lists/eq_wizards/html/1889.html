<div id="ygrps-yiv-650828988">Hi, <br/>
<br/>
Since this is my first time on this list, I decided to share something<br/>
I have been playing with for about a month now. The following<br/>
is an email I sent to a friend awhile back.<br/>
<br/>
Any questions or comments about this are very welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Hey Fist! It&#39;s me again. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am experimenting with some new tactics I made up while experimenting<br/>
&gt; with my new spells.<br/>
&gt; You know that our biggest weakness as human wizards is mana, and it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; pain when you want to throw EVERYTHING YOU GOT at a target and it&#39;s all over<br/>
&gt; you and you get intrrupted.  Melee helps a little, but<br/>
&gt; then BAM! We don&#39;t last long...(but grouping always helps. hehe).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, when soloing, some options for safe killing are:<br/>
&gt; - Stay close to zone and get out quick when things get too tough and you<br/>
&gt;   can&#39;t pull off all your spells.<br/>
&gt; - Nuke target with everything you got and then zone, then rest and come<br/>
&gt;   back in zone to finish it off (doesnt always work, because target<br/>
&gt;   regains hp fast most of the time like that).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - Steal kills by doing most damage fast (hehehe, I sure wouldnt try this) <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - Use the sniper technique (a.k.a. &#39;multiburst&#39; technique).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ah, I bet your wondering &quot;Has Norcimo been sniffing glue? What the hell is<br/>
&gt; the multiburst technique!?!?&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, yes I have been sniffing glue, but that has nothing to do with what<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m gonna explain to you now. hehe.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This technique involves one thing: Shooting your target with bolt spells<br/>
&gt; at FAR distances! From one zone border to the other if there are no<br/>
&gt; obstacles in between. How, you might ask? Easy! BOLT SPELLS!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, you can cast bolt spells from LONG distances. How? The trick is not<br/>
&gt; to target your victim and then shoot, but to TARGET YOURSELF and then<br/>
&gt; shoot. When you target yourself, the bolt spell with shoot in a straight<br/>
&gt; line in front of you.  All you have to do turn left/right until you aim<br/>
&gt; directly at your enemy, which has to be in Line-of-sight. In order to do<br/>
&gt; this successfuly, you have to use one of 4 spells we get as wizards:<br/>
&gt; GLIMPSE, GAZE, SIGHT, or MAGNIFY. These spells make your eyes act as<br/>
&gt; telescopes (Magnify being the best). With this special sight, you can<br/>
&gt; easily target and shoot enemies from very very far away. The good thing<br/>
&gt; about bolt spells is that after you shoot one, the bolt has to travel<br/>
&gt; for awhile until it hits your target, giving you PLENTY of time to shoot<br/>
&gt; 2-3 more in succesion!!!!! zap, zap, zap!<br/>
&gt; Of course, the hardest part about this technique is aiming, but that can<br/>
&gt; be fixed by putting a &#39;marker&#39; on your monitor so you can target your<br/>
&gt; enemy more precisely. Another drawback is the terrain. Casting bolt spell<br/>
&gt; this way WON&#39;T let you control the UP-DOWN direction of the bolt. this<br/>
&gt; means that you and your target have to be in the same elevation for this<br/>
&gt; technique to work. otherwise if you try to shoot something on a hill and<br/>
&gt; your on flatter ground, the bolt will it the hill. And if your on a hill<br/>
&gt; and the target is on flatter ground, the bolt will pass by its head. Also,<br/>
&gt; make sure that obstancles like trees, players, etc, aren&#39;t in the way<br/>
&gt; either.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m still looking for optimal spots to use this technique. One interesting<br/>
&gt; place i was thinking about was oasis, close to the beach, or east karanas.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyways, have fun! And hope to see you tonight!<br/>
