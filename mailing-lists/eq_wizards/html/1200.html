<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1209320602">I used to charge when i hit lvl 12 and had very little money, now that i<br/>
have a decent amount, i bind and invis for free if it&#39;s not out of my way...<br/>
if i&#39;m busy or headed another direction from where they want  bound, i&#39;ll<br/>
offer to do it for a small fee (usually around 5gp unless they&#39;re in the mid<br/>
teens, then they should be able to spare a plat)... i feel that&#39;s fair for<br/>
everyone<br/>

&gt; Disclaimer: this is only my opinion so no flames please.  I am only hoping<br/>
&gt; to elicit some other opinions on this subject as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know why but it has never made sense to me to charge for services<br/>
&gt; such as binding, invis, and language training.  Perhaps it is just the<br/>
&gt; personality of my character that he enjoys helping others and gets full<br/>
&gt; satisfaction out of the good deed itself, not needing any sort of physical<br/>
&gt; compensation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I realize that I will be able to make make up to a plat or more each per<br/>
&gt; bind and a plat or more for invis (depending on how bad they want it) but<br/>
&gt; that just seems unkind.  I remember when I was level 8 just travelling<br/>
over<br/>
&gt; to freeport.  I only had a couple of my new 3rd circle spells because they<br/>
&gt; were so expensive and I was flat broke.  I saw people auctioning: &quot;Binding<br/>
&gt; at S. Gate, 15gp&quot;, and there was no way i could afford that without<br/>
selling<br/>
&gt; the few pieces of cloth armor i had left.  I was lucky to find a kind<br/>
druid<br/>
&gt; that bound me and asked for nothing in return, but I just wonder why so<br/>
many<br/>
&gt; seek to earn a profit from their abilities rather than just use them to<br/>
help<br/>
&gt; others and take joy in that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I guess it is just based on your roleplaying style, but even if I have no<br/>
&gt; money and still have spells to buy, I would not ask for or accept any sort<br/>
&gt; of payment for using my talents.  Does anyone else agree with me or do you<br/>
&gt; all think that you SHOULD rightfully earn a profit from using your skills?<br/>

&gt; I am excellent in Dragon, Combine, Old Eurdian, Elder Elvish, and am<br/>
working<br/>
&gt; on Elder Tier&#39;Dal today.  I will be happy to teach Dragon and Combine for<br/>
6<br/>
&gt; runes each.  The rest, I will teach for 3 runes or 5 plat each.  I am<br/>
&gt; located on the Tarew Marr server.  I am firm on the Dragon and Combine<br/>
btw.<br/>
&gt; I won&#39;t accept money but only runes for those languages.<br/>
