<div id="ygrps-yiv-53597238">Here is a strategy I have been using that I wanted to share with everyone<br/>
else.  It may seem almost obvious to some but I want to make sure that<br/>
everyone knows.<br/>
<br/>
Distance Distance Distance!  If you are in an area in which you have good<br/>
sight distance, get to the maximum range that you can cast your spell from.<br/>
Cast your most powerful spell and then WHILE you are recovering BACK UP even<br/>
more and then cast again when recovered.  Using this strategy I can hit with<br/>
2 shocks of lightning (at level 13, so I am sure it works at level 12 also)<br/>
for a total of 158 damage (if they both hit for full damage) BEFORE the<br/>
enemy gets to me!  Against blues and sometimes evens, this will be enough<br/>
damage so that I can now switch to shock of ice (which casts fast enough to<br/>
use between them hitting me) and finish them off in 2 or 3 castings.  If you<br/>
don&#39;t want the monster in your face, cast root instead of the 2nd DD spell.<br/>
<br/>
Another strategy that someone posted (should have been obvious but I didnt<br/>
think of it) uses the fact that your bolt spells dont actually hit until the<br/>
bolt reaches them (using the distance tactic).  Cast your most powerful bolt<br/>
at maximum distance (I haven&#39;t done this but it should work) and while it is<br/>
still on the way you can recover enough to root the enemy, then blast away.<br/>
I would change this tact for slightly easier enemies and instead of rooting,<br/>
cast your best shock spell and then you might even be able to cast again<br/>
before the monster gets to you.  I haven&#39;t played with this bolt tactic yet<br/>
so it is all theory.  I will try tonight and let you all know.<br/>
