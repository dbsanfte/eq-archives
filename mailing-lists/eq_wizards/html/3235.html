<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-358240841">Phaedra, Do not despair, I have no clue why we get root at lvl 4 because<br/>
was useless to me until ablut lvl 12, i had all of the same probs as u r<br/>
having with it, wouldnt stick, eats WAAAY too much mana however, at lvl<br/>
12 or so it will start to actually stick and become a little more mana<br/>
efficient.  Beleive me, root WILL become your lead-off spell or you will<br/>
die very often, and without it you can forget about soloingWe cannot<br/>
kite, so we must root.  Hang in there, it DOES get better, Much better!<br/>
