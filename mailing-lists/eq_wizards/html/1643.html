<div id="ygrps-yiv-143685981">It all comes down to playing style...but I&#39;ve been solely relying upon <br/>
spells for fighting.  I haven&#39;t used or used very little melee since level <br/>
12.  Although admittedly, melee was VERY useful during the 8-12lvl stages <br/>
where you needed the extra dmg to finish the creatures off.  Since 12, if <br/>
you are lucky enough to find a regular group, you can begin your role as a <br/>
pure nuker...cast/med/cast/med.  I have met many a high level Wizard who <br/>
have gotten rid of staffs/daggers altogether in favor of mana or <br/>
intelligence enhancing items (idols, tomes, wands, etc)<br/>
<br/>
In a group, and believe me, you WILL probably have to group at higher <br/>
levels, I find that your value to the group is more in your ability to <br/>
strike from a distance rather than risking your neck near a <br/>
creature..especially since it&#39;s pissed off at the 117 damage spell you just <br/>
casted 2 seconds ago.  :)<br/>
