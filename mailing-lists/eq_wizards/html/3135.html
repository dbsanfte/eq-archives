<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-464113057">Actually you will be quite surprised to know that there are a lot of<br/>
creatures still blue in Sol A at 37th. The throne room(where solusek<br/>
goblins, solusek mages, and solusek champions spawn) is almost totally blue<br/>
still. As well, if you hate gnomes, the gnome castle is full of blue<br/>
clockworks and gnomes(this is where charred armor comes from). Anyway, just<br/>
wanted to let you know that Sol A is still good into the upper 30&#39;s but by<br/>
this time you may want to think about moving to B unless you are still in<br/>
need of items.<br/>
<br/>
Yours,<br/>
