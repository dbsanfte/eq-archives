<b>Subject:</b> Places to hunt for a lvl 13 or above wizard.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-84453860">Any help in this area would be greatly appreciated,  also if you could <br/>
give a short description on how to go about finding them it would help a <br/>
great deal.  Nothing in depth, I like to explore, I just want some sort <br/>
of direction to head.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time,<br/>
