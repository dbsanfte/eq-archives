&gt; You won&#39;t see any major difference in dmg until lvl 29+... then we begin<br/>

&gt; you reach that lvl for it.  Sit back and throw your previous most powerful<br/>
&gt; spell at the baddies and they won&#39;t come at you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am not using my most powerful spell as soon as I got It I&#39;m level 13<br/>
now...  next?  Oh and I know all the tricks to wait and such... but you also<br/>
want to help as much as you can... I have found there is a find line... cast<br/>
once to start off... then again after about 3 seconds... then wait for about<br/>
5 seconds... if the battle is still a long way from finishing usually my<br/>
tanks are not doing so well so I have to go heavy and dump into the mob, if<br/>
they are doing well I watch to try to finish...  I also know about rooting<br/>
if the Mob runs...  believe me I know most of the tricks... chuckle.  So<br/>
even though our only benefit is that we are damage doers we have to wait<br/>
till 29th?<br/>
