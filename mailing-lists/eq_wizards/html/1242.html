<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1746953779">So having the off hand free is obviously a plus, but what kind of items can<br/>
you hold there (sorry I am new to this list so maybe just reply to me if<br/>
this has been posted extensively)?  Also at what level can you expect to<br/>
start finding these items?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Problem is... I don&#39;t think you have a piercing upgrade &#39;til Stiletto and I<br/>
believe that weapon is designed to be too tough to get until Lvl 40+.<br/>
Although the RTS isn&#39;t perfect, it is pretty good and does prepare you (2H<br/>
Blunt skill) for the Observer&#39;s Staff which I think is designed for Lvl 30+.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stats on Oberserver&#39;s Staff:   Dmg 12, Delay 39, +5 INT, +5 WIS, +30 MANA<br/>
<br/>
This is obviously an excellent weapon to keep in mind...<br/>
<br/>
I think the information we keep seeing here lends credence to the strategy<br/>
of keeping all or at least two of your weapon skills up.  I won&#39;t duplicate<br/>
that thread here ))<br/>

		Piercing is the way to go.  I am an advocate of it because<br/>
of the Pugius, the <br/>
		fanged skull stilleto, and the certain skull that was talked<br/>
about so many <br/>
		times prior.  With a Pugius right now at lvl 13, and the<br/>
skull, life is much <br/>
		easier.  Plus 20 mana is better than the runed staff can<br/>
provide, and the <br/>
		Pugius attacks much, much quicker.  I am still looking for a<br/>
fanged skull <br/>
		stilleto (anyone know where to get them), but once I have<br/>
found one, life <br/>
		will be much easier.<br/>
