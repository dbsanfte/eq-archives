<div id="ygrps-yiv-454215069">Your comment about how it may be &quot;boring&quot; makes me think that I must state my opinion on this subject. hehe<br/>
<br/>
Although both tailoring, and jewelcraft can be profitable.  If you dont like doing it.  Stick to adventuring.  The best advice someone can give you, is to play your character how you think your character would play.  Or roleplay.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone can be a succesful tailor as long as they stick with it.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;re going to need to put a few points towards the skill, else you&#39;ll be wasting a LOT of time and money building your skills up.  I&#39;ve even heard of people putting around 20 points into the skill just to help their success rates out.<br/>
<br/>
On jewelcraft, ...  it is a VERY expensive craft to learn.  Plan on spending a lot of plat just getting your base skill down.  However, the payoff is really good.  Some jewels sell for a couple plat, some sell for hundreds.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you put lots of time into either of these, it will become profitable.  As I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve found fishing to be. Remember when you first started fishing?  Your skills were so low, you failed lots?   Tailoring is a lot harder to learn than fishing.  ...and Jewelcraft is harder than tailoring.   It all depends on what you think your character would do.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways..  hope that helps.<br/>

&gt; What is a good trade skill for a Wizard. I&#39;m 12 th level and I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; decent at fishing ( 50 something ) I&#39;m wondering if it would be worth <br/>
&gt; my time to take up something like tailoring or jewelcraft. Or would <br/>
&gt; it be just a lot of boring not very profitable work and I should just <br/>
&gt; stick to adventuring. Any comments or sugguestions are welcome.<br/>
