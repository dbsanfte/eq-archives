<div id="ygrps-yiv-41665757">Hello I am a 7th level wizard who wants to get a jump on his language<br/>
skills.  I have been unable to figure out how to do so though :(  I know how<br/>
to change my language from Erudite to Common and back.  I also see them<br/>
listed as skills.  I do not see anyplace for other languages though when I<br/>
talk to my guild trainer.  Is this what the specialization or research<br/>
skills are for.  Or am I missing something.  I know that listening to the<br/>
language is supposed to help increase skill, but I have yet to been able to<br/>
really listen to foreign tounges for a long period of time.  Was just<br/>
wondering if anybody could explain how to go about this, because I am<br/>
stumped and don&#39;t see any easy or logical way to start studying a new<br/>
language.  Thanks Everyone<br/>
