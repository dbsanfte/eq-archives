<div id="ygrps-yiv-1972384647">Yes, you kill him for the robe.  And the after the robe is looted it can be traded.  You should realize you don&#39;t get a robe everytime, or even close to everytime.. it&#39;s pretty rare.<br/>

    Do you have to be the one to LOOT the robe from him in befallen or can a TANK loot the body then give you the robe???  Cus it would stink to have to try to kill him again if a TANK accidentaly looted his body . . .  (I you do kill him for his robe right?)<br/>

        There is no better robe than the Sr. Aprentice robes that you can buy.  From now on you&#39;ll have to quest to get a better one.  I&#39;d suggest starting with the thermateugist (sp?) robe you get from the necro thermateugist (sp?) on the third floor of befallen.  Have fun..<br/>

            What is the next step up from the Sr. Apprentice robes, where can I buy it, and how much does it cost? Thanks, Lott. </span></blockquote></div>
