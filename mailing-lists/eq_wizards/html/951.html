    Yes there are 2 different planes besides the normal one. Hate and Sky (or air). The spells are Alter Plane: Hate and Alter Plane: Sky. They are both lvl 44 spells. I have a friend who traveled there. He said there are liches on the hate plane. Personally i cant wait to get to go there but are there only certain places from which you can cast these spells? This i do no know he didnt say, but from the way you were talking there is.</div>
