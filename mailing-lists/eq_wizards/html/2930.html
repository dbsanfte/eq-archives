<div id="ygrps-yiv-791973689">i totally don&#39;t agree with the partial resist partial mana thing. that&#39;s<br/>
utter bullshit. here&#39;s the thing, in real RPG&#39;s mana wasn&#39;t a physical thing<br/>
taht could be y&#39;know, seen, it was the actual wizards stamina.<br/>
<br/>
think of it this way:<br/>
<br/>
casting a spell takes energy away from a wizard (kinda like hitting a home<br/>
run in a baseball game, you&#39;re tired after you do it.) the bigger the spell,<br/>
the more exausted the wizard got, as he became experienced, he grew stronger<br/>
and gained more stamina.<br/>
<br/>
the problem:<br/>
<br/>
the wizard casts the complete spell (says the magic incantation....)<br/>
<br/>
THEN the spell hits! no matter how much the spell hits for, the wizard still<br/>
said the same words and devoted the same amount of energy towards shooting<br/>
the spell off. end of story.<br/>
