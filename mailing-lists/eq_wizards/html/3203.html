&gt; &gt; Absolutly, as a wizard, you are the groups panic<br/>
&gt; &gt; button.  Fighting a steady<br/>
&gt; &gt; stream of blues, a group that includes a cleric will<br/>
&gt; &gt; almost have no use for<br/>
&gt; &gt; us until the puller yells,  &quot;Oh Shit, I pulled<br/>
&gt; &gt; something big guys, get<br/>
&gt; &gt; ready&quot;  That is when we shine.  With our burns,<br/>
&gt; &gt; nobody can save the situation<br/>
&gt; &gt; faster than a wizard.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; I disagree.  That&#39;s the situation where an Enchanter<br/>
&gt; really shines.  Wizards can help, but not as well.<br/>
&gt; Our best bet in that situation is Evac.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Enchanters are great for debuffing the mob (When they aren&#39;t resisted) But<br/>
they really lack in doing damage to a mob.  Keeping in mind that both<br/>
wizards and enchanters are limited by the 6 Level cap rule, so we are<br/>
talking low red, high yellows here, I would rather place my bets with a<br/>
wizard than an enchanter.  Wizards, can burn a mob to down to 1/3 - 1/2 of<br/>
its life chaining DD&#39;s (Even if they are 1 circle down due to matching<br/>
cold/fire resists) much faster than an Enchanter can Debuff the same mob to<br/>
a manageable state (Taking resists into account).  Tashen, Slow, Weaken 1,<br/>
Weaken 2, Dot, etc.  Will about halve the damage dealt by the mob.  Stuns<br/>
work, but 2 enchanters in a group are needed to be completely effective,<br/>
and again resists are an issue.   Charm is out of the question, because the<br/>
last thing you want to do in a battle against a tough opponant, is to drag<br/>
another possible hostile into the fray.   Of course Everyone should have<br/>
some form of root/ensnare handy to keep the mob from jumping us.   Oh well<br/>
boss is here gotta go :)<br/>
