<div id="ygrps-yiv-2092861639">What i wish to say is that if people go in arena, accept a duel or are<br/>
included in guild war then there is no need to have faction hit. this can<br/>
be also valid on PVP server so only if you hunt and kill unexpected people<br/>
like a bandit you are looked upon as a bandit. if you are a noble gentlmen<br/>
wich calls on duel then you dont have need to get a faction hit as your<br/>
oponent accepted a duel,  or he goes with you in arena or he is member og<br/>
guild war and all is open game.<br/>

&gt;According to Mike Browne:<br/>
&gt;&gt; No it won&#39;t. I participated in a Guild war and killed two PCs and suffered a<br/>
&gt;&gt; faction hit. I can no longer purchase items in Felwithe as a result. Bug<br/>
&gt;&gt; still exists in program.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It think that Wizard &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:wizard@...">wizard@...</a>&gt; was saying that faction hits<br/>
&gt;outside of an arena, duel or guild war situation would be fine, not<br/>
&gt;that they are. Which basically means: faction hits only for PvP players,<br/>
&gt;not players that have &quot;temporary&quot; PvP.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As if this would encourage people to switch to PvP :)<br/>
