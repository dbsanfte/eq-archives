<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279836088">The Mage&#39;s 16th lvl spell is not as powerful as ours, but it is close.  They<br/>
start off at 91 dmg we start off with 104 dmg.  Also, they don&#39;t get another<br/>
DD spell until 24th, where as we get one at 20th and 24th.<br/>

&gt; During my adventures over the past weekend I happened to group with a<br/>
&gt; very nice magician and his pet &quot;Gonaker.&quot;  We did very well together<br/>
&gt; and had fun.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The problem was that he made claims that he can strike a target for DD<br/>
&gt; equal to mine.  We were both level 19 and sad thing is, I think he is<br/>
&gt; right!  Can anyone tell me how much mana is used and damage delivered<br/>
&gt; for the magician DD spell (16th level) equivelant to Fire Shock?  I<br/>
&gt; have a feeling it will be the same which is sad really.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Before I rant on my class I will need to know the truth on this matter.<br/>
&gt;  I love being a wizard and believe the long road to true power is a<br/>
&gt; long one.  But we should be doing more damage than a damn magician and<br/>
&gt; plus he gets a pet.  Let me know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
