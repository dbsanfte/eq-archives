<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262512929">I for one an frustrated with the cookie cutter look that all higher<br/>
level people end up taking on.  How many of you out there have played<br/>
AD&D?  They have a rather decent random loot method that I think would<br/>
be *fine* for EQ.  I too am dissapointed that there tends to be only one<br/>
BEST set of equipment for us, and therefore, those poor mobs are always<br/>
camped to death.  I would like to see a simple random loot factor.  I<br/>
kill a goblin wizard, there is a 50% chance he has a robe.  It would be<br/>
a robe appropriate to a wizard as well.  Then create a second random<br/>
chart that says it has 0,1, or 2 effects.  (Maybe on higher level mobs,<br/>
that would be 2-4, etc..).  The effect could be +(1 to 3) int, or<br/>
+(5-10) hp, or something appropriate.  Nothing signifincantly better<br/>
than quest items you can already get, but just SOMETHING different!  Can<br/>
you seriously think of seeing a wizard over level 30 that is happy with<br/>
a robe that isnt a FRB or Robe of the Oracle?  No, unless he killed the<br/>
reclusive ghoul magi, and got one that *looks* like a newbie robe, but<br/>
gives him +3 int, stamina and str!  Yes, of course, it would need<br/>
balancing, but I think it would be a lot more interesting and give us<br/>
some MUCH sought after variety.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought in my bleery eyed, sleepless state.<br/>
