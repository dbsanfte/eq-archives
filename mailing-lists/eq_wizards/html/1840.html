<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166658487">At 18th level you should have been hitting anything in Befallen for full damage. I&#39;m 20th now, and NOTHING in there cons above blue to me. I&#39;ve also noticed that spells get resisted depending on the mob. Dorn for example conned an easy blue and yet all my spells were doing one third damage or so. So, I believe magic resistance is innate in certain creatures and not in some others. <br/>
