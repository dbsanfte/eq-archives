An Enchanter I group with often is up to 11th now, and Im hoping he&#39;ll be able to turn out some things. All he can do is +2 rings currently, and Im not sure if its worth the money, or if I should wait, hoarde, and buy something REALLY good, rather than babystep upgrade. Theres a 57plat ring at the mages building in Freeport that Id like, and Im only 5 gold away from buying it, buuut I have to keep in mind buying my level 16 spells too.<br/>
<br/>
Normally I dont merchant, I scrounge beetle eyes noone wants and I do things the Do-Unto-Others system, so I do favors and hope others are nice in return. Ive gotten a nearly complete suit of silk, the rings I mentioned, the amulet, and a blackened wand (15 magic resistance)  and given out gifts of pelts and various items I came across. But you dont get a lot of cash this way.<br/>
<br/>
Wavering on if I should turn into a miser or deal with breaking even. :D Some people charge for Binds, some dont, and I can bind now. :z<br/>
<br/>
At what level do you tend to start going to pick up nice magic user items? Most quests that grant such things seem geared for lvl 30 and up.<br/>

&gt; Human wiz, Int 95. I just yesterday was given a +3 Int amulet, so 98.<br/>
&gt; I hear 100 is THE magic number... Found that out at level 2. :( Wisdom<br/>
&gt; 75 Agi 90 dex 80 (base stats). Two +2 dex Dervish rings and a +5 hp<br/>
&gt; ring.<br/>
<br/>
95 isn&#39;t too bad....you can up that with jewlry for not too much coin and<br/>
100 is the magic number, though for us the higher the better... Thoguh<br/>
don&#39;t dispare too much, that 90 agi and 80 dex will come in handy....the<br/>
critters can&#39;t interupt you when they can&#39;t hit you, and dex comes into<br/>
play when you do get hit and try to continue casting..and int jewlery is<br/>
one of the cheaper kinds...i missed what server your on, but if your on<br/>
Innoruuk give me a tell and i&#39;ll hook you up with some +int rings for<br/>
real cheap<br/>
