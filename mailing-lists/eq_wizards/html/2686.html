<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521677784">This faction loss came from just ONE slaying of a high elf?  That&#39;s a pretty steep penalty.  What is Verant thinking, attaching this penalty to dueling.  I assume you were dueling, weren&#39;t you?  Or are you all PVP+?<br/>

  Hello, fellow Wizards!<br/>
   <br/>
  Several weeks ago I participated in a guild war and slew a High Elf not knowing that there would be a faction hit as a result. Well, I can no longer purchase or sell items in Felwithe. I&#39;ve tried everything that I know of to improve my faction standing with the Merchants there, but to no avail. My faction standing with the guards is &quot;amiable&quot; -- It is with the &quot;Merchants&quot; that I need a faction adjustment. Does anyone have any ideas? Suggestions? Personal experience? Would appreciate any and all advice.<br/>
