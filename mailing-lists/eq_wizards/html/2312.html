the stuffin&#39; out of you almost every time... why do they still con blue?  <br/>
Shouldn&#39;t they be conned yellow or red?  <br/>
<br/>
Are the con colors a straight, level-wise calculation (L15 vs L15 =<br/>
white/black), <br/>
or a probability of success calculation (L15 vs L15, but the player is low<br/>
on HP = yellow)?<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I&#39;ll not see level 30+ critters as anything but red for a long<br/>
long time.  =)<br/>
