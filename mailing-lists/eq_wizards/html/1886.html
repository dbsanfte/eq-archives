Many wizards who start their careers in Erudin may know of this quest.  It is to seek out the Testamnet of Vanear.<br/>
<br/>
I am currently at the point in the quest where I must travel to Highhold Pass<br/>
<br/>
In the Keep I must find a fellow named Ran the Librarian.<br/>
<br/>
My question is:  What lvl should I be before attempting to go to HighHold Pass.  I have heard this is a dangerous place to travel at lower levels.  I am currently lvl 7.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your answers ahead of time,<br/>
