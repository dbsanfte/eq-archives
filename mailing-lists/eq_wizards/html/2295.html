<div id="ygrps-yiv-399779778">I agree with everyone else in here who has any sense about the issue....Kill <br/>
Stealing does NOT accomplish anything.  People *remember* you...it&#39;s a <br/>
self-fulfilling prophecy.  You get yourself a reputation that you are a <br/>
KSer...you&#39;ll NEVER get a group.  I&#39;ve seen it happen where certain KSers <br/>
where literally shunned from certain zones as soon as they were spotted.  <br/>
Nobody grouped with them and nobody helped them when they were in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Like many others here, I have had NO problems finding a group.  It&#39;s been <br/>
kinda easy since 16 or so...a couple /tells or one /ooc or so can usually <br/>
grant me an invite.  It&#39;s gotten so easy to find at least ONE person I&#39;ve <br/>
helped before in the past...either I binded them in the past or simply said <br/>
hello to in another zone.  C&#39;mon people...is it so hard to make friends even <br/>
online?<br/>
<br/>
You will need to group eventually...I have some 30+ level friends who are <br/>
everything from mages to warriors.  They tell me it&#39;s near impossible to <br/>
solo even a blue creature anymore....groups will become essential.  If you <br/>
have a bad rep later on...tough luck for you.  I&#39;ve said this before: <br/>
Wizards are ALWAYS welcome high level groups.  These same buddies of mine <br/>
tell me they sometimes look for at least 2 Wizards for their groups.<br/>
