<div id="ygrps-yiv-455904999">To whom it may concern, to get Chandra and Baobob to craft these great bear/wolf skin items for you all you need to do is raise some faction with them. You must have a con of indifferent or higher before they will make you the cloaks. What I did was kill bandits in the Karranas, also Splitpaw gnolls give +faction for KaranaResidents so start the slaying! Oh and enjoy your new garments, just don&#39;t flood the market ok? You&#39;ll put me out of business!<br/>
