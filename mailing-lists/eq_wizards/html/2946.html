&gt; The spells cast Force,Column of lighting and Lightning storm are my 3 AE<br/>
&gt; spells I can make for this level. Do I realy need 3. ?Can you tell me what<br/>
&gt; one or 2 are the best pleas?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One other question.I am close to 24th level. I am finding that I cant get<br/>
&gt; all the ruins I need to make each levels spells. I know you all have that<br/>
&gt; problem. Was wondering if any one know&#39;s some one on the Innourkk server<br/>
&gt; that sells spells?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s RUNES first of all. And second of all, I&#39;m level 25 and I already<br/>
have all my runes for all my 29 spells (doubles in most cases, in case I<br/>
fail) and many runes for 34 and 39. <br/>
<br/>
How? <br/>
<br/>
I just have a hot button that auctions that I&#39;m buying runes and I click<br/>
it every time I enter a zone and every 10 minutes or so later as I stay<br/>
in the zone. All these runes I got from high levels who have tons of<br/>
them and just want to get rid of them. I usually traded or bought most.<br/>
<br/>
A good idea about research is to put all points possible each level into<br/>
it. Personally, I&#39;ve made all possible spells, some twice, and I&#39;ve only<br/>
failed twice, maybe three times. Each time you try there is a chance<br/>
your skill will go up too.<br/>
