<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039007982">According to mstokes:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Enchanters are great for debuffing the mob (When they aren&#39;t resisted) But<br/>
&gt; they really lack in doing damage to a mob.  Keeping in mind that both<br/>
&gt; wizards and enchanters are limited by the 6 Level cap rule, so we are<br/>
&gt; talking low red, high yellows here, I would rather place my bets with a<br/>
&gt; wizard than an enchanter.  Wizards, can burn a mob to down to 1/3 - 1/2 of<br/>
&gt; its life chaining DD&#39;s (Even if they are 1 circle down due to matching<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It usually doesn&#39;t matter, as the enchanter will start with an Enthrall or<br/>
similar, proceed slowly to debuff the mob, then &quot;release the dogs&quot; and let<br/>
damage flow.<br/>
<br/>
Enchanter are not damage dealer. They&#39;re riot control. Wizards are<br/>
damage dealers; they&#39;re downtime reducers.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Typically not. Charm works wonders, again in riot situations, when you get<br/>
jumped on by a crowd of hostiles. Everyone attacks one, enchanter charms<br/>
one, use it to dispatch same or a third one. But working with an enchanter<br/>
requires discipline from all party members, while working with a wizard<br/>
requires discipline from the wizard himself :)<br/>
