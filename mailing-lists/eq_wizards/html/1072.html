I&#39;m a lvl 8 wizard (almost 9) and I just lost my SR. apprentice robe to 3rd lvl befallen, since I followed my friend down the well entrance and I got killed. I asked a friendly high level shaman if he could get my stuff and he did, except he couldn&#39;t get the robe since it&#39;s a sr apprentice robe. I don&#39;t really mind being without a robe, but was wondering if I should buy another sr. apprentice robe (that&#39;d mean leaving antonica and heading back to ak&#39;anon to get one that fits me) or just wait till I&#39;m strong enough to get the other robe that you speak of?<br/>
