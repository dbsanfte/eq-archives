<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246186245">Yes that Colorado thing was in poor taste, but that describes my sense of<br/>
humor so oh well.  Secondly the spell Halo of light can be bought in the<br/>
Temple of life in Qeynos.  As for Wizard spells the library and tower of the<br/>
crimson hands in Erudin have a HUGE selction of spells, in fact the only<br/>
spell i have&#39;nt found is eye of zomm.  Hope this helps whomever asked.<br/>
