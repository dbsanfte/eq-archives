<div id="ygrps-yiv-1627384384">I don&#39;t believe you can create your own spells with research.  Research is<br/>
your ability to create spell scrolls from ingrediants.  You get the<br/>
ingrediants from books that are sold in your respective wizard guilds.<br/>
(possibly there are rare books which can only be found out in the world as<br/>
well)  These books are written in obscure languages though, so to use your<br/>
research skill you will first have to practise your languages, so that you<br/>
will be able to read the books with the ingrediants listed in them.<br/>
