<div id="ygrps-yiv-891741107"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I meant what one-handed blunt would be the next step.  I have used the 2H<br/>
 </span></blockquote>blunt with my other wizard characters and am familiar with the order they<br/>
go.  I am planning to use 1H for second hand items and writhing staff.<br/>
Sorry for the inconvenience.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Your next step would be to get the Slime Crystal Staff in Runnyeye, Water<br/>
Crystal Staff from the aqua goblin in Lake Rathe, then the Ice Crystal Staff<br/>
from the Scryer(I think) in Permafrost. Then you move on to Solusek where<br/>
you get the Staff of Fire on the A side and the Staff of Writhing on the B<br/>
side.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that is what you were looking for.<br/>
<br/>
Yours,<br/>
