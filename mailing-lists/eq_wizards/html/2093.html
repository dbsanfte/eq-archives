<div id="ygrps-yiv-123114601">According to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:dayne@...">dayne@...</a>:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Dayne IS NOT capable of soloing most blues, nor some greens. It IS<br/>
&gt; that simple. Root holds about 50% of the time. BLUES resist about 25%<br/>
&gt; of my spells.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I beg to differ. I&#39;m not 12, I&#39;m 11th, and I can solo and take:<br/>
	Orc Centurions, Lions, Lioness (East Commonlands)<br/>
	Sand Scarabs (North Ro)<br/>
<br/>
I have a single piece of woven, and no other fancy equipment. I rely on my<br/>
trusty worn great staff. All these were taken with moderate ease<br/>
(meaning I usually end up at 50% mana and 40% life), but I never engage<br/>
unless I&#39;m full on both ranges.<br/>
<br/>
It is true my spells get a partial resistance, and I usually have to cast<br/>
three of four times before one goes uninterrupted, but this almost always<br/>
work. I can&#39;t solo Kodiaks - about same level - however. These guys seem<br/>
to do damage more consistently, and I have to escape. The only centurions<br/>
that I won&#39;t touch are those with slashing weapons - if a centurion has<br/>
a two-handed sword, I&#39;m almost dead.<br/>
