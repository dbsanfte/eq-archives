<b>Subject:</b> Kill Stealing <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-717148485">You guys don&#39;t seem to understand why some of us (such as myself) kill<br/>
steal all the time.  IT IS BECAUSE WE CANNOT FIND GROUPS !!!  simple as that.<br/>
no groups, KS !  thats it.  I don&#39;t feel like sitting on my ass for 30 - 40 min<br/>
waiting for ppl to group, while shouting all the time.<br/>
<br/>
1) people hate us for shouting so much<br/>
2) people don&#39;t message us even if they need group member (weird)<br/>
<br/>
     You ppl who are against kill stealers by shouting their names out so no one<br/>
will group them are so god damn stupid, all you have to do is group with them<br/>
and BINGO !! no more kill stealing.   If i am getting good xp , why kill steal<br/>
??  there is no point for me to risk my life trying to get xp from some monster<br/>
6 others are beating up on.  I rarely die in a group since I stand so far back,<br/>
but while kill stealing if i beat them up too much, the mob might run to me with<br/>
no one else helping.   If you really want to stop kill stealing, then just group<br/>
with those people so you guys can take on higher mobs together.   I would<br/>
happily stop KS anytime during the day to Group with ppl passing by.  I only KS<br/>
while waiting for groups and i do shout for groups while i KS as well.<br/>
People are stupid and don&#39;t know how to stop a problem,  oh well... what can you<br/>
do ?</div>
