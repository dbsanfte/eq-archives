<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930619990">Well, I met a lvl 40 wizard yesterday who desired to learn a language, and in the course of teaching him we ended up conversing for several hours, seeing the world via Evac, and I teaching him all I knew in the art of language. <br/>
<br/>
Tho I didnt ask for anything in return, he gave me a sack of runes and a staff of writhing. Ive been piercing for so long (95) my 1hblunt is 31, and so the staff isnt much use to me, while the runes definitely are! But I think the best thing I got was his time, companionship and advice. <br/>

Languages are useful because they allow you to meet other people that you might not have before.<br/>

&gt;You got them *all* maxed?  Impressive!  I&#39;ve only mastered all the research <br/>
&gt;languages including such things as elder dragon and erudian.  But I&#39;m in no <br/>
&gt;way inclined to go through the trouble of getting some of the evil race <br/>
&gt;languages up like Orcs and Gnoll languages. :P<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually I got to excelent in all the languages a while back, it wasn&#39;t<br/>
being bored.  It was in the hopes that verant would put in quest that<br/>
required you to speak to the NPC is a specific language to be able to<br/>
converse with them.  Wishful thinking on my part. But it would give those<br/>
languages a use. :)<br/>
