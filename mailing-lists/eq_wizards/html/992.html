<div id="ygrps-yiv-1820845368">What good is this spell... I have never seen the damage on it so on that I<br/>
cannot comment.  However, if wizards are never suppose to tank... what good<br/>
is a PB area effect spell?  It is tough enough having every monster in an<br/>
area attack you when you area effect spell them at range... much less at PB.<br/>
Will some one give me some insight into this spell and others like it (PB<br/>
area damage)?<br/>
