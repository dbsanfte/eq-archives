<div id="ygrps-yiv-240595586">Here is the poormans way to make a tarnished dagger.  Put one sharpening stone<br/>
(4cp), and one rusty dagger (free) into a forge and click combine.  At a zero<br/>
skill level you have roughly a 50/50 shot of making a tarnished dagger.  It<br/>
won&#39;t seel for anymore than a rusty dagger, but it raises your smithing skill<br/>
for the heck of it, and it gives you something to do with all those daggers you<br/>
get fishing.  They sell for nothing anyway.<br/>
I believe the stats on the tarnished dagger are 22/3as opposed to 24/3.<br/>

Do any bakers out there know what you need to combine meat and bread to make a<br/>
sandwich.<br/>
