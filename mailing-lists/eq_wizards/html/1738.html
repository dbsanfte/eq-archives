    Hello everyone,<br/>
         I am a  High Elve Wizard approaching level 16 where I have been looking forward to starting on Research. I always belived that research would become a valuable trade skill for me. However, as more information is becoming available about research, it looks to me that research will not be a viable platinum maker. So far I have heard that if you cannot find the runes(which seem to be very rare) you have to buy them, which makes the cost of the spell more than if you just go buy it. Now I have heard that there are a few spells that are research only. In those cases, if you succeed in creating that spell, could you then sell it to another wizzard, or is it automaticcaly place in your spell book? I guess what I want to know is, is anyone making (or gonna make in the future) any money outta research? It would be great if we wizzards could also research spells of the other classes and then be able to use them ourselves. Is anyone having any luck with any other trade skill? I was considering trying tinkering untill I heard that tinkering is available only to gnomes.<br/>
        Thanks for any thoughts on this matter<br/>
