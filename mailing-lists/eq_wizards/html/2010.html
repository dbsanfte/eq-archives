<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503715230">hrmm. maybe it will get better for me. i havent exactly kept track, but i do<br/>
think that my force shock gets resisted about 1 out of every 4 casts (blue<br/>
mobs).  it does seem to work much better if i start with flame shock and<br/>
finish with force shock (maybe the mobs MR goes down as his health goes<br/>
down???).  when enstill does stick, i find that a force shock will knock<br/>
them right out of it. go figure???  but im not complaining, as i am still<br/>
very satisfied with my flame shock which practically never gets resisted,<br/>
and root stilll seems to stick 9 out of 10 times (tho it doesnt stick for<br/>
the duration of the fight anymore).  thats great that frost shock doesnt<br/>
have to recharge. my flame shock doesnt seem to be doing enough dmg at lvl<br/>
23 now (well, it is only a lvl 16 spell being used at lvl 23)...<br/>
<br/>
ps. anybody know of a better 2h blunt we can use than the rts in the mid<br/>
20&#39;s lvl range? i picked up a glowing wooden crook this morning, but we cant<br/>
use :(<br/>

&gt;&gt; yeah. how embarrassing is it to have to tell ur group that we cant fight<br/>
&gt;&gt; reds because our spells wont work???  that should be top priority on<br/>
&gt;&gt; anything we send to verant.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; side note: if anybody reading this has made it to lvl 24 and used frost<br/>
&gt;&gt; shock, please let me (or us) know if the resists for this spell are just<br/>
&gt;as<br/>
&gt;&gt; bad as force shock and enstill.  I must say that force shock and enstill<br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt;&gt; the only two spells i use regularly on blues and greens that get resisted<br/>
&gt;&gt; regularly (this is seperate from the resists we get on reds which is<br/>
&gt;another<br/>
&gt;&gt; issue altogether).  so maybe it&#39;s not a resist issue, but more of a<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;     that sounds good,  but I think we need to bring up the resist spells<br/>
&gt;&gt; bug,  in a small party to medium party, there is no problem,  but in a<br/>
&gt;party<br/>
&gt;&gt; of 6, you take on high red mob&#39;s,  and all the other class can contribute<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;&gt; the party in some way even if there spells can not effect the mob,  but<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;&gt; wizard class is left standing there with nothing to help out the party.<br/>

&gt;&gt;         Okay, before the Verant text thing, I posted that we should and<br/>
&gt;try<br/>
&gt;&gt; to get one (1) thing changed.  Then people posted they wanted a ton of<br/>
&gt;stuff<br/>
&gt;&gt; to change.  Then I posted a ton of stuff and now they are saying post<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;         Actually, we sound just like a bunch of bickering Wizards, heh, I<br/>
&gt;&gt; can just picture us all in a dimly lit lecturing hall, trying to figure<br/>
&gt;out<br/>
&gt;&gt; how to best approach the Master Wizard and tell him his spells suck,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt; Verant SOMETHING.  Seran is right, I just read on eq.stratics.com that<br/>
&gt;they<br/>
&gt;&gt; are working on Specialization and it should be implemented in a couple of<br/>
&gt;&gt; weeks.  So no use bugging them for that.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;         If we are only going for a couple of things I would go for :<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;         Meditate Skill cap of 7 rather than 5 - reason:  Hey, come on,<br/>
&gt;they<br/>
&gt;&gt; took away 2 points from our combat abilities, at least they could give it<br/>
&gt;&gt; back to us for mana, right?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;         Line of Sight Fade and Shadowstep spells with set minimum<br/>
&gt;&gt; distances - reason: Well, I came up with it originally (ahem, blush) and<br/>
&gt;it<br/>
&gt;&gt; would serve a dual purpose of being a good escape spell and help with<br/>
&gt;lower<br/>
&gt;&gt; level travel, both of which are things we Wizards could desperately use.<br/>
