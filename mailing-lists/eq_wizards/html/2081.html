I have to agree whole heartedly with this statment. Most people here do have problems :)<br/>
<br/>
As to familiars I for one do not want anything like this to go through. I play both a magician lvl 16 and a wizard lvl 19 on rodcet nife server.I dont think the wizard should ever have any type of pet. I started playing a wiz because i hated nedding to stop and summon my pet ever load and having to worry that my pet would not follow me exactly and train me. Pets are a big hassle that it dont want to deal with as a wizard.<br/>
<br/>
Of course this is just my opinion i could be wrong.</div>
