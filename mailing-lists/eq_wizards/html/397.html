    Is there anyone out there that calls Karana their home that speak Old<br/>
Erudian?  I have put about 20-30 points into it now and find I am all alone<br/>
is this work for people to talk to in it.  If someone about my skill would<br/>
like to start trading off points to help build the skill please let me know.<br/>
We are going to need this skill soon peolpe (me in 2 lvls) so lets all help<br/>
each other out.  Once I get to a point where I can read the books I will<br/>
start teaching others the language.<br/>
