<div id="ygrps-yiv-939915659">Well, I would personally love to have you run a part of EQFreaks, but alas,<br/>
Albryno setup the server WITHOUT CGI-Scripting :( only the crappy Microsoft ASP<br/>
scripts are available, I have been looking for this instant update sorta thing<br/>
in an ASP script also, if anyone knows where to get one, lemme know! I know a<br/>
good place for a CGI script if you want it, and its free<br/>

&gt; I wish to create a &quot;Tome of Magi Lor&quot; web page. If you have or know where I<br/>
&gt; can get a CGI/HTML script that will allow others to add their comments to<br/>
&gt; this web page please let me know. What I am looking for is a CGI data base<br/>
&gt; that allows external entries to be added then automatically updates a FAQ<br/>
&gt; sheet. The automatic part is a must cause I like to play EQ too much to get<br/>
&gt; stuck updating a web page. I can screen the page and omit others. I would<br/>
&gt; really like a CIG data base that would allow me to have a login and password<br/>
&gt; security that way those pesky fighters could not steal information. Also I<br/>
&gt; would be able to track who said what about quests or items to glean more<br/>
&gt; info from then if needed.<br/>
