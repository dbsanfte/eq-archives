&gt; According to Cristie:<br/>
&gt; &gt; You can get some woven armor or damask... we pretty much have to stick to<br/>
&gt; &gt; cloth types but they are much better for certain.  I think we are able to<br/>

small cloth.  So if you are a small race, don&#39;t waste your time.  Woven is<br/>
heavier than cloth.  It generally has a 1 or 2 AC advantage over cloth per<br/>
piece.  Woven is found rarely on Frogloc Foragers, and Kolbold Hunters in<br/>
Innothule.  Innothule is also a great place for loot (armor, giant snake fangs,<br/>
no people) and experience for a level 10 person.  It is about a fifteen minute<br/>
walk from Freeport.  Before you go there, purchase all the bear hide armor<br/>
pieces from the Millers in Qeynos Hills.  You can&#39;t beat Bear Hide AC and I<br/>
believe it is wearable by all classes(If somebody could verify this, I&#39;d<br/>
appreciate it)  You may also want to hunt some Elite Guards in BB before you<br/>
go.  Their Neckbands sell pretty good in Freeport.  When/if you head back to<br/>
Qeynos, stock up on Giant snake fangs.  There are like 3 giant snakes in the<br/>
Qeynos area, and you can&#39;t walk 5 feet without stepping on one in the Freeport<br/>
area.<br/>
