<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110932736">Just wondering how other people feel about our Wizard class. It seems to me<br/>
that we are short-changed compared to magicians and necromancers, whose<br/>
spells seem a lot better, and can have &quot;pets&quot; fight for them. It&#39;s also<br/>
hard to make signifant amounts of money to buy spells. I still like the<br/>
game, just wondered if anyone else felt the same way.<br/>
