<b>Subject:</b> Re: What do you think about a few new spells <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-917207078">I have made a feedback folder in my mail program. I will be adding this<br/>
post to it. Any other ideas that people have that we should ask Verant<br/>
for, please send to the list and mark it as such. I will then gather<br/>
these ideas into one request including our validations for them. This<br/>
way we can all send the same request to Verant and we can show them that<br/>
Wizards have voices too! (not only Enchanters)<br/>
<br/>
We also should discuss each and come to consensus on the most important<br/>
ones. That way we dont come off as greedy and want to do everything,<br/>
we&#39;re just looking for a little balance. For example, I think pets/buffs<br/>
are right out as they do not go in line with our class ideals. But we<br/>
should be able to expand on our strengths to make us a bit more unique<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Summon - Teleports group member inside the zone to your location<br/>
&gt; Phase - Teleports yourself to location of other group member inside zone<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Excellent ideas and good names too :P <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Greater Summon - Teleports group member to your location, even across zones <br/>
&gt; Greater Phase - Teleports yourself to a group members location, even across zones<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While these would be nice, I fear they can be taken advantage of and<br/>
thus Verant may not be open to them. These spells could be used to<br/>
teleport everyone everywhere. One of the goals of Verant is to make the<br/>
landmass seem large and thus not have instant teleportation everywhere.<br/>
Any way we could make them less able to be abused?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Group Gate - Slow casting spell which teleports group to your bind spot, doesn&#39;t leave anyone behind<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like this one because it is limited to one bind spot. YOUR bind spot.<br/>
But it can be very handy :)<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Retreat - Evacuate version of group gate<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Would this one leave anyone behind? I think all evacuates have that 1%<br/>
chance.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Haste - Increases movement rate for self only.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a VERY good suggestion. All other suggestions for wizards<br/>
getting SoW I have rejected because that reduces druids/shamans<br/>
uniqueness. Plus, wizards aren&#39;t in tune with wolves, they are more<br/>
inclined to nuke them! But this is limited to self only, so it helps us<br/>
but doesn&#39;t interfere too much with SoW&#39;s usefulness :)<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to seeing other classes get some or all of these spells, such as magicians getting Summon, Clerics Phase, druids group gate, etc.  As a wizard, with my teleportation spells, I never bind myself in the city anymore, now generally only at a zone border, for quick pick up when I get a bit too active with my burns.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Splitting these spells among the other casting classes is a good idea as<br/>
well. But I also think that wizards don&#39;t have much that is truly unique<br/>
about them. We have blast, but other casters have too to lesser degree.<br/>
We have teleport but druids have to equal/lesser degree. Shouldn&#39;t we<br/>
have somethings that no other casters get?<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Phase and Summon would be just terribly useful, as quite often the puller sometimes grabs a bit more then he can chew, where the magician, wizard, whatever can pull his bacon out of the fire so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We will be the ones who can bring home the bacon then :P<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Phase also would be quite useful, as the wizard, I generally get delegated to go on town runs (by the way, great way of making money, buy silver/copper for plat, various weapons.  Just gate back to the bank, or the nearest gate to your town and sell sell sell) and sometimes my group wandered off somewhere, or I don&#39;t want to run through nasties to get to my group.  So far I lost about half a level in Najena as I&#39;ve discovered Orges can see invis.  It would be nice not having to deal with them.<br/>
