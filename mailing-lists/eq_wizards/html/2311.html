<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087326055">I heard or read somewhere that the skull when combined with two rubies would<br/>
create an item usable by a Wizard.  One ruby is suppose to be located in the<br/>
Innothule Swamp on a Troll npc I believe.  The other I am not sure.  If<br/>
anyone has completed this quest I&#39;d like to know what the outcome was.  I<br/>
plan on attempting this quest as soon as I make a few more levels.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

I just bought a Hollow Skull. Got it on an impulse for 5pp, not really<br/>
knowing what it&#39;s for.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a container with two spots and a combine button. Does anyone have<br/>
any idea what it&#39;s for?<br/>
