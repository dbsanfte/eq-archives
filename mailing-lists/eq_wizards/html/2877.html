<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533916932">One-You should read up on what you are trying to combine.  It makes for a reduction in &#39;these items don&#39;t combine&#39; messages.<br/>
<br/>
Two-I have never had to use paper and quill to make spells.  Runes were sufficient enough for me.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, this stuff works (and hope the paper and quill thing is something I missed for certain spells).<br/>
