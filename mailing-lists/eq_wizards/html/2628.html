<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-720893241">Hmm there are many possible nice things with wizard but i think we will<br/>
have to wait a bit until they are done well and make some rumor. All other<br/>
have get significant buffs and yet they were much easier to play then wizard!<br/>
Wizard is hard to play but i like it very much but verant don&#39;t have very<br/>
well defined a ruole of wizard, they tok from wizard too much to create<br/>
other classes, and leaved it without much spell combination possibilitys<br/>
you have  to get your best DD spells, some low spell to give final strikes,<br/>
your best root, skin, and every now and then change one slot to cast buffs.<br/>
- Enchanter with buffs, debuffs, int bosting, mana bosting, luul, pets is<br/>
realy great to make diferent aproachs they are also only enchant metal caster. <br/>
- Magician have nearly our fire power it is lillte bit slower but have a<br/>
pet summon food, water, bags no weight, damage shields, ect. <br/>
- Necro rules in his solo play but is a litlle bit hampered with starting<br/>
factions. <br/>
- Wizard is master dimensional traveler, Direct damage dealer (fastest of<br/>
them all and do bigest visible hits, wich is most dangerus thing in game as<br/>
monsters get pissed fast and go on you!), wizard is also one of best<br/>
rooters. But wizard deal best with one blu 2 gets you run for your life,<br/>
white will vaste all your mana if and it is realy if you can win and yellow<br/>
never dream about it. <br/>
<br/>
But to say wizard class at later lv are very nice with teleports you realy<br/>
can go to sell from middle of dungeon travel fast, this is one nice<br/>
advantage. You deal much damage and any god group know to aprecite this,<br/>
god group you know very fast if you miss a hit they will leve all and try<br/>
to get a MOB from you. If they leave you to deal with it alone more then<br/>
once my advise is to get out of group fast.<br/>

&gt;I know that the purpose of the wizard class is to do heavy damage quickly.<br/>
&gt;A friend of mine was telling me that mages do almost the same damage plus<br/>
&gt;they have a pet to fight for them.  He does close dmg to me now at lvl 20.<br/>
&gt;He says at lvl 49 mages do lava bolt which does 950 whereas ice comet does<br/>
&gt;1100.  That is almost the same damage as the wizard.  So it seems to me<br/>
&gt;that there isn&#39;t much of a use to be a wizard if you can be a mage and do<br/>
&gt;almost the same amount of direct damage plus you have a pet.  So anyone<br/>
&gt;tell me something good about the wiz class to make it worth playing them to<br/>
&gt;high levels?<br/>
