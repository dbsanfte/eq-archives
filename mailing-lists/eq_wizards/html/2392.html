<b>Subject:</b> Re: A nice group fight i&#39;d like to share... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506227281">Well in the 1 fight I wasnt really needed since it was against undead and we<br/>
had a number of clerics in the group. But it was<br/>
<br/>
- me, a ol&#39; lvl 31 wizard<br/>
- lvl 41 cleric<br/>
- lvl 39 cleric<br/>
- lvl 41 warrior<br/>
- lvl 41 shaman<br/>
<br/>
And a solo necro that was causing some fuss. Anyways, our group was sitting<br/>
around and fighting Specters in the Ferrott, then I guess a solo necro was<br/>
getting bored or kiting or something and started to spook undead or just<br/>
something. But for some reason one specter after another came flowing out of<br/>
the cave. At the end of the fight we killed about 5 of them in a row. Was<br/>
rather fun.<br/>
<br/>
Another fun fight, is when I was in a tae tower group. We had a zealot,<br/>
fanatic, protector and a judicator or something and a few other things. I<br/>
went all out on the judi since it can heal the others and it&#39;s self. The<br/>
clerics and warriors bashs&#39;s / stuns interupted it perfectly and I nuked it,<br/>
I sat down and med. Got back up, lobb&#39;d off a few more spells at the other<br/>
monsters, sat, med. Lobbed off more, stat down and med. When I got back up a<br/>
defender had joined the mess and there was a prot fanatic and defender left.<br/>
I popped off 2 column of lightnings (130 dmg per mob for about 130 mana),<br/>
then sat and meditate. ( I had a nice dosage of clarity from an enchanter so<br/>
I was getting mana fast)<br/>
<br/>
anyways it was rather fun and I enjoyed it and actually got to use my area<br/>
effect spells =) at the end I was OOM tanks about half health cleric OOM.<br/>
<br/>
OOoh! another fight that we didnt win but no one died. Me and my friends<br/>
were exploring the keep of Permafrost, a lvl 50 druid asked us if we had<br/>
ever killed the king, it has some good things and we are about the right lvl<br/>
to do it. We say &#39;no, where does he spawn?&#39; and he showed us the room that<br/>
the king spawned in. So we got ready and proceded to clear out the room<br/>
leading upto the king. This fight went quite well and the wizards were<br/>
needed to out damage the healing of the mobs,. So we sat down and rested.<br/>
Then for some reason our bard and 1 wizard had to go afk for like 15 or 20<br/>
mins. So we sat there, waiting, and waiting, and waiting. It got rather<br/>
dull, but then they finnaly came back. Problem tho - the whole area has<br/>
respawned. So we carfully plan our next attack. The warrior plunks off an<br/>
arrow at a mob standing on a ledge. It runs down and around the back of the<br/>
room picking up ALOT of mobs on the way.<br/>
<br/>
So we start to fight, it was quite the fight. I was blasting out spells so<br/>
was the other wizard, using AE spells, the cleric doing 100% healing on the<br/>
tanks, the paladin healing and tanking, had to use LOH one. The bard lulling<br/>
and charming as much as he can. We finnaly realize that we are being over<br/>
whelemd. We couldnt take out the healing mobs fast enough to keep going. We<br/>
had a few dead but low on mana for the others and the tanks were getting<br/>
weak. So the tanks yell &quot;evac evac evac&quot;, but ack! both wizards are low on<br/>
mana. I tell the other wizard to sit and med, I toss off a few more spells<br/>
then start to beat them with my staff. ( these mobs were casting AE wind<br/>
spells that shifted us around which added to the confusion). Anyways, the<br/>
wizard finnaly has enough mana for evac and she starts to yell &quot;stand close&quot;<br/>
over and over. I dart towards her, I enter her gate just seconds before it<br/>
kicks in. We all land in north kanara with everyone at about half health and<br/>
saying congrats to everyone. We did not win the fight but it was the most<br/>
fun any of us had had in a long time.<br/>
<br/>
Well thats all I got for for now. But wizards are just to much fun =)</div>
