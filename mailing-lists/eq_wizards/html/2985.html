<div id="ygrps-yiv-728708336">Yes, I totally agree with you.  Who&#39;s NOT going to camp for things like <br/>
JBoots?  :)  &quot;Tension&quot; is a good word to describe the amount of shouting <br/>
I&#39;ve heard in areas where people camp for 8-hour long stretches.  heh<br/>
<br/>
I think the other ideas I&#39;ve heard are pretty good... level or class <br/>
restrictions.  I don&#39;t necessarily agree that it&#39;s a good idea to make <br/>
things rare just for the sake of merchantability (is that a word? heh, you <br/>
know what I mean I hope).  I think that only encourages the camping behavior <br/>
that we&#39;re trying to address.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if Verant is even considering these issues..anybody know?  I hate <br/>
to be resigned to say that &quot;this stuff happens all the time in MUDs and you <br/>
can&#39;t do anything about it&quot;....there HAS to be a way!  :)<br/>
I&#39;m just too clueless to think of a way right now....<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I mean evryone want those good items and nothing is gona stop them, so <br/>
&gt;sooner or<br/>
&gt;later ppl will have em. So Veerrant cant keep those items away from ppl <br/>
&gt;couse<br/>
&gt;they want it, they are just making more tension in game with making things <br/>
&gt;lore<br/>
&gt;item and no drop. Couse then we will see those lv 45-50 ppl coming to <br/>
&gt;Najena to<br/>
&gt;get Jboots if they havent before or lost them. B </span></blockquote></div>
