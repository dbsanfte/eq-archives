<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439404191">A lot of them are available from the server selection screen.  If you click<br/>
on news, it will give you the updates going back quite a while.  Farther<br/>
back than that, though, I&#39;m not sure.  You could try the official Everquest<br/>
site; they might have some older ones.  And you can also try Everquest<br/>
Stratics.  They have archived news.  If you scroll down to the very bottom<br/>
of their main page, there is a link to archived news.  I don&#39;t know how far<br/>
back it goes, but the last time I needed to look something up I seem to<br/>
remember it going back several months.  Their pages always list the updates<br/>
that the patch server prints out, so you might find them all there.  They<br/>
are at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eqss.stratics.com/">http://eqss.stratics.com/</a>    Hope this helps.<br/>

&gt; I went away for the summer and am finally back, but to my regret, when I<br/>
&gt; updated my EQ, it only listed the most recent updates and I have no clue<br/>
&gt; what has gone on in the past 3 months! I also decided to join a pvp-teams<br/>
&gt; server but I don&#39;t even know the teams! Anyone know where I could get a<br/>
list<br/>
&gt; of all the updates? Thanks, Lott.<br/>
