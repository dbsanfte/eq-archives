<div id="ygrps-yiv-453832154">Walk through the entry tunnel from your &quot;zone in&quot; point.  It will open up a<br/>
bit and have walls on right and left.  Pick a wall and stay close to the<br/>
zone.  Stay along the wall as the trains that go by will not see you there<br/>
unless you are silly enough to attack it.  From there send a scout a bit<br/>
further up to pull out death beetle and tormented dead...jack o lanterns and<br/>
gtr skels.  DeaTH BEETLES will con yellow around level 10.<br/>

&gt; Your friend should never have tried Unrest at lvl 10.  From lvl 12 on is a<br/>
&gt; good time to start.  As I mentioned in an earlier post, only myself and a<br/>
&gt; cleric friend went there at lvl 12 and gained 4 lvls in 2 days.  Just stay<br/>
&gt; in the courtyard and kill Death Beetles, Tormented Dead, Greater<br/>
Skeletons,<br/>
&gt; Jack o Laterns, and the occasional Ghoul, if your friend has any magical<br/>
&gt; attacks.  Also, don&#39;t be afraid when you con the Death Beetles and they<br/>
turn<br/>
&gt; out to be blue, that you waited too long.  For some reason, the Death<br/>
&gt; Beetles give out excellent xp and I was still gaining decent xp off of<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; at lvl 16.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On another note, Unrest is a great place to revist once you hit 20th or<br/>
so.<br/>
&gt; The house has mobs anywhere from 18th lvl up to 36th lvl.  Again, great xp<br/>
&gt; and awesome loot, they drop fine steel weapons, bloodstained armor, and<br/>
&gt; bronze plate mail.  So for any of you that have reached the higher lvls<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; are looking for a place to hunt, Unrest is better than most ;)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, on someone&#39;s advice, forget whom it was, but I made the trip to<br/>
&gt; &gt; Kaladim to plumb the depths of Unrest. I&#39;m 14th level and just coming<br/>
into<br/>
&gt; &gt; my power right now. Right now the rest of the people in my group are<br/>
&gt; between<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3-5 levels below me. So I figure I&#39;ll just solo and get xps slower, but<br/>
&gt; also<br/>
&gt; &gt; not hinder their progress either. Where should I go? I&#39;ve gone to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; chessboard and killed pawns, bishops and their annoying pets, as well as<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; odd King that shows up. A dwarven friend of mine was telling me how his<br/>
6<br/>
&gt; &gt; member lvl 10 party was completely wiped out in Unrest down to the last<br/>
&gt; man.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I made the following conclusions:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; a. Unrest is nasty<br/>
&gt; &gt; b. My dwarven friend&#39;s party is stupid for not running from something<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; &gt; can&#39;t win<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I can admire going out gloriously next to your comrade, but not when<br/>
death<br/>
&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t permanent.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So, question, if I take my group into unrest what should I be looking to<br/>
&gt; &gt; kill? Is there somwhere else that is nearby that I should go instead? My<br/>
&gt; &gt; dwarf friend said to hit the steamfonts, suggestions?<br/>
