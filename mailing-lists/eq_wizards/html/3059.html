<div id="ygrps-yiv-1543177883">Lim but it is....If you always got the item then you wouldnt have any kinda <br/>
pride or anything about it and everyone would have one I like to be one of <br/>
the only people with stuff like our guild we would go and get all the items <br/>
on server first and we wouild keep them no selling and we kept them as <br/>
trophys....Like we had first writhing staff...mithril breastplate...we had <br/>
first gm event and we got mithrila rmor out of it...WHich my picture was on <br/>
the vault for it  :) we got first bone armor we got first full suit of <br/>
crafted and first rubicite armor...And no one is allowed to sell any of <br/>
it...it took a long time to get all the stuff and it should be the same <br/>
always Thats why items are RARE. It would be so dumb the other way.  In fear <br/>
plane you get something nice every loot practically...to bad fear planes down <br/>
when its back to normal Ill renew my account so please tlel whne its back to <br/>
normal</div>
