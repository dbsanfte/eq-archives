<div id="ygrps-yiv-168830837">I wish to add that a god web page must have also a cast time of a spell.<br/>
and it will be nice to have near also lv of chanaling and evocation spell<br/>
skill in moment of misuration i think it will not be same for a lv 40 and<br/>
lv 20 wiz to cast a same spell. As i understand many class balances in<br/>
combat are also conected to this very important time to cast component.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m looking for a web page which lists the complete wizard spells including<br/>
&gt;spell effects, mana cost and if an offensive spell, the damage it does.  I<br/>
&gt;am a level 21 Erudite wiz(Euros) playing on Rallos Zek.  From what I gather,<br/>
&gt;the level 24 wizard DD spell Frost Shock does around 200 dmg for 110 mana.<br/>
&gt;If this is the case, it sounds to me like this is the level where we<br/>
&gt;wizard&#39;s start to mature.  That damage/mana ratio is very, very good.<br/>
&gt;Nearly as good as DOT&#39;s.  Can any higher level Wizzies out there confirm<br/>
&gt;this?  Also the 20th level spell Force Shock does great damage yet is<br/>
&gt;resisted too often by &quot;dangerous&quot; blues and higher mobs to be my exclusive<br/>
&gt;high damage spell.  Does this trend of high resistance continue as we get to<br/>
&gt;higher levels?  Or is Force Shock some kind of special case?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
