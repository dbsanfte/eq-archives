 </span></blockquote>According to what I&#39;ve heard, yes - D&#39;Vinn is Dorn&#39;s brother, not sure who<br/>
is older though.  And I believe D&#39;Vinn is an ambassador of Neriak (or maybe<br/>
just the Indigo Brotherhood specifically).  Rumor has it that he has a pet<br/>
running around in Befallen, though what a rogue is doing with a pet I have<br/>
no idea.<br/>
