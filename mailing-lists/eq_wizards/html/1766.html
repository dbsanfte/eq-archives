<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062029155">I regret that at the time I was doing this, talking between you both, while <br/>
both nearly identical in skill, causes only wasted bandwith.  The changes <br/>
aren&#39;t apparent until someone zones, a bug that needs fixing.  that is the <br/>
reason for the zoning.  Without the changes being registered, you are still <br/>
not technically as good as your partner, therefore you talking to him does no <br/>
good.  Maybe they fixed that bug, as I have retired from teaching a few days <br/>
ago.<br/>
