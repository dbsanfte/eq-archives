<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485733477">When you are finished Meditating and stand up the warriors are just finished <br/>
resting back there HP&#39;s. This means that if they must wait for you then you <br/>
are casting too much. I only start nuking if I see a targeted warrior drop <br/>
below 1/2 his health, and we do not have a healer. Then when the party is <br/>
healing themselves I am Meditating and we tend to finish at same time. This <br/>
way they do not feel I am a burden but rather a savior when I really let <br/>
lose my power to save them.<br/>
