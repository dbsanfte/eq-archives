&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am currently in the process of creating a Wizard<br/>
&gt; Guild on Karana.<br/>
&gt; We have half of the members necessary to send in our<br/>
&gt; info to Verant. We have<br/>
&gt; many plans on the basis of this guild.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sick of having to deal with the KS&#39;ing reputation<br/>
&gt; that Wizards have? We will<br/>
&gt; help others who are having problems with ANY KS&#39;ers<br/>
&gt; and promote Wizards&#39;<br/>
&gt; abilities in a very positive manner.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sick of having less-than-ideal equipment because no<br/>
&gt; one cares that you want<br/>
&gt; to go to location X to get item Y? I have grouped<br/>
&gt; with many Wizards at once,<br/>
&gt; we get the items that we want that no one else cares<br/>
&gt; about. We have<br/>
&gt; developed very effective strategies that doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have any down time that you<br/>
&gt; think a group of wizards would have. Also, I believe<br/>
&gt; that there is anything<br/>
&gt; wrong with GIVING fellow Wizards hand-me-downs<br/>
&gt; (making sure that the item in<br/>
&gt; question isn&#39;t too powerful for person in question).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We always GIVE extra runes or extra spells (which<br/>
&gt; ever the person prefers)<br/>
&gt; to those who need them.<br/>
&gt; This is the only problem that Wizards have with<br/>
&gt; joining this guild. Some<br/>
&gt; feel that they are given more runes by being<br/>
&gt; surrounded by those who don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; need them. I totally agree with them.<br/>
&gt; I totally feel, however, that this disadvantage is<br/>
&gt; far out-weighed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; These are just some of the main focuses of our<br/>
&gt; guild.<br/>
&gt; If you have any comments or suggestions or desire to<br/>
&gt; join, PLEASE email me.<br/>
&gt; I love to hear what people think about this guild.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, if you want to start a Wizard guild on a<br/>
&gt; different server, email me<br/>
&gt; and I will give you all kinds of info and help to<br/>
&gt; get you started.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for reading,<br/>
&gt; Telor<br/>
