&gt; Why is everyone so quiet lately?  Trying to finish that dumb quest for the<br/>
&gt; cloak? hehe.  Has anyone done it yet?  I think it&#39;s really no big deal so<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sweating it yet, but it would be a nice accomplishment to do it<br/>
&gt; anyway.  I think I&#39;m going to pass up the extra AC and just try for that<br/>
&gt; Molten Cloak instead.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; By the way, 29th level is one heck of a fun set of spells.  I&#39;m not using<br/>
&gt; the DD yet as they tend to fizzle still, but we can cast those frost shock<br/>
&gt; spells with impunity it seems.  And until it gets old, thse group teleports<br/>
&gt; are fun to play with.  They make it easy to get some quick cash or some free<br/>
&gt; buffs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, I also just got 29. Nice too feel needed with your group Teles. :)<br/>
<br/>
I have not had any problem with fizzles since about level 16, so I&#39;m<br/>
using Inferno Shock and loving it. I don&#39;t know what good Thunder Strike<br/>
is, though. Is it just useless?<br/>
<br/>
Too bad I failed all my research attempts for level 29 spells. But I<br/>
think I&#39;ll probably keep using column of Lightning as my AE anyway.<br/>
