<div id="ygrps-yiv-400642724">Wizards are one of earliest implemented and developed class, and all other<br/>
magic user class are developed later so they needed much more adjustments to be<br/>
made balanced as they start to be now it is not finished yet look at enchanters<br/>
one week they have no resistance another week they have faster spells and low<br/>
resistance, Pets get kick and bash and so on as verant try to balance them.<br/>
But a point is that as all other things change also our class need some<br/>
improvements this is not so big as changes which were needed to other classes<br/>
but still we need some. <br/>
<br/>
- First to be of better utility in groups. Groups fight series of monsters.<br/>
Wizards go in great in 2 or 3 member group as monster hit a fighter, healer<br/>
buffer spend mana on healing fighter and buffs or pet help and we spend mana on<br/>
nuking and rooting, but this is possible IF a group fight yellows or whites.<br/>
After a fight all spend same time meddling to get mana back and fighter hits<br/>
back ? <br/>
But when we are in group of 5 - 6 members things go in other direction you<br/>
cannot nuke as your spells are resisted from red guys or if you nuke you spend<br/>
too much mana and group must wait on you to get it back much more time then<br/>
they need to wait to other group member to be ready for fight !! this is why I<br/>
proposed to get for wizards grater mana recovery rate -- monk have on his<br/>
primary skill dual wielding /(lv + 1) * 7 skill limit why we cant have it on<br/>
meditation or specialization skill ? Other mana users have pets and buffs and<br/>
other advantages you don�t get them. You recognize here that specialization<br/>
skill is NOT IN GAME YET !! it is clear signal that game is not finished yet<br/>
and we will pass another wave of balancing and rebalancing after this new<br/>
skills come in.<br/>
<br/>
Wizard is easy to confound with other classes as once when you see a mighty<br/>
damage spells you are hypnotized with this but is it all? how much time you<br/>
spend to be ready again can you fight a series of light skirmishes and then go<br/>
in big fight?<br/>
<br/>
Nearly all in this world can be made better and in one group where all other<br/>
Magic using classes get upgrades because they send feedback to verant, I will<br/>
continue to send my ideas how I look at a game and how a class which I prefer<br/>
can be made better, please argument why we don�t need any changes why we must<br/>
stay stick with first idea which we see its like go in first zone and stay<br/>
there all life never exploring new depths which are around us !<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;&lt;&lt;Example last night I was laughed at when I asked if any one wanted a level<br/>
&gt;12 wizard. (by 3 people over shout no less)  If that is the opinion of the<br/>
&gt;majority of the populace in a game that is suppose to be group only, then I<br/>
&gt;say we need something to make us more valuable...&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am not sure who was laughing or for what reason but rest assured that<br/>
&gt;wizards have no problems finding a group. I can&#39;t count the times that my<br/>
&gt;group(I have a few people I constantly group with) will not pull critters<br/>
&gt;while I am AFK, they recognize that I do most of the damage in a big fight<br/>
&gt;and they have died without my help many times. I think the problem is that<br/>
&gt;at your level people tend to think that any of the other spell casters are<br/>
&gt;just as good as you(or better because they can buff) but what they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;understand is that you are the supreme damage dealer. You can and will make<br/>
&gt;the difference in a lot of fights. You need to find people who understand<br/>
&gt;what a wizard is meant to do and those that appreciate what you bring to a<br/>
&gt;group. Keep looking because those people are out there and they become much<br/>
&gt;more prevalent at levels 16 and up.<br/>
