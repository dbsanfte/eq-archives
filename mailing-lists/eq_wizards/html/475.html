Are you sure about that?  You&#39;ve done it before?  I died once a long way<br/>
from home, and consented someone to loot my body and bring my stuff back.<br/>
He was able to take everything except my robe.  No matter how many times he<br/>
dragged it over to his inventory it stayed on my body.<br/>

&gt;because of all the messages I&#39;m gettin about how to get them, I&#39;ve decided<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to post it...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;/consent    Yep.  Thats how.  If you die..  and you consent someone else to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>retrieve your belongings.. they can take your robe.  Then, they cant give it<br/>
back to you.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;EXAMPLE:  You want that black robe from Neriak..   problem is..  you&#39;re a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>High Elf.  You travel into Neriak..  just near the zone..  do a /who all and<br/>
find a wizard in there...  start telling people to help you out.   Heres the<br/>
deal...  your &quot;friend&quot; the dark elf has to go buy it.  Whether you give him<br/>
money or whatever is inconsequential.  He gets the robe, and goes to meet<br/>
you.  He has to die.  After he dies, he /consent s you to retrieve things<br/>
off of his corpse.  You take the robe.   Now you&#39;ve got it.   If you try to<br/>
give it back to him, you&#39;ll get the error message &quot;This item cannot be<br/>
dropped, traded, or sold.&quot;  but its yours now.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Hope that helps.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Let me know if there are any questions.<br/>
