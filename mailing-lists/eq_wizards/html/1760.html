<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365733063">This twinking stuff is damn fun to read!  Anyway, it is possible to advance <br/>
one point past your speakers level.  Therefore your partner, or you, whomever <br/>
knows the basics of the language, talks the other person to one point past <br/>
the speakers current level.  You both zone.  You are now one point better <br/>
than the person who was speaking to you.  They sit down, and you speak to <br/>
them.  They become as good as you are, by you talking to them, and then as <br/>
you continue to spam them to death, they advance another skill point.  Now <br/>
you both zone.  You repeat this until, as I have said, you are both either <br/>
bored, or excellent in your language of study.  I know that this works for a <br/>
fact, as I have mastered nearly every language in the game by it.  Time well <br/>
spent, as it is satisfying to pick up any book, and to be able to read it.  <br/>
Please, feed my habit.  Brandy is prefered, although I drink any alcoholic <br/>
beverage.<br/>
