<div id="ygrps-yiv-1721308091">Well, no matter how hard you try it is impossible to avoid all hits!<br/>
Otherwise a wizard could go around killing everything in Norrath with ease.<br/>
Ways to minimize the hits  you do take though, are to travel in a group with<br/>
nice big tank in front of you.  While you let him stand there and take all<br/>
the punishment you can relax, sit back, and nuke some monsters.  If you are<br/>
alone, never forget to memorize root.  It is a wizards best friend, at least<br/>
until higher lvls when you get better spells which essentially do the same<br/>
thing.  When fighting alone here is my suggestion for a strategy.. root<br/>
something, move back and then cast all your offensive spells at it.  If you<br/>
kill it before running out mana you win and never get hit.. if you run out<br/>
of mana and it&#39;s still alive, you may win, but probably not.  For a wizard<br/>
it&#39;s all about being able to get your spells off to do the fantastic dmg<br/>
that we do, this becomes impossible if the creature is standing right in<br/>
front interrupting your spells each time you try and cast them.  Well, I<br/>
hope helps you somewhat.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Greetings!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I were not fortunate enough to take part of the Everquest beta, but<br/>
&gt;now, at last, I am a regular player of EQ. However, I read many<br/>
&gt;reports from beta testers, guides and other people before setting out<br/>
&gt;on the path of the wizard and have a question relating to that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What confuses me, now after playing the game myself, are all the tips<br/>
&gt;in various &quot;wizard guides&quot; about the importance of avoiding hits as a<br/>
&gt;wizard. That it is important is obvious, but how should one manage<br/>
&gt;it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I decided to &quot;solo&quot; the first five levels in order to learn the game.<br/>
&gt;My experience from that time is that it is almost impossible to avoid<br/>
&gt;being hit during combat. Now at level seven I mostly team up with a<br/>
&gt;necromancer friend of mine and it is much easier avoiding getting<br/>
&gt;hit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What do the guides mean? Are the advice for higher levels where one<br/>
&gt;have access to &quot;killed on impact&quot; spells or am I missing something<br/>
&gt;obvious? What can one do except running away when trying to avoid<br/>
&gt;hits? Is it the &quot;mini teleportation spells&quot; that are referred to or<br/>
&gt;what? Please enlighten me so that I can continue my hitherto very<br/>
&gt;rewarding and highly enjoying career as a wizard!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Regards,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Zachris, dark elf wizard of Bertoxxulous<br/>
