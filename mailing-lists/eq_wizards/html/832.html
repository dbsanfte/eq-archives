<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-761671950">Greetings all. I write this letter to perhaps aid any who have begun down<br/>
the long path of wizardry.<br/>
I am Mirrin, high elf wizard, of the new Nife server, formally of the<br/>
Karana server.<br/>
<br/>
My first wizard was up to level 12 when I re-rolled to the new server. I<br/>
did so for several reasons:<br/>
<br/>
First to increase my intelligence. My first wiz had a 110 INT and my new<br/>
wiz a 126 INT.<br/>
I can not stress enough how much the extra 16 points have helped my overall<br/>
mana. The extra mana has been<br/>
incredible. For instance:<br/>
<br/>
+	I now spend more time actually hunting and less time in meditation. This<br/>
makes your &quot;tank&quot; friends happier because your not always<br/>
	meditating. Mana management helps here too.<br/>
+	I now have that extra mana needed to finish off that high level creature.<br/>
Nice to pick off that creature thats about to run<br/>
	to get reinforcements.<br/>
<br/>
Another reason I re-rolled is, as many of you have noticed, our combat<br/>
skills tend to raise slowly.<br/>
Higher INT will help compensate for this. I have also learned a few tricks<br/>
along the way. Many of you probably already<br/>
know this but I put this here because of an old rule my master taught me.<br/>
&quot;Never assume what you know is common<br/>
knowledge. Let those who read your words decide that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
+	I have learned that you can raise your Off and Def skills very fast<br/>
combating multiple creatures at the same time. Find 2 or 3 that do<br/>
	very little damage to you and let them smack away at ya. If you do this<br/>
every level for a short while It is very easy to keep your<br/>
	skills high.<br/>
+ Have a &quot;tank&quot; friend help you keep your OHB and 2HB&lt;one hand blunt and<br/>
two hand blunt&gt; skills maxed up. I hunt with a ranger<br/>
	and he is more then happy to take the damage on a few critters while I<br/>
beat on them my a staff. Once you have maxed out your<br/>
	skills, you then only need repeat this tactic for a short while every time<br/>
you level. This works well with dagger skills as well. Remember 	you	can<br/>
help you &quot;tank&quot; friends with skills too. Like with language skills.<br/>
<br/>
A few tips of the trade:<br/>
	<br/>
+ Wizards are the keepers of knowledge. Learn where your &quot;tank&quot; friends can<br/>
find those magical weapons before they do.<br/>
	Do some research. There are many on-line resources to find out where<br/>
little knick-knacks can be found. If your friends begin<br/>
	to rely on you for such information then you will indeed become a TRUE<br/>
wizard.<br/>
+ Keep this in mind. It is in your best interest to make sure your &quot;tanks&quot;<br/>
can take as much damage as possible. Help<br/>
	them get that leather tunic they need or the weapon they REALLY want.<br/>
&quot;Tanks&quot; are very simple to please and it only takes<br/>
	a minimal amount of effort to make them your &quot;loyal friend&quot;.<br/>
+ Take risks! Overhunt when-ever you can! Press your limit and you shall be<br/>
rewarded. Instead of hunting those easy critters<br/>
	until you reach level 4 go out and hunt... pixies for instance in lesser<br/>
feydark. You and a &quot;tank&quot; can get from level 3 to 6 in just a few 	hours<br/>
there. From there press yourself to the huge spiders and then right over to<br/>
CrushBone at level 7 or 8. <br/>
+ Always, always, always keep an eye on your skills. Once your OHB is maxed<br/>
then get that great staff out and get it going.<br/>
	You need to be able to use many weapons. Don&#39;t want to limit your<br/>
effectiveness with any magical item. It would be a shame<br/>
	to not be able to hold that magic book (+30 mana and +10 Int) because you<br/>
can only use a 2 handed staff and the book has to be held<br/>
	in your left hand to get the bonus.<br/>
+ Lastly, remember we wizards are known for our Intelligence. Play that<br/>
way! Write that way! Think that way! <br/>
	Take great pride in your class!<br/>
<br/>
Be well and remember that the fate of Norrath does indeed lay within the<br/>
hands of the wizards. Accept this simple fact.<br/>
