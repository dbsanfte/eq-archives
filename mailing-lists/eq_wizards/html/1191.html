<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1896846317">I think there is absolutely nothing wrong with people bartering for services<br/>
as he is doing below. <br/>
<br/>
However, I treat these issues the same as you.  I train languages and bind<br/>
for free all the time, even turning down &#39;gifts&#39; that are offered to me for<br/>
performing the service for free.   ...but that is just me and my character.<br/>
I just hope the good will is returned by others in the future when I may<br/>
need it.  I guess you could call it the &#39;Good Karma&#39; approach.  : )<br/>

		Disclaimer: this is only my opinion so no flames please.  I<br/>
am only hoping<br/>
		to elicit some other opinions on this subject as well.<br/>
		 <br/>
		I don&#39;t know why but it has never made sense to me to charge<br/>
for services<br/>
		such as binding, invis, and language training.  Perhaps it<br/>
is just the<br/>
		personality of my character that he enjoys helping others<br/>
and gets full<br/>
		satisfaction out of the good deed itself, not needing any<br/>
sort of physical<br/>
		compensation.<br/>
		 <br/>
		I realize that I will be able to make make up to a plat or<br/>
more each per<br/>
		bind and a plat or more for invis (depending on how bad they<br/>
want it) but<br/>
		that just seems unkind.  I remember when I was level 8 just<br/>
travelling over<br/>
		to freeport.  I only had a couple of my new 3rd circle<br/>
spells because they<br/>
		were so expensive and I was flat broke.  I saw people<br/>
auctioning: &quot;Binding<br/>
		at S. Gate, 15gp&quot;, and there was no way i could afford that<br/>
without selling<br/>
		the few pieces of cloth armor i had left.  I was lucky to<br/>
find a kind druid<br/>
		that bound me and asked for nothing in return, but I just<br/>
wonder why so many<br/>
		seek to earn a profit from their abilities rather than just<br/>
use them to help<br/>
		others and take joy in that.<br/>
		 <br/>
		I guess it is just based on your roleplaying style, but even<br/>
if I have no<br/>
		money and still have spells to buy, I would not ask for or<br/>
accept any sort<br/>
		of payment for using my talents.  Does anyone else agree<br/>
with me or do you<br/>
		all think that you SHOULD rightfully earn a profit from<br/>
using your skills?<br/>
