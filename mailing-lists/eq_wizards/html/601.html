&gt; &gt; About the language thing: you&#39;re right, but if you only have a few<br/>
&gt; &gt; points in the language, I don&#39;t think people will be able to<br/>
&gt; &gt; understand you.  I think it&#39;s the EQ equivalent of speaking broken<br/>
&gt; &gt; English - the chance of being misunderstood is bigger if your language<br/>
&gt; &gt; skill is very low.  Just a conjecture , of course.<br/>
&gt; &gt; My friends have started practicing languages during my increasingly<br/>
&gt; &gt; longer meditations.  Just start chattering away in your race language,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and in a few minutes you will see some gain.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My theory on this is you can only teach others up to your level in the<br/>
&gt; language, or parhaps a bit less (seems logical that you can not teach them<br/>
&gt; to speak better than you can). That&#39;s too bad, I&#39;d have loved raising my<br/>
&gt; Old Erudian just talking with someone who also only put 1 point in it :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do you get one new language every two levels to train with, or is this<br/>
&gt; random ? Or perhaps it depends on what critters you encounter ?<br/>
&gt; I wanna learn griffin :)<br/>
