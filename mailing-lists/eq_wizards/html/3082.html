&gt; I have a rant about the way that magic users are getting a raw deal on pvp<br/>
&gt; that is.  Now the lowered our damage when we fight other PC&#39;s.  Hey they<br/>
&gt; chose to be that race/class, i chose to be a wizard.  I have to put up with<br/>
&gt; just as much pain if not more than they do.  So why are we being punished<br/>
&gt; for them choosing to be a warrior type on the pvp servers.  I tend to think<br/>
&gt; that this will lead to the other servers even more heavily in the fact that<br/>
&gt; all the warrior types say we do to much damage or are ksing everything cause<br/>
&gt; of our power.  Yea you with 400 hp at lvl 13 me with barely over 200.  Guess<br/>
&gt; he who whines the most in EQ gets the most.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Veerant will never aprove of this, this is Enchanters  teritory and the<br/>
&gt; will never. I think that it�s a good ide�or something like it but they just<br/>
&gt; wont.<br/>
&gt; &gt; And yes something has to be done to wizards atraction to groups, most of<br/>
&gt; my life up to lv 25 has been like: Logs on to EQ, any friends on - sometimes<br/>
&gt; yes, but most of my friends are powerleveling so i�m far behind them and<br/>
&gt; cant group, anything to solo and not get killed more then i can bare - NO,<br/>
&gt; ok trying to get a group . NO WAY most of the times, any nice quests to do<br/>
&gt; and get a nice item annd or some nice XP - NO.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well one problem for me is that i cant play on regular basis, my work<br/>
&gt; prevents it so one week i can play evry night and level quite nice about 1<br/>
&gt; level/night or close to it. But that i cant play for a week or 2 and when i<br/>
&gt; come back all those i grouped with are to high again. So i need to find some<br/>
&gt; new friends and convince them of that not all wizards are killstealers and<br/>
&gt; bad ppl.<br/>
&gt; &gt; It gets frustrating over time and now i�m at the point where i rather play<br/>
&gt; something else then EQ, AC or Homeworld mostley.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hmm i bit of a rant there but as you can see, if wizards where more sought<br/>
&gt; after for groups then it would be much easier for all us wizards in Norrath.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh yes, definately.  Grouping is probably the number one problem.  I<br/>
&gt; disagree though about the &quot;Enchanter Territory&quot; bit.  First off, if you look<br/>
&gt; at my original post, you&#39;ll note that the formulation I posted *required* an<br/>
&gt; enchanter to be carried out.  So it enhances both classes.  (Another<br/>
&gt; suggestion I received from a friend was to allow summoned weapons to be<br/>
&gt; similarly &quot;charged,&quot; thus allowing magicians, enchanters, and wizards to all<br/>
&gt; participate in the weapon charging procedure.  And I could give you a half<br/>
&gt; dozen alternate formulations.)  At any rate, I&#39;m not personally attached to<br/>
&gt; the idea, but I&#39;d like to see if others like this one or have alternate<br/>
&gt; strategies in mind.  Wizards need *something* to make them more valuable for<br/>
&gt; grouping as I see it.  The DD and AE spells just don&#39;t cut it.  The desired<br/>
&gt; spell casters are the healers and the buffers.  Healing seems to remote.<br/>
&gt; Buffing in some fashion???  &lt;shrug&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; So basically at 34th level, a magician can do more direct damage than me (true it<br/>

&gt; As people usually do, you forgot to take two important issues into<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wanna bet you are better at both? Also, the fact that it is a bolt spell<br/>
&gt; does matter. Especially in dungeons, where bolts are nearly useless.<br/>
&gt; And, as I hear, in your mid 30&#39;s almost all the places you go have to be<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t know, wizards are pretty much sought after where I come from. I<br/>
&gt; never have problems getting a group in Mistmoore, if there is a group<br/>
&gt; wit ha free spot. People do want wizards because they know that if the<br/>
&gt; situation gets bad, but not hopeless, a wizard can quickly turn the<br/>
&gt; tides, thus saving someone&#39;s life. And I&#39;m not talking about stopping a<br/>
&gt; higher level train here. I&#39;m talking bout a too big pull that the group<br/>
&gt; is evenly matched with (pull does not necessarily refer to just one mob.<br/>
&gt; I just mean an even fight all around), a wizard can very quickly take<br/>
&gt; out one of the evens (with some minimal tanking to help) or take out one<br/>
&gt; blue and seriously damage another. why is that important? Well, clearly,<br/>
&gt; when you kill someone quickly, you no longer take damage from them for<br/>
&gt; the rest of the fight. Then the wizard can med and maybe get enough for<br/>
&gt; another blast or two while the rest of the party will end up beat up,<br/>
&gt; but definitely not dead.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, evacs are a must at higher level. Yeah, druids have them too, but<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s just one other class with the skill. Shamans have SOW too, but<br/>
&gt; you don&#39;t see that diminishing from Druid power.<br/>

&gt; Yeah i see what ya mean, but i dont think Veerant will go that way. better then to tune up our AE spells. Like if we cast it on a tank and say the spells hit 3 MOBs if you do this after a few hits all the ones that the tank dosent hit on will go for you right ! i would like to have it that all the agro goes on the tank, it should realy be this way from the begining i think couse it there opinion it�s the tank who hits them. Just like damage shields!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And maybe lower the resistance on AE spells, say like 8 or 10 levels above the caster.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Lim but it is....If you always got the item then you wouldnt have any kinda<br/>
&gt; &gt;pride or anything about it and everyone would have one I like to be one of<br/>
&gt; &gt;the only people with stuff like our guild we would go and get all the items<br/>
&gt; &gt;on server first and we wouild keep them no selling and we kept them as<br/>
&gt; &gt;trophys....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, I can see your point.  Yet, it still doesn&#39;t make camping any more<br/>
&gt; enjoyable does it?  All it does is delay the inevitable.  Assuming the MoB<br/>
&gt; dropped your item everytime...your guild would STILL be the first ones to<br/>
&gt; get it.  It doesn&#39;t mean you tried any harder...it just meant you didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have to waste so much time doing it.  How is that a bad thing?  Item Rarity<br/>
&gt; should be dependant upon the difficulty in the MoB itself IMHO.  An item can<br/>
&gt; even be made rare by making the MoB spawn less often... they DO that<br/>
&gt; already...but the frustration is made worse when the item is not on the MoB.<br/>
&gt;   It&#39;s like they want to double-up on your tension.  This point is not as<br/>
&gt; important...but you gotta remember we are all on paid time.  Verant has no<br/>
&gt; problem making us sit for 18hours at a time for an item now do they?  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I liked the other post I read earlier that suggested random spawns...if it<br/>
&gt; could be designed in such a way that a NPC would spawn *anywhere* in the<br/>
&gt; level itself.  Now that&#39;s a fun challenge!  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, now that the powergamers have gotten all there is to get, your point<br/>
&gt; is moot my friend.  I have no desire to be the &quot;first&quot; to get an item...I<br/>

&gt; :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh, by the way Askur, the advice to go to Cazic is a good one.  From 24 and<br/>
&gt; up....it&#39;s a haven for xp!  And I&#39;m not going to begin to say how much money<br/>
&gt; you can get there hehe.   I&#39;ll probably run into you there.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes i know, but for the most part wizards dont get a group the easy way. ever heard a group call for wizard to join them ? well i may have one or 2 times. But lets say they shout for a Wizzie 5% of the time and the rest for outher classes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Actualy i grouped with 4 outher Wizards in MistMoore and it was kind of nice, the zone was a bit to crowded when we did so i cant realy say much about it outher then we hade alot of fire power. 5 Wizzies doing around 170 points a round :-))<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And that about dieing all the time as wizard, i grouped in MM with anather wizard the same level as me then (24) and a druid lv 26, (and 2 paladins and a shaman or something like that ) they both died 3-5 times on one night and i didnt die for 2 levels there and that was to a bug, i got zoned back in to MM when i zoned out :-((. So i think that it depends alot on play style if you die alot or not. And to stop from being flamed about chicking out and zone first or not getting in to the fights, i can tell ya that i almost always zone last in any group i�m in and i dont hesitate to drag that extra pull from the tank and finish him of up close, if it�s a blue or even fight that is. i even take a few hits from reds if need be. The shieldskin and leather spell is great.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hmm i bit of a rant there but as you can see, if wizards where more sought after for groups &gt; then it would be much easier for all us wizards in Norrath.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t know, wizards are pretty much sought after where I come from. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; never have problems getting a group in Mistmoore, if there is a group<br/>
&gt; &gt; wit ha free spot. People do want wizards because they know that if the<br/>
&gt; &gt; situation gets bad, but not hopeless, a wizard can quickly turn the<br/>
&gt; &gt; tides, thus saving someone&#39;s life. And I&#39;m not talking about stopping a<br/>
&gt; &gt; higher level train here. I&#39;m talking bout a too big pull that the group<br/>
&gt; &gt; is evenly matched with (pull does not necessarily refer to just one mob.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I just mean an even fight all around), a wizard can very quickly take<br/>
&gt; &gt; out one of the evens (with some minimal tanking to help) or take out one<br/>
&gt; &gt; blue and seriously damage another. why is that important? Well, clearly,<br/>
&gt; &gt; when you kill someone quickly, you no longer take damage from them for<br/>
&gt; &gt; the rest of the fight. Then the wizard can med and maybe get enough for<br/>
&gt; &gt; another blast or two while the rest of the party will end up beat up,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but definitely not dead.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, evacs are a must at higher level. Yeah, druids have them too, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; that&#39;s just one other class with the skill. Shamans have SOW too, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; you don&#39;t see that diminishing from Druid power.<br/>

&gt; ok Lim<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You are the second one telling me to go to Casic so ill better head over there then. dont know if i dare to try the gate there tho, even if there has been some good advice on how to go there the best way without geting killed. My play style is that i dont run around blindly in a new zone not knowing where it�s safe to meditate best place to hunt etc. Know any good URL for a map over Casic and our drop spot over there ?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Lim but it is....If you always got the item then you wouldnt have any kinda<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;pride or anything about it and everyone would have one I like to be one of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;the only people with stuff like our guild we would go and get all the items<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;on server first and we wouild keep them no selling and we kept them as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;trophys....<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well, I can see your point.  Yet, it still doesn&#39;t make camping any more<br/>
&gt; &gt; enjoyable does it?  All it does is delay the inevitable.  Assuming the MoB<br/>
&gt; &gt; dropped your item everytime...your guild would STILL be the first ones to<br/>
&gt; &gt; get it.  It doesn&#39;t mean you tried any harder...it just meant you didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; have to waste so much time doing it.  How is that a bad thing?  Item Rarity<br/>
&gt; &gt; should be dependant upon the difficulty in the MoB itself IMHO.  An item can<br/>
&gt; &gt; even be made rare by making the MoB spawn less often... they DO that<br/>
&gt; &gt; already...but the frustration is made worse when the item is not on the MoB.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   It&#39;s like they want to double-up on your tension.  This point is not as<br/>
&gt; &gt; important...but you gotta remember we are all on paid time.  Verant has no<br/>
&gt; &gt; problem making us sit for 18hours at a time for an item now do they?  :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I liked the other post I read earlier that suggested random spawns...if it<br/>
&gt; &gt; could be designed in such a way that a NPC would spawn *anywhere* in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; level itself.  Now that&#39;s a fun challenge!  :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, now that the powergamers have gotten all there is to get, your point<br/>
&gt; &gt; is moot my friend.  I have no desire to be the &quot;first&quot; to get an item...I<br/>

&gt; &gt;PS. Does anyone know of a good guild on Veeshan ? i play on CET time and<br/>
&gt; &gt;most of<br/>
&gt; &gt;my in game friends live in USA so for me to play with them i have to stay<br/>
&gt; &gt;up all<br/>
&gt; &gt;night almost and it dosent agre with my work any more :-((<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just look at the people you play with everyday and see what guilds they are<br/>
&gt; in.  I think that&#39;s the best approach...otherwise, you&#39;ll be stuck in a<br/>
&gt; guild where you don&#39;t know anybody.  That isn&#39;t going to help much either.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Veeshan has a LOT of guilds...biggest of which I think are FoH, the<br/>
&gt; Companions, and Aradani I think.   I&#39;m beginning to overhear people saying<br/>
&gt; their guilds are a little TOO big now. ;)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Yes. That&#39;s why, when you hear someone with the Scepter of Rahotep, the<br/>
&gt; &gt;Scarab Ring, or something like that, you go aaahhh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;They&#39;re not overpowered (if they were like JBoot, can you HEAR the cries<br/>
&gt; &gt;of outrage), but they&#39;re like a badge. If you wield a scepter, wear a<br/>
&gt; &gt;ring, then you&#39;re *someone*.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I suppose, to some people you would be someone.  But to me, I just can&#39;t see<br/>
&gt; how being lucky enough to find a rare drop makes you someone.  I was lucky<br/>
&gt; enough to get a double-bladed bone axe from a wandering npc, an item a lot<br/>
&gt; of people have never heard of, but it just doesn&#39;t seem so cool.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know.  I guess with everyone looking like clones, people are desperate to<br/>
&gt; look different or be different in some way.  I remember once just walking<br/>
&gt; around wearing nothing, just to be different, since my character in his<br/>
&gt; &quot;gear&quot; looks like everyone else.  Someone wanted to know where I had died.<br/>
&gt; Lol.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Whats this crap about player economy ? Go to Veeshan and visit Freeport on<br/>
&gt; a crowded night and you wont find 2 ppl of 10 that want to sell there stuff,<br/>
&gt; only trading. Money is worthles in EQ at higher level. Well some ppl say you<br/>
&gt; can invest it in a tradde skill, why the hell should I ?? the only trade<br/>
&gt; skill worth the effort is jewelery and then you still only get more worthles<br/>
&gt; money.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Perhaps money is worthless at higher levels, but will that last forever?<br/>
&gt; When the game went live back in March, money was worthless to buy the best<br/>
&gt; items, too, because no one had many good items.  If you sold your rare item,<br/>
&gt; even for a lot of money, you couldn&#39;t buy anything with the money, since<br/>
&gt; good items were too rare.   The higher levels who trade only for other items<br/>
&gt; with other high levels are doing so because those items are rare.  As time<br/>
&gt; goes on, there will be more and more high level players, and those &quot;rare&quot;<br/>
&gt; items will become not so rare.  Then people will sell them, if only to lower<br/>
&gt; level people who have accumulated money.<br/>
