<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985177508">That&#39;s another annoying problem. I was running with a monk that became<br/>
pk (I&#39;ll use pk and nonpk because it&#39;s less confusing to me) and the cleric<br/>
in the party wouldn&#39;t help him at all. He even said, don&#39;t heal me, don&#39;t<br/>
buff me or you&#39;ll become pk. Very cool of him.<br/>
<br/>
    As to the looting issue, that&#39;s absurd. (In your favor) NO ONE should be<br/>
able to loot your body unless they personally killed you. Another point for<br/>
you, and that&#39;s something that I think they need to address. I didn&#39;t know<br/>
that just anyone could pick stuff off your body. As a matter of fact, I&#39;d<br/>
make looting a pk body that you didn&#39;t kill turn you pk. That&#39;d be more<br/>
reasonable I think. Believe me, no one&#39;s picking on you, maybe taking the<br/>
easy way out, but not singling out pk players.<br/>
<br/>
As to coding the changes. It&#39;s more than likely that it&#39;s easier to make<br/>
them not be able to cast anything on you instead of being selective. As a<br/>
matter of fact I KNOW it&#39;d be easier that way. It&#39;s like having 1 switch to<br/>
turn on all the lights in your house, or running around and turning some on<br/>
and some off.<br/>
<br/>
All in all though, I think that for the moment, it&#39;d be better to just enjoy<br/>
the game as is for the moment, and work towards what changes you&#39;d like.<br/>
There&#39;s a fdback button there, use it and have all the pk players you know<br/>
use it as well. Good to hear the comments though.<br/>

&gt;&gt;     Whoa. Hold on there, Iggie didn&#39;t say YOU, he said that there are a<br/>
&gt;lot<br/>
&gt;&gt; of +pvp players that are jerks. There are also a ton of -pvp players that<br/>
&gt;&gt; are jerks as well. I&#39;ll tell you about Elyas the loser Paladin on Solusek<br/>
&gt;Ro<br/>
&gt;&gt; sometime.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He didn&#39;t say anyone was a jerk.  He said we weren&#39;t important enough to<br/>

&gt;Fix the PvP specific bugs.  I don&#39;t care about PvP specific zones.  I play<br/>

&gt;Are thee bugs, yes that&#39;s true, but I think that<br/>
&gt;&gt; fixing global bugs that affect everyone will be more of a priority than<br/>
&gt;bugs<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; So you have restrictions that I do not have as<br/>
&gt;&gt; a -pvp wizard. It was your choice, so live with it. Learn to get around<br/>
&gt;it,<br/>
&gt;&gt; and I&#39;m sure that you&#39;ll have a much better experience for it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Huh?  What are you talking about?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;     You also have to remember that it&#39;s THEIR world  you&#39;re in, so you<br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt;&gt; to conform to them, they don&#39;t have to conform to you, even though a lot<br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;&gt; player suggestions have been implemented. I&#39;m still waiting for a patch<br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;&gt; will save the choice of how I view servers. Why would anyone want to view<br/>
&gt;by<br/>
&gt;&gt; number of players once you&#39;ve created and levelled your characters is a<br/>
&gt;&gt; mystery to me. : )<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;No kidding.  That&#39;s kinda annoying.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;     Try and remember that there&#39;s nothing that they&#39;ve done is to be<br/>
&gt;&gt; intentionally harmful to the -pvp class, but given a choice the majority<br/>
&gt;has<br/>
&gt;&gt; to rule, and that majority is -pvp. Their priorities concerning +pvp will<br/>
&gt;&gt; always come first.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Um, you are wrong.  Their priority is -PvP.  This should be pretty obvious<br/>
&gt;if you have played the game at all.  -PvP has no real problems (I play<br/>
&gt;a -PvP ranger on the Rathe).  +PvP still has a couple HUGE, game balance<br/>
&gt;destroying issues that would be pretty simple to fix.  From what I read<br/>
&gt;about the testing on the test server, it looks like they may finally have<br/>
&gt;addressed the issue as the looting for +PvP is supposed to have changed.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;give you a brief rundown of the current problem, you are a lvl 35 (insert<br/>
&gt;any class here) player.  You accidentally have autoattack on or are playing<br/>
&gt;song of discord or aoe a critter that is standing near a guard at one of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;kelethin lifts.  The guard kills you.  ANY person who comes along can loot<br/>
&gt;you.  Even lvl 1 newbies.  Goodbye black robe and no way to get it back<br/>
 </span></blockquote>from<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;them (four level limit).  Obviously this screws up game balance a bit.  All<br/>
&gt;they need to do to fix it is apply the same loot ruels they use for MOBs.<br/>
&gt;If you didn&#39;t kill it, you don&#39;t get to loot it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;However, non combat spells you should be able to cast on<br/>
&gt;&gt; others. Bind Affinity, O&#39;Keils radiation, Invisibility, great spells, and<br/>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m behind you 110% in that you should be able to use them on others. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;&gt; sure they&#39;ll change it in the future, but how long depends on how hard it<br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;&gt; to code.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I wouldn&#39;t think it would be that hard as most players can already cast<br/>
 </span></blockquote>them<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;on others, just not +PvP for some reason.  +PvP spells would work exactly<br/>
&gt;as -PvP spells on a -PvP person.  There is no difference whatsoever in how<br/>
&gt;they should behave.  if a -PvP can cast it on a -PvP, a +PvP should be able<br/>
&gt;to.  The code is all there, and all works, except they aren&#39;t using it.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;only sane explanation is they are punishing +PvP for something.  BTW, if<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;are +PvP you can forget about -PvP helping you ever.  They can&#39;t cast<br/>
&gt;helpful spells on you without becoming +PvP themselves.  Of course, I play<br/>
&gt;on zek, where the only real concern is the looting issue I just mentioned.<br/>
