<b>Subject:</b> Re: Piercing or blunt? (Q about weapon skill) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-342588478">According to Wizard:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I used to try to max my piercing and 2h staff until lv 8, when i lost my<br/>
&gt; snake fang to death bug. I try it again at a 12 lv and i tryed to max it<br/>
&gt; again. IT DONT MOVE i lost hours fighting a blue yellow and even red when<br/>
&gt; some group leave me to try and nothing i never get any advance anymore ?? i<br/>
&gt; also get one cracked staff but with skill 0 i never got any advance. so now<br/>
&gt; i have 2h blunt at 36 and dagger at 20 1h blunt at 0. and i dont have any<br/>
&gt; wish to invest a skill points in this :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t really know. I hadn&#39;t used my dagger skills since level 2, when I found<br/>
a decaying skeleton carrying a worn great staff, so when I decided at level 8<br/>
to go back to dagger (skill was 4 when I stopped it), it took me three fights<br/>
before I got a message on Piercing skill. And the skill *immediately* raised to<br/>
8, which shows that your min skill is also equal to your level for combat<br/>
skills.<br/>
<br/>
(so, if you&#39;re 12, investing 1 practice in 1h blunt gives you 12, not 1)<br/>
<br/>
Since then, I&#39;m switching weapons after each fight in which I gain a skill<br/>
point. Keeps me maxed correctly in all... I suspect I&#39;ll have a Crookstinger<br/>
before I get the totem staff...<br/>
