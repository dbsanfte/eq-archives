<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411351206">Try Lavastorm or the dungeon Najena contained within.. farther out in <br/>
Lavastorm is Solusek A and B, as well.  You might like it.  You will have <br/>
to run through Nektulos forest to get there...so I don&#39;t know if you need <br/>
to invis yourself and party being a High Elf, I think you do.  There are a <br/>
lot of groups that come through there with level 12 on up to mid <br/>
30&#39;s.  Something for almost everyone.  :)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I am a fresh 16th level wizard currently bound in the Qeynos area, I <br/>
&gt; was wondering where the best solo/group hunting grounds are?  So far 16 <br/>
&gt; seems to be a &quot;tweener&quot; level, too high for some places and too low for <br/>
&gt; others. I don&#39;t really care where the areas are. (willing to relocate : ) <br/>
&gt; )  I&#39;m just looking for a place my group can fight, that has decent <br/>
&gt; soloing near by.<br/>
