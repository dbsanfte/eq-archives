but it certainly COULD be more! I know it&#39;s greater than 6 though...<br/>

&gt; &gt;To his defense, I am level 20 now and also disillusioned with the wizard<br/>
&gt; &gt;class.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (snip)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Of course hindsight is 20/20 but I&#39;ve invested over 6 realtime<br/>
&gt; &gt;days into my wizard and am too stubborn to give up on him. The spells of<br/>
&gt; &gt;the wizard are very limited. Sure we can do the most damage in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;shortest amount of time, but it&#39;s not THAT much more. But other than<br/>
&gt; &gt;that, we can teleport like the druid, and that&#39;s all!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is incredible to me..... I just turned lvl 13 and my played time is 9<br/>
&gt; days and 12 hours. Are you doing something special or am I just wasting a<br/>
&gt; lot of time?<br/>
