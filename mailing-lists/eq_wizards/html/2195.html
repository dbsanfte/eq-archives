<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044461716">According to Tom Bratina:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; friendly fyi: watch the stuff in south ro by the oasis zone border. it&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; only &quot;cheesy&quot;, but it&#39;s an exploit and you could get banned for it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You mean the only place I ever got killed in South Ro? Yeah, I found a<br/>
killer - literally - exploit.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I was unprepared. I had gone there a few times on my way to Innothule<br/>
and it&#39;s stores of Netted and Woven... Never paid attention to what was<br/>
there, and never saw anything. Once, going over the dune, I got four<br/>
simultaneous messages:<br/>
<br/>
A dry-bone skeleton casts a spell.<br/>
A dry-bone skeleton hits YOU for 21 damage.<br/>
You are stunned.<br/>
Your skin freezes all over.<br/>
<br/>
Five seconds later, I was contemplating the skeletons (there was a ghoul too,<br/>
rushing toward me, but the skeletons got me first) from the usual sky vantage<br/>
one never wants to use...<br/>
