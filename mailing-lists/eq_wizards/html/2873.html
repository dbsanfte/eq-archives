<div id="ygrps-yiv-122988207">According to Jeff Bleich:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does anyone know of any good Wizard sites to goto?  I&#39;m new at the wizard<br/>
&gt; class and joined vallon zek to kill... I bielieve this is one of the best<br/>
&gt; classes to play at pvp.  Any help would be great on where to get damask ,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do hope you are dark elf then. Dark Elfs rule the area. Befallen,<br/>
where you can get some nice items (including, if I remember right, the<br/>
damask robe), is hotly contested between the dark elves and the halfling<br/>
druids, but the Dark rule the Commonlands, Ro, cutting off Freeport from<br/>
any possibility of levelling (there are always a dozen or more DE or<br/>
trolls on &quot;frontier duty&quot;). But Dark Elfs more consistently CONTROL the<br/>
area with Najena (hey, who&#39;s gonna have the boots?) and its gossimer,<br/>
Lavastorm (good area), and Solusek (where you can level up to 50).<br/>
<br/>
Wizards are very appreciated in race wars as they can root. Unlike mobs,<br/>
an opponent will size forces very quickly, and can run to the zone if<br/>
outmatched. Hence, root, or enchanter&#39;s whirls.<br/>
