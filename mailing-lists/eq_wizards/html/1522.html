<div id="ygrps-yiv-966221868">We have had threads on this before but I would like to pass on to everyone<br/>
how I made about 15 plat in about 2 or 3 hours last night.  I had travelled<br/>
from my home in felwithe across antonica and was battling the gnolls of<br/>
blackburrow.  Well at level 13 which I was last night (till i leveled to 14)<br/>
I easily found a similarly leveled party to fight the gnoll elites and<br/>
commanders.  Even with 5 members in our party the loot each of us got was<br/>
incredible.  The gnoll elites and commanders each have the chance of having<br/>
a bronze weapon (2 or 3pp), studded or spiked collars (1pp to store, more to<br/>
players), and the commanders additionally have the chance of having onyx<br/>
earrings (2 or 3pp to players) and I think bloodstone rings as well.<br/>
Occasionally you would get more than 1 of those items at a time and one of<br/>
the fellows in our group said that he once got a bronze weapon, spiked<br/>
collar, onyx earring, and bloodstone ring off a single commander.  The best<br/>
I have gotten is a bronze weapon and a spiked collar (which was off a single<br/>
elite).<br/>
<br/>
It was intestesting to note that although blackburrow is very crowded (and<br/>
laggy in some areas) there were not all that many groups fighting elites and<br/>
commanders, so we had plenty to kill.  Once you hit level 12 if you are in<br/>
the area this is a good place to earn cash if you are in a group or can find<br/>
one.<br/>
