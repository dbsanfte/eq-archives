<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1252725214">Anyone have any idea why it is listed as &quot;flight&quot; and not levitate?  is it<br/>
just me, or does anyone else remember early spell lists having the spell<br/>
flight in it? i may have been dreaming &lt;and thats most likely the case&gt; but<br/>
i think i remember seeing flight as a mage spell?<br/>
<br/>
and if it wasnt, dont you think flight would be a cool spell to have? :)</div>
