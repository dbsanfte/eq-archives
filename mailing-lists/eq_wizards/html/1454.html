<div id="ygrps-yiv-180629898">I was at the same Desert camp as Solric with the following group:<br/>
<br/>
Zalbar            18th Human Wizard<br/>
Sinorf             15th Barbarian Shaman<br/>
Snowdown    16th Dwarven Cleric<br/>
Magyar          16th Barbarian Warrior<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, I&#39;d like to apologize for some of my members jumping in there and<br/>
just grabbing stuff. I don&#39;t normally work that way. However, once the<br/>
gauntlets thrown down, I&#39;m not going to let my tanks die over principles.<br/>
: )<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re all casters in the group. Granted, the cleric can tank and fight, as<br/>
does the Shaman. However at the end of the fight, the cleric is healing.<br/>
Whether himself or others won&#39;t matter. Solo or duo, he&#39;s going to have to<br/>
heal himself more in any case.<br/>
<br/>
After taking down various devishes, the ghouls at the ruins etc, I&#39;d be<br/>
medding more than most, but not by much. However my health meter wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
touched. It&#39;s a balancing game, and the thing is to find a group that works<br/>
for you. For me, it&#39;s having a bunch of people that don&#39;t squabble over<br/>
loot, willing to chat in downtimes, and we&#39;re all more than willing to<br/>
sacrifice oursleves for the group.<br/>
<br/>
From my experience no one class can solo effectively. Note that I said<br/>
effectively. Anyone can solo, but it&#39;ll be slow going. What you really have<br/>
to do to effectively solo is find a group, and stick together. I&#39;ve been<br/>
lucky in that I have a good group that has gone to great lengths to stick<br/>
together. When our monk died in Western Karanas and was bound to Freeport,<br/>
we all turned around and ran back to get him. It&#39;s a group and team effort<br/>
that will lead the way in this game. Some quests are hard, and a group is<br/>
much easier to accomplish. We recently helped a friend do the screaming mace<br/>
quest and you&#39;ve GOT to group to do these effectively.<br/>
