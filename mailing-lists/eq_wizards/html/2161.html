<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-867063881">&quot;Your gate is unstable and closes&quot;  I&#39;ve gotten this message a couple of<br/>
times now (since the last patch) Has anybody else gotten this?  Has it<br/>
been that way since day one, and I&#39;ve just been lucky until now?<br/>
It&#39;s happened 3 or 4 times to me so far.  Once when it was a life or<br/>
death situation.  I died and it really pissed me off.   I did a shadow<br/>
step then a gate.  The gate went through the complete casting time, used<br/>
100 mana, did the graphics, and then came up with that message.<br/>
