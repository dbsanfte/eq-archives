At last one person wich thinks i see all time fixing necro spells ,<br/>
magiciam pets get stronger, only wizards look all time content and fight<br/>
with all forces against changes? One wise man say &quot;In everchanging<br/>
world a looser is one wich never changes&quot; ..&lt;br&gt;<br/>

&lt;font size=2&gt;&lt;blockquote type=cite cite&gt;First of all, I would like to<br/>
thank Drev and Talarin for their informed opinions and for actually<br/>
posting something other than &quot;where can I find item X, spell<br/>
Y&quot;.� Dont worry about telling me I am wrong, I am an<br/>
Artist/Technical Illustrator in real life, everyday I am told about how I<br/>
do things wrong and I developed a thick skin many,many years ago!<br/>
;-)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;font size=3&gt;�&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=2&gt;Secondly, I tend to log on to Everquest VERY early in<br/>
the morning here, (5:00 - 6:00 am EST)� so when I connect to the server<br/>
there are usually 300-400 people online max.� That means that I can very<br/>
effectively solo with my Wizard because there is NO competition for<br/>
blues.� I dont know about anybody else, but lately I have been<br/>
consistently doing 1 bubble of xp every hour that I play.. I have no idea<br/>
if that is good or not, but it is perfectly fine for me because I dont<br/>
come anywhere near dying.� I also realize that that may change as I<br/>
advance in level, but I tend to move around a lot so I think I should be<br/>
fine.� Playing that early also means that it is very difficult to group,<br/>
seems like everyone else is out soloing as well...I dont know, maybe its<br/>
the time of day?� As well, I have a full time job as Sr. Technical<br/>
Illustrator which means that I only play 2 hours or so a day, so I am not<br/>
expecting to be 20th level already.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;font size=3&gt;�&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=2&gt;Actually what truly baffles me is why some people<br/>
seem so dead set against getting Verant to change Wizard spells.� Whats<br/>
wrong with fixing something thats broken?� Everyday they keep patching<br/>
non-working aspects of this game and yet noone seems to care enough to<br/>
fix Wizard spells, probably because noone complains enough.� Or instead<br/>
of fixing spells, replace useless ones with some of those beautiful<br/>
Teleport Other (or was it Tap Affinity?) spells that were mentioned here<br/>
a while ago.� Awesome.� Fits right in with class description and people<br/>
would be clamouring for Wizards to be in their group, even at the lower<br/>
levels.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;font size=3&gt;�&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=2&gt;Well I was going to get in to which spells should be<br/>
changed and why, but I have yammered on too long as it is.� So I will<br/>
save it for another post =)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br/>
