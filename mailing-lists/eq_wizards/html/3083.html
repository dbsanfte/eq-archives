<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018898781">This is the reason i quit being a Wizard im sad to say<br/>
my wizard is a 34th on povar and i refuse to play her untill they do<br/>
something new wizards.... you made one very valid point... and it was<br/>
the reason i quit wizard completely.... Magicians and encanters and<br/>
Necros all have there place...... wizards have mana...THATS IT ... WHEN<br/>
THE HELL WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SOLOED a white or black .... IM sorry to<br/>
say that if you are fighting a squirrel with this class youd be lucky<br/>
if half your magik wasnt resisted.. some of it did 3 points of<br/>
damage... and 34rth this is really retarded.. and then by that times<br/>
the creature breaks your usless root spell because none of your other<br/>
so called better spells all suck as far as paralyzing your openent... <br/>
<br/>
WE ARE PURE CASTERS... please give us double the mana or something.. I<br/>
dont even think this would make us more powerful... but it migfht give<br/>
us the ability to kill something our lvl....<br/>
<br/>
in the mean time, i have chosen to play a cleric on Vallon Zek... A<br/>
very rewarding class to those of you who are sick of wizards... YOu can<br/>
heal .. you are loved. you can melee... and strangly enough at 30 i can<br/>
kill two blues and still have enough mana to heal me to full after<br/>
words ...go figure eq_clerics@onelist here i come<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dear eq friends!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When i started a game it was very vell balanced and<br/>
&gt; i can say there were<br/>
&gt; many people trying all classes and it was funny, but<br/>
&gt; as game advance new<br/>
&gt; specialized tactics come out and in many times<br/>
&gt; Verant is a last one to see<br/>
&gt; exploit and not a first one as it have to be. Now i<br/>
&gt; have seen that at 5<br/>
&gt; newer servers first to reach a higest lv are druids<br/>
&gt; !! at valos zek pvp<br/>
&gt; server it is a same reason is of course kiting and<br/>
&gt; dot spells wich they<br/>
&gt; have. This is something wrong !<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Second thing i noted was farming of glowing stain<br/>
&gt; wich we have seen in last<br/>
&gt; 2 weeks from nowere to see there are now nearly<br/>
&gt; every higer lv caster have<br/>
&gt; one! It is funny for my glowing black stone wich was<br/>
&gt; a hard to get item is<br/>
&gt; now nearly underpowered item :) This was stoped<br/>
&gt; unfortunatly to late and<br/>
&gt; now we wich dont get a stain will never get it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now i start to see one other problem.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Powerfull items are comming from higer lv players<br/>
&gt; wich give or sell or<br/>
&gt; twinkle lower lv when they get mre powerful items.<br/>
&gt; This items make item<br/>
&gt; dipendent mele class out of any balance on lower<br/>
&gt; lvs!!  Spell casters are<br/>
&gt; particulary sensibile to this as they are not item<br/>
&gt; dependent for their<br/>
&gt; power but it dependens on spells, mana to damage<br/>
&gt; ratio, mana to healing ..<br/>
&gt; protection ratio wich is all hardcoded to level. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So what hapends .. to make example i spend some time<br/>
&gt; building a wizard and<br/>
&gt; a warrior to 6 lv and i twinked them with items to<br/>
&gt; make a probe.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Warrior with nearly full large bronze and fine stell<br/>
&gt; sword .. Wizard with<br/>
&gt; full woven, rts skull, +10 mana earings ect..<br/>
&gt; Normaly warrior dies on 3<br/>
&gt; high blues 100% on this lv .... wizard dont have<br/>
&gt; mana to kill 2 high blue .. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My warrior take against 8 !!! BLUES and survived<br/>
&gt; .... so he realy have been<br/>
&gt; affecter imensly... Wizard tryed against same 2<br/>
&gt; blues and he died in same<br/>
&gt; mode as before.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Counting im only a 27 lv so i can twinkle my guys<br/>
&gt; only a little :)) one 50<br/>
&gt; lv guy can make this diference much much higer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Same effect i have seen in mistmore .. grouping with<br/>
&gt; many people i have<br/>
&gt; seen what diference can make overpowered items...<br/>
&gt; warrior hitting for 70 a<br/>
&gt; hit it is 140 - 160 counting a bash ... without mana<br/>
&gt; use a turn!!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Wizard at 27 lv can do only 178 damage and he will<br/>
&gt; be out Of mana in 6 - 7<br/>
&gt; hits a warrior can go without end and with god items<br/>
&gt; he will alos need less<br/>
&gt; cleric healing!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Wisdom classes normaly are more item dipendent so<br/>
&gt; they are affected a bit<br/>
&gt; less then INT based so called pure caster. This<br/>
&gt; effect is mostly visible on<br/>
&gt; my old server fenin ro where are many high lv people<br/>
&gt; producting one sea of<br/>
&gt; overpowered items !<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I dont know what effect this items have on higer lv<br/>
&gt; casters but as i heared<br/>
&gt; some opinions...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; a. new items for mele class help them strike faster<br/>
&gt; and for more damage<br/>
&gt; (stronger weapons) take less damage and recover hits<br/>
&gt; faster (rubicite<br/>
&gt; breastplate with rubicite effect !) !! Items for<br/>
&gt; mana users only gives more<br/>
&gt; mana... wich in end mean more meditation and looking<br/>
&gt; in stupid book (verant<br/>
&gt; guys will you finaly do something here), casters<br/>
&gt; dont get faster mana<br/>
&gt; regenaration items, less resists items, more damage<br/>
&gt; for their spells items<br/>
&gt; !!!! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I see this as a very big problem wich will get worse<br/>
&gt; as time pass if<br/>
&gt; something is not done. What are yours opinion on<br/>
&gt; this are there any<br/>
&gt; possible solution wich you see for this?<br/>
