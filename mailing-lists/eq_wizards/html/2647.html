<br/>
BTW i have been to Unrest from low lv 19 to lv 20 couse i thought that was the best place to get XP and friends told me so I COULDNT BE MORE WRONG... i say this to all lower level wizards only go to Unrest for lot and items. The XP there just sucks, ok you can get XP to but for the most part your group will be zoning and waiting for members to get back when dieing. It can make a difrence if your in a group with close friends but mostley you will not do much fighting. I went to south karana and Lake Rahathe and WOW i made a litle more then 2 bubbles of XP in 4 hours of fighting.. I�m staying there thats for sure!!..<br/>
