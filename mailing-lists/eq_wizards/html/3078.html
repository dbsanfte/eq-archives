<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Personally, I&#39;d be willing to make one trade concession in the wizard class.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d like our channeling skill to be significantly higher than the other<br/>
&gt;spell casters (say an extra 2 pts per lvl).  We need it, and it makes sense<br/>
&gt;from virtually every angle (role play, balance, etc.).  And I&#39;d be willing<br/>
&gt;to incure an xp penalty for it, to keep leveling balanced.  My point is<br/>
&gt;simply that when wizards get into melee situations, they should still have<br/>
&gt;some casting ability. It is, after all, the only thing wizards have (unlike<br/>
&gt;ALL other casters).  They ought to be the best at channeling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well until/if/ever your idea is implemented.  Get your dexterity scores up<br/>
has high as possible.  My Gnome Wizard has a dexterity of about 110 now.<br/>
Generally I can always get off a root spell, usually within the first 2<br/>
attempts.  I will admit this was definately not the case before I was level<br/>
20.  In the teens if you get in melee and can&#39;t time your spells right,<br/>
your running or your dead.  Now that I am in the mid 30s  I can usually<br/>
solo any one blue mob.  If two come running when I pull I start running the<br/>
other way.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Second, we need some way to make wizards more of a symbiotic class.  We are<br/>
&gt;simply not as desirable for grouping as the other classes in most scenarios.<br/>
&gt;There may be many ways of going about this.  Here&#39;s my one suggestion<br/>
&gt;(paired down for space purposes, but I think you can see how it could be<br/>
&gt;modified for balance, etc.).  Wizards (perhaps with the help of an<br/>
&gt;enchanter) should be able to cast their damage spells onto the weapons of<br/>
&gt;other classes.  One possible implementation would be to have an &quot;enchanted<br/>
&gt;weapon&quot; randomly go off for, say, 1/10th of the total damage possible in the<br/>
&gt;spell, for up to 10 hits.  This would allow a wizard to &quot;buff&quot; in a<br/>
&gt;meaningful way.  Tanks would want us, and it would increase our<br/>
&gt;effectiveness because the damage would cause hate buildup towards the tank,<br/>
&gt;not us (which becomes a serious problem at higher levels).  I&#39;ve talked to<br/>
&gt;enough non-wizards who loved this idea that I think it worth bringing before<br/>
&gt;a group of wizards, possibly for a petition.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve never really had a grouping problem.  Maybe its because I am in a<br/>
great guild of friends.  Basically at the higher levels the only places to<br/>
go are dungeons.  Pets are notoriously difficult to manage when in a<br/>
dungeon.  It would make more sense to me that people would prefer a Wizard<br/>
who has more functionality with out a pet.  Ok maybe an Enchanter too.<br/>
Thats not to say the other classes are not as good as us.  Just different.<br/>
Its unlikely that your above idea will enhance the groupability of the<br/>
wizard class.  Were I a tank that didn&#39;t want a wizard in my group yet<br/>
wanted to have some buffed weapons.  Prior to adventuring for the night I<br/>
would take my collection of 8 FS Long Swords and get them all enchanted.<br/>
Presto, no need to take a wizard with you because you have their helpful<br/>
buff taken care of for the next 60 charges.<br/>
Its also quite unlikely that verant would ever implement this idea.  The<br/>
only classes capable of making magic items are Enchanters and the few<br/>
select Magician spells which, I have been told, aren&#39;t really that usefull<br/>
at higher levels, except maybe for the levitate rings.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have something i want to try some time.  I want to put an item on a bat<br/>
&gt;and then tell all the newbies, ro go find it.  Who ever brings me the item<br/>
&gt;will get a reward.  Myabe a tentacle whip for the fighter typs or my water<br/>
&gt;crystal staff for the casters.  Ot could be fun.  The other night I was<br/>
&gt;bored and was going through teh Najena dungeon arming the skels with all the<br/>
&gt;old rusty weapond I had found earler.  I even gave one a tentacle whip to<br/>
&gt;see if hed use it.. He did and it looked cool.  I killed that one to get my<br/>
&gt;whip back<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t recomend trying this with a Lore Item.  And definately not a No<br/>
Drop item.  While you may be able to give many No Drop items to NPCs and<br/>
mobs.  The item will get deleted most of the time as soon as you trade it<br/>
to the npc.  This was done so that people could not trade no drop items by<br/>
giving things to a green and letting someone else kill the green.<br/>
<br/>
My personal suggestion would be to put a semi rare item on a mob.  Makeing<br/>
sure that it can be looted when that mob is killed.  Try it with some of<br/>
the crafted items.  Not many newbies know how or have the cash to train<br/>
cooking up enough to make pickeld lizard.  Its also kina hard to get lizard<br/>
meat in say Greater faydark.  Put the pickeled lizard, or other hard to<br/>
find item thats not lore or no drop, on a mob.  Announce it to the zone and<br/>
when someone brings you back your pickeled lizard you award them with the<br/>
prize.<br/>
Here is another good one for you.  Put the item on a spiderling in Gfay and<br/>
zip over to Butcherblock and announce it there.  Or in your shout let<br/>
everyone know that they can only claim their item by meeting you at a<br/>
specific location (which they have to find).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;test them.  At 34th level, my direct damage shock spell does 306 (might have <br/>
&gt;been 307, but it was very close to this).  The magician&#39;s did 287.  Not much<br/>
&gt;difference, but that is fine.  My second direct damage spell, which is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>research<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;only and I have heard is bugged and does not work, I did not have.  The<br/>
&gt;magician had a 34th level bolt spell which did 326 points of damage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So basically at 34th level, a magician can do more direct damage than me <br/>
&gt;(true it is a bolt spell, but not a large issue) and has a pet that double<br/>
 </span></blockquote>attacks<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;for over 20 points a hit.  Hmmm, really made me wonder.  I know at 39th level<br/>
&gt;I will again surpass the magician damage, but still a little annoying.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of my close friends plays a magician.  I wondered about this one too<br/>
when I first herd about it.  So I asked him.  Apparently when he was in the<br/>
mid to upper 30s.  He was extreamly luckey if his bolt hit for max damage.<br/>
Apparently it usually did not.  The magician spell at 34th is also a fire<br/>
based spell.  One of the best dungeons to be in at 34th is Sol A, and Sol B<br/>
in a GOOD group.  There aren&#39;t many things in either dungeon that don&#39;t<br/>
have increadable fire resistance.  Magicians also don&#39;t get a DD spell at<br/>
levels 29 or 39.<br/>
<br/>
If I get luckey this next week with my research I will let you all know<br/>
what the damage on Thunderclap is, assuming the spell works.  I just<br/>
recently got the runes required to research this spell so hopefully over<br/>
the next week I will get brave enough to attempt to research the spell.<br/>
