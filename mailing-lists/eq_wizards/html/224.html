<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-79246346">I found that around lvl 14 or so root became completly usless. my friend was<br/>
lvl 19 and gave up on using root at lvl 15 because it just sucked so much.<br/>
It is resisted alot (blue ghouls resist it), and it never sticks when it<br/>
does get past the MR. I found it very usefull at lvl 11 and 12 against young<br/>
kodiaks.. I loved fighting those. Anyways at lvl 20 you get a new root spell<br/>
taht holds longer, its call Enstill. But either way your better off just<br/>
grouping IMO with atleast 1 tank, best to have a tank and a cleric tho.<br/>

&gt;    I&#39;m confused.  I am a level 17 Wizard on Fennin Ro.  I find that the<br/>
&gt;only way I can nuke an opponent is to Root him first because it is utterly<br/>
&gt;impossible to Nuke, say, Ambassador DVinn while he&#39;s piercing you.  I am<br/>
&gt;excellent at timing casts, and they just attack to fast for us to get the<br/>
&gt;cast before their next hit, and most likely, they will.  I don&#39;t see at all<br/>
&gt;how Wizards cast fast, that&#39;s one of our fallbacks, the other is the long<br/>
&gt;waiting times for mana regeneration.  But no worries.  There are things you<br/>
&gt;may get that help restoration of mana.  Back to casting... It&#39;s terribly<br/>
&gt;slow, Flame Shock takes a LONG time to cast, and it is impossible to cast<br/>

&gt;you, because Root casts relativlely fast, but Root hardly holds.  And my<br/>
&gt;Alteration is maxed.  I have 142 INT, soon to be 148.  I get 5 casts out of<br/>
&gt;Flame Shock for 102 Dmg each on enemies with lower magic resistance.  Ok,<br/>
&gt;well, that was a fun chat.  I still love my Wizard and would never give him<br/>
&gt;up for any other class.<br/>
