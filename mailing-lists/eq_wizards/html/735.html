<div id="ygrps-yiv-1702023407">I don&#39;t think the cutting the damage a wizards spell does will reduce <br/>
the amount of KS&#39;ing. I am greatful that my wizard does the damage he <br/>
does with his spells. I have had several other players try to steal my <br/>
kill. I had rooted a monster before I attacked. I got off one spell <br/>
before some fighters(unsure at to exact class) ran up and started <br/>
hacking the monster. I was able to keep my kill and ward off this <br/>
groups attacks on several other of my rooted monsters. This is by no <br/>
way isolated. It happens every time at worste, every other time at <br/>
best. Changing the wizards spell damage would hamper their ability to <br/>
gain levels why doing nothing about KS&#39;ing. I think that the game is <br/>
fair as it is now and would hope that this group does not go out and <br/>
petition for a change.<br/>
