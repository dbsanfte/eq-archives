<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175755152">Now I&#39;m confused.  On two points.  First, where did everyone get the idea<br/>
that you have to spend a training point to learn a language?  Is this true<br/>
only for some langauges?  It surely is not true for all of them, since I<br/>
learned Dwarvish and Gnomish without spending any training points at all.  I<br/>
just listened to someone who was proficient in the language.<br/>
<br/>
The second point of confusion is how two people could ever become excellent<br/>
in any language just by listening to each other speak, if neither one is<br/>
excellent to begin with.  When I first started learning Dwarvish, for<br/>
example, I was being taught by a Gnome who was himself only average in it.<br/>
So my language understanding only climbed to average.  No matter how much he<br/>
spoke after that, I went no higher.  How could your method teach someone a<br/>
language better than you know it?<br/>

Subject: [eq_wizards] On possible twinking, with language info<br/>

&gt; People who have high level items at low levels may not necessarily have<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; twinked.  As I was not twinked, but had many hundreds of platinum by level<br/>
&gt; 12.  There have been in the past messages posted requesting language<br/>
&gt; assitance.  Well, if someone has mastered all of the main languages in the<br/>
&gt; game, player languages, monster languages, and most importantly the<br/>
research<br/>
&gt; languages (Old Erudian through elder Dragon).  Its amazing how well people<br/>
&gt; will pay to become excellent in the research languages.  Its really not<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; hard to become excellent either, the most difficult thing is to find the<br/>
&gt; languages. Just search the land, looking for someone who will train you<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; point in the language, and then get a friend, sit by a zone.  Whomever has<br/>
&gt; learned the language begins by speaking while one sits on the ground<br/>
&gt; listening.  When you have stopped improving, stand up and zone.  Then your<br/>
&gt; friend sits down, and you speak in the language until your friend improves<br/>
&gt; two points.   Then your friend stands up and you both zone again.  Repeat<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; two point then zone process till your tired of it, or you&#39;re excellent.<br/>
This<br/>
&gt; method will take you from awful or higher to excellent, in an hour or two.<br/>
&gt; Enjoy.  If anyone finds this info helpful, then I would appreciate a few<br/>
&gt; alcoholic beverages!  Enjoy, and good learning.<br/>
