&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been in and around Ro and the Commons for about a week now and I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;starting to feel more adventures.    I decided on Guk to try to score<br/>
&gt;some Netted, Woven and/or Mesh armor.  If there are any wizards out<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Woven, forget it unless you go and pay a troll to get it for you. Netted<br/>
stuff you can get off the frogoks, fisherman, and tads. What a tadpole is<br/>
doing with armor, I have NO clue.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;there who can give me some advice on what and where to hunt in Guk or<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you go into Guk stay to the first three rooms. do NOT venture past the<br/>
circular wooden bridge. You will only die, and it&#39;s a long and dangerous run<br/>
from freeport to reclaim your corpse. My troll warrior is level 8 and<br/>
doesn&#39;t go past those areas. Also watch out for trains. If there&#39;s a troll<br/>
in the tunnel you won&#39;t be able to get by. Sometimes jumping works,<br/>
sometimes not. Hopefully it&#39;ll work for you !<br/>
