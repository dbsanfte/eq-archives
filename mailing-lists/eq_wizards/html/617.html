<div id="ygrps-yiv-1524263146">Going up levels is race dependent, with humans going up fastest. I am a<br/>
human wizard and I went up half a level in about one to one and a half<br/>
hours of killing giant spiders in west Karana in a mixed group, so I don&#39;t<br/>
think it has to do with being a wizard. <br/>
