<div id="ygrps-yiv-690106860">According to Dan Alexander:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a hot button on the same button set as my offensive spells:<br/>
	Hit Fx (whatever position the tank is), 6 (assist), 1 (big nuke)<br/>

&gt; whichever happened to be closest to us.  If mana had held out, we would<br/>
&gt; have made quick work of them, but such is life.  Thinking back on it now,<br/>
&gt; maybe it would have been better if we&#39;d both focused on the same one until<br/>
&gt; it dropped, then regroup on the next one.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Assuming you have 3 peoples dealing the a fixed amount of damage over time<br/>
vs 3 mobs dealing a fixed amount of damage, check what happens if:<br/>
	1) you engage each other 1-on-1<br/>
	2) all 3 engage 1, then switch to the next<br/>
<br/>
Basically, you can see that it will take the same time to kill them in both<br/>
circumstances (you need the same amount). However, if you use tactic 1, the<br/>
all mobs deal damage over the full time, while using tactic 2, only one mob<br/>
deal damage over full time, while one will do damage over only 1/3. Since<br/>
mobs do the same damage at all time, unless almost dead :)<br/>
<br/>
How this is done is by having the combat leader doing the targetting. Once the<br/>
leader says &quot;I have a target&quot;, all click /assist. The combat leader is<br/>
usually the main tank - not necessarily the group leader.<br/>
