I too am a lonely wizard seeking knowledge, leading to power.  My existence is dedicated to all things arcane.  Perhaps in the future, if I could see into I would know, our paths may meet and we could share in our experiences.  I too call Karana my home, but my direct lineage comes from the great, proud, and noble race of Erudites.  You have nae said what rank in your training you have obtained, but if you are close to my own rank, {close to 2), I would be most interested in a meeting.<br/>

  Roleplaying is an art, I am sorry to say that a quite a few of the players I<br/>
  have met have not given serious thought to their character or the history.<br/>
  The last thing I want to hear from another player is &quot;Cool&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
  I choose a Human Wizard it fits my style and therefore makes it easy to<br/>
  roleplay.<br/>
<br/>
  My wizard tends to keep to himself and in a group they almost always forget<br/>
  I&#39;m there, up until combat and my spells start going off. I group because I<br/>
  must to get what I need to advance my skill. I will help people I meet along<br/>
  the way, race is not an issue if it advances my knowledge. My goal as a<br/>
  character is to learn all there is to learn, Knowledge is Power and Power is<br/>
  Good.<br/>
