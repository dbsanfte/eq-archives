 </span></blockquote>Not really.  The game environment is balanced for a reason.  What other<br/>
people do DOES have an affect on the rest of us.  That is what an<br/>
interactive game is all about.  We haven&#39;t heard from GMs on this topic, but<br/>
I suspect that if they are going to suspend people for giving high level<br/>
items to their low level characters, then we can all be pretty well assured<br/>
that someone has a problem with this.<br/>

&gt; What exactly is so bad about it? How ever easy or hard it is on her, has<br/>
&gt; no effect on you, so why don&#39;t you just mind your own business and stop<br/>
&gt; being so uptight. She&#39;s done nothing that brakes the rules or bothers<br/>
&gt; other players in any way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The only bother, is pure green jealousy, isn&#39;t it? You&#39;re just upset<br/>
&gt; that she gets an advantage you didn&#39;t, right? Well, life is tough like<br/>
&gt; that. Whether she gets an advantage or not, is none of your business<br/>
&gt; because it doesn&#39;t really affect you. And remember, she had to work her<br/>
&gt; way to level 22 before that as well, so she is only giving her other<br/>
&gt; Char something she rightfully earned.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just concentrate on your own character and stop being a jerk about it.<br/>
