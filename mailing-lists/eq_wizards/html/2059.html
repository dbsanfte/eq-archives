&lt;&lt; I for one belive in the power of the wizard and I do know that brad and <br/>
 verant have absolutely no intent of changing them.  I quote &quot;Wizards are by <br/>
 far the most balanced casting class and to change anything to them now would <br/>
 destroy 1 years worth of game balancing&quot;.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well it sounds like they don&#39;t want to change it because they worked on it <br/>
for a year.  Well maybe they should work on it for 2 years then.  Ahhhh if <br/>
only people would just say &quot;oohhhh i worked on it for a year i guess i&#39;m <br/>
done, no need to go any further&quot;  sounds like brad and Verant have somethig <br/>
against wizards :)<br/>
