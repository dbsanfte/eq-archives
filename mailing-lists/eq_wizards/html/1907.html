<b>Subject:</b> Re: Spell Resistance - the reason <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1451572737">Good Point. Level 12 was difficult in that manner, but I could at least<br/>
hurt blue creatures! So I actually wouldn&#39;t mind if it fizzled a lot or<br/>
not hit for full damage. But in fact it rarely fizzles and always hits<br/>
for full damage, WHEN it isn&#39;t resisted. I guess I&#39;m worried that as I<br/>
advance in level, that most blue creatures will STILL be able to resists<br/>
Force Shock. Nevermind the Orcs, at 21 they will all be green, but<br/>
whatever creature cons blue at 21. <br/>
<br/>
I find that, when soloing, I need to unload 3/5 of my mana to kill most<br/>
blue creatures. I just don&#39;t want to be hitting at the same level I did<br/>
at level 16 against all non-green enemies because I can&#39;t use my new<br/>
spells. See what I&#39;m gettting at? I can accept the fact that reds will<br/>
resist most of the time, yellows some of the time, whites half the time,<br/>
and blues rarely but such is not the case. It ends up<br/>
reds=90%,yellows=90%,whites=80%,blues=70%. I don&#39;t know exact numbers<br/>
but it is up there...<br/>
<br/>
If, on the other hand, what you&#39;re saying is that when I am lvl 21, that<br/>
blues will resist less than they do now. That may be workable, not<br/>
liked, but workable. For example if the creature 2 levels below me<br/>
resistance goes down to 60% at 21, 50% at 22, 40% at 23 or some such. So<br/>
when I am level 23, creatures of level 21 or below resist at 40%.<br/>
<br/>
While that may be a bit better than my first scenario (where blues will<br/>
resist a lot for the rest of my days) I still don&#39;t like it. Especially<br/>
when the blues I am testing it on are probably about 4-5 levels below<br/>
me. Or should I go group with people of levels 14-15 :P<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s hoping it gets better! *gulp* What&#39;s the bar at now? Level 30<br/>
when we will truly shine? One guy on the list is up there I think, is 20<br/>
more difficult than the other levels? Do I want to know?<br/>

&gt; Think of it this way..remember when you got your spells at level 12.<br/>
&gt; YOu tried out SOL but it liked to fizzle a lot or not hit for full<br/>
&gt; damage?  Then at level 13 it cast more often and did full damage more<br/>
&gt; often?  Well, same thing goes here.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hm, when ever I blast they just keep running at<br/>
&gt; &gt; me...I guess I really<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t need the stun effect. That&#39;s what rooting is<br/>
&gt; &gt; for. If it is stun<br/>
&gt; &gt; meant to cancel spells, well I don&#39;t need that<br/>
&gt; &gt; either because that is<br/>
&gt; &gt; what enchanters are for (anti-magical-artillery). It<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>
&gt; &gt; cancel the orc priests from casting on me so I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; know...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I guess I&#39;m going to be a 16th level wizard until<br/>
&gt; &gt; 24. I Sincerely hope<br/>
&gt; &gt; none of our later spells have stun because it gets<br/>
&gt; &gt; hardeer and harder as<br/>
&gt; &gt; it is than to have blue stuff kick our asses even<br/>
&gt; &gt; more :P If we do get<br/>
&gt; &gt; these more often, then we should get tashan/tashani<br/>
&gt; &gt; in order to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; effective.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, how does one explain enstill resisting all the<br/>
&gt; &gt; time? Even more<br/>
&gt; &gt; than my Force Shock...<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; The reason why your level 20 spell shock of force<br/>
&gt; &gt; is resisted so often is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; because it has a dual effect.  It not only does<br/>
&gt; &gt; damage but it also stuns the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; opponent.  Any spell with a dual effect is<br/>
&gt; &gt; resisted a LOT more (ask<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; enchanters because almost all their spells have<br/>
&gt; &gt; dual or triple effects).  At<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; level 24 we get a DD spell that does about the<br/>
&gt; &gt; same amount of damage as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; shock of force, but does not have a dual effect<br/>
&gt; &gt; and is thus not resisted as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; much.  It also costs less mana to cast.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Same problem here with abnormal amounts of resists<br/>
&gt; &gt; with Lvl 20 spells...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is quite different from any other new level<br/>
&gt; &gt; spells in the past.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Enough of a difference to conclude that Lvl 20<br/>
&gt; &gt; spells were programmed<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; differently or there was a change in a patch that<br/>
&gt; &gt; affects all spells that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; just coincided with my reaching lvl 20...<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I just reached lvl 20, got all my spells, and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; guess am a little<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; dissapointed. I do enjoy blasting for 170 points<br/>
&gt; &gt; of damage, but it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; almost as if Verant has made these new spells<br/>
&gt; &gt; EASIER to resist. For<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; instance, I fight Orcs in oasis. Low blue orcs and<br/>
&gt; &gt; they are resisting my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; new shock spell. They NEVER resist my 16th level<br/>
&gt; &gt; lightning bolt. You<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; would think that a higher level spell would be as<br/>
&gt; &gt; or harder to resist.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Another example is enstill. This ONLY works on<br/>
&gt; &gt; greens. There is no blue,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; white, yellow, red that I have found that is<br/>
&gt; &gt; successfully enstilled. In<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; fact, when I fight the 20th level orcs that con<br/>
&gt; &gt; black to me, they always<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; resist. Yet root works on them about 25% of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; time. I was hoping that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; when I got enstill it would be easier to solo<br/>
&gt; &gt; because it is more<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; powerful, alas it isn&#39;t so.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am heading to Lake Rathe now and hopefully my<br/>
&gt; &gt; spells work better<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there. If not, mayhaps we should petition to get<br/>
&gt; &gt; this change. I mean<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; come on, I am about as useful as a 16th level<br/>
&gt; &gt; wizard against red if<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; BLUES resist my new 20th level spells. While<br/>
&gt; &gt; monsters are getting<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; progressively better I seem to be getting<br/>
&gt; &gt; progressively incapable to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; handle them.<br/>
