<div id="ygrps-yiv-890886935">To BIND OTHERS you have to be INSIDE the city ZONE, so if you go INTO the<br/>
gnome city it will work.  You can bind yourself anyway though.<br/>
Feelwithe and Keletin are exceptions.  I think because Kelethin is IN GF<br/>

kill you.  Especially if you are Meditating.<br/>
Once you are high enough lvl they will leave you alone.<br/>

&gt; I have mostly been fighting in Crushbone, so my standing with the orcs<br/>
&gt; really sucks.  Sometimes a legionaire or slaver will attack me without me<br/>
&gt; attacking them and the &quot;tanks&quot; have been totally unable to pull them off<br/>
