<div id="ygrps-yiv-1267366296">&quot;Freeport guards -- slow reaction times, but not as bad as Kelethin.<br/>
Faction<br/>
might affect the way they help you here since some of them are corrupt.<br/>
They do not help you against those irritating...err...I forget what they&#39;re<br/>
called...beggers or something.  I don&#39;t think they help you against Dorn the<br/>
Dark Elf NPC either.  Somebody else here might know...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Greeport guards in N Rho will not attack Dorn or any of the different<br/>
Mad Men.  Zoning or finding  a higher kevel player to help you are the only<br/>
options you have against them.</div>
