<div id="ygrps-yiv-599699174"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Actually Sol A (Solusek Eye) you can start out in the low 20s.  I&#39;v found<br/>
&gt;&gt;stuff that still gives me exp at level 35 in Sol A, but it sure isn&#39;t much<br/>
&gt;&gt;when it happens.  If your going to solo there, best be level, oh say, 50.<br/>
&gt;&gt;I don&#39;t believe there to be a way to safely solo in Sol and still get exp<br/>
&gt;&gt;at any level.  Most of the place was green to me even at 33 (when I first<br/>
&gt;&gt;went there).  However, 95% of all those Greens still attacked me.  I do<br/>
&gt;&gt;believe some of the casting goblins can see through Invis.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think you are right.  When I was in Permafrost, the ice goblin casters<br/>
there attacked me, invisible or not.</div>
