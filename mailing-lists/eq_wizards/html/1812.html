<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-935975764">Actually Mata, you were almost as bad in my view because you re-posted the <br/>
entire chain letter with your reply.  I agree... chain mail has no place on any <br/>
maillist.  <br/>
<br/>
Please trim the quoted material from your reply or send it just to the person <br/>
you&#39;re addressing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks much!<br/>
<br/>
