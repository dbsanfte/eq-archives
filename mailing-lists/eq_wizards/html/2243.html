&gt;To his defense, I am level 20 now and also disillusioned with the wizard<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Of course hindsight is 20/20 but I&#39;ve invested over 6 realtime<br/>
&gt;days into my wizard and am too stubborn to give up on him. The spells of<br/>
&gt;the wizard are very limited. Sure we can do the most damage in the<br/>
&gt;shortest amount of time, but it&#39;s not THAT much more. But other than<br/>
&gt;that, we can teleport like the druid, and that&#39;s all!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is incredible to me..... I just turned lvl 13 and my played time is 9<br/>
days and 12 hours. Are you doing something special or am I just wasting a<br/>
lot of time?</div>
