<div id="ygrps-yiv-693668996">Well as for the creatures coming after you, you have to learn to cast the<br/>
spells in moderation. Let the tanks deal some damage before you start<br/>
casting. And don&#39;t cast again right away. If you can get the timing right,<br/>
it is much easier and you have a lot less down time.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Druid, I don&#39;t know their spells that well. But I do know that<br/>
Druids are mainly for outdoors, so my thought is, can she do that kind of<br/>
damage in a dungeon? Or is that spell an outdoor spell only?<br/>

Okay, I guess it is bad I come on here to give my observations, but here<br/>
they are:<br/>
<br/>
Well I have discovered the wonders of doing the most damage to a Monster,<br/>
They come right at you.  Hunt you till you cry, and then kill you, no matter<br/>
what your friends do to try to save&#92;taunt&#92;interpose for you.  I have to<br/>
stand so far back that I don&#39;t even get the combat messages or sounds, and<br/>
that doesn&#39;t even work all the time.  Yes I&#39;m kicking ass and taking<br/>
names... but at what cost...  (It was great when a dwarf was complaining<br/>
about me being in the group as a exp. stealer when I shocked of lighting<br/>
once too often and  the monster left the party 100 yards back in preference<br/>
for me. :)  shut him up quick *chuckle*)<br/>
<br/>
Next I have discovered the POWER of the druids...  What I&#39;m about to relate<br/>
to you was fully observed and discussed with a druid in my clan...  She at<br/>
14th level gets a spell called conflageration(sp)  it does 65 points of<br/>
damage for 35 mana. 1.86 dam per mana.  I do at level 13, 79 points of<br/>
damage for 60 mana. 1.32 dam per mana.  We casted the spells at close to the<br/>
same rate... we timed 5 of mine to 4 of hers.  How can we claim to be the<br/>
masters of anything after this little show of power? btw at the end of the<br/>
test she did 260 hps dam for 140 mana and I did 395 hps dam for 240 mana.<br/>
Fruther I would like you to realize that when I get to level 14 i&#39;ll do 1<br/>
more hps dam in a slightly shorter period of time.  Not bad but nothing like<br/>
i would expect from the masters of damage that I expected and still do<br/>
expect the wizard to be.  (she pulled a monster off of me with her spells<br/>
once and another time she pulled the monster on herself after a set of<br/>
spells [it saved vs 2 of mine I had cast doing only 36 and 39 respectivly])<br/>
(these were wolly calfs, and orc Mounteneers/shamans)<br/>
