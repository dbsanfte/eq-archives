<b>Subject:</b> Mounting a skull? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-230985549">I have heard that you can mount a skull to i believe a runed totem staff. Have heard this from lost of people but no one seems to know how to do it. Does anyone have any idea how this feat is accomplished? I would really like to know.<br/>
