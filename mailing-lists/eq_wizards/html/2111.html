&gt;&lt;&lt;Maybe it&#39;s just a quirk of my character&#39;s nature - but if I&#39;m grouped,<br/>
&gt;there is never mana left for an emergency Gate.  I can&#39;t bring myself to<br/>
&gt;Gate-out on my Tanks - even in the most hopeless of situations, so we all<br/>
&gt;die together.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When I play my shadow knight and my group is deep in befallen on the 3rd <br/>
&gt;floor and all the sudden I get hit by 6 greater skeletons, 3 necro thero, 2 <br/>
&gt;ice bones, 3 ghouls etc etc, I see that as the party leader this train is <br/>
&gt;going to run over our asses.  So I yell RUN and stand my ground to the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>death. <br/>
<br/>
If I get the order to run, I expect everyone to run.  If someone chooses to<br/>
stay behind and get chewed on, I&#39;m grateful for their sacrifice, but I<br/>
under no circumstances expect it from them.  <br/>
<br/>
While I&#39;m perfectly willing to run away from a fight with them (hell, I&#39;ve<br/>
called retreats for them), I don&#39;t gate on them.  I&#39;m no melee fighter by<br/>
any stretch of the imagination, but by gating out on my tanks, I&#39;m removing<br/>
one more potential random target from the mob - thus decreacing my tanks<br/>
odds of survival.  Whatsmore, I don&#39;t want them to be in a situation where<br/>
they think they are being backed up by artillery that doesn&#39;t exist -<br/>
whether the Wiz is OOM or has just plain split.  <br/>
<br/>
Strategy check:  Which has the better survival rate?  A group running away,<br/>
or a group that scatters?  (I&#39;m not questioning your qualifications as a<br/>
leader, just wanting to know which has worked better from your point of<br/>
view)  I can see pluses and minuses on both sides of the argument.  <br/>

I usually lead my parties (if one can call it &quot;leading&quot; since I&#39;m in the<br/>
back).  Wizards can do this effectivly as long as they aren&#39;t so caught up<br/>
in blasting they forget to keep an eye on their tanks health or the groups<br/>
surroundings.  And from the back, I&#39;m removed enough to keep an eye on the<br/>
flow of the battle (like if we seem to be getting too near a critter that<br/>
will decide to assist the one we are attacking, or said critter decides to<br/>
charge us)<br/>
