<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262606749">haha. won&#39;t work to &quot;stand and melee&quot; at higher lvls (not many classes can<br/>
actually do this without a healer).  believe me, when you&#39;ve got a total of<br/>
roughly 450-500 hp and the monsters are hitting for anywhere from 50-70 in<br/>
the mid to high 20&#39;s and kicking/bashing for a descent amount of dmg (and<br/>
just about all monsters stun on a regular basis), then you WILL NOT STAND<br/>
AND MELEE.  And no, the mob will not leave you if he senses that he can kill<br/>
you (ie. once your health is down far enough, there&#39;s no getting him off of<br/>
you. period).<br/>
<br/>
your best bet is just to stay back and make sure he doesn&#39;t come after you,<br/>
or root the son-of-a-bitch.  if he does get a hold of you, you&#39;re gonna die<br/>
real quick if you don&#39;t do something about it (and no, that doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
melee).<br/>
<br/>
keep on with your melee, as it is not suicide at lvl 13...  but make sure<br/>
you don&#39;t make a habit of it, as when you pass 20, and move into the mid<br/>
20&#39;s and higher, you&#39;ll see the light, and realize why some of us don&#39;t even<br/>
carry a weapon anymore :)<br/>
