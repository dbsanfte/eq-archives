<div id="ygrps-yiv-861085491">Hello fellow Wizards,<br/>
    I recently hit level 12 and am currently traveling with a group in and around Daggnors Cauldron. If we are hunting Goblin Mariners or shamans,my spells will hit, however if we bring in a Bosun,my spells are completely resisted. Some in the group are getting tired of these and want to go into Unrest. Will I be able to damage any MOBS there? The group consists of a 13 Ranger,14 Cleric,Myself 12 Wizard and a 16 Paladin (I know, the exp gap is large and I get minimal exp, but heck...these are friends). Can anyone give any pointers about what lie ahead in Unrest for our group. Oh By the Way.....the NPC&#39;s at the Camp along the coast do NOT Always help protect you...We all learned that the hard way against a Tidal Lord!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help,<br/>
