<b>Subject:</b> Question on Two Robes:Chain mail looking and Blueish with fancy Trim <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-635684441">The other night I noticed a couple new robes that I hadnt seen before. The first was a Blue looking robe with fancy trim like the black robe has. Anyone know where to get that and the stats on it? Second I saw a char with a robe that looked like it was chain mail. I am not sure if this char was a Wizard(was playing anon and would not talk to me when I asked about the robe). Anyone know what that was and where it is found?<br/>
Thanks</div>
