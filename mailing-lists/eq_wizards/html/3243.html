<div id="ygrps-yiv-2073985294"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;By the way, I keep here people saying that they never<br/>
 </span></blockquote>rooted before 12.  Did you solo?  What was your tatics?  I started &gt;rooting <br/>
and<br/>
nuking at 4 and I haven&#39;t stopped since.  Even if it kept the mob off &gt;of me <br/>
1/4<br/>
of the fight, it was still meant the difference of life or death to &gt;me.  By<br/>
level 10ish (I think, its been a while since then) I was rooting &gt;Grizzleys <br/>
in<br/>
the Karanas, and often finishing them off before root would break.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been using Root since day one.  Don&#39;t leave home without it memorized.  <br/>
As yet, it&#39;s the only way I can think of to get a MoB off your back solo OR <br/>
grouped.  I think you&#39;re at a disadvantage with any spells if you start off <br/>
with low INT.  Human Wizards would not be my first pick for a Wiz although <br/>
it leads to great role-playability.  RP is the reason I picked a High-Elf <br/>
against an Erudite/Gnome.  If you&#39;re a power-leveler, go straight for an <br/>
Erudite and pump that bad boy up with all the INT you can. :)  My buddy who <br/>
started his second char as a Wiz did just that and has had little problems <br/>
getting spells off.<br/>
(little punk has more INT than me already...BAH! =)<br/>
