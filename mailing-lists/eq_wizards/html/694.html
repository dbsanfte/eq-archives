<b>Subject:</b> CORFLUNK QUEST <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-807090502">Hey as a wizard I have always run from Corflunk, but last night I saw him coming down the path at me and I was all alone, but I said &quot;What the hell I am 12th now!&quot;<br/>
and I kicked his tail.   Even melee!! Like 3 shock of lighnting and a few staff blows and DEAD ogre.  hehe he hardly touched me!   Anyway where do I need to go now that I have his head?   I mean where do I get the quest?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  I love Shock of lightning!</div>
