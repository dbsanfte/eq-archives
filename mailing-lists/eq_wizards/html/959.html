<div id="ygrps-yiv-816867479">My dark cousins would be better off left alone.  They isolated themselves<br/>
from us and such is their state of being now.  To be friendly to them I<br/>
would tri killing things they hate, humans, High Elves, Wood Elves, etc,<br/>
etc.  Just dont plan on entering Queynos or Freeport anymore with being KOS<br/>
