&gt;&gt; I probably will get flamed for this for sure, but who cares.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I made it all the way to lvl 12 as an erudite wizard.   I found that<br/>
&gt;leveling<br/>
&gt;&gt; was very slow indeed and it was getting really boring camping with my<br/>
&gt;groups<br/>
&gt;&gt; till the sun comes up.   However, i was on a few days ago in the morning<br/>
&gt;and my<br/>
&gt;&gt; regular group wasn&#39;t on.  I shouted for about 30 min and no one wanted to<br/>
&gt;join<br/>
&gt;&gt; up with me for bandit hunting.  Out of boredom, i went down to the bandit<br/>
&gt;camps<br/>
&gt;&gt; to see if i can find a group there(West karanas on top of Hill).  I found<br/>
&gt;this<br/>
&gt;&gt; group of 6 there camping the bandits so i just sat around shouting for<br/>
&gt;groups<br/>
&gt;&gt; once again. But while those guys were fighting the bandits, i thought,<br/>

&gt;&gt; as well try to see if i can kill one solo, if i can&#39;t, then they will<br/>
&gt;probably<br/>
&gt;&gt; help me anyways.  I attacked one bandit and killedh im in 3 shots with<br/>
&gt;Shock of<br/>
&gt;&gt; Lightning.  and WOW ! so much XP !!!   so i just kept going.  I got<br/>

&gt;like<br/>
&gt;&gt; they can do anything about it HAHAHA.  too bad for them that they wont<br/>
&gt;group<br/>
&gt;&gt; with me.  I also found some wizards are really stupid, the group  of 6 i<br/>
&gt;was<br/>
&gt;&gt; stealing from had a lvl 14 wizard and a lvl 11 wizard. and none of them<br/>
&gt;could<br/>
&gt;&gt; stop me from stealing. its odd but true... ppl just don&#39;t think.. oh<br/>
&gt;well.. i<br/>
&gt;&gt; hope you all try to just have fun and not give a shit what other ppl<br/>

&gt;personally<br/>
&gt;&gt; think we were made to give grief to others heehhe.. j/k   I personally<br/>
&gt;think we<br/>
&gt;&gt; should be changed to Erudite Magical Theives hehe..<br/>
