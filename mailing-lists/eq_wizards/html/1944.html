<div id="ygrps-yiv-227588895">Of course your crazy not to buy it... I haven&#39;t seen anyone say that.  Most<br/>
people say it gets resisted way too much, and I agree.  Just hit 21 and<br/>
don&#39;t see any significant improvement yet.  I used to understand the<br/>
fizzles, but this has been a completely different experience after hitting<br/>
20.  There are way too many people with the same experiences here to dismiss<br/>
this issue... but DEFINITELY buy the spell and use it.<br/>

Hey, it was too tempting. I&#39;ve found that it works on pretty much anything<br/>
that cons blue. This includes, Emperor Crush, Ambassador Dvinn, a whole host<br/>
of orcs, Crag spiders. Yeah I&#39;ve fizzled but never twice in a row. I&#39;ve had<br/>
it resisted ONCE by a blue. I wouldn&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;m not casting it<br/>
more than once a fight anyways. Takes forever to be able to cast it again,<br/>
and eats up a TON of mana. I wouldn&#39;t worry about other people&#39;s<br/>
experiences. Have your own, and take it from there. Like your mother said,<br/>
if you friend jumped off the bridge you would have to as well? Seems to me<br/>
it&#39;s all in perspective. I&#39;ve had a blast with Force Shock.<br/>
