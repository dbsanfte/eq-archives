<div id="ygrps-yiv-581494864">Shieldskin is great. Believe me. Doesn&#39;t interrupt your casting. Awesome,<br/>
and needed spell for soloing. However, it&#39;s gonna cost you. The spell<br/>
component is a cat&#39;s eye agate which sells for roughly 2 gold 5 silver or<br/>
so. Now, here&#39;s another tip, from what I can see the spell has to &#39;work up&#39;<br/>
to it&#39;s full strength. So, if you cast it and then immediately stary<br/>
whacking on something, your shield will come down with the first hit.<br/>
Duration was also better than I thought, but keep that in mind, if HAS a<br/>
duration.<br/>
