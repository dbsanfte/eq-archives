<b>Subject:</b> What i have to put up with <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421090027">Sorry this is so long.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a level 11 wizard about to turn 12.  Well my friend is a shaman who just<br/>
turned 14. Well he just brought<br/>
his new damage spell and he said it does 77 damage, to which i replied kewl<br/>
my next spell does that amount<br/>
too. That was a mistake he started laughing and saying things like &quot;why<br/>
would anyone want to play the wizard<br/>
when they can play the shaman&quot;.  &quot;the shaman can stand toe to toe like the<br/>
warrior and do the same damage<br/>
as the wizard, Ha HA HA HA .....&quot; . Then he went on saying crap like now he<br/>
knows the shaman is the best<br/>
class in the game. All he could talk about before was the sow spell, and now<br/>
it is he does the same damage<br/>
as the wizard.  My question is this, i thought i picked the wizard so i<br/>
would not have to hear stuff like this?<br/>
I thought level 12 was when the wizard started to leave other mage class<br/>
behind.  Know i have to hear alot<br/>
aggraviating crap from this shaman, laughing at the wizard class. Dam that<br/>
is going to suck.  Someone<br/>
please tell me there is hope out there as far as the damage spells go.</div>
