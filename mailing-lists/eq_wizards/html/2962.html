<div id="ygrps-yiv-2120616793">I&#39;m going to answer several posts at one time here to conserve your <br/>
bandwidth. :)  I hope you can follow:<br/>
<br/>
-- thanks for the Cazic maze directions.  Sounds freaking scary for now <br/>
hehe.  I don&#39;t like the 75% odds...especially with my slow old legs.  <br/>
Lim&#39;Dul cannot run like he used to.  I think I&#39;ll be safe and take the long <br/>
route around by way of my own 2 feet heh.<br/>
<br/>
-- AE spells.  I&#39;ve tried playing around with them under the advice I heard <br/>
here.  Still not working that great for me...I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m just not <br/>
targetting the right MoB in a fight.  Very little damage quite a bit of time <br/>
to cast.  I&#39;ll play with it a bit more.....<br/>
<br/>
-- Leatherskin.  I don&#39;t leave home without it. :)  Yes, expensive as hell.  <br/>
But I value my hide.<br/>
