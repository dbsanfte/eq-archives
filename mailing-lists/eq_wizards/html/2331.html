<div id="ygrps-yiv-202336426">Who cares if it&#39;s considered an exploit or not. My rule of thimb is: &quot;If it works for you and the game allows it, then do it!&quot;  If it&#39;s considered an exploit then don&#39;t tell anyone.  Basically an &quot;Exploit&quot; is anything that is considered morally wrong.  Thievery is morally wrong but the game allows it.  Just don&#39;t brag about your &quot;exploits&quot; and its&#39; ok.</div>
