&gt; By 14th, they are too easy.  I would suggest Unrest or the Cutthroat<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am level 10 and went there to try to solo one of the Aqua goblins.  He<br/>
resisted my root and swam over and started beating me.  I was able to land<br/>
some shocks of ice on him, but I could see he was going to kill me, so I<br/>
shadowstepped to the bottom of the ocean and gated to Felwithe from there.<br/>
<br/>
Was this just unlucky, or do I need to wait a level before going back to the<br/>
Aquas?  He did con blue to me.<br/>
