<b>Subject:</b> Faction With Trolls, and Dark Elves *spoiler* <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754199457">To all my fellow wizard. I am a Erudite Wizard, and have been rather curious if anyone knew of a way to gain faction with Trolls, and Dark Elves? My god is Solusek Ro, this may be a hinderance, but if anyone has any information I would much appreciate it. Thanks in advance.<br/>

P.S. If anyone wants to trade language when your on, give me a buzz. I play on Xegony, and Fennin Ro</div>
