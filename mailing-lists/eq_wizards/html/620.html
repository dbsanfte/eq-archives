<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-441696720">I&#39;m currently level 6 and have only used one of my training points to train in meditation. I assume that once I hit a certain level I&#39;ll realize what&#39;s lacking and then train alot in that, but any suggestions would be helpful. I was also saving up for spell research. Is spell research a skill that goes up quickly? Also, what does raising the spell research skill improve? All help is appreciated. Thanks, Lott.</div>
