<div id="ygrps-yiv-1212197873">According to Lim Dul:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I can see your point, but I don&#39;t think Verant intended for people to be <br/>
&gt; grouping with party members to are that far apart in Levels.  Otherwise, <br/>
&gt; what&#39;s to stop us from grouping with 40+ levelers and going after Giants and <br/>
&gt; Dragons! :)  Yeah, damn exciting...but pointless. ;)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;it&#39;s lonely at the top&quot;.<br/>
Unless you are in a very regular band of people, who adventure together all<br/>
the time - and usually exclude others then, which would be counterproductive -<br/>
you will have a good difference between lower levels and uppers within the<br/>
party.<br/>
<br/>
The problem kicks in then.<br/>
<br/>
I think Verant tend to ignore any whine &quot;we are underpowered&quot;. But they<br/>
definitively won&#39;t ignore &quot;people don&#39;t want to group with me for reason X&quot;<br/>
when the reason X is *objective* (such as the magic resistance factor), as<br/>
opposed to a dislike based on perceived prejudice (rogues suck - enchanter<br/>
suck and so on).<br/>
