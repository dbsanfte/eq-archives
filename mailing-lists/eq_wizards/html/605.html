<div id="ygrps-yiv-463022132">Ok so here&#39;s what I have learned about Languages so far, and seeing the many<br/>
questioning responses I figured I would throw my 2 coppers worth into the<br/>
pot.<br/>
<br/>
1)    Training 1 pt into a language will allow you to start learning it,<br/>
ussualy as with all skills 1 pt is need for faster advancement.  But<br/>
training at the guild is not always needed first.  To learn a new language<br/>
you have to hear it first before you can train in it.  Once you hear a<br/>
langauge then you can go to your guild trainer to learn it.  But not all<br/>
guild rtainers know all the languages.  Just like in real life, only<br/>
specific trainers know certain langauges.  You may have to ask several<br/>
trainers.  I know for a Wizzard in Nerriak I have 3 poeple I can train from<br/>
and My Quild Master only know 2 langauages while one of my trainers knows 5.<br/>
<br/>
2)  The only way to trully advance your language skill is by training at<br/>
guild or by listening to a person is a group.  Tells and Says do not work<br/>
for learning purposes.  They work for you to start the training but after<br/>
that you will need to be in a group to learn it from someone.  Speaking the<br/>
langauge to someone else does not work.  I have spent several hours with<br/>
another Wizzard when we both had the same training in it and we learned<br/>
nothing.  I went and trained a few more times and came back and he increased<br/>
to my level by me talking to him only.  I now hold and excellent rating in<br/>
several langauges including Old Erudian and received that by getting spammed<br/>
by 4 Erudites while I was in their group.  I traded another language they<br/>
wanted for OE.<br/>
<br/>
3)  You skill in languages is also limited by the persons skill you are<br/>
listening to.  If they only have a good rating in the langauge, then that is<br/>
the best you can get from them.<br/>
<br/>
For Wizzards I would HIGHLY suggest to learn Old Erudian by lvl 16, you WILL<br/>
need it to read the books needed for some spells.  I am only lvl 15 now, but<br/>
have Excellent speaking skills in OE, so if you are on the Karana server and<br/>
would like some lessons please give me a tell.  My fees are ussually small<br/>
