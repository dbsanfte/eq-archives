subject of kill stealing.  If you are going to do it.  At least turn it into a<br/>
positive.  For instance, when you are around level 10ish, you can hang out at<br/>
the &quot;plat&quot; in Northern Ro.  People will constantly be training /con yellow<br/>
mummies and madmen to there begging for your help.  Not only will you get<br/>
descent experience and loot (As a wizard we always seem to get the kill )  ;)<br/>
You will be building a good reputation for yourself, and at the same time be<br/>
helping others out.   Sometimes they are so greatful you may even get a &#39;tip&#39;.<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten everything from SoW to a couple of plat for doing this.  And all<br/>
you did was let them tank while you nuke, nuke, nuke.</div>
