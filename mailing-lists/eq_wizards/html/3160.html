<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111917433">Just wanted to clear up a few misconceptions in Aljernon / Alan Charity &#39;s<br/>
post<br/>
<br/>
    Tarton&#39;s Staff - Once you get to the level that you can actually get<br/>
this item you shouldn&#39;t be meleeing anyway.  At this point all weapons are<br/>
strictly for stat bonuses.  I&#39;m thinking to myself that Tarton&#39;s staff and<br/>
the Glowing stein would make an awesome combo.  Plus 20 Int.<br/>
<br/>
    Root/Enstill  - Out of all the classes that get this spell line, ALL of<br/>
the classes have the same problems as your version.  Snare rules in every<br/>
way over root/enstill.  It&#39;s one of the best spells in the game for dungeon<br/>
diving.  Try going to Lower Gukk without someone who can snare.  I guarantee<br/>
you won&#39;t last long.<br/>
<br/>
    Crowd control - Yes, Enchanter&#39;s absolutely rule at this.  It&#39;s what we<br/>
do.  Everything else is just cream.  The problem is, this is how we add to<br/>
the group.  Yes we can do DD, but it absolutely sucks.  Extremely long cast<br/>
time AND refresh rate.  Much better off De-buffing and crowd controling.<br/>
There are long periods of time when I&#39;m with my group that I never do a<br/>
SINGLE point of damage to any MOB&#39;s.  And that&#39;s the way I want it, because<br/>
I&#39;ve slowed it, weakened it, sped up my party members, and then cast clarity<br/>
and other buffs.<br/>
<br/>
    And My absolute biggest BEEF with your post - Mez&#39;ing and mem blurring<br/>
not being resistable.  Your friend mez&#39;d and blurred a HG at level 20?<br/>
Absolutely utter CRAP.  No way.  Never happened.  The only way I&#39;ll ever<br/>
believe that is if I see him do it.  Mez and mem blur IS resistable.  I get<br/>
resisted ALL of the time, especially if I don&#39;t Tashani first.  Pure<br/>
misinformation of your &quot;friends&quot; part<br/>
<br/>
    And how do I know all of this you ask?<br/>
