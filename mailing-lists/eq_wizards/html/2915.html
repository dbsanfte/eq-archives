<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581878563">The only way i know for sure to stop a spell is to interupt it yourself.<br/>
You can do this usually just by taking a few steps.  Moving messes up your<br/>
concentration and usually will stop the spell,  The closer a spell is to<br/>
being cast, the harder it is to interupt.</div>
