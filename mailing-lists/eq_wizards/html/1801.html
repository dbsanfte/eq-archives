<b>Subject:</b> adjustments for Wizards? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830665339">There is starting to get some interesting suggestions for tweaking the <br/>
Wizard class.  Keep &#39;em coming...way better suggestions than that whole &quot;ban <br/>
the twinky&quot; idea.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something that I found disconcerting last night.  I was with a bunch <br/>
of warriors, druids and others inside Dvinn&#39;s palace last night. It was my <br/>
first time back there in a long time and so I was pleasantly surprised <br/>
everything was green to me there.  Most of the others in the room were <br/>
almost uniform in level 14-19...maybe about 10 of us in the room.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...it has been a dream in my young Wizard life to give some payback to <br/>
Dvinn for the hassle he had given me when I was younger.  I was one of the <br/>
higher level guys there being 16lvl...and being the only caster in the <br/>
room...everyone was depending on me to get the damage in while everybody <br/>
else tanked.<br/>
<br/>
Lo and behold...the fighting started and ALL my spells were resisted. We <br/>
managed to take him down anyway...and everybody praised me for my help...but <br/>
I was so embarrassed I brushed off all the praise and just sulked in the <br/>
corner.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I know we&#39;ve addressed the subject of our spells vrs tombstones before, but <br/>
we are an embarrassingly useless class against red level characters.  <br/>
Everything just bounces off.  Wonder if Verant should see it fit to adjust <br/>
that a little...maybe even if we just knick the tombstones a *little* it <br/>
would be nice.  Even the lower level tanks were contributing at least.<br/>
