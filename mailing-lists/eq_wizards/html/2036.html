<div id="ygrps-yiv-225560200">Well, I don&#39;t think Verant will allow Wizards to be able to summone<br/>
players or thier group ...that seems to really make travel too easy..<br/>
<br/>
But they may allow increased travel options for Wizards themselves...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
how about a Wizard&#39;s Gate Spell....<br/>
<br/>
        It has a possible six Gate Locations....the first being your<br/>
bind point.<br/>
        The rest are set by &quot;tokens&quot; the Wizard places or gives to a<br/>
player, allowing the<br/>
         Wizard to Gate to a total of six spots/players chosen by him.<br/>
<br/>
         The tokens could be found and sold by others so placement would<br/>
be critical...<br/>
         They could be expended after it is use so a replacement would<br/>
need to be carried.<br/>
          They could be a &quot;Jewel&quot; made by a Jeweler.<br/>
<br/>
     I don&#39;t really think Verant will want to have an addition 5 items<br/>
around for each Wiz,<br/>
     and the Data Base changes might be extensive...so as an<br/>
alternative...<br/>
<br/>
          The Wiz gets to set and additionl 5 bind points...the first<br/>
one being where he returns when killed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There could be another way to transport groups that Verant might not<br/>
object to....personally I think it would be an interesting addition to<br/>
the game...<br/>
<br/>
Give the Wizards a spell that only works at certian points...say at<br/>
Pentacles places around Norath...at these points, you can cast and be<br/>
transported to another of the same.<br/>
<br/>
they would be placed in out of the way places..but not necessarilly LONG<br/>
walking distances ..<br/>
<br/>
by using a series of these Teleports, you could get to the desiered<br/>
location..<br/>
<br/>
So, you would have to walk to the first one in the chain, teleport to<br/>
the target, walk to the second one..telleport to the next one....etc<br/>
till you reached your destination...<br/>
<br/>
Each Pentalce would have a fixed target point so you would have to know<br/>
where each one goes and then know where the next one in the chain you<br/>
wish to travel is located...<br/>
<br/>
there might be several routes to the same final destination..depending<br/>
upon how many pentalces the Wizard was aware of...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, say the Wiz gets this spell at L12 or 16..and he can transport<br/>
himself only at that level....but with each spell circle, he can add<br/>
another player to the number he can transport....and so after 5<br/>
aditional circles he could transport his whole party<br/>
<br/>
Verant could control the ease of movement by making the shortest routes<br/>
have pentacles located in very Difficult places to get to...and the<br/>
longer routes located in eaiser places..<br/>
<br/>
In a +PVP environment, there could be much conflict trying to control<br/>
key pentacles...<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts???</div>
