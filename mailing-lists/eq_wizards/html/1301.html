Agreed. Excellent tactics for wizards with brains..........but other party<br/>
members need brains and have to think like that too. We KNOW we are useful<br/>
to parties but we have to convince them we are.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well said Jay. Parties cant be bothered with wizards, they<br/>
&gt; &gt; cant buff, cant heal<br/>
&gt; &gt; and cant really help parties that much...&quot;we were supposed<br/>
&gt; &gt; to be heavy<br/>
&gt; &gt; artillery&quot; but that just is not correct. I think a wizard<br/>
&gt; &gt; would be most parties<br/>
&gt; &gt; last choice if they could choose from all the classes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Let me just throw in the fact that this is not my experience.  A<br/>
&gt; wizard can be a great help to a party if it is organized well and if<br/>
&gt; the wizard has brains.<br/>
&gt; What do I mean by brains?  Well, some wizards immediately start<br/>
&gt; casting on a monster when the fight starts.  They do a good chunk of<br/>
&gt; damage so the monster runs for them.  From then on, the whole party<br/>
&gt; has to scramble to keep the wizard alive.<br/>
&gt; If played well, the wizard can make the difference between a tough<br/>
&gt; fight and an easy one.  Throw in spells to take out nice chunks of<br/>
&gt; hitpoints once in a while.  If things go wrong, blast away and do<br/>
&gt; 300-400 damage in a few seconds, saving the party.  If the monster<br/>
&gt; runs, root it and finish it off, saving time.<br/>
&gt; A smart wizard can be a great asset to any party.  The key is, don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; put yourself in a position where everyone has to go out of their way<br/>
&gt; to save you.<br/>
