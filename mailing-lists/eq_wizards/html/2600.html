<div id="ygrps-yiv-817236984">I hunt lavastorm/najena all the time and I honestly have not found an over <br/>
abundance of cats eye agates there.  Maybe I just haven&#39;t hit the jackpot <br/>
yet, but I would buy them in the city until you find that little gold mine <br/>
yourself.  Lava is a good place but at your level you will probably con a <br/>
lot of the creatures green there.  The lava crawlers and lava basilisks <br/>
will be an exception but bas hit you with a spell that turns you to rock <br/>
and stuns you for a few moments while they pound you hard and crawlers cast <br/>
as well.  You need someone else to team with on those as they also tend to <br/>
resist root very well.  You could try to kill the NPC Erudite Hykallen and <br/>
her pet out in the zone at the gobbie camp, but she is a nec, I believe, <br/>
and she casts some whopper spells on you and doesn&#39;t seem to have down time <br/>
to recover like we do.  Najena would be a good place for you.  Get invis <br/>
spell for sure when you get your level and all the others you can get <br/>
without research and make your way in and fight fight fight :)...lots of <br/>
goodies inside.<br/>

&gt;Could someone give me information on good places to hunt at lvl 16.  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;heard Lavastorm is good for collecting jewels needed for Shieldskin but I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t know if It&#39;s too dangerous for me yet.  Also are there any zones at my<br/>
&gt;lvl that are notorius for giving good wiz items?<br/>
