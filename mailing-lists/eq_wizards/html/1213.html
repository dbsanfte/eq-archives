<b>Subject:</b> Re: Charging for Services <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1550922843">According to Marziani, Michael D.:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t know why but it has never made sense to me to charge for services<br/>
&gt; such as binding, invis, and language training.  Perhaps it is just the<br/>
&gt; personality of my character that he enjoys helping others and gets full<br/>
&gt; satisfaction out of the good deed itself, not needing any sort of physical<br/>
&gt; compensation.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is also why I suggested you invest in useful life-saving spells<br/>
before checking Bind. If someone binds me, I&#39;ll give something (usually the<br/>
gold I have at hand) if possible, but do not expect to be given something<br/>
once it&#39;s me doing the binding.<br/>
<br/>
I might charge something (probably) symbolic once I get to the gates and<br/>
portals levels, since I took upon the Wizard class almost solely for the<br/>
purpose of using these spells (I enjoy teleport. I always end up a gaming<br/>
session by bowing to friends, then gating for the fun of it. Even when I<br/>
was in Faydark&#39;s Orc camp and moving back to Felwithe). &quot;Newbie transport<br/>
service. Express from Faydark to Erud or Queynos. Binding at destination<br/>
if required&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that just seems unkind.  I remember when I was level 8 just travelling over<br/>
&gt; to freeport.  I only had a couple of my new 3rd circle spells because they<br/>
&gt; were so expensive and I was flat broke.  I saw people auctioning: &quot;Binding<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One trick, which works for some spells only alas: Look at other guild<br/>
merchant. Some have spells that are shared across classes, and are of lower<br/>
circle than ours for other classes. Why, I was surprised at the Freeport<br/>
guild of finding an Sense Summoned (level 8) for 4gp... until I realised<br/>
the merchant was a Magician merchant (and they get Sense at level 4)...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I guess it is just based on your roleplaying style, but even if I have no<br/>
&gt; money and still have spells to buy, I would not ask for or accept any sort<br/>
&gt; of payment for using my talents.  Does anyone else agree with me or do you<br/>
&gt; all think that you SHOULD rightfully earn a profit from using your skills?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Alas, I am afraid it is the only part of the player economy that works...<br/>
because it costs nothing to make :(<br/>
