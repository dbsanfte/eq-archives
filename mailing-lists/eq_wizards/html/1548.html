<div id="ygrps-yiv-903417915"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; On Eqlizer&#39;s site I noticed we get gate to North.  I am<br/>
&gt; wondering where is &quot;North&quot;.  I assume it is North Qeynos,<br/>
&gt; but I would appreciate if someone can confirm this for me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s North Karana.  Have you ever seen those structures, 4<br/>
huge curving glowing pillars?  They&#39;re found in Toxullia Forest (near<br/>
Erudin), at the bridge in North Karanas, and in Greater Faydark.<br/>
Those are the places you can gate to with Fay Gate, North Gate and Tox<br/>
Gate.<br/>
