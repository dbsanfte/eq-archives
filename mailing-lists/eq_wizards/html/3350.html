<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053480631">According to Lim Dul:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Can&#39;t really say since I&#39;ve never fought in Toxx.  However, some guards in <br/>
&gt; certain newbie zones are better than others.  Other&#39;s might have different <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All guards have a &quot;lookabout&quot; cycle, of varying durations (I think it&#39;s<br/>
linked to the computer they run on). In my experience, the Kelethin and<br/>
Toxxulian ones are the slowest ; I think they have a lookabout of 2s or<br/>
so. Plenty of time for the mob to hit you once or twice.  The Kelethin<br/>
guards have also a voluntarily very small agggro range, otherwise, they&#39;d<br/>
devastate the countryside, or clear the orc camps before the players.<br/>
<br/>
Note that all guards, regardless of their origin, will not help you against<br/>
&quot;humanoid&quot; opponents ever. Freeport guards never help you against Dorn,<br/>
or madmen. Qeynos guards never help you against bandits.<br/>
<br/>
The only exception, I think, are the Highhold Pass guards, which will<br/>
eradicate any smuggler they find.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Steamfont guards -- good reaction time, but they&#39;re relatively weaker than <br/>
&gt; some of the MoBs you might encounter in the area.  If you hear &quot;Hero&quot; you <br/>
&gt; should basically zone out. :)  Weak little stinky gnomes...OOPS!  Did I just <br/>
&gt; say that out loud?  heh<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Hero is the Hill Giant of the area. Qeynos guards also fall quickly<br/>
against hill giants, or the griffons (for those on duty in the Karanas).<br/>
Don&#39;t expect the Commonland guards to survive attack by griffons either.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Freeport guards -- slow reaction times, but not as bad as Kelethin.  Faction <br/>
&gt; might affect the way they help you here since some of them are corrupt.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope. They spot an &quot;ennemy&quot;, they attack. They have a slow lookabout,<br/>
and only medium aggro range.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; called...beggers or something.  I don&#39;t think they help you against Dorn the <br/>
&gt; Dark Elf NPC either.  Somebody else here might know...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Queynos guards -- pretty reliable.  I haven&#39;t had any problems with their <br/>
&gt; help there.  You might want to head here since there is more stuff to kill <br/>
&gt; than Toxx.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I strongly suggest that. Except for necros, who pretty much have to wait<br/>
till they can get their invis spell, head immediately to Qeynos, and hunt<br/>
there. You&#39;ll find it a paradise for newbies.<br/>
