<b>Subject:</b> Re: Bit of advice - experimenting <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-323992970">The gentleman in the post below reminded me of a bit of advice I always give<br/>
to lower level wizards when they ask me &quot;What level 8 (or 12 or 16) spells<br/>
should I buy?&quot;  I tell them to buy them all.  If they ask me what they<br/>
should buy first I tell them what I think, but I reiterate that they should<br/>
always buy all their spells.  Never let anyone tell you that some spell has<br/>
no use.  The only time you should believe it is if you have experimented<br/>
with it enough to determine that for yourself.  Personally I think some<br/>
spells are fairly useless, but it&#39;s only because I bought them all and tried<br/>
to find something useful to do with them.  If you let someone else tell you<br/>
that something is useless, then it will condition you to not experiment, so<br/>
don&#39;t let that happen.<br/>
<br/>
Always remember we are Wizards, seekers of knowledge and keepers of great<br/>
power.  Seek to understand the spells you get and what they are for rather<br/>
than taking someone else&#39;s word for it.  I know that I don&#39;t have it all<br/>
figured out yet as I am only level 17, but I as I progress I will always try<br/>
everything I can to make the most of the power and knowledge I receive.  I<br/>
encourage you all to do the same.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I hit the magical 20 and against many people&#39;s advice bought force shock.<br/>
Hey, it was too tempting. I&#39;ve found that it works on pretty much anything<br/>
that cons blue. This includes, Emperor Crush, Ambassador Dvinn, a whole host<br/>
of orcs, Crag spiders. Yeah I&#39;ve fizzled but never twice in a row. I&#39;ve had<br/>
it resisted ONCE by a blue. I wouldn&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;m not casting it<br/>
more than once a fight anyways. Takes forever to be able to cast it again,<br/>
and eats up a TON of mana. I wouldn&#39;t worry about other people&#39;s<br/>
experiences. Have your own, and take it from there. Like your mother said,<br/>
if you friend jumped off the bridge you would have to as well? Seems to me<br/>
it&#39;s all in perspective. I&#39;ve had a blast with Force Shock.<br/>
