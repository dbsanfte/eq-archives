<div id="ygrps-yiv-25453413">The spell you choose first depends on your style of adventuring. If <br/>
you enjoy large groups, the first and most helpful spell is clearly <br/>
FireBolt. Your party members will be quite impressed with this spell <br/>
because you will do tremendous amounts of damage for your level. <br/>
However because,its casting time is long (too long to use one on <br/>
one), and range is short, it is only effective in a party (also you <br/>
can miss). <br/>
<br/>
If you are a more solitary fellow I would sugguest shock of ice. The <br/>
damage is still good and its casting time is such that you can cast <br/>
and melee at the same time ( I don&#39;t recommend it though ). It is <br/>
also an effective spell for finishing off squirly runners.<br/>
After obtaining one of these two spells I would suggest getting <br/>
lesser shielding. It is a decent upgrade to minor shielding. Then get <br/>
the other of the two direct damage spells that you didn&#39;t get before. <br/>
In my opinion the rest of the spells are optional. These three are <br/>
your bread and butter for that rank. (shadow step can be quite handy <br/>
for getting out of a bad situation though).<br/>
<br/>
Just my humble opinion. Hope this helps<br/>
