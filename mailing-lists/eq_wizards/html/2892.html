<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-71170573">The main question is how and when to use AE spells. This is great spells if<br/>
you are with a party wich know how to get monsters from you if you cast it.<br/>
<br/>
One of tactics wich i think that can be usefus is if you are in group with<br/>
a 3 or more fighters wich engage a monsters on 1 on 1 basis so when you<br/>
cast a AE spell it will do low damage to all 3 mobs wich have already build<br/>
some hate to fighters. AE spels are not efficent if you hit less then 3<br/>
mobs as mana to damage ratio is much worse then our DD spels. The main<br/>
problem is if your group is attacked by more mobs then you have fighters to<br/>
intercept with, as any mob wich was not been hit at last some times will<br/>
imediatly turn on you.<br/>
<br/>
If you are in group wich is attacked by one big guy and some green ones<br/>
come along, you can cast a AE spell on your puller and then wait a second<br/>
that your group take off all guys wich come to attack you.. ps advice dont<br/>
try this if your group is not a well known people in casual groups people<br/>
tend to continue hacking on their  target and they see that you are near<br/>
dead when its too late and your leather skeen is alredy gone.<br/>

&gt;Hi evryone<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Is there any AE spells that a lv 22 wizzie can use at all ? i mean when i <br/>
&gt;cast on the mob a few times they will come after me, so i thought that if <br/>
&gt;there was a good AE spell that i can cast on the tanks and do about the same <br/>
&gt;danage but not take the blame for the damage ?. that would be werry neat!!<br/>
