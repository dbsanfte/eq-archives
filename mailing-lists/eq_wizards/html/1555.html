I have just made level 20 and have noticed that I now get several options besides root and nuke.  Enstill and Titan Clash come to mind, DD spell does some stunning, plus I still got my old Root and Nukes.  The new DD gets resisted A LOT, possibly because of its dual effects, damage & stun.  Would appreciate any insights/combo strategies, especially ones that concentrate on Titan Clash, Enstill, Root, etc etc.  Seems to me<br/>
that Titan Clash could be pretty useful against<br/>
enemy casters, since it interrupts them.  Oh well, post your experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for you help.<br/>
