<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306311283">Veerant will never aprove of this, this is Enchanters  teritory and the will never. I think that it�s a good ide�or something like it but they just wont.<br/>
And yes something has to be done to wizards atraction to groups, most of my life up to lv 25 has been like: Logs on to EQ, any friends on - sometimes yes, but most of my friends are powerleveling so i�m far behind them and cant group, anything to solo and not get killed more then i can bare - NO, ok trying to get a group . NO WAY most of the times, any nice quests to do and get a nice item annd or some nice XP - NO.<br/>
<br/>
Well one problem for me is that i cant play on regular basis, my work prevents it so one week i can play evry night and level quite nice about 1 level/night or close to it. But that i cant play for a week or 2 and when i come back all those i grouped with are to high again. So i need to find some new friends and convince them of that not all wizards are killstealers and bad ppl.<br/>
It gets frustrating over time and now i�m at the point where i rather play something else then EQ, AC or Homeworld mostley.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm i bit of a rant there but as you can see, if wizards where more sought after for groups then it would be much easier for all us wizards in Norrath.<br/>

&gt;------ snip --------<br/>
 <br/>
&gt; Second, we need some way to make wizards more of a symbiotic class.  We are<br/>
&gt; simply not as desirable for grouping as the other classes in most scenarios.<br/>
&gt; There may be many ways of going about this.  Here&#39;s my one suggestion<br/>
&gt; (paired down for space purposes, but I think you can see how it could be<br/>
&gt; modified for balance, etc.).  Wizards (perhaps with the help of an<br/>
&gt; enchanter) should be able to cast their damage spells onto the weapons of<br/>
&gt; other classes.  One possible implementation would be to have an &quot;enchanted<br/>
&gt; weapon&quot; randomly go off for, say, 1/10th of the total damage possible in the<br/>
&gt; spell, for up to 10 hits.  This would allow a wizard to &quot;buff&quot; in a<br/>
&gt; meaningful way.  Tanks would want us, and it would increase our<br/>
&gt; effectiveness because the damage would cause hate buildup towards the tank,<br/>
&gt; not us (which becomes a serious problem at higher levels).  I&#39;ve talked to<br/>
&gt; enough non-wizards who loved this idea that I think it worth bringing before<br/>
&gt; a group of wizards, possibly for a petition.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; couple of last comments:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Micon Bittermage said:<br/>
&gt; &gt; There is one other solution that to me is a lot more in keeping with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; AD&D style that I think people are used to - randomization.  You are<br/>
&gt; &gt; right tho that virtually all quests are breaks down to kill X and give<br/>
&gt; &gt; its head/heart/tongue/whatever to NPC Y.  But randomizing would make<br/>
&gt; &gt; them more quest-like.  Easier to explain in an example:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I agree wholeheartedly.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Lastly, to address the twinking problem:  Maybe the stein instead of<br/>
&gt; &gt; giving +10 int would give (+2 times level/10).  Therefore, your level 50<br/>
&gt; &gt; wizard has a +10 int stein, but his twinked level 2 wizard has the same<br/>
&gt; &gt; stein at +0 int!  Easily explained that with wisdom of levels you gain<br/>
&gt; &gt; the ability to use a sword better (damage =level, or something similar),<br/>
&gt; &gt; gain more power from the gem, or whatever.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is a good solution, but the problem (as I see it) isn&#39;t the twinked<br/>
&gt; wizards, but the twinked tanks.  A glowing stein that gives plus 10 int, is<br/>
&gt; only giving a lvl 5 wizard (to pull an example from a hat) an extra 10 mana.<br/>
&gt; This is trivial.  In contrast, a warrior wearing several pieces of bronze<br/>
&gt; (say 40 or 50 pp worth--substantially less than a glowing stein in value) at<br/>
&gt; lvl 1 or 2 gets a significant boost to AC (roughly 50 to 100 AC points).<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve played around enough with low level spell casters and tanks to know<br/>
&gt; that the difference is impressive.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, I don&#39;t know how twinking should be solved.  I have yet to hear a<br/>
&gt; solution I like.<br/>
