&gt; Ok, I agree with you.. but what you are asking for is a programming miracle.<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately it&#39;s incredibly hard (possibly impossible ?) to be able to<br/>
&gt; program a game  to distinguish between the two circumstances.  So Verant<br/>
&gt; chose to allow them to pass through walls and avoid having exploitable<br/>
&gt; situations.  Realistically they had to chose one way or the other, and I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t say I disagree with their choice.<br/>
