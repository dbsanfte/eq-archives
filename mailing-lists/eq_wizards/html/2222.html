Well, I&#39;m finally going to break down and seriously play a spellcasting <br/>
class.  Of course due to the raw power of the class, as well as the <br/>
versatility of teleportation, Wizards are my first choice.  I realize that <br/>
people have most likely time and again requested spell lists, but here I am, <br/>
brand spanking new to the list.  I was wondering if perhaps some nice soul <br/>
out there might be able to send me a complete list.  I&#39;ve checked EQLizer, <br/>
EQVault, and EQstratics and none of them have every spell, thanks in advance <br/>
everyone.<br/>

I&#39;m a 14th level wizard on E&#39;Ci. David, if I may be honest here, I would <br/>
like to suggest that if you want to have fun playing a spellcaster, pick <br/>
about anything other than Wizard. Enchanters get pets and can make magical <br/>
items. If I were to start over and pick a pure mage class, that would be the <br/>
one I&#39;d go with.<br/>
<br/>
*ducks flameage*<br/>
<br/>
&lt;rant mode&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Let me explain - Verant hasn&#39;t implemented specialization skills or the <br/>
alternate planes, we have almost nothing for armor or hitpoints, our melee <br/>
skills are pathetic and our powers don&#39;t become greater than other classes <br/>
until 40-somethingth level. Plus, the single greatest way of leveling up - <br/>
killing har red mobs - is unavailable to us, because our spells are often <br/>
resisted completely by these creatures. So, instead of grouping with <br/>
powerful warriors to beat up on mobs that will actually give EVERYONE in the <br/>
group decent experience, we&#39;re relegated to trying to solo weak blues or <br/>
fight white and yellow creatures in a group for pitiful experience because <br/>
WE CAN&#39;T TOUCH HARD MOBS LIKE EVERY OTHER CLASS CAN!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve watched every group I&#39;ve run with pass me up in level. I&#39;ve watched <br/>
characters started while I was at level 12 PASS ME at level 13. It&#39;s not as <br/>
though I never play, it&#39;s just that I CANNOT GAIN MORE THAN HALF A BUBBLE <br/>
EXP PER HOUR, on average. That&#39;s powergaming, soloing in the Karanas vs. <br/>
blue beetles and the occasional white/yellow.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, I&#39;m very frustrated in playing this class right now. The <br/>
only reason I remain a Wizard is stubbornness. Everyone says it gets better <br/>
at higher levels, but the fact of the matter is that we&#39;ll always be a <br/>
second-rate class unless Verant fixes specialization, plane travel and <br/>
spell-resistances of higher-level mobs.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;/rant mode&gt;<br/>
