&gt; Oh no...I was talking about the rune of scale for the Runescale cloak?   I<br/>
&gt; understand it was supposed to be carried by saltwater crocs in the back<br/>
&gt; regions of Upper Guk?<br/>

once or twice. Or three times. :) They did not like that, so make sure<br/>
you know where you are going.<br/>

The thing that got in the way were the sonic bats who can see through<br/>
both invis and invis undead, so you have to stick to a wall carefully<br/>
going around their aggro radius. Other than that - if you know the way<br/>
and you got see invis and the hand has been recently killed, you can do<br/>
it alone.<br/>
