<b>Subject:</b> Twinking...one other note ref. to UO and Diablo <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1212323368">Also, I would point out, the references to &quot;see what happened in UO and<br/>
Diablo&quot; really don&#39;t hold water, simply because there was no choice as to<br/>
whether a player was +pvp or -pvp.  You had to play and do what was<br/>
necessary to protect yourself.  In that respect, there would be an unfair<br/>
advantage if someone had high level equipment and were the same level as<br/>
you, you would not be able to defend yourself the same as if you were on<br/>
even ground item-wise.  Here it doesn&#39;t matter who wears what, unless you<br/>
are +pvp really.  Those people are aware they will have a rough road ahead<br/>
and they choose to be +pvp because they like that challenge.  Personally, I<br/>
was terribly tired of losing all my money and regeants, armor in UO that I<br/>
had on me to go to a dungeon, only to have some pack of brats hiding and<br/>
nuke me to kingdom come and laugh while they take all my possessions that I<br/>
worked very hard for.  I also counseled in UO for about 6 months and I<br/>
honestly did not ever hear anyone complain one time about someone having<br/>
special items there.  I see it all the time here.<br/>
What would happen if I saw a flowing black robe for sale, or it was being<br/>
auctioned and I actually had enough money to purchase it.. is this wrong if<br/>
my level doesn&#39;t allow for me to have ventured into the dungeon to get it<br/>
myself...what if I get the majority of damage in, while killing Najena and I<br/>
am lower level than is thought to be necessary to get this item...OR, what<br/>
if it is simply my turn to loot in a group atmosphere even if I am lower<br/>
than the rest of my group by 5 or 6 levels?  Is this wrong?  There are a<br/>
multitude of ways to have acquired many different items in the game.  It<br/>
seems to me, that 99% of the uproar on this topic is due directly to<br/>
jealousy on the part of the people who are complaining.  Sure I would like<br/>
certain items, but I don&#39;t think there is anything in the game other than<br/>
level 49 spells that will give me a huge advantage over anyone else, and I<br/>
won&#39;t be to that point for a very long time and I can&#39;t use those no matter<br/>
what right now.<br/>
The use of 3rd party programs should not be allowed, but sharing is not a<br/>
bad thing...everyone&#39;s parents taught them sharing was good ( at least I<br/>
hope they all did).  I still think it is in the majority of cases, just not<br/>
necessarily on the +pvp server.  I think that is the one place this issue<br/>
should be monitored if it is at all.  That is where the disparity will be<br/>
noted if anywhere.<br/>
Topic is pretty well closed for me, having said that.  &#39;Nuff said and thanks<br/>
for allowing my voice to be heard as well.</div>
