<b>Subject:</b> Staff of the Wheel <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-656728571">I have started my quest for the Staff of the Wheel and currently have 8 of<br/>
the 10 rods.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am missing the one in Guk and the one from the Everfrost caves. But I have<br/>
a few questions since I have spent no time in Guk in 32 levels.<br/>
<br/>
GUK<br/>
1. I need to know the easiest or quickest path to the hand room?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2. Is the room on the Live or Dead side?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3. Will I encounter any Undead frogs along the way?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
EVERFROST<br/>
I know that the rod is surrounded by 3 IBS and that an NPC is in the area. I<br/>
can get by the IBS with Invis to Undead but the NPC could be a problem.<br/>
<br/>
1. Is this NPC within range of the rod?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I will not have a group with me and am only going to attempt this when the<br/>
Hand room is being camped. I may however try a suicide run depending on how<br/>
brave I feel.<br/>
