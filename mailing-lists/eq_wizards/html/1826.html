<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232079344">Well I have a problem with this whole e-mail, First I thought the whole point <br/>
of this game is to group and not solo.  That is what attracted me to this <br/>
game.  I&#39;m tired of playing Might and Magic and other such RPG&#39;s.  What your <br/>
saying is everyone is whinning because they feel useless in a group.  Well <br/>
grouping is the whole point to this game.  Second I wanna kill red mobs, it&#39;s <br/>
much more satisfying killing something such higher level than your group.  <br/>
Now no one wants a wizard because they know you&#39;re useless when it comes to <br/>
mobs 5 or 6 levels ahead of you.  Your point about coming back later when <br/>
your higher level is just stupid.  If all other classes can group and kill a <br/>
red mob why can&#39;t you?  The wizard is left in the cold.  I don&#39;t think either <br/>
that anyone wants to jump right in and melee, I sure as hell don&#39;t.  But i <br/>
want to be effective in a group with my spells, that&#39;s all I want.  Sorry if <br/>
I sound like an ass but it pisses me off when people are so satisfied with <br/>
our class when you see all the other classes get improvements.  I would love <br/>
to start a petition to make our class better if everyone is for it!<br/>
