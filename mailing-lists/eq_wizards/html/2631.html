<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047677528">Hi all,<br/>
 I am level 24 so i now just pass the terrible 16-24 level (yeah at level 23<br/>
i was only using dd of level 16 sigh :( ).So i can deal 175 hp per cast...<br/>
Wow... It really sucks.... I get others char on the server nearly same<br/>
level, and let  me tell you friends, that the wizzard is the weakest class<br/>
of all Norrath. All classes get many lines of spell.. We don&#39;t...<br/>
We have :<br/>
<br/>
1. Dd spel : our only power.<br/>
2. Ae spel : useless.. Never seen someone use it<br/>
3. Shield : same as all caster classes<br/>
4. Gate and evacuate : same as druid.. (evacuate work beters then gate ok ok<br/>
you get a point:) )<br/>
5. glimpse line : mouhhhaaa too funny :)<br/>
7. root : yeah as shaman and druid.... And i have been told that the root<br/>
level 39 immobilise doesn t work well...<br/>
<br/>
and it s all... Nothing more.. So we get dd spel it s ALL.. That&#39;s so<br/>
boring... At level 24, a necro can :<br/>
<br/>
1. summon a strong pet<br/>
2. Cast dot for 500 dommage for two bubble of mana...<br/>
3. Suck life of the mob...<br/>
4. Cast a dd of 145 dommage......<br/>
5. get a very good ac with spirit armor and invulnerability !!<br/>
6. Heal other<br/>
7. Cast fear who is LESS resisted then root and stay for a minimum of time<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To be realist, we are a magician or necro without pet and shield.. Many tell<br/>
us : oh you can cast spel very fast !!! Yes and ??? It&#39;s the worste thing to<br/>
cast spel very fast.. Everyone know that in a group you must cast spel<br/>
veryyyy slowy or the mob will became crazy at you.<br/>
It helps in solo ? Heu every other caster get a pet, so casting time is not<br/>
important...<br/>
<br/>
I don t think a petition will change anything. We are just a undepowered<br/>
class forever. I will continue to play with my wizzard for fun cause i like<br/>
rpg with him but that s all i know he will never been a powerful char. <br/>
<br/>
My 2 cents<br/>
<br/>
yakos on karana<br/>
<br/>
p.s. oh and yes for the funny guys who say : we are the only one who can<br/>
solo a hills giant and so.. Guys a hills giant is green at level 40-42...<br/>
And for now, no one know about meteor shower (yes at level 50 you will use a<br/>
dd level 44, and yes the same as the druid use at level 49 :( )</div>
