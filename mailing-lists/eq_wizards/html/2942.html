<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Tactic:  if a group pull 2 or 3 darkies i wait until they build some &gt;hate<br/>
&gt;against fighters and then i cast a Ligting storm on them. If casted &gt;in<br/>
&gt;right moment it will not make them agresive and i will do much more &gt;damage<br/>
&gt;then using only DD spels.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for the tips.  Question....I would assume you&#39;d need to have your <br/>
group attack each of the Mobs to get their attention eh?  I would assume any <br/>
Mobs that have not been attacked would suddenly turn aggro on you if you <br/>
suddenly dropped balls of flame on their heads?  :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Pulling with eye... Eye is nice thing to pull a mobs first they don  &gt;get<br/>
&gt;agresive to it until it is realy near. and when they hit you can pull &gt;only<br/>
&gt;this room of monsters as target is already killed and they go after a<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll give this tactic a try.  Do you just let them kill the eyeball and wait <br/>
for them to find you?<br/>
<br/>
Final unrelated question:  I know this has been covered before, but I don&#39;t <br/>
want to dig through hundreds of digests. :)  How do I find my way around the <br/>
Cazic maze from our teleport pyramid?  How do I get to the courtyard?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
