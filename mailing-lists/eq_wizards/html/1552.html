<div id="ygrps-yiv-221599386">You are very perceptive Valacian and, at least to me, make a lot of sense.<br/>
I have stated before, several times, that I am very happy with the wizard<br/>
class as it stands.  Some ppl don&#39;t agree. Very well, as Valacian suggested,<br/>
lets get by this and focus on what we CAN do.  Lets unlock the mysteries of<br/>
the wizard class as it stands now, not what it could be or what it should<br/>
be.  That&#39;s what the /feedback feature is for in the game.<br/>
<br/>
If we wish to continue to argue the different aspects of the wizard class,<br/>
then maybe we should make a new email list for that specific focus.  Don&#39;t<br/>
get me wrong, I like a good debate as much as the next person, but I think<br/>
Valacian is right, we have the potential of scaring ppl away, of doing the<br/>
opposite of what this list was created for.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Valacian for the reality check.<br/>

&gt; I can feel the wrath now...  but I am ready for the comments.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I may comment - I don&#39;t believe that us discussing what &#39;would be nice&#39;<br/>
for Wizard spells really helps us be Wizards.  I really believe that if we<br/>
continue to complain or comment on the apparent lack of spells/problems with<br/>
spells that we have, we are not going to achieve what I believe this mailing<br/>
list was setup for.  This list is to share information between all Wizards<br/>
within Norrath !  We are going to lose potential and current subscribers (me<br/>
and I&#39;m sure others), thus losing valuable shared information because of our<br/>
ranting and raving about our class.  Remember, Verant is probably not<br/>
reading this forum..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My suggestion:  Let&#39;s talk about ideas and share information that will<br/>
help each other play the class that we chose to play.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So far, the most useful thing I have read (besides Spoiler information) is<br/>
the &#39;bug&#39; that allows our Eye of Zoom to unlock doors.  I think that&#39;s great<br/>
