<div id="ygrps-yiv-474114218">I agree with you.  You should be able to cast spells on a docked boat.  Maybe they dont want the extra animation lagging the boat ride up?  *shrugs*  But, yeah, I think we should at least be able to cast Gate while on a docked boat...<br/>

&gt; Please give your thoughts on this:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Traveling from Queynos to Euridan the boat stops at the Cat island.<br/>
&gt; Frequently adventures bring trains of undead to the boat and we wizards get<br/>
&gt; stuck on the stopped boat stunned and unable to cast our offensive spells to<br/>
&gt; clear up the situation.  I am lvl 16 and got mauled by 6 undead sailors and<br/>
&gt; could not get enough time to figure out I couldn&#39;t cast on the boat, not<br/>
&gt; even shadow step/gate to save myself.  I then ran off the boat with 1 bar<br/>
&gt; health remaining and was killed while trying to cast my spells.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some would say this is part of the game...I disagree.  I cannot cast my<br/>
&gt; spells (what wizards do best) on a docked boat to defend myself, yet others<br/>
&gt; may attack me.  Not fair, I say.  Maybe Verant should allow us to cast<br/>
&gt; spells once the boats dock for loading and unloading?  That would be fair.<br/>
&gt; I agree with their logic on not casting while boat is in motion (you can get<br/>
&gt; folks attacking NPC&#39;s from the boat and causing innocents to get killed).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Looking for inputs as I am petitioning this.<br/>
