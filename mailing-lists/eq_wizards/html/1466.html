<div id="ygrps-yiv-241149679">According to Neil Lambert:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the level 8 does over 40! not to mention other spells. but the wizard really<br/>
&gt; starts coming into power at level 12. you get your money making spell (many<br/>
&gt; people will flame me for this) which is Bind Affinity. and you&#39;re new spell<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Grumble :)<br/>
I do agree. Bind Affinity means for me that I&#39;ll travel more safely, as I can<br/>
bind me at a relatively safe location (be sure to check it very carefully<br/>
beforehand. Many a wizard lost a full experience level when he discovered a<br/>
hostile guarding near his bind point - die... reincarnate... mob jumps you...<br/>
die... and so on, til he leaves)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So that&#39;s about it. i&#39;m sure once you realize how good the exp is in Ro<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Sand scrarabs are hunted to extinction. Tarantulas are left alone (people<br/>
hate being poisoned), and mummies must be checked carefully: if you haven&#39;t a<br/>
cleric at hand, stay away, or suffer the rabies - for 30mn real time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure about the occasional madman; the guards leave those guys alone,<br/>
so if you hunt them, you might get KOS (but then, *you* might be KOS already).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you&#39;ll stay for a while then start exploring, maybe going to Felwithe (if<br/>
&gt; you can stay invis long enough to get to the docks in freeport.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Anyone got luck into finding the hidden passageways? There is supposedly a<br/>
secret passage from the docks to the side of the wall after East Gate, but<br/>
all I&#39;ve found is a red-conning dark elf that forced me to dive to recover<br/>
my body :( .<br/>
