<div id="ygrps-yiv-946739170">I also found this in the manual:<br/>
<br/>
C. Casting - To cast the spell, click on the intended target, then click on the<br/>
spell icon in your memory<br/>
slot (or on the Hotkey Button if it you moved it there).  A time gauge will<br/>
appear in the upper lefthand<br/>
corner of your screen, indicating the casting time.  If the caster is struck or<br/>
moves during this time, the<br/>
spell can be interrupted, causing it to fail.  The Channeling skill gives the<br/>
caster a chance of recovering<br/>
from such interruptions.  Many casting classes do not get this skill until later<br/>
in their career, and the<br/>
chance of success is VERY small at the lower skill levels..<br/>
<br/>
I knew there was a reason why I E-Mailed myself the manual.<br/>
