<div id="ygrps-yiv-68296007">While a agree with most of what you are saying, root should have a more set<br/>
duration, and I would like to see an addition to the fade--&gt; Shadow Step<br/>
line, I must say that Shadow Step is one of my favorite spells.  It has<br/>
saved my life on many occasions.  Of course, it has failed on others but I<br/>
really didn&#39;t expect it to work all the time.<br/>
    I would have to say that over all Shadow Step (in cunjunction with Gate<br/>
or a zone run) has saved me about a full level of exp. (level 16 now)  Now<br/>
it doesn&#39;t always work perfectly, sometimes I have to cast it multiple times<br/>
to get far enough away to gate, and sometimes just once will do it.  I have<br/>
seen (and experienced) it go terribly wrong, like the time I watched a<br/>
fellow wizard trying to escape from two undead pawns at the chessboard,<br/>
Shadow Step into the arms of a freshly spawned pawn.  But in the end all I<br/>
know is that when the going gets too tough with Shadow Step I have a chance,<br/>
and without it not much of one.<br/>

&gt; help us by giving it a minimum distance of teleport (at least enough to<br/>
&gt; where we can start running rather than just end up behind the monster and<br/>
&gt; get hit immediately).  If we are supposedly the masters of teleport spells<br/>
&gt; then why the heck is shadowstep and fade so random?  Ok maybe these lower<br/>
&gt; circle spells should be a little random as we are low level and maybe not<br/>
&gt; very good at wizardry yet, but how about having a 4th or 5th circle spell<br/>
&gt; upgrade from shadowstep to a spell that will reliably teleport us a decent<br/>
&gt; distance in a fairly straight line in the direction we are facing?  Look<br/>
