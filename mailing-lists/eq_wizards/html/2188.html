<div id="ygrps-yiv-10941009">i&#39;m thinking about making a druid but i&#39;d like to know if anyone on this list also have a druid and have a problem with the outdoor only spells?<br/>
<br/>
like if i were to go to unrest would that be bad? could my average fighting skills make up for my lack of spells or not?</div>
