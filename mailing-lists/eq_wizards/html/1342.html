<div id="ygrps-yiv-528555133">I wholeheartedly agree, but I didn&#39;t want to get into grouping tactics, and open up another can -o- worms.  My point was DoT&#39;s take a long time compared to burn, burn,<br/>
burn.  This is definitely more important in a  multi-mob  situation where time is a critical factor, or the tanks will take a lot more of hits.  I can med 1/2 my mana<br/>
faster than they can med 1/2 of their HP&#39;s.<br/>

&gt; &quot;  Don&#39;t look at mana to damage<br/>
&gt; ratios, look at damage to time ratios.  That is the important stat because the<br/>
&gt; quicker the mob is dead, the less down time the group has,&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just a quick note..when were outta mana group does have a lot of down time then..unless they carry on and we just med..so, it is important to look at mana ratio also..<br/>
