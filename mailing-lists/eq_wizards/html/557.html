<div id="ygrps-yiv-1959202960">Can anyone help me with a language question?<br/>
<br/>
I spent one training point on the languages Dwarven, Gnoll, and Erudian (sp)<br/>
when at the Academy of Sciences in Freeport but these languages do not show<br/>
up in my skills when training at other trainers, and they also are not<br/>
available as languages in my chat window. Anyone have any idea why? Also<br/>
assuming I figure out how this can be fixed how can I improve my skill in<br/>
these easiest.<br/>
<br/>
I know they will be important in the researching of spells later so id like<br/>
to advance them now while I am not busy with other skills.</div>
