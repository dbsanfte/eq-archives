&gt; it has been fixed guys<br/>
&gt; i talked to a gm friend after i tried it myself with some cheaper items.<br/>
&gt; this trick, posted in digest 164, used to work but verant caught it and<br/>
&gt; fixed it. the monsters will accept your gift but you wont find it in their<br/>
&gt; loot once you kill them. it was a good idea, im sorry to say it doesnt work.<br/>
