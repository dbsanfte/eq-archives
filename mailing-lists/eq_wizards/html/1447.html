<div id="ygrps-yiv-665807892">Wizards are supposed to be masters of teleportation, right?  So why can&#39;t we<br/>
have little perks like two bind points, or the ability to group teleport<br/>
back to our bind location, or a spell to teleport someone else, in group, to<br/>
their bind spot?  Sure would make traveling and acquiring knowledge a lot<br/>
quicker...<br/>

	Yes the Magician (as stated by Verant) is supposed to be the second<br/>
most<br/>
	powerful DD caster in the game (second only to the wizard of<br/>
course).  But<br/>
	as noted by the fellow below, they only get DD spells every other<br/>
circle<br/>
	whereas we get them each circle.  So at level 8 both me and my<br/>
magician<br/>
	friend did almost the same damage (I think his shock spell did 31<br/>
while mine<br/>
	did 36 and his bolt spell did 40 where mine did 45 for the same mana<br/>
cost).<br/>
	BUT...  At level 12 he is still using his old DD spells for 35 and<br/>
44<br/>
	damage, where I have a new spell that does 78.  By level 15 he will<br/>
STILL be<br/>
	using his level 8 DD spells for 35 and 44 damage, while my lightning<br/>
will do<br/>
	81.  <br/>
<br/>
	At level 16 he will get a new DD shock spell (the same one which we<br/>
wizards<br/>
	get) which will bring him again close to the damage that we do<br/>
(lower by 13<br/>
	points though).  Something to keep in mind is that at level 16 we<br/>
also get a<br/>
	DD bolt spell that the magicians do not get, lightning bolt, which<br/>
starts at<br/>
	118 damage or so (not sure exact figure), so compared to his 91<br/>
damage shock<br/>
	spell we can still do almost 30 more damage.  And again keep in mind<br/>
that at<br/>
	level 23 he will still be using this level 16 spell while we will<br/>
have<br/>
	gotten a new and more powerful one at level 20.<br/>
<br/>
	So all in all magicians at times come near (but not close) to the<br/>
damage<br/>
	that we can inflict, but most of the time they are quite far behind.<br/>
And it<br/>
	of course makes sense seeing that they have a pet to protect them<br/>
and do<br/>
	damage.  We have only ourselves to rely on and I must say that I<br/>
like it.<br/>

	The Mage&#39;s 16th lvl spell is not as powerful as ours, but it is<br/>
close.  They<br/>
	start off at 91 dmg we start off with 104 dmg.  Also, they don&#39;t get<br/>
another<br/>
	DD spell until 24th, where as we get one at 20th and 24th.<br/>

	&gt;<br/>
	&gt; During my adventures over the past weekend I happened to group<br/>
with a<br/>
	&gt; very nice magician and his pet &quot;Gonaker.&quot;  We did very well<br/>
together<br/>
	&gt; and had fun.<br/>
	&gt;<br/>
	&gt; The problem was that he made claims that he can strike a target<br/>
for DD<br/>
	&gt; equal to mine.  We were both level 19 and sad thing is, I think he<br/>
is<br/>
	&gt; right!  Can anyone tell me how much mana is used and damage<br/>
delivered<br/>
	&gt; for the magician DD spell (16th level) equivelant to Fire Shock?<br/>
I<br/>
	&gt; have a feeling it will be the same which is sad really.<br/>
	&gt;<br/>
	&gt; Before I rant on my class I will need to know the truth on this<br/>
matter.<br/>
	&gt;  I love being a wizard and believe the long road to true power is<br/>
a<br/>
	&gt; long one.  But we should be doing more damage than a damn magician<br/>
and<br/>
	&gt; plus he gets a pet.  Let me know.<br/>
	&gt;<br/>
	&gt; Thanks!<br/>
