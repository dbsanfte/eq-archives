<b>Subject:</b> KS and PowerGaming - LONG MSG <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1572414083">THIS IS MY LONG RESPONSE TO THOSE WHO DISLIKE MY WAY OF PLAYING:<br/>
<br/>
     Personally, i don&#39;t think my KS reputation will go as far as you claim.<br/>
First of all, there are probably around 2000 - 3000 people playing on the<br/>
server.  At this point, I haven&#39;t traveled around too much, but i rarely see<br/>
people from Erudin that i&#39;ve grouped with or talked to in the past.  I play<br/>
around the Qeynos area, usually West karanas, so its not too far from my home<br/>
town.  With a population of approximately 2000 - 3000 players on the server and<br/>
a zone population of around 30-50 ppl, no one gives a shit about my name or if i<br/>
have KS from them before or not.  So my reputation is pointless at this time and<br/>
i don&#39;t give a shit if people hate me.  There are some people i steal from often<br/>
and they do hate me to some extent, but i don&#39;t really care about that.  Since<br/>
they can just go else where if they don&#39;t want me to KS from them, but i can&#39;t<br/>
travel solo too much since i die easily as a wizard.<br/>
<br/>
     On the power gaming / whining issue of my personality.   YES ! I LOVE to<br/>
powergame !  Currently, i play around 6 hours/day after work, and 12 - 15<br/>
hours/day on the weekend.  I love to level just for the hell of it, don&#39;t really<br/>
care too much about Role Playing, although I do RP sometimes.  But not very<br/>
often.  maybe only 20-30% of the time I am on.  Power Gaming keeps the fun in it<br/>
for me,  I don&#39;t like spending a lot of time doing NOTHING.  Its more fun for me<br/>
to see that i&#39;ve gained some lvl after spending x amount of time.<br/>
<br/>
     You also inform me that people like to train stuff to me after i KS from<br/>
them, maybe this is the issue in dungeons but i don&#39;t goto dungeons often.  I<br/>
like to stay out doors cuz dungeons are just too messy with tones of ppl around.<br/>
So there is little risk for me to get trained.  Sometimes people try to train<br/>
bandits at me(west karanas), but they just end up dying themselves with me<br/>
stealing a few off their trains. This has happened quite a number of times and<br/>
its not a problem for me to deal with.  I also had other Wizards from groups<br/>
standing behind me in an attempt to train, but i usually keep an eye on my msg<br/>
board to see when they cast, and i wait for them to cast first.  If they don&#39;t<br/>
cast and just waiting for me to make the first move, i usually cast a weak<br/>
spell(shock of frost) on the mob and let them cast harder to train themselves.<br/>
I also had this happen quite a few times.  But again, its not a big problem.  It<br/>
is also funny sometimes the people i KS from think that if they just go in while<br/>
i med, or something, then i won&#39;t have mana to KS from them.  But i usually med<br/>
anywas out of habbit even though i have full mana, i usually just keep pressing<br/>
F8 and keep an eye on who is attacking etc through the msg board.  Those people<br/>
who go in too fast are usually unprepared and not organized,  they get in<br/>
trouble themselves and ask for their group to help.  But a lot of times their<br/>
groups don&#39;t have clerics or other types of healers(a lot tanks around west<br/>
karanas)  so they end up dying and then get mad at me cuz i didn&#39;t KS the bandit<br/>
so they could live.  I&#39;ve had this happen 3 times so far.<br/>
<br/>
     After saying that, i see a lot of skill involved in KS , not just over<br/>
power but to see when to KS and when to wait.  There is much more strategy<br/>
involved with KS than just grouping and kill/med all the time.  Its more fun for<br/>
me to go around picking ppl&#39;s kills when i don&#39;t have a group so i can still lvl<br/>
and not just sit around doing dick all.  I tried the method of looking up using<br/>
/who lvl, for ppl who are my lvl, but  a lot of ppl are anonymous(as am I) and<br/>
the people who are not, i usually ask.  They either are already grouped<br/>
themselves or are logging off(maybe thats just an excuse).  I don&#39;t blame people<br/>
for not grouping with me, they do their stuff i do mine.  And i don&#39;t care if<br/>
they blame me for KS their kills.  In a non-PVP environment, i do whatever i<br/>
want, they do whatever they want.  If they don&#39;t like how i operate , they can<br/>
try to train me, but it has NEVER worked so far.  Trains usually hate them way<br/>
more than me and shadow step works quite nicely most of the time.  The only<br/>
times I die is when i am stupid for not saving enough mana for shadow step and<br/>
then gate, or that some mob spawns beside me while i am attacking.   It does not<br/>
happen often, but its always my fault when it happens.  It is, however, NEVER<br/>
due to the fact that someone else purposely tried to kill me.  Maybe this will<br/>
be different if i am in a dungeon, but again i don&#39;t goto dungeons and won&#39;t go<br/>
anytime soon.<br/>
<br/>
     To those people who are very ANTI--KS, i used to be just like you.  Anonyed<br/>
at everyone who stole from me or my group, but now i just do whatever i want, i<br/>
group a lot as well, and i KS the rest of the time.  It puts more fun into the<br/>
game for myself since i love to PowerGame and lvl fast.  Do what you will , try<br/>
to KILL those darn KSer if u wish, if they die, its their fault for being stupid<br/>
and not carefully looking at the situation at hand.</div>
