&gt;Yep, it WAS turning into a skeleton! hehe, I hit it three times for 310<br/>
&gt;damage each, and the first cast was hitting a skeleton so he WAS trying<br/>
&gt;hard. ;o)<br/>

<br/>
&gt;Im a level 40 necromancer at level 44 we do 500dmg and turns the enemy into<br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;skeleton so if the thing wasnt turning into a skel then he wasnt casting our<br/>
&gt;strong spell<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The reason you beat him is that the necromancer spells do take longer to<br/>
cast.  At 44th level the necro does havea 500 point DD spell.  With casting<br/>
and spell regeneration time  I am guessing that they can cast this spell<br/>
twice in 20 sec.  Dot attacks would be relatively useless as they may get<br/>
about 50% of the spell damage before the mob dies.  In roughly 20 seconds<br/>
at these levels you can cast off about 4 Ice Shocks for 1250 damage total.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say it was probably close in number every time.  However, wizards are<br/>
supposed to be able to deal the most damage in the shortest amount of time.<br/>
 Necromancers are MUCH more mana efficient than we are.  They can also do<br/>
more total damage than we can with their pool of mana, due to a DOTs high<br/>
mana/damage ratio.<br/>
<br/>
Note, that I am not writing this to encourage wizards to KS from necros, or<br/>
anyone else.  On the contrary I can&#39;t stand KSing myself and I am glad you<br/>
were able to keep your kills from the KSing Necro.<br/>
