&gt;&gt; The only solution is, of course, to make the item really more difficult.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Forget quests: quests aren&#39;t intrinsically more difficult than slaying<br/>

&gt;&gt; stein was obtained, hundreds followed on all servers.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; One can increase the difficulty to get an item by:<br/>
&gt;&gt;         - raising the level needed to get it (which puts all rare items at <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;&gt;                 level 50, everything before is chaff)<br/>
&gt;&gt;         - raising the difficulty of the location (which, once a group gets <br/>
&gt;down<br/>
&gt;&gt;                 the unvarying routine down pat, stops being true)<br/>
&gt;&gt;         - raising the difficulty of finding the item (which is the case with<br/>
&gt;&gt;                 mega-rare spawns. How many players do you know with a <br/>
&gt;Scarab Ring?)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There is one other solution that to me is a lot more in keeping with the<br/>
&gt;AD&D style that I think people are used to - randomization.  You are<br/>
&gt;right tho that virtually all quests are breaks down to kill X and give<br/>
&gt;its head/heart/tongue/whatever to NPC Y.  But randomizing would make<br/>
&gt;them more quest-like.  Easier to explain in an example:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Everyone knows who to talk to to start the glowing stein.  Instead of<br/>
&gt;his fixed dialog though, imagine if he says I need a rare and exotic<br/>
&gt;drink. You say &quot;I would like to help you&quot;.  He says &quot;Here is a recipe<br/>
&gt;book.  Find the ingredients listed here and return them in the book to<br/>
&gt;me.&quot;  Each item would have one more set of fields that should be<br/>
&gt;randomly generated every time you get the quest given to you.  Maybe<br/>
&gt;make it from a more appropriate list, you might not need a gargoyle eye<br/>
&gt;for a level 10 quest, but you get the idea.  Then you keep this book<br/>
&gt;with you, refer back every few play sessions, seeing what you need. <br/>
&gt;Maybe you need to figure out where to get an item even! (ack- a real<br/>
&gt;quest!)  THEN - continue this.  You return the book.  You get the item<br/>
&gt;&quot;The Glowing Stein&quot;.  Except that its is +5 to +10 int, and +5 to +10<br/>
&gt;dex - maybe you get lucky and get the ultra rare +10 +10 stein.  Voila -<br/>
&gt;you have a dynamic quest that no web page is going to spoil, and<br/>
&gt;everyone is NOT alike!  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Lastly, to address the twinking problem:  Maybe the stein instead of<br/>
&gt;giving +10 int would give (+2 times level/10).  Therefore, your level 50<br/>
&gt;wizard has a +10 int stein, but his twinked level 2 wizard has the same<br/>
&gt;stein at +0 int!  Easily explained that with wisdom of levels you gain<br/>
&gt;the ability to use a sword better (damage =level, or something similar),<br/>
&gt;gain more power from the gem, or whatever.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just my few coppers worth.  Unfortuntaly, it is probably too late for<br/>
&gt;this version, but that would all make nice additions to the expansion!<br/>
