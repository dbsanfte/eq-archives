<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;meet many ppl willing to sell there hard earned items for gold.<br/>
&gt;Verrant are fools who think they shuld keep the number of items down, &gt;and <br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt;making them lore item and no drop. if this keeps up ill go play AC <br/>
&gt; &gt;instead.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have to agree with you there Askur.  I can understand why Verrant made <br/>
things hard to get and rare... but the current method tends to encourage a <br/>
lot of the parts of the game that is NOT fun.  (ie camping, hording for <br/>
guildmembers, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t offer a solution...would it be a better game if Verrant made it so <br/>
every NPC *guaranteed* that you&#39;ll get the item you wanted?  Or if they made <br/>
things spawn faster so everyone has a chance to kill it? I&#39;m divided....<br/>
