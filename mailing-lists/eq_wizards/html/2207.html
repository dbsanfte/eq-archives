<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513906978"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Yeah, I finally got some info on the Orb.  It&#39;s supposingly found in Guk<br/>
&gt; somewhere.  My friend told me the name although I&#39;ve forgotten<br/>
&gt; already...I&#39;ll let you guys know when I ask again.  Says it&#39;s a real rare<br/>
&gt; spawn.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You get the shiny orb of the Froglok Scyer.  Froglok Scyer can charm so be<br/>
careful.<br/>
It is in the room with the two pillars of water near the heart spiders.  The<br/>
orb is a rare drop of a rare spawn so if you want to get one be prepared<br/>
to go and camp there for a few days.<br/>
