<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I too am of the adventurous spirit, and just gated for my first trip<br/>
into CT into here.  And yes, its rather dangerous, the inviso key is<br/>
hotkeyed for me when I gate in there now.  Basically, you gate into the<br/>
east side of what is affectionatly called &quot;the maze&quot;.  The way out is<br/>
simple though. You SHOULD be facing west when you gate in (quick sense<br/>
direction can confirm).  Just head west. You will see a LOT (a real lot)<br/>
of side passages.  At times, you might not know which way to turn - just<br/>
keep heading as westerly as you can - if in your last turn, you picked<br/>
slightly more north, this one pick slightly more south.  A few runs<br/>
thru, and you will know where you are quickly.  Its only about 45<br/>
seconds to the door out to the courtyard.  If you have picked up a train<br/>
of Lizardmen, head in the courtyard, take the double doors to your left,<br/>
and run for the zone - another 40 feet ahead around the corner!  Now you<br/>
are safe (?) in the Feerrott.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Nek Gate<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This one is rather safe as well- I have used it many times as well, as a<br/>
High elf.  It gates you in at 440 by negative 775.  That is the middle<br/>
north south, but the far EAST side of the zone.  In otherwords, kinda<br/>
close to the city entrance.  You should see a few skeletons around you,<br/>
it is a newbie hunting zone tho, so they will not be a problem.  Head<br/>
southwest to get out to Commonlands, or northwest for Lavastorm.  Again,<br/>
inviso is your friend if dark elves dont like you, there are plenty of<br/>
guards patrolling here.  Sure, that first one is green, but it still<br/>
hits for about 40 per whack, and has plenty of friends coming...<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps<br/>
