<div id="ygrps-yiv-877023604">I act as escort even if they tell me not to. I can&#39;t tell you how many<br/>
times I&#39;ve been able to keep one of them alive because I didn&#39;t gate<br/>
out. They might have made it. But when you are a walker and you are 4<br/>
or 5 zones away, why risk it? If the tanks lag behind in exp(cause<br/>
they died), seems to happen anyway, they can&#39;t continue to do their<br/>
job with mobs of your level.<br/>
<br/>
The EC and WC grifs and giants are a perfect example. At our current<br/>
level, the fighter types can survive a few hits but that&#39;s it. If I am<br/>
watching, I can throw a piss em off but doesn&#39;t hurt em spell(seems<br/>
like AE spells never cease to upset a mob) and pull them off the tank<br/>
they&#39;re about to cream. I do this from far enough away that I can zone<br/>
or gate and everybody gets a running start where it was certain death<br/>
before.<br/>

&gt;Since my groups tend to have a high ratio of tanks to spellcasters, I<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt;live (or die) together.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;#2 has lead me to doing a LOT more solo fighting, cause I hate the idea<br/>
