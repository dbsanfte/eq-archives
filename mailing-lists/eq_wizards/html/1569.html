Ecommons to North Ro. So<br/>
<br/>

Bring, yourself and anyone else who knows any languages. Evil races welcome.<br/>
We&#39;re here for knowledge. If you don&#39;t want to know T&#39;ier Dal, don&#39;t listen.<br/>

<br/>
We&#39;ll be forming up in groups depending on how many people are there, I&#39;ve<br/>
found that setting up a hotkey to<br/>
<br/>
/g I&#39;m speaking another language, understand?<br/>
<br/>
works the best. You can click the mouse faster than hitting the keyboard,<br/>
and it&#39;s not as tiring.<br/>
Anyone think I should email the new sites to post up about the meeting?<br/>
