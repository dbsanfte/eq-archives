If you are going to a questionable zone...Levitate before you gate..then you<br/>
have ample time to cast the invis spell..works like a charm for Cazic every<br/>
time!<br/>

&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; been playing around with the level 24 teleports and thought I&#39;d post and<br/>
&gt; request some info, since I haven&#39;t seen it out myself on any of the web<br/>
&gt; pages.  As most of you know, the lvl 20 teleports are all designed to be<br/>
&gt; fairly safe and highly visible (those huge sets of four arched pillars<br/>
&gt; located in Faydark, North Karanas, and Tox Forest).  Mobs usually won&#39;t go<br/>
&gt; into the teleport area unless pulled.  An exception to this would be the N<br/>
&gt; Karanas teleport, where a guard occasionally marches through (which could<br/>
&gt; cause problems depending on your Qeynos Gard faction).  The lvl 24 teles<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; different.  So you know what to look for if you stumble across one . . .<br/>
&gt; They are stubby, cropped off pyramids, a little taller than a tall player,<br/>
&gt; with four knee high arched pillars at the corners.  They give off hums<br/>
when<br/>
&gt; you are near/on them.  Their rough locations are as follows:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1.  The Commonlands teleport:  Drops you in West Commonlands, North West<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; Befallen a bit.  Fairly useful teleport if you want to visit that dungeon,<br/>
&gt; etc. (which will be low for your level when you get the teleport; but,<br/>
hey,<br/>
&gt; some of us get our gossamer robes late).  Doesn&#39;t appear to be too<br/>
&gt; dangerous.  There are some rough wandering mobs in W Commons though, so<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; may want to invis after you get there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2.  The Ro Teleport:  Ah, having a teleport near Freeport (in W Commons)<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t enough you say?  Well, you have a choice apparently.  In North Ro<br/>
&gt; there is another teleport pillar a fair distance south from Freeport.<br/>
This<br/>
&gt; teleport isn&#39;t exactly safe as low level players seem to love to pull<br/>
&gt; mummies and such to the teleport to fight there.  Why?  I dunno.<br/>
Shouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; be a problem unless you teleport there on low mana.  One wonders why they<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t put this one in South Ro to space the teleports better.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3.  The West teleport.  Carrying on the pattern of high redundancy, Verant<br/>
&gt; put another one of these wonderful teleports in W Karanas (which, of<br/>
course,<br/>
&gt; borders N Karanas which has a &quot;safe&quot; teleport).  Now since W Karanas is<br/>
&gt; probably the longest East to West land zone in the game, it would make<br/>
sense<br/>
&gt; to put a tele here, right?  Say on the West border, near Qeynos hills,<br/>
&gt; right?  We&#39;ve all gotten tired of the long runs from N Karanas to, say,<br/>
&gt; Qeynos by now.  Naturally, therefore, Verant put the teleport on the<br/>
*East*<br/>
&gt; and not the *West* side of the zone where it might have actually been<br/>
&gt; useful.  Depending on your zone times, the N Karans and W Karanas<br/>
teleports<br/>
&gt; are only about a minute apart.  You may want to save a bit of money here<br/>
&gt; when buying your lvl 24 spells if you need the cash.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4. Cazic Thule.  Last night I had a chance to use this spell, for reasons<br/>
&gt; too contorted to go into here.  I&#39;d been warned it was dangerous, but what<br/>
&gt; the heck?  We only live about a thousand times.  The gate drops you inside<br/>
&gt; Cazic Thule, into a set of caverns.  When you teleport in, I highly<br/>
suggest<br/>
&gt; you go invis immediately, and don&#39;t move until you are sure it will hold.<br/>
&gt; At level 26, there are a few lizardmen around that con blue.  I<br/>
immediately<br/>
&gt; set off in search of my party (loc written down ahead of time) and<br/>
proceeded<br/>
&gt; to get thoroughly lost.  My invis failed 4 times before I finally gave up<br/>
&gt; and gated out.  Is there anyone out there who knows how to navigate from<br/>
&gt; this gate to the Feerrott zone, or some other location of general<br/>
relevance?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, haven&#39;t tried the Nek gate yet, but will give it a go tonight.  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; heard that it is generally safe for good races, but we shall see.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do want to put in a gripe though.  Why not move the West teleport over<br/>
&gt; closer to Qeynos, or put one in near Halas or Everfrost?  And how about<br/>
&gt; moving the Ro gate to South Ro?  It is almost insulting to buy redundant<br/>
&gt; teleport spells.<br/>
