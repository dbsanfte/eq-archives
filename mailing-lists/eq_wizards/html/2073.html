<div id="ygrps-yiv-2130152374">I dont know why you guys play a Wizard, but I know why I do, thats the<br/>
fascinationg with spells, the sheer ability to shoot  with so much dmg<br/>
per shot, i like that. In UO, i had alot of magery, i liked there spells<br/>
better than the Wizard in here cuz they could do all sorts of fun stuff,<br/>
like conjure 2 animals and make them fight(great fun with eles :P) and<br/>
all kinds of stuff. But I like a wizard, and I for one think they are<br/>
just fine. If you got a problem with a wizard, I think you should play<br/>
another class, not whine about it.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. the /feedback helps ALOT! I also want to say that everyone here<br/>
should spend some special time to talk to guides if you see em around.<br/>
They give up there EQ playing time to help others, and thats GREAT! I<br/>
personally talk to each of em for about 5 min or more every time I see<br/>
em, I even get along pretty well and kinda know this guide on The Rathe<br/>
server :)<br/>
