<b>Subject:</b> About the Scarecrows. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809462525">I have heard you people talking about scarecrows.<br/>
What is wierd is that I met a NPC on the 3rd<br/>
floor of the Erudin Library, who for 20 gold<br/>
pieces will sell you a piece of parchment that<br/>
offers some script about animating a scarecrow.<br/>
This is supposed to be from an original copy<br/>
of some of Morbius&#39;s collection (I think thats<br/>
him, the ultimate necromancer we read about in<br/>
Norrath&#39;s history books).  I am not sure where<br/>
this parchment was trying to lead me, since I am<br/>
not sure where this parchment was trying to lead<br/>
me, since I am still a lower leveled wizard, and<br/>
do not have much knowledge of Norrath yet.  Has<br/>
anyone else gotten this piece of parchment?  Does<br/>
anyone know about this quest?<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just thought anout it when someone was talking<br/>
about killing scarecrows at some garden place.<br/>
<br/>
Appreciate any info.<br/>
