<b>Subject:</b> Purpose of wizard class (short, maybe small spoiler) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-484237755">I know that the purpose of the wizard class is to do heavy damage quickly.<br/>
A friend of mine was telling me that mages do almost the same damage plus<br/>
they have a pet to fight for them.  He does close dmg to me now at lvl 20.<br/>
He says at lvl 49 mages do lava bolt which does 950 whereas ice comet does<br/>
1100.  That is almost the same damage as the wizard.  So it seems to me<br/>
that there isn&#39;t much of a use to be a wizard if you can be a mage and do<br/>
almost the same amount of direct damage plus you have a pet.  So anyone<br/>
tell me something good about the wiz class to make it worth playing them to<br/>
high levels?</div>
