<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-810998536">I&#39;m looking for a web page which lists the complete wizard spells including<br/>
spell effects, mana cost and if an offensive spell, the damage it does.  I<br/>
am a level 21 Erudite wiz(Euros) playing on Rallos Zek.  From what I gather,<br/>
the level 24 wizard DD spell Frost Shock does around 200 dmg for 110 mana.<br/>
If this is the case, it sounds to me like this is the level where we<br/>
wizard&#39;s start to mature.  That damage/mana ratio is very, very good.<br/>
Nearly as good as DOT&#39;s.  Can any higher level Wizzies out there confirm<br/>
this?  Also the 20th level spell Force Shock does great damage yet is<br/>
resisted too often by &quot;dangerous&quot; blues and higher mobs to be my exclusive<br/>
high damage spell.  Does this trend of high resistance continue as we get to<br/>
higher levels?  Or is Force Shock some kind of special case?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Euros</div>
