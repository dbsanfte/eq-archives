<div id="ygrps-yiv-598385158"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I wish UO had not poisoned my mind so much against<br/>
&gt;PvP, but it was just<br/>
&gt;heinous.  Most UO PKers didn&#39;t even kill you in<br/>
&gt;character, it was like<br/>
&gt;&quot;HE<br/>
&gt;*&*$^&$  YOU ARE DEAD F*&%ER YOU SUCK blah blah blah&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with you like the other guy said there may be<br/>
a large portion who are good but I can see all kinds<br/>
of problems if +PVP spells can effect -PVP. As far as<br/>
the bind goes you have to be in the Binders party to<br/>
be bound to that city so we have that in our favor.<br/>
Maybe they could implement something to where +PVP<br/>
spells can effect -PVP if they are in the same party?<br/>
But random casting I think is a bad idea. I quit UO<br/>
because of the Pkers I don&#39;t want the same thing to<br/>
happen to EQ. EQ is not Quake if you want random<br/>
killing for no other reason than to rack up a body<br/>
count and to talk trash while you do it get out of EQ.<br/>
