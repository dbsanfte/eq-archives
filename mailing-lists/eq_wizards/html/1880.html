&gt; This works very well.  I hunt occasionally with an enchanter friend.  She<br/>
&gt; would cast the inital debuff to lower magic resistance, the critter<br/>
&gt; charges, the pet blocks, I root and we both blast.  If we get into trouble,<br/>
&gt; the pet blocks, I root and we both Gate.  Great system.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>From what I understand, there is a hard cap on when our spells become completely<br/>
ineffective, and it was put in to prevent exploits.  I believe the level of this<br/>
cap is 6 levels above the caster.  I think its great to stick together on a<br/>
petition, and I feel that this is one issue that needs to be addressed.  Here are<br/>
my two prposed solutions.<br/>
<br/>
1) Raise the cap to 9+ levels of the caster<br/>
2) make the cap 6+ levels of the highest player in the group.<br/>
