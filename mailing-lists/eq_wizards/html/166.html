<div id="ygrps-yiv-506470667">Try the cross road of Butcherblok mountains..  There&#39;s couple of<br/>
monsters you can try to kill and good exp for lv5+ (snake, skunks,<br/>
globin..ect)..  If you got team up, run to the guards beside the cross<br/>
road.  But the easiest way is try to group with someone else, wizards<br/>
are fragile in the early lvs.. Hope this helps.<br/>
