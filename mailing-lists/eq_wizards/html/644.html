<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468866948">Please give your thoughts on this:<br/>
<br/>
Traveling from Queynos to Euridan the boat stops at the Cat island.<br/>
Frequently adventures bring trains of undead to the boat and we wizards get<br/>
stuck on the stopped boat stunned and unable to cast our offensive spells to<br/>
clear up the situation.  I am lvl 16 and got mauled by 6 undead sailors and<br/>
could not get enough time to figure out I couldn&#39;t cast on the boat, not<br/>
even shadow step/gate to save myself.  I then ran off the boat with 1 bar<br/>
health remaining and was killed while trying to cast my spells.  <br/>
<br/>
Some would say this is part of the game...I disagree.  I cannot cast my<br/>
spells (what wizards do best) on a docked boat to defend myself, yet others<br/>
may attack me.  Not fair, I say.  Maybe Verant should allow us to cast<br/>
spells once the boats dock for loading and unloading?  That would be fair.<br/>
I agree with their logic on not casting while boat is in motion (you can get<br/>
folks attacking NPC&#39;s from the boat and causing innocents to get killed).<br/>
<br/>
Looking for inputs as I am petitioning this.<br/>
