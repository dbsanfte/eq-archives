<div id="ygrps-yiv-79248796">Verant had already thought of this when they made the decision to not have<br/>
&quot;hard&quot; level limits on items.  Someone from Verant said that they do have<br/>
&quot;soft&quot; level limits on items where a high level item won&#39;t benefit a player<br/>
until they reach the &quot;soft&quot; level limit that was set for this item.  That<br/>
full suit of gossamer, woven, flowing black robes, etc might be better than<br/>
cloth sure, but not by a whole lot at low levels.  Like another person<br/>
posted, this twinker will get beaten on just as severely as a newbie in<br/>
cloth armor.  I do not twink because it cheapens my experience of the game.<br/>
Each character I make has to earn everything for themself.  If it doesnt<br/>
cheapen the experience for other players (read powerplayers, losers, morons)<br/>
then thats their own problem.  Norrath is a big world, and I know plenty of<br/>
zones with really good hunting that only have a couple players in them at<br/>
any one time.<br/>
