<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000832835">The best Druid DD spell does the same dmg as our lvl 44 DD spell.  That&#39;s<br/>
the closest anyone comes to us.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;But anyways, at the low lvls (yes, lvl 12 is a low lvl, hell 16 is even low<br/>
&gt;lvl IMO), your DD is very comparable to that of which other class&#39;s can do.<br/>
&gt;But in the end we do dish out much more damage. Can you say &quot;1100dmg in 1<br/>
&gt;shot&quot; .. can anyone else lay claim to that? not even druids can, their max<br/>
&gt;damage is 650 I think. </span></blockquote></div>
