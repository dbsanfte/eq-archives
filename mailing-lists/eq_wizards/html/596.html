<div id="ygrps-yiv-818152248">I am going to assume you can get to Lesser Faydark, after zoning into Lesser<br/>
follow the mountain to your left(this is the zone border) until you come to<br/>
another zone entrance, this takes you into Steamfont Mountains. Once there<br/>
follow the path until it branches off left and right(a gnomish watchman will<br/>
be at the crossroads), take the left hand branch. Continue to follow this<br/>
path until you come to a large set of windmills, you will see a few watchman<br/>
and another gnome near here. At this point you should see a large mountain<br/>
on your right, follow this mountain(keeping it on your right) until you see<br/>
what appears to be a mine entrance(there should be rogue clockworks, ebon<br/>
drakes and harpies as critters in this area). The mine entrance is where you<br/>
will find mino&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
Yours,<br/>
