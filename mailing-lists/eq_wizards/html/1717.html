<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591643841">it does bother me and yes i am jealous and i would not be doing anything<br/>
right now unless i knew that the gm&#39;s didn&#39;t allow it (i&#39;m only reporting it<br/>
because it&#39;s against the rules.)<br/>
<br/>
If it wasn&#39;t against the rules there wouldn&#39;t be a suspension, so yes...<br/>
she&#39;s breaking the rules<br/>

&gt;What exactly is so bad about it? How ever easy or hard it is on her, has<br/>
&gt;no effect on you, so why don&#39;t you just mind your own business and stop<br/>
&gt;being so uptight. She&#39;s done nothing that brakes the rules or bothers<br/>
&gt;other players in any way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The only bother, is pure green jealousy, isn&#39;t it? You&#39;re just upset<br/>
&gt;that she gets an advantage you didn&#39;t, right? Well, life is tough like<br/>
&gt;that. Whether she gets an advantage or not, is none of your business<br/>
&gt;because it doesn&#39;t really affect you. And remember, she had to work her<br/>
&gt;way to level 22 before that as well, so she is only giving her other<br/>
&gt;Char something she rightfully earned.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just concentrate on your own character and stop being a jerk about it.<br/>
