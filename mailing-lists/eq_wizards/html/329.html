<div id="ygrps-yiv-362920132">I&#39;m not sure of the address off the top of my head, but go to the site that runs<br/>
the message list, change your &quot;subscription&quot; to the [eq_wizards] list to Digest<br/>
version..  I&#39;m not sure, but I think the digest version is one huge email per<br/>
day, instead of 10 or 15 an hour.. :)<br/>

&gt; Ok, I have had quite enough of this. An EQ-Wizards newsletter is one thing.<br/>
&gt; An EQ-Wizards mega-messageboard that is delivered straight to your e-mail is<br/>
&gt; another. I NEED to be able to go through my e-mail without having to sift<br/>
&gt; through 100+ EQ-Wizards e-mails a day. PLEASE! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, REMOVE<br/>
&gt; ME! REMOVE! REMOVE! REMOVE! IIIIiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeee!!!! </span></blockquote></div>
