<div id="ygrps-yiv-863342415">Ok, I agree with you.. but what you are asking for is a programming miracle.<br/>
Unfortunately it&#39;s incredibly hard (possibly impossible ?) to be able to<br/>
program a game  to distinguish between the two circumstances.  So Verant<br/>
chose to allow them to pass through walls and avoid having exploitable<br/>
situations.  Realistically they had to chose one way or the other, and I<br/>
can&#39;t say I disagree with their choice.<br/>

&gt;You are right. I don&#39;t believe that you should be able to nuke thing that<br/>
&gt;are in a building if you are not in the building yourself or nuke things<br/>
&gt;outside a building if you are in it. What I am saying is that monsters<br/>
&gt;should not beable to walk through walls to get at you or to get away. I<br/>
&gt;think that they should have the same limitations as us. If we get them in<br/>
&gt;stuck (say two big rocks) between objects and can take them on one at a<br/>
