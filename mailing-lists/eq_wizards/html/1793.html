<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185048874">In an effort for cooperation of the spell casters on the Solusek Ro server I<br/>
have created a message board at the following URL:<br/>

<br/>
Please keep the posts to only those that reside on the Solusek Ro server.<br/>
We&#39;re about helping each other in the game (No not twinking and I&#39;m not even<br/>
gonna open up that can of worms again), acquiring and improving languages,<br/>
questing together, and helping each other in general. Any messages<br/>
derogatory or &#39;whiny&#39; in general will be immediately removed. This isn&#39;t the<br/>
place to post about what&#39;s wrong with the class, or what should be changed.<br/>
Rather how we can help each other with what we&#39;ve got to work with.  : )<br/>
