&gt; According to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:dayne@...">dayne@...</a>:<br/>
&gt; &gt; Dayne IS NOT capable of soloing most blues, nor some greens. It IS<br/>
&gt; &gt; that simple. Root holds about 50% of the time. BLUES resist about 25%<br/>
&gt; &gt; of my spells.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I beg to differ. I&#39;m not 12, I&#39;m 11th, and I can solo and take:<br/>
&gt;         Orc Centurions, Lions, Lioness (East Commonlands)<br/>
&gt;         Sand Scarabs (North Ro)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At level 12 I soloed Orc Legionnaires. From 12 to 15 I soloed everything<br/>
in N Ro, including Dervishes, Sand Scarabs, Madmen, Mummies, Zombies.<br/>
Some of that time was spent in groups, but that was more for the fun of<br/>
it and not for leveling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have a single piece of woven, and no other fancy equipment.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have 4 pieces of Woven, the skull of Jhen&#39;Tra, 2 +5 mana rings, one<br/>
+10 mana bracelet, a +3 INT earring (I sold it for 35pp and a +2 AGI<br/>
earring to a high level guy. It cost me 10pp :) ). I have an RTS but<br/>
I&#39;ve stopped using it since I got the skull.<br/>
<br/>
I now have ~65pp as well. I have never twinked (only GAVE some money to<br/>
one guy once). All this I made on my own, soloing most of the way. I<br/>
would say that I soloed about 65~75% of my life, if not more. All the<br/>
equipment I got, I got by traveling around, haggling, trading and<br/>
buying. No high level characters helped me.<br/>
<br/>
So, YES, it can be done. I consider myself to be a quite successful<br/>
wizard, though I&#39;ve invested nothing (!!!) in my INT at character<br/>
creation. I was a clueless newbie and I distributed the points around,<br/>
putting a big part in WIS. My INT is still 102.<br/>
<br/>
I think most wizards underestimate wisdom, but I think it is the stat<br/>
that gets checked for regaining concentration. At level 15 I regain<br/>
concentration almost every battle when the mob gets melee with me. I<br/>
actually Gated when 2 gnolls were hitting on me.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, I think, is experience. Just knowing what to take and what<br/>
not to take. Some mobs are very resistant to magic. Some are helpless.<br/>
Some are very tough in melee (though they con blue) and some are not.<br/>
It&#39;s just traveling around, seeing the sights and knowing what you&#39;re<br/>
doing.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I found is that groups full of wizards kick unbelievable ass.<br/>
It&#39;s amazing what 3 wizards in a group can do. Not even talking about 6.<br/>
Try it. Have a designated rooter, a back up rooter, and all the rest<br/>
blast. It&#39;s very fun, very quick and safe.<br/>
<br/>
Also, always get SOW when you can. If you see a shaman in zone, get him<br/>
to cast SOW on you. It&#39;s amazing how useful this spell is. For instance,<br/>
if the mob resists the root, you just run away, stop and root again.<br/>
You&#39;re OOM? Just run to zone/guards/group.<br/>
<br/>
I do agree with the improvements we are asking in the petition, but we<br/>
are still very good for soloing. Maybe the best. We just have to know<br/>
what we&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and about familiars - it doesn&#39;t have to be Conjuration. How about<br/>
casting a spell on some low level mob and MAKING him your familiar?<br/>
That&#39;s pretty cool, and allows diversity. Someone in Butcherblock will<br/>
get a skunk. Someone in Freeport will get a rat. we could get<br/>
spiderlings or stuff like that. They would be used as mana batteries.<br/>
The spell to make them familiars could take all our mana, no matter how<br/>
much we have, and store about half or a third of that in the familiar. <br/>
