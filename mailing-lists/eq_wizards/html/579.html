<div id="ygrps-yiv-1519134671">I think for every level of spells, the bolts spell do 10 more damage then<br/>
the shock spells.<br/>
I think it is handy to have both (havnt bought any bolts yes) because they<br/>
tend to differ<br/>
in base.<br/>
<br/>
ie) Shock of Ice and Fire Bolt.<br/>
<br/>
You may wonder how this is usefull. Welll lets say you are fighting an ice<br/>
boned skeleton,<br/>
guess what? Shock of Ice wont work on it, but fire-based spells will. Or if<br/>
you are fighting<br/>
fire drakes, fire bolt wont put a dint into it, but shock of ice would.<br/>
<br/>
I learned that the hard way in P4 when I attempted to unload all of my shock<br/>
of ice mana<br/>
onto an ice boned jsut to have to run to the zone line.<br/>
