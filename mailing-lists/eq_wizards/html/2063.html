<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729174312">Yes we pay a price with lack of diversity. And maybe in that respect, we<br/>
shouldn&#39;t change :) But we pay the price with power? Because my spells<br/>
at level 20 are resisted, a magician is still damn close. A necromancer<br/>
has true power for they can fell a Sand Giant where a group of us would<br/>
get our bath robes ripped off our asses! Do we get more power at higher<br/>
levels? So far the jury is out, but it doesn&#39;t look good from what we<br/>
hear.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I don&#39;t see that with all the fiddling that Verant is doing with<br/>
the casting classes how they can truly claim that wizards are balanced.<br/>
I mean, why aren&#39;t the other classes balanced after a years worth of<br/>
beta? And if they aren&#39;t balanced yet ( which they don&#39;t seem to be what<br/>
with all the changes, high level magicians didn&#39;t even have pets!!! )<br/>
then how can we be balanced against them? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing that at 36th level a wizard will do about 300 pts of<br/>
damage. Hardly enough to kill a 20th level mob in one shot. But pit that<br/>
36th level wizard against a 43rd level mob and he&#39;s a whimpering mess :P<br/>
I don&#39;t see how increasing the range of creatures we can effect HIGHER<br/>
than us hurts things. So we can all gang up and kill something, half of<br/>
us&#39;d die. <br/>
<br/>
I was in a group fighting in unrest, our bait pulls out a Dry Bones<br/>
Skeleton. Unfortunately when he got near we found out he also had a<br/>
barbed bone skel in town. Resisted all my spells so I ran up to melee.<br/>
Of course I couldn&#39;t do any damage, but wait, our druid who&#39;s spells<br/>
were also resisted cast shield of thistles ( or something ) on me. The<br/>
only way I could damage the thing was by being a Dark Elf pincussion :P<br/>
The warriors were all lesser or equal level than me. The barbed was<br/>
obviously +6 levels above me. Yet we killed it! Why? Because the<br/>
warriors could do damage!<br/>
<br/>
If enough of us voice our concerns, then maybe Verant will see. Yeah<br/>
they tell us we&#39;re balanced, but so much has changed since then. If we<br/>
don&#39;t say anything they will never take a look again. Hehe, maybe we<br/>
should call the game EverBalance :P Either way, I say we give it a shot!<br/>

&gt; I see where your coming from on making a wizard &quot;different&quot;.  Wizards are 99%<br/>
&gt; direct damage.  It does get boring after awhile, med. nuke nuke, med. repeat<br/>
&gt; as necessary.<br/>
&gt; While a necromancer has a pet, mage gets a pet, enchanter gets a ton of<br/>
&gt; spells and each class can use some direct damage.  Shamans and druids... well<br/>
&gt; they are just great and have a ton of diversity.  However we are wizards and<br/>
&gt; the exact opposite of warriors.  Warriors do nothing but bash in close combat<br/>
&gt; and they are damn good at it.  Wizards do nothing but destroy with magic and<br/>
&gt; they are damn good at that.  We are the only class that can teleport to other<br/>
&gt; planes &quot;although secret entrances do exist for the people that don&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt; find a wizard&quot;.  Our travel spells are very nice as are our area affect<br/>
&gt; spells at high levels with a party.  You pay a price with power and that<br/>
&gt; price is a lack of diversity I think.  Truely no one can come close to the<br/>
&gt; damage a wizard can do in less then 5 seconds.  Truely a sight to see when a<br/>
&gt; 20th leve MOB is beating on your level 8 party and you can&#39;t hit it, then a<br/>
&gt; 36th level wizard walks by we yelled for help, he casts one spell and the MOB<br/>
&gt; dies like that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Diversity Suggestions..<br/>
&gt; Wizard Only Special Robes and more graphics for them.  I must say the ones<br/>
&gt; they have now are great, but more couldn&#39;t help.  Again more quests and fix<br/>
&gt; the broken ones, this is everquest after all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I for one belive in the power of the wizard and I do know that brad and<br/>
&gt; verant have absolutely no intent of changing them.  I quote &quot;Wizards are by<br/>
&gt; far the most balanced casting class and to change anything to them now would<br/>
&gt; destroy 1 years worth of game balancing&quot;.<br/>
