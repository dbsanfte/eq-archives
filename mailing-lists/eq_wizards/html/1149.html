<div id="ygrps-yiv-544939938">Screw &#39;em.  I say if you&#39;re the first one to root or strike a creature, <br/>
you&#39;re entitled to it.  It would be foolish for a fighter to jump in anyway <br/>
since a Wiz can almost always outdo a fighter in dmg points anyway.<br/>
If you&#39;re in a cool group, most people like to use this to the group <br/>
advantage so that you can secure kills from other possible KS&#39;ers.<br/>

&gt;Well.. I find kill stealing is never a problem either on my server, or on <br/>
&gt;my<br/>
&gt;continent.  Not sure which, but I&#39;ve heard lots of complaints of KS&#39;ing, <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;I almost never see someone do it.  But that would seriously annoy me, if I<br/>
&gt;attacked something and some fighter just jumped in, and then he gave me<br/>
&gt;shit.  I think I&#39;d freak... oh well...<br/>
