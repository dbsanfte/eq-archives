<br/>
My name is Oonagh i play on the E&#39;ci server<br/>
<br/>
I am a devouted Wizard.. Don&#39;t get me wrong , but as a reply to Greg<br/>
(Kronan)<br/>
I would say:<br/>
<br/>
All caster class can do as much damage as a wizard until lev 15 at least (I<br/>
am only 14 )<br/>
<br/>
Magicians does in the mid 70 dam with their spell DirectDam spell<br/>
Clerics do the same<br/>
Necros i don&#39;t know about, but think they do about mid 70 as well<br/>
Wizards does 80dam per DD spell<br/>
At 16 you do about 100 dam as your DD spell<br/>
<br/>
So you would not see your class shine until higher lev..<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps 20.. I don&#39;t know but i heard the DD Wizard spell did 200dam there..<br/>
offcourse the Cleric undead spell at that lev does  close to 200 dam as<br/>
well.. But thats just against undeads.<br/>
<br/>
I am 14th lev now and all the other casters i meet do just as much damage as<br/>
me and have much more nicer utility spell like pets. buffs/debuffs etc..<br/>
I am in need of another player to really get xp (or actually any xp at all<br/>
without the danger of dying or zoning to save my butt on every mob i<br/>
attack).. wheras the magics and necros etc can solo perfectly alone..<br/>
<br/>
I am sure the reward will be GREAT, BUT it will come at a later level than<br/>
14, believe me.<br/>
maybe 20 maybe higher.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there fellow Wizard, we WILL rule the world *snicker*<br/>
