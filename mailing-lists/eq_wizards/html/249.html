<div id="ygrps-yiv-445876960">Hi, I am a level 6 human wizard.  I noticed that my only choice for<br/>
language currently is the Common one.  Will I ever be able to learn<br/>
other languages?  In not, would that affect my ability to perform<br/>
research down the line since that apparantly requires familiarity with<br/>
certain languages?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance<br/>
