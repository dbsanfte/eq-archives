<div id="ygrps-yiv-457273453">ROOT is the most important spell you can use in a dungeon or in solo... it<br/>
is the only thing that makes you a true force to be faced!  Here is the<br/>
accepted method for group / solo for me:<br/>
<br/>
Group:<br/>
<br/>
let some one pull it... let the tank beat on it for about a count of 15<br/>
(slow 15... if you get excited count to 30) and unleash with 2 of your best<br/>
DD spells... If one is resisted then you can try a third... but beware...<br/>
Count another 10 and let loose with another spell...<br/>
When the creature gets to about 25-40 percent of its life, ROOT it... then<br/>
nuke as hard as you can.<br/>
<br/>
Solo:<br/>
<br/>
BOLT SPELL BOLT SPELL BOLT SPELL!<br/>
okay here is the sequence...:<br/>
cast your most powerful bolt spell at long range.  As the bolt flies out you<br/>
are already in spell reset stage... when the bolt hits you are ready to<br/>
ROOT... heck half the time I have to keep hitting the ROOT hot key just till<br/>
the monster gets in range!  You will start casting as soon as it gets in<br/>
range and get the spell off well before it gets to you.  Now to the<br/>
important part... BACK OFF!  backup  till the monster looks about the same<br/>
size on the screen as it did when you first cast the first bolt... then<br/>
recast the bolt..  if the monster breaks after a hit just start recasting<br/>
the root (it is still out of range like the first time right?) fast till it<br/>
goes off... back up and repeat...  If the creature ever gets into melee<br/>
range just take a deep breath wait till you see his attack attempt and hit<br/>
that ROOT!  You should get it off before he can attack you.  (this does not<br/>
mean that he wont get another attack on you)  Then back up till just in bolt<br/>
range and repeat!<br/>
<br/>
On the off chance your group is pulling too red a creature for you... mem<br/>
your fire shield and hold off attacking that thing till it has less than 25%<br/>
hps... you have a little better chance at hitting it... plus cast a spell<br/>
that is one circle back from what your capable of at the time any way ( most<br/>
likely a deep red will resist at least partially if not all the time even at<br/>
25% hps so you might as well do less (max damage) so it doesn&#39;t pull on<br/>
you...  Oh yea ... bind in the zone near the zone point... and make sure<br/>
gate is a mem&#39;d spell... if your going to be useless make sure you atleast<br/>
wont die with the rest of the silly&#39;s.<br/>

&gt; I have few spells, maybe 4/level, and cant wait till we can rearrange our<br/>
spellbooks. So I can move the never-used spells (Root, Fade, lvl 1 damage<br/>
spells...) to the back out of the way.  :)<br/>

&gt; I think that only getting spells every 4 lvls is stupid.   I think that<br/>
&gt; we (or everybody) should get spells every lvl or every other lvl.<br/>
&gt; Especially for wizards.  My friend who is a lvl 5 enchanter almost has<br/>
&gt; more spells then I do.  They gave us so many useless spells.  Like the<br/>
&gt; low lvl Sphere of light.  I havent had the need for any other damage<br/>
&gt; spell besides shocks or bolts.  Then again I am also at a low lvl.<br/>
