<div id="ygrps-yiv-1701858156">I would like to set up a language training session in the Desert of Ro (inside the tunnel near the zone) on Fennin Ro. I am not very good at any of the languages but i&#39;m Excellent in Erudian (like that matters ;o)  If anyone on this list is on fennin ro and knows any languages i would be happy to learn them, if i become average-excellent at any of them i will gladly teach others as someone did for me. So please respond to this if you are on Fennin Ro!</div>
