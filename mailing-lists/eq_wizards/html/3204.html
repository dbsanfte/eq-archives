&gt; &gt; I disagree.  That&#39;s the situation where an<br/>
&gt; Enchanter<br/>
&gt; &gt; really shines.  Wizards can help, but not as well.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Our best bet in that situation is Evac.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Enchanters are great for debuffing the mob (When<br/>
&gt; they aren&#39;t resisted) But<br/>
&gt; they really lack in doing damage to a mob.  Keeping<br/>
&gt; in mind that both<br/>
&gt; wizards and enchanters are limited by the 6 Level<br/>
&gt; cap rule, so we are<br/>
&gt; talking low red, high yellows here, I would rather<br/>
&gt; place my bets with a<br/>
&gt; wizard than an enchanter.  Wizards, can burn a mob<br/>
&gt; to down to 1/3 - 1/2 of<br/>
&gt; its life chaining DD&#39;s (Even if they are 1 circle<br/>
&gt; down due to matching<br/>
&gt; cold/fire resists) much faster than an Enchanter can<br/>
&gt; Debuff the same mob to<br/>
&gt; a manageable state (Taking resists into account). <br/>
&gt; Tashen, Slow, Weaken 1,<br/>
&gt; Weaken 2, Dot, etc.  Will about halve the damage<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not speaking from experience here. But most<br/>
enchanters over about lvl 20 seem to feel that they&#39;ve<br/>
screwed up if the group has to zone due to a bad pull.<br/>
I don&#39;t know what spells they use. AoE Mesmerize,<br/>
Lull, Memory Blur...crowd control is what Enchanters<br/>
do. They turn a fight against 12 MOB&#39;s into 12<br/>
different fights against lone MOB&#39;s. And Charm works<br/>
great as well in those situations.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, it takes longer, but my money&#39;s still on the<br/>
Enchanter.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; dealt by the mob.  Stuns<br/>
&gt; work, but 2 enchanters in a group are needed to be<br/>
&gt; completely effective,<br/>
&gt; and again resists are an issue.   Charm is out of<br/>
&gt; the question, because the<br/>
&gt; last thing you want to do in a battle against a<br/>
&gt; tough opponant, is to drag<br/>
&gt; another possible hostile into the fray.   Of course<br/>
&gt; Everyone should have<br/>
&gt; some form of root/ensnare handy to keep the mob from<br/>
&gt; jumping us.   Oh well<br/>
&gt; boss is here gotta go :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cheers<br/>
