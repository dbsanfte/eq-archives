<div id="ygrps-yiv-1697121619">From what i have been told, the dark elf wizard quests have not yet been<br/>
programmed into the game.  As for any other class quests, I spent some time<br/>
talking to the rogue guild master, who was telling me he&#39;d like me to go to<br/>
Freeport on some errand, then at the last moment he told me I had not done<br/>
enough to prove myself to the guild yet.  That is the only quest I have ever<br/>
even come close to getting.  (not that I&#39;ve looked around all that hard)<br/>

&gt;Does anyone know if there are any wizard quests in Neriak?  Or any other<br/>
&gt;class quests in which the rewards are beneficial to a wizard?  Thanks.<br/>
