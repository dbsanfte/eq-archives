<b>Subject:</b> Thinking about adventuring to Guk tonight- advice needed <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1340358706">I&#39;ve been in and around Ro and the Commons for about a week now and I&#39;m<br/>
starting to feel more adventures.    I decided on Guk to try to score<br/>
some Netted, Woven and/or Mesh armor.  If there are any wizards out<br/>
there who can give me some advice on what and where to hunt in Guk or<br/>
the Swamp, it would be greatly appreciated.   Right now I&#39;m level 9 and<br/>
have a couple of other mages and monks who have shown some interest in<br/>
this endeavor.<br/>
