<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828286880">Hello, <br/>
<br/>
I am also a L10 wizard on Bristlebane.  I am having an enjoyable time <br/>
grouping with one other player, usually L10 Ranger or L10 Rogue.  <br/>
Kill something big, sit down and chat awhile.  I recommend the undead <br/>
pawns on the chessboard, but be careful of overcrowding.  Last night <br/>
some monk tried to claim all the kills by hitting them once then <br/>
yelling kill stealer when we tried to get one out of five.  I once <br/>
again proved that it is a waste of time to try to take a kill from a <br/>
wizard.  (smiles proudly)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, its a matter of taste, but I like to hit a big thing and then <br/>
rest.  Killing a lot of weaker stuff for exp is tough with all the <br/>
campers out there.  <br/>
<br/>
Let the tank do most of the damage, and then if he gets to hurting, <br/>
just phaser the MOB to the ground.  Lots of fun!  Then recharge at <br/>
your leisure.  A little thought and that gate spell will be <br/>
unnecessary.  Find a regular partner who thinks like you do.  <br/>
<br/>
This level I have gotten noticeable exp with almost every kill, so I <br/>
must be doing something right.<br/>
<br/>
See you on Bristlebane!<br/>
