<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560211481">Make sure you are killing Shadowed men, not Shadowed women.  :)<br/>
<br/>
On another note. Shadow men spawn in numerous zones, maybe you&#39;ll have<br/>
better luck elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Not confirmed, just an idea<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Has anyone gotten the shadowed ball for the kilt yet?  I camped the<br/>
&gt; other day with two of my level 40+ friends (warrior and a cleric) and<br/>
&gt; we killed shadowed men nonstop (as fast as was possible.  We were<br/>
&gt; constantly waiting for them to respawn, and they respawn in about 5<br/>
&gt; min or so) for about 3 hours strait and I saw several shadowed<br/>
&gt; patches, eye, fist, mask, book, shining stone, and numberless weapons,<br/>
&gt; but no ball.  Is it possible to get it or is it super rare??<br/>
