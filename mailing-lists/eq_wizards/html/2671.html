<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137749629">Hate to tell you but your gunna be wasting your time then there is absolutly no rubies in paw.<br/>
There&#39;s some magic item called a ruby something dunna remember what it was cause i sold it but there isnt any plain rubies (which is what lyguna wants) and yes ive done the quest she is rare spawn in Innothule swamp also. Well not really rare but she wonders I literally saw her in South Ro walking one day which is where i gave her my ruby. when shes in the swamp she is to the right of GUK.<br/>
Good luck wiht your ruby<br/>
