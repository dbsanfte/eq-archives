<br/>
Ok that is my cynical reply :).  I can actually say that I found a use for<br/>
these (other can increasing your divination skill for when you get<br/>
invis--hehe).  I have at times used these spells to get a closer loot at<br/>
bandit camps and such to better see how many enemies are present (and who<br/>
has weapons?), but in general these spells are not worth keeping memorized.<br/>
<br/>
I wish that these spells were more a little more useful, but the amount of<br/>
magnification that you get from glimpse and gaze (its the same spell only<br/>
gaze lasts longer and you can cast it on others) is just not very useful.<br/>
If they perhaps doubled the magnification that you had with it, it could be<br/>
useful (scanning the horizon for hill giants maybe?).<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, I would really like to see some more vision spells with<br/>
more uses.  Perhaps a night vision spell that gives us better low light<br/>
vision (perhaps similar to ultravision that the dark elves get).  Heat sight<br/>
is nice but only useful for humans and erudites.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone got some ideas for cool and useful vision based spells?  Perhaps make<br/>
it so that if a monster attacks your eye of zomm, it at least won&#39;t then<br/>
come after you?  I mean come on that really makes no sense.  You are a<br/>
monster and see this little eye moving around.  You decide to whack it cause<br/>
it&#39;s annoying you, and somehow you immediately know that the little elf 2<br/>
miles away casted it?  Things like this make spells like eye of zomm<br/>
completely useless.  Anyway..  I don&#39;t really know what my point is, maybe<br/>
that we need to get rid of useless spells or have them improved.<br/>
