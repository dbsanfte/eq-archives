<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711946794">You will want to head up to North Karana and fight the<br/>
beetles up there.  You can hang out by a zone line and<br/>
kite them all day.  You should be able to take out<br/>
White Pincer Beetles rather easily.  Do not worry<br/>
about rooting them.  You can easily out run the<br/>
beetles without SOW...you may have to jump a few times<br/>
to get out of their range quickly (if they get too<br/>
close for some reason).  I have taken out yellow<br/>
beetles but did not do this very often due to resists<br/>
on my SOL spell.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck...and its great XP.<br/>
