<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838744650">After many levels of wishing I finally got my Runed Totem Staff for <br/>
the bargan basement price of 13 pp (though I&#39;m quite broke now). <br/>
However it isn&#39;t as effective as I thought. Anything that is tough <br/>
enough to need a good damage weapon I generally can&#39;t hit ( I believe <br/>
my 2h blunt is maxed ) and anything that isn&#39;t that tough I can nuke <br/>
in no time. <br/>
<br/>
So my question is should I sell it for 20 pp and buy more of my ranks <br/>
spells ( i&#39;m level 12 and only have Shock of Lightning and bind <br/>
affinity ) If so which spells should I buy? Or should I stick with <br/>
the staff. Just want some friendly advice.<br/>
<br/>
TIA<br/>
<br/>
