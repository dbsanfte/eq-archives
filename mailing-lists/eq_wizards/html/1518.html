<div id="ygrps-yiv-1507543917">Right, we all need languages, and any learning is good. So, what I&#39;d like to<br/>
do is set a date and have all the people interested in learning languages<br/>
come and group spam each other.<br/>

   Date: Saturday May 22nd<br/>
  Place: ?? Any suggestions? Nice open place where we don&#39;t have to show off<br/>
our nuking talents?<br/>
   Time: Starting from 2pm EST till we all get tired and need to order pizza<br/>
<br/>
Anyone interested please email me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kenlee@...">kenlee@...</a><br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;d also like to do is form up groups of wizards afterwards to see if<br/>
we can effectively party in a &#39;wizard&#39; only environment.<br/>
PAW is close by, and I&#39;m sure that the commanders, elites, guards, and<br/>
gnolls would prove interesting fodder.<br/>
<br/>
We can also discuss strategy, swap items, and all that other fun wizardly<br/>
stuff that the warriors and tanks just don&#39;t seem to get.... : )<br/>
