<div id="ygrps-yiv-229861125">I hear a lot of players say that it is wrong and I agree. I hear few say <br/>
leave it alone! I and a lot of other players left twinking alone in UO and <br/>
look where that game is now. Same for Diablo. It does effect me and my <br/>
character cause it will lead to every other player having to twinkle just to <br/>
play on even ground. Then all the honest players will be left behind like <br/>
UO.<br/>

Twinking the Definition....Giving high level gear to a low level character.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that &quot;low level&quot; is not lower level. I a 10th level wizard gave <br/>
items to a fighter who is 7th level. Things I can not use but he can and it <br/>
helps our party. He being only 3 levels under me. This just makes sense. But <br/>
when a 20th level character gives items high in value to a less then 10th <br/>
level character that is simply foolish and exploitable.<br/>
<br/>
Now at 5th level I did find a mighty magical item that someone had <br/>
mistakenly dropped. I belive this is fair in the game. But to have a <br/>
character outfitted by other, in a guild or no, is simply cheating and will <br/>
ruin the balance of the game.<br/>
