<div id="ygrps-yiv-292156020">Ok..  my comments.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think that we should necessarily know when a root spell is running<br/>
out.  Although it is our spell and we may know everything about it, we do<br/>
not know everything about the monster we are casting it on.  We don&#39;t know<br/>
what kind of resistances he has, we don&#39;t know how much willpower or mental<br/>
strength he has, etc.  Because of this, I think it makes sense that we not<br/>
know exactly how long it will last.<br/>
 <br/>
Some notes on Shadow step and Fade:  1.  Fade sucks.  I can only hope that<br/>
others have had better luck with it than I, but Fade has never put me more<br/>
than 5 feet from where I was when casted in combat.  Casted out of combat it<br/>
usually takes me a good distance, but in combat it has never been useful.<br/>
Shadow step is a lot better.  It takes you a much farther distance and seems<br/>
to work in combat better as well.  I have found (can anyone confirm this)<br/>
that fade and shadow step *usually* will teleport you more or less in the<br/>
direction that you are facing, but will sometimes be to one side or the<br/>
other.  I have almost never seen a time when they will teleport you behind<br/>
where you already are.  I keep shadow step and gate memorized right next to<br/>
each other most of the time, but in a dungeon shadow step loses its<br/>
usefullness and i will replace it with something else.<br/>
 <br/>
O&#39;keils radiation does pretty much suck.  I don&#39;t understand why it was<br/>
given to us because we don&#39;t (to my knowledge) get any other damage shields,<br/>
so it is not like a series of spells or anything like it should be.  I still<br/>
use it a little at level 10 (and I think it does 3 damage now, not 2) to<br/>
help our tank out a little, but I think by level 12 or 16 it will be out of<br/>
my repertoire.<br/>
 <br/>
I wish we did get more buffs for groups (that are in line with the wizard<br/>
theme), such as raising magic resistance or a better damage shield (I<br/>
remember some MUDs that had a sweet high level wiz spell called fireshield<br/>
that would do THE AMOUNT of damage inflicted on the player back to the mob<br/>
with each hit.  Probably a bit overpowered for EQ though :)<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway.. these are my thoughts.<br/>
