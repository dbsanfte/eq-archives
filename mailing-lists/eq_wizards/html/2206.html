<div id="ygrps-yiv-263597414">Yup, definitely happens for me.  Never really bugged me because I&#39;ve assumed <br/>
you have to see your target to direct an attack against it.  Your experience <br/>
in the mino caves might be unique to that area I think only because of the <br/>
way they had set up the walls there? (ie the way the minos can strike <br/>
through the walls might have something to do with why you can hit them <br/>
through the walls there too).<br/>
<br/>
Best to fight away from corners I guess.<br/>

&gt;Does this really Happen? I could swear that earlier, when my group was<br/>
&gt;hunting the mino caves, I could hit a mino that was around the corner.<br/>
