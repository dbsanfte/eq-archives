&gt;     Whoa. Hold on there, Iggie didn&#39;t say YOU, he said that there are a<br/>
lot<br/>
&gt; of +pvp players that are jerks. There are also a ton of -pvp players that<br/>
&gt; are jerks as well. I&#39;ll tell you about Elyas the loser Paladin on Solusek<br/>
Ro<br/>
&gt; sometime.<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t say anyone was a jerk.  He said we weren&#39;t important enough to fix<br/>
+PvP specific problems.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Enabling +pvp or -pvp is a choice you make, and because Verant has<br/>
&gt; decided to offer you this choice, it is also up to them to protect players<br/>
&gt; that don&#39;t share a +pvp view. They&#39;ve given you &#39;free zones&#39; where<br/>
even -pvp<br/>
&gt; players are fair game, they&#39;ve given you an entire +pvp server. I don&#39;t<br/>
see<br/>
&gt; what more they can offer?<br/>
<br/>
Fix the PvP specific bugs.  I don&#39;t care about PvP specific zones.  I play<br/>
my wizard on zek where this specific issue isn&#39;t a concern to me since there<br/>
are no -PvP players to worry about.  I&#39;m just saying this continued attitude<br/>
toward +PvP is totally unwarranted.  What did we do to everyone else?<br/>
<br/>
Are thee bugs, yes that&#39;s true, but I think that<br/>
&gt; fixing global bugs that affect everyone will be more of a priority than<br/>
bugs<br/>
&gt; that affect a single class.<br/>
<br/>
The bug I am concerned with is a global bug.  It affects people of any class<br/>
on all servers.  It just hurts +PvP a lot more.  But the bug is still there.<br/>
<br/>
 So you have restrictions that I do not have as<br/>
&gt; a -pvp wizard. It was your choice, so live with it. Learn to get around<br/>
it,<br/>
&gt; and I&#39;m sure that you&#39;ll have a much better experience for it.<br/>
<br/>
Huh?  What are you talking about?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     You also have to remember that it&#39;s THEIR world  you&#39;re in, so you<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; to conform to them, they don&#39;t have to conform to you, even though a lot<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; player suggestions have been implemented. I&#39;m still waiting for a patch<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; will save the choice of how I view servers. Why would anyone want to view<br/>
by<br/>
&gt; number of players once you&#39;ve created and levelled your characters is a<br/>
&gt; mystery to me. : )<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No kidding.  That&#39;s kinda annoying.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Try and remember that there&#39;s nothing that they&#39;ve done is to be<br/>
&gt; intentionally harmful to the -pvp class, but given a choice the majority<br/>
has<br/>
&gt; to rule, and that majority is -pvp. Their priorities concerning +pvp will<br/>
&gt; always come first.<br/>
<br/>
Um, you are wrong.  Their priority is -PvP.  This should be pretty obvious<br/>
if you have played the game at all.  -PvP has no real problems (I play<br/>
a -PvP ranger on the Rathe).  +PvP still has a couple HUGE, game balance<br/>
destroying issues that would be pretty simple to fix.  From what I read<br/>
about the testing on the test server, it looks like they may finally have<br/>
addressed the issue as the looting for +PvP is supposed to have changed.  To<br/>
give you a brief rundown of the current problem, you are a lvl 35 (insert<br/>
any class here) player.  You accidentally have autoattack on or are playing<br/>
song of discord or aoe a critter that is standing near a guard at one of the<br/>
kelethin lifts.  The guard kills you.  ANY person who comes along can loot<br/>
you.  Even lvl 1 newbies.  Goodbye black robe and no way to get it back from<br/>
them (four level limit).  Obviously this screws up game balance a bit.  All<br/>
they need to do to fix it is apply the same loot ruels they use for MOBs.<br/>
If you didn&#39;t kill it, you don&#39;t get to loot it.<br/>
<br/>
However, non combat spells you should be able to cast on<br/>
&gt; others. Bind Affinity, O&#39;Keils radiation, Invisibility, great spells, and<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m behind you 110% in that you should be able to use them on others. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; sure they&#39;ll change it in the future, but how long depends on how hard it<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; to code.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t think it would be that hard as most players can already cast them<br/>
on others, just not +PvP for some reason.  +PvP spells would work exactly<br/>
as -PvP spells on a -PvP person.  There is no difference whatsoever in how<br/>
they should behave.  if a -PvP can cast it on a -PvP, a +PvP should be able<br/>
to.  The code is all there, and all works, except they aren&#39;t using it.  The<br/>
only sane explanation is they are punishing +PvP for something.  BTW, if you<br/>
are +PvP you can forget about -PvP helping you ever.  They can&#39;t cast<br/>
helpful spells on you without becoming +PvP themselves.  Of course, I play<br/>
on zek, where the only real concern is the looting issue I just mentioned.<br/>

&gt; &gt;There you have it, even players say &quot;screw you, +PvP people.  You aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;worthy of a good game experience.&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; Actually I don&#39;t believe it was done to make PVP players harder but to<br/>
&gt; &gt;protect<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; those who choose not to PVP.  I can understand why you say these things<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; make your lives harder tho.  However, I have to say that I support<br/>
Verant<br/>
&gt; &gt;on this<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; one.. there are just too many jerks out there who give PVP a bad name<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; their antics.<br/>
