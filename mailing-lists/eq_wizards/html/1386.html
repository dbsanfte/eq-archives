<div id="ygrps-yiv-1589443582">My friend, I invite you to bring a 22nd lvl Necro out to the Cauldron, take<br/>
on a yellow Tidal Lord and then tell me he doesn&#39;t have to med.  You are<br/>
very much mistaken if you think he doesn&#39;t and I almost guarantee he will<br/>
lose his pet in the process.<br/>
<br/>
The enchanter&#39;s have some nice buffs, this is true, but against mutiple<br/>
enemies, I will take a Cleric and a Wizard every time.  Our AE spells are<br/>
unmatched by any and the Enchanter can&#39;t touch a Cleric when it comes to<br/>
buff spells.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I disagree, I have never had to sit longer than a mage or necro of<br/>
the same lvl in our group.  Never.  Its all on how you play your character.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, a Mage can take out 2-3 blues just like us, but will lose his<br/>
pet and will be out of mana.  Guaranteed.  I know, I&#39;ve played a Mage up to<br/>
lvl 17.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts on this.  Again, eveyone is entitled to their own opinions<br/>
and I&#39;m not putting you down for stating yours, but in my belief,  you are<br/>
mistaken.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&quot;It appears that yes we wizards<br/>
&gt; &gt;to a increasing damage amount per circle of spells (near double each<br/>
time),<br/>
&gt; &gt;but what troubles me is that the monsters get factorially more hit<br/>
points.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t quite understand your point here. Are you saying that we should<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; &gt;able to take out creatures in one or two shots??? That&#39;s crazy, it would<br/>
&gt; &gt;totally unbalance the game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I agree on this<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Of course the creatures are going to get more<br/>
&gt; &gt;HP the higher lvl you go. We still do more dmg than any other class in<br/>
any<br/>
&gt; &gt;given round. I can now cast a spell that does 175 dmg. I can cast this<br/>
&gt; &gt;spell 6 times and enstill 1 time. I&#39;m currently taking out yellow Tidal<br/>
&gt; &gt;Lords solo in the Cauldron and in a group,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nice thing ..... a necromancer can do it also and will not have to sit and<br/>
&gt; meditate after this why?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I have reduced the amount of dmg<br/>
&gt; &gt;our tanks normally take because the creatures die much faster.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Enchanter is much better on this if you fight multiple enemies his buffs<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; valid all time you will spend your mana very fast and he will have a pet<br/>
after<br/>
&gt; a fight.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;But, as it has been<br/>
&gt; &gt;pointed out, the wizard is constantly on his ass meditating.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Of course he is, that&#39;s part of being a wizard, or any other magic-using<br/>
&gt; &gt;class. Sitting on your ass meditating is not any different for a mage or<br/>
&gt; &gt;enchanter than it is a wizard, so once again I miss your point here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is much different a magician or necro or enchanter will have to sit<br/>
much<br/>
&gt; much less then you, ask somone who played at last two classes to over lv<br/>
20.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;1. Speed up casting time for Wizards. This would allow us to cast<br/>
&gt; &gt;in-between attacks with our newest spells.(the only class that would be<br/>
able<br/>
&gt; &gt;to do so).&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;First off, our casting time IS faster than the other magic-using classes.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Secondly, what you purpose about casting in between attacks would<br/>
seriously<br/>
&gt; &gt;hinder our class. As it is now, if we are in a group and attack too<br/>
often,<br/>
&gt; &gt;the creature turns to us and starts ripping us a new one. Not a good<br/>
thing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;That&#39;s why you spread your attacks out, never blasting them one right<br/>
after<br/>
&gt; &gt;another.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No need for faster casting time but...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;that extra little kick, although there is nothing &#39;little&#39; about being<br/>
able<br/>
&gt; &gt;to deliver 175 dmg in one shot. A warrior of the same lvl with a 2-h<br/>
sword<br/>
&gt; &gt;can still only do 40 dmg in one round. I CAN solo 2-3 blues before I&#39;m<br/>
out<br/>
&gt; &gt;of mana. I&#39;ve been hunting Bosuns and Shamans, both of which are blue to<br/>
&gt; &gt;me, in the Cauldron and can usually take 2-3 of them before I have to<br/>
med.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hmm what do you think how many blue can solo a expert magician at lv 22<br/>
&gt; without<br/>
&gt; need to med and he can survive 3 blues in same time if he sacrifices a pet<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; sometimes also win. (not to mention some other magic users)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My comment wich i post under other tread i repeat it so to try to explain<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; better and not to multyoly treads on same subject.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In my first post i don&#39;t explained it good so i try to explain it better.<br/>
&gt; I like to play a wizard as i play wizards in all games for more than 12<br/>
&gt; years now, but if we talk about balancing all magic users to same lv then<br/>
i<br/>
&gt; see some problems with a wizard class, i wish to see your comments on this<br/>
&gt; and other ideas to make a game more playable without throwing a balance<br/>
out<br/>
&gt; or tring to make a overpowerfull class.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First positive things<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - wizards are great for plane(after 34+ lv), group travel (druid is best<br/>
&gt; in individual and nearly as good in group)<br/>
&gt; - wizards are best in DD damage spells (but not in damage to mana ratio<br/>
DOT)<br/>
&gt; - wizards spells are less resisted and it damage at last for one part<br/>
&gt; moust other class spells are resisted full<br/>
&gt; - wizard is fastest to deal a massive damage in shortest time (but a<br/>
price?)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Negativ things<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Wizards have lowest defence, hit points and ac of all classes (lowest<br/>
&gt; combat survivel)<br/>
&gt; - wizard spells do massive damage but also use masive mana but when wizard<br/>
&gt; uses it mana it is useless. Fighting is not a wizard strong side, wizard<br/>
&gt; dont have pets, dont have buffs, dont heal, they dont run well.<br/>
&gt; - Wizards risks very very much in combat agains only 2 blues<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First i don&#39;t wish to say that a wizard is not good or playable class it<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; nice but it is also a class with most downtime of all clases so as a<br/>
result<br/>
&gt; a 2 equaly expert people playing sametime will never get equal play time,<br/>
&gt; wizard will most time be in his book. Why this hmm lets see<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All other Magic users have better mana usage then wizard, why pet is a<br/>
best<br/>
&gt; mana use it damages, it defend, it tount and it never expires until it<br/>
dies<br/>
&gt; ( i personaly dont like this pets i wish to have a cat or dog od mouse :-)<br/>
&gt; not for combat but as familiar ) . Buffs as result do more damage and DOT<br/>
&gt; spells are much more mana efficent then our DD spells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So what can be done to make a wizard a time efficent to play as other<br/>
&gt; classes are. I suggest a faster mana recovering ratio not too much but a<br/>
&gt; 1.3 or 1.2 faster times can help and its easy to implement one number<br/>
&gt; change in formula and go go go.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here i dont put in effect of specialization as for now it is not in game (<br/>
&gt; long beta ) and i dont know if in later levels exist any only wizard mana<br/>
&gt; regeneration booster but i heared of &quot;mana stone&quot; but noone knows what it<br/>
&gt; is and when you find it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks all for reading and as i live in italy my english is not maxed yet,<br/>
&gt; but i please you to join a discussion and to not take to hard my spelling<br/>
&gt; mistakes.<br/>
