Finally pulled out he old bang, fizzle, RUN! Char last night. Was in highpass and tried to take a green gnoll. Actually hit him for 171(Was shocked at this). Then enstill didn&#39;t work and I got the crap beat out of me, but zoned in time. After regen I headed back in. There was a 20th lvl ranger. ( I know it&#39;s a hybrid class.)  She took out three blues (Blues to me) without a resting period.  And I questioned our &quot;power&quot; as wizards.<br/>

One thing I have noticed in Blizzard games. (Don&#39;t get me wrong here) is they spent enough time before release finding BALANCE in a game.  Yeah they had a ton a problems with cheating but the underlying BALANCE was there. Everquest can be a GREAT game if they can work these out.  If you have noticed the patches flying around they totally deal with balace in the game. Perhpas they should look at the wizard class to see if there is any balance there at all.</div>
