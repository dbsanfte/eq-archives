<div id="ygrps-yiv-651855818">Ok I have to complain about this even if it is a rumor. Wizards can kill<br/>
steal very easy at any level. As well as Enc. Mages, Necs, and Druids(I&#39;m<br/>
sure any spell casting class can).<br/>
<br/>
Why should those of us who don&#39;t abuse the class suffer because of the<br/>
idiots? The only time I have ever killed someone elses crit without asking<br/>
is if they dropped to 2 bubbles or less and the Crit was still above half.<br/>
Everytime I was thanked because they would rather me get the Exp for the<br/>
kill than them lose 1/4 a bubble of exp and have to retrieve their stuff....<br/>
Matter of fact the only place I&#39;ve seen as a KS problem is in dungeons.<br/>
<br/>
                    !!!!!NEWSFLASH!!!!<br/>
Anatomy of a KS-<br/>
In BB When a tank comes down to the bridge with a few gnolls in tow for his<br/>
party to beat on Mr. KS Spellcaster will target what? That&#39;s right the<br/>
biggest toughest thing in the group: Usually the Gnoll Elite or the<br/>
Commander. When I see something like this I just turn auto attack off and<br/>
let the Elite or whatever go play with the caster. I guarantee a few deaths<br/>
like this and attitudes will change.<br/>
<br/>
Why is it that hard? This was not meant to be a mindless game. It was meant<br/>
to be thought about. Does anyone think anymore???<br/>
<br/>
I agree with the Hill Giant assessment: Once we&#39;re OOM we&#39;re toast by even<br/>
the smallest crit.<br/>
<br/>
Reducing the effectiveness of the Wizard class at higher levels will more<br/>
than upset me... I&#39;ll be changing classes. I suppose no one complains about<br/>
the fact that Druids once they reach Level 14 can solo MOB&#39;s that con Red<br/>
and are 3-5 levels above them? I look at the high level players in game and<br/>
Druids are right up there in the 40&#39;s and I&#39;ve rarely seen a Wiz over 35.<br/>
Don&#39;t punish the whole class for a few of the Asses out there.<br/>
<br/>
This better just be a rumor or all the hardwork I&#39;ve done so far is for<br/>
not.....<br/>
