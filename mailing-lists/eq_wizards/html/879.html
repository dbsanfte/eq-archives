<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983590803">Watch out, I just decided to test a Gnomish Warrior out 1 day(it does<br/>
suck btw :P)<br/>
Anyways, I saw 2 elves die, there is a Elf KoSer merchant at the VERY<br/>
FRONT of Ak&#39;Anon, there is no way around it, right when U enter the city<br/>
part(after the zone by about 4 steps) you hit a wall, this merchant is<br/>
right by the wall, the only way I see to get in Ak&#39;Anon around this<br/>
crazy merchant is to:<br/>
1) Have Someone get it for you that is not an ELF(High Elf or Wood Elf,<br/>
not sure about Half-Elves, but I dont believe thise affects them)<br/>
2) Or, you can get someone to group teleport you in there(you&#39;re prolly<br/>
gonna take number 1, cuz noone can currently group teleport, that I know<br/>
of atleast, eheheh)<br/>
3) Yes, I know this sux! Its gonna be hard for me, but all I am gonna do<br/>
is make a gnomish character with HIGH charisma and get him some money<br/>
and then buy my spells then transfer it after walking to Kelethin or<br/>
Felwithe or whatnot!<br/>

&gt; immediatly upon entering Akanon by a Merchant. He wasnt able to get<br/>
&gt; the name of this npc though. Does anyone know the name of this npc so<br/>
&gt; I can steer clear of him. I need to go to Akanon to get my lightning<br/>
&gt; spell soon.    Another question. Has anyone had sucsess in getting a<br/>
&gt; black robe from neriak by having  friend get it and then giving<br/>
&gt; consent to loot his corpse? This was discussed here a while ago and<br/>
&gt; was wondering if it was indeed possible to do. If robes cannot be<br/>
&gt; traded and/or sold (even ones from najena or the thatamurgist) this<br/>
&gt; seems like a serious bug since these robes are valuable to us casters<br/>
&gt; but not to others and they would likely want to sell them if<br/>
&gt; they(non-casters) got those robes. Any thoughts? </span></blockquote></div>
