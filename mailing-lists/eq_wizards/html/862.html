<div id="ygrps-yiv-1108257634">Well, I disagree.  Being able to stand inside a building in safety while<br/>
nuking a monster that cannot hit you is not using your head but cheating.<br/>
Perhaps this isn&#39;t what you were referring to in your message, but this<br/>
would seem to be want Verrant is protecting against, and now that I think<br/>
about it, I&#39;d say it&#39;s wise.  Other wise people could go out and solo just<br/>
about anything without ever getting hit.  They&#39;d be levelling 2-3 times a<br/>
day, and the game would be easy.<br/>

&gt;Seems like this would be an example of us using our heads to trap and fight<br/>
&gt;monster reaistily. I don&#39;t know about you but part of any battle involves<br/>
&gt;having the best position and if we can trp a bunch of dumb monsters in a<br/>
&gt;building and light it up... Well seems like that is using our heads. The<br/>
&gt;monster can do this to us and we have to scramble to find an exit. They<br/>
&gt;should have to also.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;From what I have read previously,  I believe you are both right.  It is<br/>
&gt;&gt;very easy to turn on clipping for monsters, but it would allow an obsene<br/>
&gt;&gt;amount of exploitable bugs.  For instance,  if you stand in a certin spot<br/>
&gt;&gt;and open a door, your character will get stuck in the door.(I have done<br/>
&gt;&gt;this) If you gain the ability to do this to a monster, it would allow us<br/>
&gt;&gt;weak mage types to solo mobs that con red.  It would also allow players to<br/>
&gt;&gt;attack linked monsters one at a time by getting one to charge while the<br/>
&gt;&gt;rest a stuck in a tent or behind a dungeon wall.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt; On the contrary I was told that it was VERY hard to make buildings off<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; limits.  To implement that code for every creatures AI would have been a<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; large task and due to time constraints was not implemented<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Just to inform everyone.  This behavior where monsters can attack through<br/>
&gt;&gt;solid object is not a glitch.  It is a choice they have made, the code to<br/>
&gt;&gt;turn clipping on for<br/>
&gt;&gt;monsters is there.  It would be very easy for them to make it so that<br/>
&gt;&gt;monsters cannot attack through things, but they have chosen to allow this.<br/>
&gt;&gt;I personally can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt;think of any reasons why they would allow this to happen, but I&#39;m sure<br/>
