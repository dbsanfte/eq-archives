<br/>
	To use the skull you simply have a one handed weapon equipped or two<br/>
free hands.  Place the skull in an open hand and Viola!!  +20 mana and +2 SV<br/>
Magic.  I believe you can use two skulls as well but you will have no melee<br/>
weapon.  This is going to be my practice in a group.  Or I may keep two<br/>
skulls on me and use them in emergency for that quick Gate away or that<br/>
finally spell to blast the mob to hell!.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your skulls!<br/>
<br/>
BTW: Identify (lore items) is not totally working yet.  They haven&#39;t put the<br/>
descriptions in on most items yet (per Verant website).<br/>
