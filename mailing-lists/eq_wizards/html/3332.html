 </span></blockquote>Great, anybody else see me online and want ta join up to do some quests, I&#39;m <br/>
game.  Give me a tell if you see me Askur.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, can anybody here confirm that there IS such a thing as an Ancient <br/>
Cyclops that wanders S. Ro?   Nobody I know has ever seen it.  I went there <br/>
last night and asked around...nobody there knew either.  Trying to find that <br/>
ring off of it for JBoots.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, Shock Spiral of Al&#39;Kabor isn&#39;t bad.  I finally tried some AE <br/>
against those deepwater goblin pets.  113 dmg for all MoBs around me and it <br/>
didn&#39;t seem to ever get interrupted despite getting whacked at from 3 or 4 <br/>
Mobs at once.  I like how it kicks back a little too...keeps you out of the <br/>
fray for a while longer.  You guys who use AE might be on to something <br/>
here.....   ;)<br/>
