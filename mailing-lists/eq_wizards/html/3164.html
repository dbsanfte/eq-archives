<div id="ygrps-yiv-158671132">I pretty much agree with the whole thing,  I&#39;ve got a few levels on you, and its<br/>
very accurate.  The Wizards biggest drawback is no pets.  Pets are the single<br/>
thing that make Nec&#39;s, Mages, and Enchanters rock at early levels.  You can also<br/>
note that all 3 of these classes will whine incesantly about the weakness of<br/>
these pets at higher levels.   Personally, I think they are over powered at the<br/>
early levels.  All 3 of these classes can mow through whites and yellows for the<br/>
1st 16 levels, while my wizard and warrior would be hunting for easy blues.<br/>
Enchanter&#39;s DDs suck, no doubt about it.  At level 19, I believe my Evo is<br/>
around 10-15.  They just aren&#39;t worth memorizing.  If any of you wizzies want to<br/>
draw comparisons, the cast/recover time is roughly the same as lesser shielding.<br/>
<br/>
One more minor correction.  I previously stated that all Enchanters spells were<br/>
magic based.  That is not entirely accurate as I remember hearing that DOT&#39;s are<br/>
poison based<br/>
<br/>

&gt; All I can say is yep yep... I&#39;m also a level 10 enchanter and if that mob is<br/>
&gt; yellow or red there is about a 1 in 7 chance that it is fully resisted on<br/>
&gt; both my enfeeble spell and my mez(until I Tashan the creature, after which<br/>
&gt; it is about 1 in 10).  I do have a incredible ability to control the flow of<br/>
&gt; battle as long as I have a group that is willing to take a few hits from a<br/>
&gt; monster until I can target the monster and unleash a mez.  If they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; wait and attack any way my mez has no effect because after the creature<br/>
&gt; takes damage it reactivates...(DOT&#39;s break the mez too... figured that out<br/>
&gt; last night with a shaman that poisoned one before I started trying to mez<br/>
&gt; it)  so far I can say this... It comes down to whether I want to draw out<br/>
&gt; the combat or cut it off quickly.  The wizard can end a combat in 7 seconds<br/>
&gt; of spell casting... the enchanter can draw out the battle but make it much<br/>
&gt; safer.  Both have advantages and minuses, but here is my sticking point:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wizards are penalized at early levels (1-28) because they are suppose to be<br/>
&gt; so good above that.  However, I feel, enchanters AND ALL classes balance out<br/>
&gt; at the upper levels.  (Is this due to incredible amounts of whining about<br/>
&gt; how much more powerful x is than y?  YES)  Therefore, Wizards are just a<br/>
&gt; valuable as any other class above 28, but we pay a penalty of being not so<br/>
&gt; valuable at a lower level.  Is this fair?  NO.  Is this life?  yes...<br/>
&gt; sadly...  Will GZ ever see the error of his way&#39;s?  I doubt it.<br/>
