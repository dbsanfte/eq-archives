<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623091509">According to Ken Morris:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have never charged for binding services or casting invis on someone.  I<br/>
&gt; will accept donations if they wish to give them, but I never require a<br/>
&gt; payment.  However, languages are a whole new ballgame.  It takes a lot of<br/>
&gt; time and effort to learn these languages, especially Dragon and Combine.  I<br/>
&gt; see nothing wrong with expecting some compensation for your time and effort<br/>
&gt; in teaching someone a language.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s something that still eludes me. How does one learn langages? I know,<br/>
I&#39;ve been told that you just chat in a group... but that doesn&#39;t seem to work.<br/>
Does one has to invest one point at guild in it? Then how does you learn<br/>
Dragon, Combine, or come to think of it, Elder something?<br/>
<br/>
I have a monk friend, and we group fairly often, yet he has still to get a<br/>
single piece of proficiency in Elvish, Teir&#39;Dal or Elder Elvish.<br/>
