&gt; Where did everyone go?  hehe.  Is there another Wizard list more active than<br/>
&gt; this one?  :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, taking my time trying to solve quests lately so my power-leveling<br/>
&gt; brethren are passing me by (again...on their second characters hehe) .  Got<br/>
&gt; the Staff of Observers yesterday which is pretty cool.  How do we get the<br/>
&gt; Sentinel spell to work on the staff...we just right-click on the staff<br/>
&gt; before medding?  To bad I really don&#39;t have a need for this staff right<br/>
&gt; now...Staff of Writhing and Stein of Mogguk is better for me.  But I wanna<br/>
&gt; play around with it before I use it for trade or something. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You should be going for the staff of the wheel. I already got that and<br/>
the acumen mask and the runescale cloak. I&#39;m now trying to get the<br/>
temperate flux staff, but it&#39;s not easy since Sol A and Permafrost are<br/>
completely horrible dungeons (ever wonder why they are virtually<br/>
empty?). <br/>
