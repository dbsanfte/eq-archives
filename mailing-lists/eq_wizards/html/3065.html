wont.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And yes something has to be done to wizards atraction to groups, most of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my life up to lv 25 has been like: Logs on to EQ, any friends on - sometimes<br/>
yes, but most of my friends are powerleveling so i�m far behind them and<br/>
cant group, anything to solo and not get killed more then i can bare - NO,<br/>
ok trying to get a group . NO WAY most of the times, any nice quests to do<br/>
and get a nice item annd or some nice XP - NO.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Well one problem for me is that i cant play on regular basis, my work<br/>
 </span></blockquote>prevents it so one week i can play evry night and level quite nice about 1<br/>
level/night or close to it. But that i cant play for a week or 2 and when i<br/>
come back all those i grouped with are to high again. So i need to find some<br/>
new friends and convince them of that not all wizards are killstealers and<br/>
bad ppl.<br/>

&gt; Hmm i bit of a rant there but as you can see, if wizards where more sought<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh yes, definately.  Grouping is probably the number one problem.  I<br/>
disagree though about the &quot;Enchanter Territory&quot; bit.  First off, if you look<br/>
at my original post, you&#39;ll note that the formulation I posted *required* an<br/>
enchanter to be carried out.  So it enhances both classes.  (Another<br/>
suggestion I received from a friend was to allow summoned weapons to be<br/>
similarly &quot;charged,&quot; thus allowing magicians, enchanters, and wizards to all<br/>
participate in the weapon charging procedure.  And I could give you a half<br/>
dozen alternate formulations.)  At any rate, I&#39;m not personally attached to<br/>
the idea, but I&#39;d like to see if others like this one or have alternate<br/>
strategies in mind.  Wizards need *something* to make them more valuable for<br/>
grouping as I see it.  The DD and AE spells just don&#39;t cut it.  The desired<br/>
spell casters are the healers and the buffers.  Healing seems to remote.<br/>
Buffing in some fashion???  &lt;shrug&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions anyone?<br/>
