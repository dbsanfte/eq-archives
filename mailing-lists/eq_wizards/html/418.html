<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051709432">When you hit /assist it will immediately switch your target to whatever your<br/>
existing target is targeting as well as put you in attack mode. Okay,<br/>
confusing I know. Here&#39;s an example:<br/>
<br/>
    You&#39;re walking along with your friend Mr. Tank and company, when<br/>
suddenly a train of gnolls is forced into your midst, and the person who<br/>
started the whole thing dies at their feet. There&#39;s 5 gnolls and 6 of you.<br/>
Being the mage, you step back out of combat to be more effective. However,<br/>
the whole thing is a mess of creatures moving back and forth. Everytime you<br/>
try to get a creature to unleash your mystic might you&#39;re selecting either<br/>
one of your own guys, or the dead putz that&#39;s on the ground. You&#39;re friends<br/>
are screaming for help, and the Barbarian warriors health starts heading<br/>
south. What do you do?<br/>
<br/>
Well, luckily you remember your old pal and mentor Zalbar, heh heh heh ,<br/>
and what he told you to do in this situation. Calmly selecting your<br/>
barbarian warrior friend using the F2 - F6 keys (F1 selects yourself), and<br/>
select from top down. First person on the list if F2, next one down is F3,<br/>
etc...<br/>
<br/>
    So your barbarian warrior is selected, and now you hit the /ASSIST<br/>
button. Presto, your target is now the gnoll that your barbarian is<br/>
fighting. Clicking on another button, and a gnoll convulses as lightning<br/>
arcs through them. YOU have slain a gnoll. Hitting F4 you select that green<br/>
magician that&#39;s trying unsuccessfully to be a warrior and trying to pierce a<br/>
gnoll shaman with a dagger. You sigh, hit /ASSIST and there&#39;s the gnoll<br/>
shaman. Checking man you figure that you&#39;d better go with a shock of flame<br/>
and tell the fool to back off. Besides, the Warriors are starting to<br/>
engage...<br/>
<br/>
THAT&#39;S how you use /assist. Just make sure that after your target is<br/>
selected, hit your melee attack to turn it off. If not, a passing tag will<br/>
turn the monster on you.<br/>
