<div id="ygrps-yiv-995149456">ok first, research is pretty much for you character... i have not seen anyone selling researched spells yes (i have seen runes for sale though)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
also, a question, is every spell in the game for sale SOMEWHERE? or are some required to be researched? i really want levitate at 24th level but i hear both those runes are really rare could i buy it?</div>
