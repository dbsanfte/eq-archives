<div id="ygrps-yiv-79777111">I find this almost unbelievable.  Not only do I not have problems grouping, <br/>
but when I join a party it usually move up to higher level creatures.  We <br/>
are not useless or unappreciated on the Bristlebane server at least.  <br/>
Perhaps you live in a heathen land (grin).<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I never shout for grouping.  I do a /who 14 (one level below me) <br/>
and ask individually.  I have never needed to ask more than 3 people before <br/>
grouping.<br/>

&gt;As far as I can tell the wizard is pretty much useless and I have put him <br/>
&gt;on the side because I can&#39;t solo (tried<br/>
&gt;many a time) and I can&#39;t find a party that wants me.<br/>
