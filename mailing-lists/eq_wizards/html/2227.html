&gt;I agree, good point.  On that note, for some of the younger wizards, you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;find a percieved hatred of our class in certain areas...notoriously because<br/>
&gt;of our abilities to strike from afar, and more likely because you are<br/>
&gt;playing with others who are ignorant of class balance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Places that are sometimes hostile to Wizards include BlackBurrow around the<br/>
&gt;Queynos area, and Crushbone over near Felwithe.  I would say those in BB<br/>
&gt;were more hostile to our class...more sensitive to issues about steal kills<br/>
&gt;and such.  Of course, there ARE those wizards I have seen that have used<br/>
&gt;their powers to exploit others and place shame on our class.  I&#39;d like to<br/>
&gt;name names...but.......nah.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Once I hit 16...it was amazing how many groups start looking favorable to<br/>
&gt;our class.  Start looking in areas such as Highhold Pass and Unrest...<br/>
&gt;people are always ready to allow a Wizard in the group.  So don&#39;t dispair<br/>
&gt;folks...the wait isn&#39;t THAT long. :)<br/>

&gt;&gt;I think Verant tend to ignore any whine &quot;we are underpowered&quot;. But &gt;they<br/>
&gt;&gt;definitively won&#39;t ignore &quot;people don&#39;t want to group with me for &gt;reason<br/>
&gt;&gt;X&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;when the reason X is *objective* (such as the magic resistance &gt;factor), <br/>
&gt;&gt;as<br/>
&gt;&gt;opposed to a dislike based on perceived prejudice (rogues suck - <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;enchanter<br/>
&gt;&gt;suck and so on)<br/>
