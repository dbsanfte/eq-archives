<div id="ygrps-yiv-1426263217">I know that using Eye of Zomm to spy on ghouls in W. Kanara is not a good<br/>
idea.. I wanted to see ghouls up close when I was 8th level and the things<br/>
somehow traced the eye back to its source and I got an express trip home..<br/>
Don&#39;t try this at home kiddies! Does anyone know if all monsters do this?<br/>
