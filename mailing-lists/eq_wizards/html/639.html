<div id="ygrps-yiv-918178292"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; First is easy.  You all ran 20 min to your fav kill spot.<br/>
&gt; Played for<br/>
&gt; hours of fun.  Night is over.  Do you gate home, leaving<br/>
&gt; your tanks to<br/>
&gt; run thru what might end up being hostile areas (but usually<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t), or<br/>
&gt; do you run with them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends on the time constraints I have.  Usually I will make an effort<br/>
and escort people to a safe zone.  It&#39;s only fair - they&#39;ve been<br/>
tanking for me for a long time, usually.  I believe in helping out<br/>
people when they need it, and if someone is new to a zone, I will<br/>
guide and escort.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 2nd is harder.  Basically, do you die with your party, or<br/>
&gt; abandon them<br/>
&gt; when there is trouble?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, depends on the situation.  If it&#39;s clear everyone is going to<br/>
be wiped out whether I stay or not, I usually hit my /loc hotkey to<br/>
get the location of the (future) corpses, and Gate to safety.  If<br/>
there is any hope of saving some of them, I&#39;ll stick around and battle<br/>
it out.  But there&#39;s no point in sacrificing yourself for the sake of<br/>
valiance.  You&#39;ll be of much more use if you can escort your friends<br/>
to their corpses.  But again, if I can make the difference between<br/>
life or death in that battle, I stick around.  I personally don&#39;t care<br/>
so much if I die, it&#39;s part of the game.  I haven&#39;t died very often.<br/>
But the feeling you get when you&#39;ve saved your party in a tight spot<br/>
is worth the risk.<br/>
