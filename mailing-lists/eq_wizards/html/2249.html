<div id="ygrps-yiv-770157162">There is no specific monster that carries any rune with a given <br/>
frequency.  Unfortunately, I am under the impression its just a game of <br/>
chance.  I have gotten lots of &quot;words&quot; in oasis off the dw crocs, BUT, I <br/>
haven&#39;t seen a rune there yet.  There were people acquiring runes in <br/>
lavastorm, but its all up to chance from what I can see.  I hope someone <br/>
else has a better answer out there than I do.<br/>

&gt;Does anyone know a website where it says where to find runes or which <br/>
&gt;monsters have specific runes because i&#39;m approaching 16 and i haven&#39;t seen <br/>
&gt;a rune in the game yet. And plz don&#39;t copy that thing that says it spawns <br/>
&gt;on magical creatures and some number or people will have runes that don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;pertain to thier class. Thanks for the assist<br/>
