<div id="ygrps-yiv-1005014518">I Will just tell that, EQ will never be finished. Its an evolving game. They<br/>
will keep changing it and put on more worlds and more stuff as the time<br/>
pass. The game will always be a kind of beta. Couse it will never stop<br/>
changing. And new lvls and spells will be add on later.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At least this is what have been said, in the EQvault developer board<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; (non-regression testing also delay fixing, yadda, yadda)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I said I would stop, but this is just wrong. It&#39;s what the industry<br/>
&gt;wants you to believe. You CAN release adequate products. I&#39;m not talking<br/>
&gt;completely bug free, especially in a game like EQ. But EQ wasn&#39;t even<br/>
&gt;complete! Even in the design and development department! The game is<br/>
&gt;still in Beta, don&#39;t you see? If we dismiss the few little bugs, what<br/>
&gt;about things like specialization or the rouge skills that have only been<br/>
&gt;worked in three months after release? Why does my Skull of Jhen&#39;Tra look<br/>
&gt;like a wooden totem? Why do some of the research spells don&#39;t work? The<br/>
&gt;research mechanism is there - it&#39;s the same as any combine mechanism.<br/>
&gt;But some stuff don&#39;t work - why? Why was jewelry fixed only now?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;These are all things that have nothing to do with coding and everything<br/>
&gt;to do with design. What I&#39;m griping about is not only the existing low<br/>
&gt;quality, but the ever present decrease in quality as well. Verant<br/>
&gt;released an uncompleted product. No other industry would tolerate a<br/>
&gt;manufacturer releasing a product so uncompleted as EQ at release date.<br/>
&gt;Whether we like it or not, we are being fucked up the ass (excuse my<br/>
&gt;french) by game developers. Yes, they are pushed by marketing which is<br/>
&gt;in place pushed by demands. I understand that the developers themselves,<br/>
&gt;the programmers would like to make the game perfect.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But, the end product is that the consumer is getting an uncompleted<br/>
&gt;product for very complete money. The great irony of this is that this is<br/>
&gt;driven by the consumer&#39;s lack of will power to abstain from buying this<br/>
&gt;buggy software and the consumer&#39;s great demand. Face it - entertainment<br/>
&gt;is not like other businesses. You can get two different microwaves and<br/>
&gt;they&#39;ll both heat. But two different games will always be much more<br/>
&gt;different.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And so, the consumers are the biggest justifiers of this phenomenon,<br/>
&gt;becoming the closing link in this circle of inadequacy and lack of<br/>
&gt;backlash. We can only hope that in the future, with the rise of game<br/>
&gt;popularity and the rise of choce in any genre, developers won&#39;t allow<br/>
&gt;themselves to release such products. Simply because the competitor will<br/>
&gt;be better and bug free as well.<br/>
