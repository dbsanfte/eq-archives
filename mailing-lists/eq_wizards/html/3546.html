&gt; you&#39;ve played?<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Why did you start playing Everquest?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Why did you choose the classes you did for your<br/>
&gt; avatars?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>bard--I&#39;d heard it&#39;s an extremely fun class, and I<br/>
came up with a ridiculous name that inspired the<br/>
character<br/>
cleric--my main group decided to start a secondary<br/>
group when things got a little stale, and I<br/>
volunteered to play the cleric<br/>
paladin--I was sick of staring at spell books<br/>
enchanter--decided it would be a fun change of pace<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you play on a PvP server?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are you in a guild?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For what reasons are you in a guild (or<br/>
&gt; alternatively for what reasons are you not in a <br/>
&gt; guild)?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been in a couple of guilds.  I joined because the<br/>
guilds were started by friends, or I became friends<br/>
with current guild members who talked me into joining.<br/>
 Both guilds eventually disbanded as the leaders left<br/>
and everyone else drifted off.  I haven&#39;t joined<br/>
another because I don&#39;t play enough now to make it<br/>
worthwhile.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you attend guild events?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do when I&#39;m in a guild<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you normally group with<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) People you meet that session<br/>
&gt; 2) People you knew prior to playing Everquest<br/>
&gt; 3) People you met through Everquest<br/>
&gt; 4) Guildmate you found in your area<br/>
&gt; 5) Other (please specify)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Options 1, 2, or 3.  Just depends on who&#39;s online at<br/>
the time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Have your grouping patterns changed as you&#39;ve gained<br/>
&gt; experience at the game?  How so?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a lot less likely to group now, because I&#39;m<br/>
pickier about people with whom I spend my time. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Time questions<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How many hours a week (on average) do you play<br/>
&gt; Everquest?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>8<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How many hours do you play each session?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>6<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do you normally spend your time in Norrath?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Generally by trying to be the group clown while we&#39;re<br/>
killing stuff.  Assuming I&#39;m in a group.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are you on a constant quest to level or do you take<br/>
&gt; time off from gaining experience while playing?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m on a constant quest to have fun.  Leveling&#39;s nice,<br/>
but very minor.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; What do you do when you take time off from the mobs?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Help newbies.  Travel and get screen shots.  Chat with<br/>
friends. Waste money on trade skills.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; While trying to level do you ever take time out to<br/>
&gt; help others? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If yes (to the previous question), in what ways?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Help with corpse retrieval, saving from death, escort<br/>
duty, playing guide, assistance in killing some rare<br/>
mob which might have a good drop.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Did you know the other avatars prior to helping<br/>
&gt; them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Usually not.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Can you give any reasons why you chose to help<br/>
&gt; others?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Part of the point to playing is to be heroic and do<br/>
great deeds, helping others.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Have you ever died helping others (outside of a<br/>
&gt; group situation)? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Calls for help <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you ever help newbies?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If yes (to the previous question), how do you help<br/>
&gt; newbies?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Same as above.  Guide, protection, buffs, healing. <br/>
Usually won&#39;t help them kill something they shouldn&#39;t<br/>
have tackled.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Can you give any reasons why you helped them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Passing along good deeds that were done when I was a<br/>
newbie.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Were you helped as a newbie? (This does not include<br/>
&gt; help from friends you met prior to playing)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If yes (to the previous question), how were you<br/>
&gt; helped?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I once lost a corpse in Faydark.  A bard tried to help<br/>
me find it, and wound up dying several times.<br/>
 <br/>
I had one budding cook buy a stack of batwings from my<br/>
paladin and pay a pair of bronze gloves.<br/>
<br/>
Food donated when I was running across country for a<br/>
corpse retrieval.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you respond to the /yell command?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve never figured yet out where the yeller is in time<br/>
to do any good.  But I try.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Does your respose to a plea for help depend on any<br/>
&gt; factors? What are those factors?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course it does.  I&#39;m much less likely to help<br/>
twinks.  Courtesy is a major factor. I don&#39;t help<br/>
people who beg for items or money.  (Well, a level 5<br/>
character whose corpse has just disappeared would be<br/>
an exception). If I&#39;ve had a chance to observe the<br/>
other player, for good or ill, in action will adjust<br/>
things.  And, of course, how immediately the help is<br/>
needed, and how capable I am of helping.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are you more likely to help members of a specific<br/>
&gt; race? gender? <br/>
&gt; class? Why?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m more likely to donate things to wizards, because<br/>
that&#39;s where I&#39;m most likely to have equipment I&#39;ve<br/>
outgrown.  Other than that, I don&#39;t bother with such<br/>
distinctions.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Was there any time in your avatars life when you<br/>
&gt; were more likely to <br/>
&gt; help others? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If yes (to the previous question), what brought<br/>
&gt; about the difference <br/>
&gt; in game play? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>n/a<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Why do you think that people help others in<br/>
&gt; Everquest?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Partly because it&#39;s a miniature of real life. Society<br/>
has developed because people are more effective in<br/>
greater numbers than alone.  The same is very true in<br/>
EQ.  The &quot;scratching each others&#39; back&quot; thing.  And<br/>
there&#39;s also the point about playing a heroic<br/>
role-playing game.  Most of us have a swash-buckler<br/>
lurking inside (people attracted to EQ are probably<br/>
more likely than most to have this suppressed in<br/>
there), and it&#39;s more possible to let this loose in<br/>
real life.<br/>
<br/>
The flip side of the coin also holds true, of course. <br/>
There are also people who will only help a limited<br/>
sample of others, or no one else at all. I think most<br/>
of those people will not last long on EQ, because they<br/>
won&#39;t make many friends, and that&#39;s vital at higher<br/>
levels. (At least, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve seen in all my<br/>
peers who are now lvl 50+)<br/>
