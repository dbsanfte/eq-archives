&gt; Whats this crap about player economy ? Go to Veeshan and visit Freeport on<br/>
a crowded night and you wont find 2 ppl of 10 that want to sell there stuff,<br/>
only trading. Money is worthles in EQ at higher level. Well some ppl say you<br/>
can invest it in a tradde skill, why the hell should I ?? the only trade<br/>
skill worth the effort is jewelery and then you still only get more worthles<br/>
money.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps money is worthless at higher levels, but will that last forever?<br/>
When the game went live back in March, money was worthless to buy the best<br/>
items, too, because no one had many good items.  If you sold your rare item,<br/>
even for a lot of money, you couldn&#39;t buy anything with the money, since<br/>
good items were too rare.   The higher levels who trade only for other items<br/>
with other high levels are doing so because those items are rare.  As time<br/>
goes on, there will be more and more high level players, and those &quot;rare&quot;<br/>
items will become not so rare.  Then people will sell them, if only to lower<br/>
level people who have accumulated money. </span></blockquote></div>
