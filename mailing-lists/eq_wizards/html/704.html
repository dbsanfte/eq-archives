<div id="ygrps-yiv-361997550">This is a long e-mail because I didn&#39;t want to send a bunch of e-mails.<br/>
Please do read the whole e-mail though.<br/>

Sad Story:<br/>
My formerly 12th level wizard went into the Minotaur cave in the Steamfont<br/>
Mountains.  We decided to explore.  THIS WAS A VERY BAD IDEA.  Some type of<br/>
mind warp to over me and I ran right to Meridith (or whatever his name is)<br/>
and 3 minotaur guards.  But I did not die.  I got stuck in a wall and could<br/>
not run out or gate out.  I filed a petition and while I was waiting I tried<br/>
to fill out a bug report.  But that crashed the game -- power off.  When I<br/>
log back on I drop right in front of Meridith and the guards (BAM, BAM,<br/>
DEAD).  Probably would have had better luck from a guard.  Anyway after 3<br/>
more deaths and some help from an enchanter&#39;s invisibility, my friend and I<br/>
got our stuff back -- the other members of the party ran.<br/>
<br/>
Question 1:<br/>
Has anybody killed this guy and what level were you, etc. etc.?<br/>
<br/>
Question 2:<br/>
Is magic resistance used to resist the mind warp?<br/>
<br/>
Question 3:<br/>
When I was still 12th level I cast Bind on myself and my friend.  I got a<br/>
message that I feel bound to the area (or something like that).  My friend<br/>
did not.  I cast it on him 4 times and he did not get that message.  I tried<br/>
to cast it by the gnome city if that matters.  The only message that I got<br/>
was that I had started to cast a spell.  When we died, I appeared near the<br/>
gnome city and he had a much longer walk.  It appears that the bind did not<br/>
work for him.<br/>
<br/>
Another Story:<br/>
I have mostly been fighting in Crushbone, so my standing with the orcs<br/>
really sucks.  Sometimes a legionaire or slaver will attack me without me<br/>
attacking them and the &quot;tanks&quot; have been totally unable to pull them off<br/>
while I am standing and trying to move away.  I don&#39;t think that the &quot;tanks&quot;<br/>
are at the top of the orcs most wanted list like I am.  If it matters, I<br/>
helped kill Crush with a large party.<br/>
<br/>
Question 4:<br/>
Has anybody else experienced this?  Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
****Spoiler****<br/>
I have figured out what to do with some of the shackle keys that you get off<br/>
of the slavers in CrushBone.  Each number corresponds to a specific race/sex<br/>
combination.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the combinations that I know:<br/>
Male Dwarf 16<br/>
Female Dwarf 17<br/>
Male Wood Elf 18<br/>
Female Wood Elf 19<br/>
Male High Elf 20<br/>
Female High Elf 21<br/>
<br/>
Question 5:<br/>
What do the other keys do?  So far I know that I have also gotten shackle<br/>
keys #15, 23 and 24.  I have not seen any halflings or gnomes, but have<br/>
heard reports of them.  If you know who to give these keys to or where the<br/>
other slaves might be (I have not gone in the castle), please reply to the<br/>
group with the answer.<br/>
<br/>
Laugh<br/>
Has anybody noticed that it is empOREr cruch and not empEROr crush.  The<br/>
stupid orcs hail empOREr crush to.  I turned that in as a bug.<br/>
