&gt; Here is a strategy I have been using that I wanted to share with everyone<br/>
&gt; else.  It may seem almost obvious to some but I want to make sure that<br/>
&gt; everyone knows.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Distance Distance Distance!  If you are in an area in which you have good<br/>
&gt; sight distance, get to the maximum range that you can cast your spell<br/>
from.<br/>
&gt; Cast your most powerful spell and then WHILE you are recovering BACK UP<br/>
even<br/>
&gt; more and then cast again when recovered.  Using this strategy I can hit<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; 2 shocks of lightning (at level 13, so I am sure it works at level 12<br/>
also)<br/>
&gt; for a total of 158 damage (if they both hit for full damage) BEFORE the<br/>
&gt; enemy gets to me!  Against blues and sometimes evens, this will be enough<br/>
&gt; damage so that I can now switch to shock of ice (which casts fast enough<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; use between them hitting me) and finish them off in 2 or 3 castings.  If<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want the monster in your face, cast root instead of the 2nd DD<br/>
spell.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another strategy that someone posted (should have been obvious but I didnt<br/>
&gt; think of it) uses the fact that your bolt spells dont actually hit until<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; bolt reaches them (using the distance tactic).  Cast your most powerful<br/>
bolt<br/>
&gt; at maximum distance (I haven&#39;t done this but it should work) and while it<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; still on the way you can recover enough to root the enemy, then blast<br/>
away.<br/>
&gt; I would change this tact for slightly easier enemies and instead of<br/>
rooting,<br/>
&gt; cast your best shock spell and then you might even be able to cast again<br/>
&gt; before the monster gets to you.  I haven&#39;t played with this bolt tactic<br/>
yet<br/>
&gt; so it is all theory.  I will try tonight and let you all know.<br/>
