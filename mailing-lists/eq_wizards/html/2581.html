<div id="ygrps-yiv-1662893460">Chandra Miller only makes bear hide armor.  You need to talk to Karg Icebear<br/>
to get polar bear armor made.  Other than that just make sure you have the<br/>
right hide quality (low, medium, and high) for the piece that you want her<br/>
to make along with the correct amount of gold.<br/>
