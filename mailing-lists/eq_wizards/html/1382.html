&gt;My wizard tends to keep to himself and in a group they almost always forget<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m there, up until combat and my spells start going off. I group because I<br/>
&gt;must to get what I need to advance my skill. I will help people I meet along<br/>
&gt;the way, race is not an issue if it advances my knowledge. My goal as a<br/>
&gt;character is to learn all there is to learn, Knowledge is Power and Power is<br/>
&gt;Good.<br/>

&gt;Wizards, by trade alone, are a selfish group.  Now before you rant and<br/>
&gt;flame me...hear me out.  I am a 19th wizard.  From our early lives we<br/>
&gt;study magic, alone in arcane colleges.  We concentrate on being our<br/>
&gt;best, to better our mind and intelligence.  This means little time for<br/>
&gt;socialization (at most arcane arts schools).  So yes, we do not<br/>
&gt;concentrate on buffering other players, we concentrate on causing as<br/>
&gt;much damage in as little time as possible.  This leaves only us to<br/>
&gt;think about in the way of shielding.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(roleplay the thoughts folks...its easy...)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My school was a serious school and one which I enjoyed my time at,<br/>
&gt;however I enjoyed flirting with the other students and frequently dated<br/>
&gt;the young lady clerics in the guild across the street and partaking in<br/>
&gt;good elven wines and ale.  I am much older now (145 years old) and<br/>
&gt;still am looking at by the high elven wizards as somewhat of an outcast<br/>
&gt;by their standards...but they never question my power and skill.  Maybe<br/>
&gt;they are just jealous.  Good looks (yeah a little gray hair, but for<br/>
&gt;145, close to middle age for me, that nnot bad), powerful magic...i do<br/>
&gt;ok.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I guess I am sort of a Rogue Wizard.  I never liked their rules and<br/>
&gt;strict policy.  I decided to make my own policy and rules which led to<br/>
&gt;my dismissal from the school early in my education of arcane arts.  A<br/>
&gt;wizard hermit in the area of felwithe approached me and offered to<br/>
&gt;train me.  He said I reminded him of himself when he was young.  This<br/>
&gt;old mage turned out to be my father whom I thought killed by Emperor<br/>
&gt;Crush, long ago.  He trained me well and polished my skills and told me<br/>
&gt;of my true lineage in the &quot;MageStorm&quot; family.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;* that brings us up to now.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Dear Ken,<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Firstly, I agree with the root duration indicator,<br/>
&gt;&gt; that relly would save<br/>
&gt;&gt; a lot of our fellow wizards life. Secondly, I dont<br/>
&gt;&gt; agree with us getting<br/>
&gt;&gt; buffing spells like SOW, that really belongs to the<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; Shamans, it&#39;s one of<br/>
&gt;&gt; the spells that makes them what they are, we need<br/>
&gt;&gt; other unique buffers<br/>
&gt;&gt; like magic resistence and in particular AE defense<br/>
&gt;&gt; spells.<br/>
