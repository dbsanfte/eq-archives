I just made 12 last night, after grumbling all through 8-11 about fizzle and resist and lack of decent damage. Things are good right now. I do 74-78 generally with my new spell, for 3 shots (with innumerable fizzles) before I have to med again.... Meanwhile the fighters swing away far outdoing me over course of time.<br/>
<br/>
Fighting red legionnaires, Im useful because I can shoot &#39;em down fast, but against the more normal stream of blues and (gak) greens my groups like to pull in... I am always medding, they are almost never hit enough to show on their health bar, and swinging constantly.<br/>
<br/>
Does this get any better?<br/>
<br/>
My groups are people Ive been with for the past few levels, 10-11 generally, as I put in a lot of time this past week to get over this fizzle business and so levelled faster than they did.<br/>

Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I thought wizards were supposed to be masters of DD spells. I was with a<br/>
level 29 cleric recently, and he has a spell (wrath) which was doing 198<br/>
damage to my 178. Granted, I am level 27, but was still kind of shocked. It<br/>
was only a two level difference, and he had a better DD spell, and could<br/>
melee too. And buff. And heal. I know at 29 I will get Inferno Shock, but<br/>
this just makes my think that we should be doing more damage, or have faster<br/>
mana regen, or SOMETHING. Just another example of how Verant has made the<br/>
wizard class suck.<br/>
