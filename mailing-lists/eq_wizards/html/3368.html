<div id="ygrps-yiv-743514945">As long as we&#39;re sharing personal experiences - up to 12 I did CB and<br/>
soloed in Butcherblock (goblins, chess pieces). 12 to about 16 I did in<br/>
N Ro - great soloing grounds, if you find a group or get in on rotation<br/>
you can take Derv camps that give great loot for the level. 16 - 20 I<br/>
spent in High Pass. Don&#39;t know about other servers - on Solusek Ro HP<br/>
was considered a FFA zone - i.e. everyone would try to steal. That&#39;s<br/>
great for me, as a lone wizard I was able to take blacks and yellows<br/>
regularly because groups would always try to steal and help me out in<br/>
the process. 20-27 I spent in MM and Lake Rathe. Soloing in MM is hard,<br/>
though I did pull it off. Lake Rathe is solo only, if the aviaks are<br/>
camped you get in on rotation. 27-30 I spent in Cazic, yes soloing. Most<br/>
people will say this is BS - but it is true, I regularly soloed in the<br/>
maze and in the TR CY. It is possible to pull singles, you just have to<br/>
know what you&#39;re doing and know where you are. Now at 30 I see no<br/>
soloing alternatives (no I won&#39;t camp treants or any good monsters for<br/>
that matter) so I&#39;m seriously thinking about quitting.<br/>
