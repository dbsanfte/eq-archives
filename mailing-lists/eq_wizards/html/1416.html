<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838955309">According to Ken Morris:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For the record, I don&#39;t believe wizards should solo past 5th lvl.  Your<br/>
&gt; chances of dying increase dramatically when soloing.  Having said that, we<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you know what you take in. For example, I&#39;m now soloing (at 9th) Desert<br/>
Tarantula, because, by experience, these critters don&#39;t hit me enough. The<br/>
only time it is borderline is when I get three fizzle in the fight. *Then*<br/>
I start to sweat. At 10th, I know I&#39;ll get into Sand Scarabs, because these<br/>
guys are almost doable on my own right now (if I don&#39;t get a fizzle at all).<br/>
<br/>
When soloing, the trick is to know which target to hunt. Pumas are significantly<br/>
weaker than Tarantulas, but they tend to hit more often (without Poison), so<br/>
I usually end up with less HP remaining after a fight with a Puma.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; strategize carefully and leave yourself a way to escape if things go bad,<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s no lvl that you can&#39;t solo.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Agreed.<br/>
