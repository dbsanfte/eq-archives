<b>Subject:</b> Force Shock & Stun <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-489357158">I just wanted to clear up one thing about force shock that I have seen<br/>
several ppl make references to regarding it&#39;s stun capabilities.  It does<br/>
NOT stun the opponent as most of the spell listing sites have indicated (and<br/>
as some ppl have assumed here). It will knock the opponent back a step or<br/>
two, but there is NO stun involved (yes, I was disappointed when I got force<br/>
shock and found that there was no stun).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
SPOILER-SPOILER-SPOILER<br/>
There is a lvl 20 spell that we get that does stun your opponent though. It<br/>
is Tishan&#39;s Clash. It will stun your opponent for about 2 seconds (much like<br/>
a skel might stun you), and does approx. 30dmg.  The recover time for it is<br/>
about the same as force shock, so you cannot cast it several times in<br/>
succession if you were hoping to keep the opponent stunned. The mana cost on<br/>
it is very high though, so I don&#39;t really see a valid use for it (if the<br/>
stun time were longer, it would be a nice spell, but 2 seconds just isn&#39;t<br/>
long enough).<br/>
