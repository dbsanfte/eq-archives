<div id="ygrps-yiv-762112012">FYI, it&#39;s actually Highpass Hold, but that&#39;s not important right now : )<br/>
This place is pretty dangerous and a long and slightly dangerous trip<br/>
through the Karanas just to get there if you are coming from Odus.  Being<br/>
able to Invis would make this much safer but you can&#39;t do that yet. (    But<br/>
if you decide to do it, you might be ok if you learn the safest way through<br/>
the Karanas zones (along edges of zones, etc.) and hope that the HpH is very<br/>
busy which means that the main spawning points are camped and you can walk<br/>
on by unscathed.  That&#39;s a lot to hope for )) I&#39;d wait til later or find a<br/>
guide/protector to get you there.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

My question is:  What lvl should I be before attempting to go to HighHold<br/>
Pass.  I have heard this is a dangerous place to travel at lower levels.  I<br/>
am currently lvl 7.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your answers ahead of time,<br/>
