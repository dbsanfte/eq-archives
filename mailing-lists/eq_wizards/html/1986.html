<div id="ygrps-yiv-908731637">Ok all of you out there that are drooling over the Flowing Black Robes<br/>
that everyone seems to be wearing, he is a bit of advice for you.  I grouped<br/>
with the following to get one last night and let me tell you it was not<br/>
easy:<br/>
<br/>
        25 Troll SD<br/>
        27 DE    Wiz<br/>
        25 DE    Wiz (myself)<br/>
        24 WE   Paladin (Go figure on this oen)<br/>
        24 Gnome Mag<br/>
<br/>
    We attempted to kill Nejena 3 times and all 3 times she did not spawn.<br/>
She is a rare spawn but when she does she always has a Robe on.  Along with<br/>
her in the room are 2 other mages and their pets that hit damn hard,<br/>
everytime we went in we almost lost someone in the party.  If she does not<br/>
spawn some type of elemental will spawn in her place.  So I hope this helps<br/>
you guys out.  Good Luck<br/>
<br/>
