<div id="ygrps-yiv-324236180">There are still many exploits in the game that they just don&#39;t have time to<br/>
fix.  So they are still in the game, and you can still get banned for using<br/>
them....  Believe me, i reported the one in Lavastorm the third day it was<br/>
released (along with tons of other ppl), yet they still have not fixed it<br/>
(all that happens is a GM comes around once a day or so and warns everybody<br/>
not to use it).<br/>
<br/>
But, i may be incorrect about &quot;the hill&quot; in South Ro.  the area in South Ro<br/>
that was originally mentioned may NOT be an exploit.  I spent some time this<br/>
morning killing Ortallius using &quot;the hill&quot; and it didn&#39;t seem like the<br/>
&quot;real&quot; exploits i&#39;ve seen in places like Lavastorm.  Ortallius could still<br/>
hit me, but if i ran up far enough on the hill, he could no longer hit me.<br/>
But he didn&#39;t just stand there and let me pound on him from a distance<br/>
either. As soon as I got to the area where he could no longer follow, he<br/>
would turn and run, not giving me enough time to cast on him from the safe<br/>
area.  So I would have to run back down the hill until he came after me<br/>
again, giving me just enough time to cast on him (but he would still tag me<br/>
as i finished my casting).  I guess it works just like a zone, without<br/>
actually having to zone.  I used it this morning, and was able to kill<br/>
Ortallius about 6 or 7 times this morning with a partner, but we probably<br/>
would NOT have been able to kill him without the help of the hill (at least<br/>
not without dieing once or twice, as he conned red a few times).  So, to<br/>
each his own, but I think I&#39;ll stay away from it just to be on the safe<br/>
side.<br/>
<br/>
But I did see some bright spots, as he didn&#39;t resist a single flame shock<br/>
(he was 2 or 3 lvls higher then me).  He did resist enstill every time, and<br/>
force shock about 75% of the time except when my enchanter friend cast<br/>
tashan...  And then my force shock went through for full dmg every time (has<br/>
anyone ever noticed that when force shock is not resisted, it goes for full<br/>
dmg every time???).  I wish they would give us tashan or something similiar.<br/>
What a great spell.<br/>

&gt;it&#39;s already been reported by me and many others and until they fix it i<br/>
&gt;assume it&#39;s supposed to be in there ?<br/>

&gt;&gt;friendly fyi: watch the stuff in south ro by the oasis zone border. it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;not<br/>
&gt;&gt;only &quot;cheesy&quot;, but it&#39;s an exploit and you could get banned for it.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;Everything up to lvl 12 is super easy, for lvl 12 to 13 i stayed in misty<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;thicket killing sand scarabs, strong giant spiders, strong giant wasp and<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;young kodiaks, lvl 13 to 14 i did in south ro, this zone is awesome,<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;take on yellow mummies and dune terantulas, cheesy but effective.  I did<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;this with my druid only doing 36 a hit, a wizard doing 78 would be much<br/>
&gt;&gt;more<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;effective.  After lvl 14 go to oasis and group, simple as that, at lvl 18<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;your options expand to high hold for orc or gnoll groups, permafrost if<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;you&#39;re feeling brave, and parts of unrest.  GET ME OFF OF THIS FUCKING<br/>
