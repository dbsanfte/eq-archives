<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560812619">From the gates in Felwithe, follow the path to the Y, take the left hand<br/>
path.  Follow that to the next Y and take a right.  Keep going until you hit<br/>
another Y and take a left.  That will lead you to the BB zone entrance.<br/>
Once in BB, I would suggest going over by the docks.  Just follow the path<br/>
to what is referred to as the Crossroads.  It is actually a Y, take the<br/>
right path, follow it past the city and to the Docks.  Hope that helps ;)<br/>

&gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt; I was wondering if anyone would quickly mind telling me where<br/>
&gt; ButcherBlock is, for i have never really traveled far from Felwithe and i<br/>
&gt; will soon be powerful enough to go hunting there. Thank you.<br/>
