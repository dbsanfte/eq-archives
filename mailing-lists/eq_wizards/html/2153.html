<div id="ygrps-yiv-968558165">Just an FYI.  I&#39;ve been hunting Innothule swamp lately, and resting in S. Ro.<br/>
Last night there was a guide who never left S. Ro, and this morning there was a<br/>
GM (Forgot his name, but he was a level 50 Rogue)  So if you are considering<br/>
using the hill, be careful of who is around.<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; for me what you just explain is a big bug.. If you can go in a safe zone<br/>
&gt; WITHOUT zoning then it s because there is some kind of bug... Cause the<br/>
&gt; developpers have done all they can to avoid that : monster can hit you from<br/>
&gt; behind walls right ? Developpers have done this to avoid a &quot;safe zone&quot; in<br/>
&gt; dungeon..... So sorry to say you that, but you use an exploit :)<br/>
