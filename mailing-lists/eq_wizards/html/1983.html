<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493595802">Yeah, I agree.  Keep it short and simple...they may pay more attention that <br/>
way.  thanks for compiling the suggestions anyway though.<br/>
<br/>
I like the ideas about adjusting Root a little.  And possibly tweaking our <br/>
abilities for attacking 6+ MOBs.  Those new spell ideas are cool, but I <br/>
would think we would have a very slim chance of getting heard on those.  <br/>
Better we work on refining the spells we have first.<br/>
