<b>Subject:</b> Re: Rubies- Where to Find & QUEST <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-447473621">According to Bill Tong:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Be carefull with Rubies that are LORE items.<br/>
&gt; I will assume that you need the RUBY to create<br/>
&gt; jewellery. They dont seem to work. I have tried<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Jewelry is created using the &quot;standard&quot; ruby. It is expensive enough<br/>
that I think if it is found as loot, it will be on pretty high monsters :)<br/>
<br/>
The other rubies are totally different items that just share:<br/>
	1) a name (part)<br/>
	2) a picture<br/>
<br/>
Internally, they are as different as a spiderling silk is from a ruby.<br/>
