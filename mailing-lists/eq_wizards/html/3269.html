<div id="ygrps-yiv-825792375">I know what you mean.  I just made 29 this morning and went off to get my<br/>
spells.  I had 15 points all saved up so I dummped them all into research.<br/>
Whats even more cool was seeing my first blue cyclops hehe abd an avocet<br/>
that was white tu me.<br/>
<br/>
I have turned down the dark parh though to get where i am.  I am killing<br/>
treants and will never be able to go to Qeynos again...Oh well I am from<br/>
Freeport. The pull is so strong theough I went from 27 to 29 in 2 days of<br/>
play.(about 16 hrs., its my day off ok)  This is the fastest I have ever<br/>
leveled.and I have more coin than ever before too.  Guess if I ever want to<br/>
go to Qeynos  again I wil have to make bandits and gnolls extimct</div>
