<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331145428">That&#39;s true for me, too.  My faction with the gnomes was terrible.  But the<br/>
merchant wouldn&#39;t attack me.  Could it be certain classes, then?  Tunare has<br/>
to have something to do with it.  Everytime I have seen it kill someone, it<br/>
was shouting about Tunare and pagan religion.<br/>

&gt; Not true!  I am a high elf wizard who worships Tunare.  The merchant hates<br/>
&gt; me, will not sell to me, but will not attack me either.  This was before I<br/>
&gt; started hunting in Steamfont, so my faction was not improved the first<br/>
time<br/>
&gt; I entered.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is something we are missing in this puzzle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Calyn of Bristlebane<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The merchant is a clockwork merchant--it doesn&#39;t have a personal name.<br/>
It<br/>
&gt; &gt;stands just inside the zone entrance of Ak&#39;Anon, usually very near, if<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; &gt;right on top of, a clockwork jeweler.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;So, the upshot is, if you chose Tunare as deity, you will be attacked the<br/>
&gt; &gt;instant you enter Ak&#39;Anon.  You can try running away into the city, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt;have never witnessed anyone successful at that.  Also, I have once<br/>
observed<br/>
&gt; &gt;this merchant running into a wall farther into the city, but that was<br/>
only<br/>
&gt; &gt;one time.  Every other time I have been into Ak&#39;Anon, it has been right<br/>
&gt; &gt;there at the entrance.<br/>
