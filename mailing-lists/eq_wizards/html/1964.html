<div id="ygrps-yiv-2078595869">Wizards and probably enchanters (I wouldn&#39;t know I&#39;ve never played one) have <br/>
a horrible time starting out, therefore, to balance, we should become the <br/>
most powerful at the higher levels. To me it seems that Verant&#39;s &quot;balancing&quot; <br/>
is that everyone starts out different, but in the end we&#39;re all equal. I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t know because I&#39;m just a lowly lvl 14, but from what I hear on this <br/>
mailing list, this is the way it is.<br/>

 On ballance...anybody can ballance a game that olny gives you THREE options<br/>
 for race/class!<br/>
 I think that Verant has done a pretty good job of ballancing...they just<br/>
 need to continue with MINOR tweaking as time goes on to maintain the<br/>
 ballance.<br/>
 Just my hyumble opinion :)&#39;<br/>
