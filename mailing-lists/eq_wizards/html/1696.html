<div id="ygrps-yiv-897380081">Although I think this is a great idea, you&#39;ll never be able to get rid<br/>
of the twinkers.  These are individuals that try to make up for their<br/>
lack of self-esteem and inferiority complexes by showing everyone that<br/>
they are the &quot;coolest&quot; and the &quot;Baddest&quot; in the world of EQ.  As soon as<br/>
you put up a new law restricting their exploits, they&#39;ll find other ways<br/>
to exploit the system.  Its in their make-up, they can&#39;t not cheat!<br/>
<br/>
I do suspect that the majority of people on this list that are defending<br/>
twinkers are twinkers themselves but why does it really matter?  The<br/>
best advice I can give to anyone is when you see an obvious twinker,<br/>
just add them to your ignore list.  Feel free to share your ignore list<br/>
with other friends on your server.  The best way to get to these people<br/>
is by pretending that they don&#39;t even exist.<br/>

&gt; would never be any twinking...<br/>
