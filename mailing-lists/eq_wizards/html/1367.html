I have noticed a lot of duplicate questions posted on this mailing list.  I for one tend to get tired of answering the same questions over and over again.  It is to your benefit to try and look for answers to your questions from previous messages before posting your question.  Chances are if someone has already answered it or seen someone answer your question, it will be ignored !<br/>
