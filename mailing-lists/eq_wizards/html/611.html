    <br/>
    OK I was told that the mana ring was +5 mana and it helps you regenerate your mana FASTER while meditating . ..   so this guy wanted 10PP for it and I was like grrrrrrr OK cus I thought &quot;hey! +5 mana AND faster regen!!&quot;<br/>
    <br/>
    but I just read a post that said that it DOESN&#39;T help regen . .  pls say it ain&#39;t so.   Any info on mana items would be most appreciated.<br/>
    <br/>
    Thanks!<br/>
