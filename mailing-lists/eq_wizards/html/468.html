<div id="ygrps-yiv-675768786">Hmm, the only thing I can think of is that you are casting too often whilst in battle.  You should let your Ranger take most of the hits.  Unless my group is in trouble I usually don&#39;t cast more than twice on any specific creature.  Even then, I usually cast the first time right away and don&#39;t cast the second time until the creature has under half the hit points remaining.<br/>
<br/>
As always (and as stated here many times), make sure you are doing a /assist on your Ranger friend.<br/>
<br/>
Rule of Thumb:  The Mages should always be the last to die.   The tanks should be willing to die for their Mages.  If your tank is not willing to die for you, then he shouldn&#39;t be grouped with a mage.  However, don&#39;t take your tank for granted and don&#39;t panic and run when he&#39;s in trouble.  You must work together!<br/>

Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I play a High Elf Wizard. He is currently 10th lvl. The first 9 levels went<br/>
very quickly. I was one of the first Wizards in my area and on my servers to<br/>
get to 9th. Now I am finding it very difficult to get past lvl 10. I seem to<br/>
die every time I am on whether grouped or solo. I almost never can get my<br/>
gate spell off in time to get out of trouble.  I do not want to resort to<br/>
Kill Stealing (this is very easy for a wizard)<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have advice on how to advance faster. And combinations of spells<br/>
to use when solo or in a group. I know there are not many options but I am<br/>
hoping I have missed something and someone can help.<br/>
<br/>
I mostly adventure right now with a friend (11th level ranger) in Crushbone.<br/>
He seems to be sucking up most of the experience.(even when we were at the<br/>
same level. The rest of the time I either solo or group (30% each)<br/>
<br/>
Help<br/>
