<b>Subject:</b> Enchanters Spell Components <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1540966150">Just wondering.  I have heard about runes for Wizards but, has anyone ever come across any words that are components for Enchanters in their travels?  This is in response to Chad Eldrige&#39;s post about Spell components.  <br/>
<br/>
Where do you find these words?<br/>
