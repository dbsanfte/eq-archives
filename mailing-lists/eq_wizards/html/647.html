<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806186855">I bought a book in, of all places Kaladim that spoke about spell research<br/>
and more importantly the languages that are needed.<br/>
Lower level spells will be written in Old Erudian. Older than that you have<br/>
Combine. That great human empire that was wiped out<br/>
by the dragon incursions of the great wurm queen. Finally, there is Elder<br/>
Dragon. The language of magic itself. I&#39;m guessing that<br/>
we won&#39;t be able to get these right away... : )<br/>

&gt;Well I thought I had it all finished, I have maxed out my Old Erudian so I<br/>
&gt;can read the Cannon of Wizzadry (which I can), and decided to buy the next<br/>
&gt;book Doctorine of Wizzadry thinking I could read it as well.  WRONG.  It<br/>
&gt;seems to be written in a new langauge, which is unfortunate because I have<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;few languages with just Feeble skill, thus why I can only read part of the<br/>
&gt;book.  If anyone out there knows what language this one is written in, I<br/>
&gt;would greatly appreciate this info.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now for new languages, I have been completely trained in Barbarian and<br/>
&gt;Gnomish last night and half training in Lizardman (I like this one).<br/>
&gt;Getting Kobold tonight, so if you have a language that you are willing to<br/>
&gt;trade for one of mine please give me a tell.<br/>
