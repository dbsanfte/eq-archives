&gt;Subject: New Robes<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does anyone know if I can buy a new set of Wizard&#39;s Robes in Freeport?<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m in Rivervale now, and none of the shops seems to be selling robes.<br/>
&gt;I know I can find them in Erudin, but that&#39;s a long trip, and I think<br/>
&gt;Freeport is just a bit closer.  I don&#39;t care about the color (although<br/>
&gt;I prefer the red ones from Erudin).  I just need robes that will fit<br/>
&gt;an Erudite.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes you can get robes in Freeport.  They sell two types one is Jr.<br/>
Apprentice Robes and the other are Sr. Apprentice robes.  I think the Sr<br/>
ones cost just under 5 plat but have an AC of 6 and also give some mana.<br/>
Not much but something is better than nothing.<br/>
<br/>
The kicker of it is that I am a GNOME.  I have been to every city.  Even<br/>
the Troll and oger city with other characters.  There re NO Gnome sized<br/>
robes.  Not even in Ak&#39;Akanon.  I lost my guild robe when I was first<br/>
starting out.<br/>
Granted my Cloth Tunic has a better AC but I still would like to have a<br/>
robe, even if its just for show.  Has anyone found a Gnome Sized Robe.<br/>
Actually I think they sell one for Magicians Only in Freeport that a Gnome<br/>
could wear, but that kind a leaves my Wizard out of the picture......<br/>
