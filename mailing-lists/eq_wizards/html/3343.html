&gt; We made a level 1 charecter and buffed him up to 200hp then gave him spirit<br/>
&gt; of the cheetah and he ran him around then we killed oracel quick looted and<br/>
&gt; we evaced it was a very good way to kill him.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You could do that even better with a regular char, no reason to make a<br/>
level 1. In fact, it&#39;s safer, because a level 35 warrior can hold off<br/>
the 40 pally longer than the newbie who would die after 3 - 4 hits<br/>
(assuming SOC runs out or some other blunder).<br/>
