 </span></blockquote>Actually their pets are just insane at higher levels.  A magician&#39;s pet is<br/>
MUCH more powerful than an actual tank at higher levels.  I saw this when my<br/>
guild got together and the main even was when the melee types had one on<br/>
ones with the magician&#39;s pet.  Even though the pet was blue it had a nasty<br/>
tendency to shred the tanks.  A paladin was able to beat one when he used<br/>
his LOH and a ranger was able to kite one to death, but in melee it was no<br/>
contest.  We&#39;re talking like pet did 5 bars of damage and tank did one.  I<br/>
think this more than anything indicates that pet wielding classes are<br/>
overpowered.  Their pets are better tanks than tanks and their nukes aren&#39;t<br/>
THAT far below ours.</div>
