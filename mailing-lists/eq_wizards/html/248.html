<div id="ygrps-yiv-109290611">He was talking about getting an item that would raise his INT.  Your<br/>
attributes are permenant and can&#39;t raise by themselves, but certain magical<br/>
items, weapons, armor, ect will raise certain attributes as long as you are<br/>
wearing/using the item.<br/>

&gt; I am sorry did I hear you correctly, did you say your INT goes<br/>
up....Please<br/>
&gt; explain, I was under the impression that you couldnt permenantly increase<br/>
your<br/>
&gt; base stats.  I am all ears.<br/>

&gt; &gt;     I&#39;m confused.  I am a level 17 Wizard on Fennin Ro.  I find that the<br/>
&gt; &gt; only way I can nuke an opponent is to Root him first because it is<br/>
utterly<br/>
&gt; &gt; impossible to Nuke, say, Ambassador DVinn while he&#39;s piercing you.  I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; excellent at timing casts, and they just attack to fast for us to get<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; cast before their next hit, and most likely, they will.  I don&#39;t see at<br/>
all<br/>
&gt; &gt; how Wizards cast fast, that&#39;s one of our fallbacks, the other is the<br/>
long<br/>
&gt; &gt; waiting times for mana regeneration.  But no worries.  There are things<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; &gt; may get that help restoration of mana.  Back to casting... It&#39;s terribly<br/>
&gt; &gt; slow, Flame Shock takes a LONG time to cast, and it is impossible to<br/>
cast it<br/>
&gt; &gt; on enemies that can Duel Wield and Bash.  Thankfully Root is there to<br/>
save<br/>
&gt; &gt; you, because Root casts relativlely fast, but Root hardly holds.  And my<br/>
&gt; &gt; Alteration is maxed.  I have 142 INT, soon to be 148.  I get 5 casts out<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Flame Shock for 102 Dmg each on enemies with lower magic resistance.<br/>
Ok,<br/>
&gt; &gt; well, that was a fun chat.  I still love my Wizard and would never give<br/>
him<br/>
&gt; &gt; up for any other class.<br/>
