<div id="ygrps-yiv-414999943">Since my groups tend to have a high ratio of tanks to spellcasters, I<br/>
find myself in an interesting position, and I was wondering what<br/>
everyone else&#39;s ideas of proper etiquette were regarding gate.<br/>
<br/>
First is easy.  You all ran 20 min to your fav kill spot.  Played for<br/>
hours of fun.  Night is over.  Do you gate home, leaving your tanks to<br/>
run thru what might end up being hostile areas (but usually aren&#39;t), or<br/>
do you run with them?<br/>
<br/>
2nd is harder.  Basically, do you die with your party, or abandon them<br/>
when there is trouble?  All of this talk of shadowstep gate has made me<br/>
think Im in the minority here.  My tanks actually tell me they expect to<br/>
die so I can live, if it comes to that.  BUT - I don&#39;t think its right<br/>
to leave them. Am I doing them a disservice ?  I would rather try one<br/>
more time to get that root off on the MOB killing them so we can all<br/>
live (or die) together.<br/>
<br/>
#2 has lead me to doing a LOT more solo fighting, cause I hate the idea<br/>
of either possiblity actually!</div>
