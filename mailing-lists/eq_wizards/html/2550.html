<div id="ygrps-yiv-1670794304">ok, ive spent the better part of the last 3 or 4 weekends in cazic... and<br/>
here&#39;s my story:<br/>
<br/>
at lvl 21, u should be ok to go in (with a healthy group of course).  i<br/>
wouldnt venture past the courtyard tho (at 24 or so, you can maybe head over<br/>
to the throne room where u can pull bigger mobs and also have a chance at<br/>
some rubicite).  u, being a wiz, should nvr pull. let the tanks pull (and<br/>
make sure they know what/where to pull from).  at 21, defenders are gonna<br/>
con blue, white, and yellow to u (i think.. may go up to 24 which would con<br/>
red).  there are some other mobs in there in the 18-24 range as well, but<br/>
dont know them by name (seems like there is about 20 different lizzy types<br/>
in there).  another good pull would be the sents (sentinels or something<br/>
like that).  they are lvl 24-26 i think.  always pay attention to whats<br/>
around you though.  anyway, whenever somebody yells &quot;train to the zone&quot;....<br/>
get out or cast invis (or just keep ur eyes open real wide). if if the train<br/>
doesnt get u on the way TO the zone, it can get u on the way back.  and some<br/>
of the mobs they train are lvl 30ish and higher mobs (protectors,<br/>
justicators, etc..)...  and not just 1, sometimes they will train 5 or 6<br/>
high lvl mobs which wipe out all the lvl 25 and lower guys before they can<br/>
even stand up :) last, you will be zoning quite often, as there seems to be<br/>
lots of trains, and groups always end up picking up more mobs then they can<br/>
handle....  but when u zone into feerot, watch out for the ogre guards.<br/>
they will come right up to the cazic zone and smash all the light races.<br/>
dark elves, trolls, and ogres are safe.<br/>

ps. exp seems good, loot not too good. expect coins (1-2 plat) and the<br/>
occassional fine steel from the majority.<br/>

&gt;Ok, my turn to ask something of you more experienced guys.  Out of<br/>
&gt;curiousity and boredom, I did some exploring and finally found my way to<br/>
&gt;Cazic Thule.  It was a little scary...saw a lot of lizard trains where<br/>
&gt;everything was yellow to reds.  I didn&#39;t really go far in...only up to the<br/>
&gt;first courtyard.  Noticed everybody there at the time was between 28-35lvl.<br/>
&gt;I was the lowest person on the totem pole..being only 21.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any of you been there yet?  Am I way out of my league there?  Good tips for<br/>
&gt;me there for rest spots or areas with Mobs more my league?  I heard it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt;good promising area for xp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I want to kill a lizard! :)<br/>
