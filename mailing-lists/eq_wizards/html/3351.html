<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427438601"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Steamfont guards -- good reaction time, but they&#39;re relatively weaker than <br/>
&gt; some of the MoBs you might encounter in the area.  If you hear &quot;Hero&quot; you <br/>
&gt; should basically zone out. :)  Weak little stinky gnomes...OOPS!  Did I just <br/>
&gt; say that out loud?  heh<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Hero is the Hill Giant of the area. Qeynos guards also fall quickly<br/>
against hill giants, or the griffons (for those on duty in the Karanas).<br/>
Don&#39;t expect the Commonland guards to survive attack by griffons either.<br/>

The &quot;Hero&quot; in Steamfont is the Minotaur Hero, who spawns near the caves and rampages through the zone, killing all in his path.  I have seen him rage all the way to the entrance to Ak&#39;Anon, killing guards all the way.  By the time he got to Ak&#39;Anon, he had been weakened enough for the guards to finish him off.</div>
