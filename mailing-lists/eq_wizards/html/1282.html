<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581031197">Okay, I have not ranted on here yet so here goes my comments.<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, I would like to say that I love playing any magic using class.<br/>
Having said that however, I now feel I need to say that the Wizard class is<br/>
the weakest class in the game.  I know....:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well everyone knows that ice comet does 1100 damage or so its been said.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But that just wont cut it.  It is great to say that we are the most powerful<br/>
of all.  But it is just lip service to Verant.  You see if you want to make<br/>
a class like the wizard and call them the most powerful, then you have to<br/>
give them nice damage margins to all the other classes from the get go.  I<br/>
personally know that a 8th level mage, vs. a 8th level wiz is no contest..<br/>
the mage has a pet and spells...  Now you are saying that the mage doesn&#39;t<br/>
cast spells as fast (dubious at best) or that they do less damage<br/>
 comparative spells.. mage: 31  Wizard: 34).  Now I&#39;m going to hear about<br/>
how the wizards get more powerful spells at higher levels and I should just<br/>
wait...  Okay this is the tough one being that I have not reached that high,<br/>
but I&#39;ll try to make comment on that region.  It appears that yes we wizards<br/>
to a increasing damage amount per circle of spells (near double each time),<br/>
but what troubles me is that the monsters get factorially more hit points.<br/>
So, yes we do more damage in any single shot, it makes us great kill<br/>
stealers... or finishers(depends on who you talk to).  But, as it has been<br/>
pointed out, the wizard is constantly on his ass meditating.<br/>
    Now as my moma told me when I was younger, don&#39;t say anything if you<br/>
cant say something good.  Well I can&#39;t so I&#39;ll do the next best thing...<br/>
Verant if your listening, think on a few of these ideas...<br/>
<br/>
1.  Speed up casting time for Wizards.  This would allow us to cast<br/>
in-between attacks with our newest spells.(the only class that would be able<br/>
to do so).<br/>
<br/>
2.  Lower mana cost for Wizards with Specialization in Evocation more than<br/>
for the other classes.(less ass time)<br/>
<br/>
3.  Put stun chances on all of our spells( thus giving us a chance to not<br/>
HAVE to Root every mob we come across) [no yelling that it is there on upper<br/>
level spells, cause I just read that they changed it to disrupt casting not<br/>
stun]<br/>
<br/>
4.  Alt to number 2:  Make cost go up, but make the spells do better damage<br/>
to mana ratio.  example :  The wizard(lvl 8) runs up to a bear, zap, half<br/>
hps gone, zap, dead bear.  The mage could be left with 1/2 mana at this<br/>
point and still feel great...  Wizards were always suppose to be the<br/>
Artillery of the game, make them that again. (new nickname for Wizard... one<br/>
shot wonder) *chuckle*  This would make the wizard once more sought after so<br/>
that when the party needs that extra little kick he is there, or if he is<br/>
solo he can take about 2-3 blues solo but be breathing hard and oom.   I<br/>
know this would mean that the wizard hardly ever gets hit point loss, but<br/>
with our hps that is not a bad thing... only 3 hits from a red and I&#39;m down<br/>
for good...(remember YOUR own motto as published in your manual : Wizards<br/>
believe that the best defense is a strong offense.)<br/>
<br/>
Rant done,<br/>
