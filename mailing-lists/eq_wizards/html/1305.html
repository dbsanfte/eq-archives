&gt;               and cant really help parties that much...&quot;we were supposed <br/>
&gt;to be heavy<br/>
&gt;               artillery&quot; but that just is not correct. I think a wizard <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a matter of finding the right balance of classes within the party. With <br/>
that balance, the wizard can, if properly played, really shine. I find that <br/>
with a Paladin, Enchanter, Wizard and any other &quot;tank&quot; class in a party, <br/>
it&#39;s possible to kill fast, and keep moving. For instance, in the Steamfront <br/>
Minotaur Cave, I joined up with a group. The first time something came in at <br/>
us, I fired off a Shock of Ice right off, then would let the rest go to work <br/>
on it. I&#39;d fire off a shot as needed to speed it to its death, but would <br/>
rarely have to expend more than 25% of my mana. While our runner went <br/>
looking for more Minotaurs to bring back, I could meditate and get back to <br/>
full mana before the next wave. I can root fleeing Minos, finish them off at <br/>
leisure, or nuke one to death if we get swarmed, giving the tanks some <br/>
breathing room.<br/>
<br/>
Your fellow players may not appreciate you at first, but the first time you <br/>
run out of mana and there&#39;s a fresh creature up, they will notice real fast <br/>
that it&#39;s taking them 3x longer to kill it than when you helped. They don&#39;t <br/>
see how much damage you actually do when you fire off spells, so sometimes <br/>
you may have to give a &quot;demonstration&quot; to sway them to invite you. I am <br/>
happy to give them :-)<br/>
