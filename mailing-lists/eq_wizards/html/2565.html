<div id="ygrps-yiv-291458233">Hmm..well it doesn&#39;t appear I&#39;m the only one having problems reading <br/>
it.  What program do you use to view email?  And I wonder what program Bob <br/>
uses as well.  His is the only email that does that.  The two others he <br/>
sent in looked the same.  I use Eudora pro so its not som funky off the <br/>
wall program that doesn&#39;t ready anything but normal text.  Has html <br/>
capacity and the whole nine yards.<br/>
