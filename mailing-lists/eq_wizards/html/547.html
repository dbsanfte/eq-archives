<b>Subject:</b> Re: Shadowstep-Gate Success Stories?? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-776699205">I have tried this too an aoften get nowhere. This is why I sometimes just<br/>
try to gate. (that does not work often either)<br/>
I have found that you cannot shadow step through an object so unless you<br/>
move forward or back in a dungeon you end up where you started pretty much.<br/>
<br/>
I have a further question tho  does your skill (alteration i think) have<br/>
anything to do with distance??<br/>
Is there any way to control direction??<br/>

&gt;I hear a lot of talk about this tactic.  Mostly success stories. However, I<br/>
&gt;have had less success counting on this tactic than I expected.  I usually<br/>
&gt;Shadowstep a mere 10yds or so away which isn&#39;t enough distance to even run,<br/>
&gt;much less Gate.  (when I Shadowstep just for fun/testing, it works great!)<br/>
&gt;Am I the only one having little success with this tactic because the<br/>
&gt;distance often isn&#39;t great enough?  Is it dependent on having &#39;open space&#39;?<br/>
&gt;(in other words, in a dungeon will this work very well or will you &#39;hit&#39; a<br/>
&gt;wall and stop)<br/>
