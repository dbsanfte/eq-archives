&gt; Haha, I can see the message now:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;You are not experienced enough to put on this ring&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; or would it be:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Other adventurers would be jealous if you had this, so you better not<br/>
&gt; wear it&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; or better yet:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;You have been twinked. Please report to the nearest Big Brother station<br/>
&gt; to have your gear stripped from you and burned. Have a nice day.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then people couldn&#39;t win cool stuff in contests, win the lottery and buy<br/>
&gt; a neat high level weapon, duel a higher level character and grab some<br/>
&gt; cool booty. THAT would make the game no fun because isn&#39;t that what we<br/>
&gt; are about? To have fun? Or have I missed something? </span></blockquote></div>
