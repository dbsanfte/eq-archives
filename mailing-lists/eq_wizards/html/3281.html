<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-877324557">Just curious,  what&#39;s everyone&#39;s magic resist at?  Mine is somewhere like <br/>
45-49 with my own buffs.  With a cleric or bard, I&#39;ve seen it somewhere in <br/>
the high 80s.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody know a more consistent way to keep this higher?  I wish we had a <br/>
personal buff to boost this up more...you&#39;d figure a master of magic would <br/>
have more resistance in this area?  :)<br/>
<br/>
I got that Thex dagger thingie that boosts SV disease up +50.  That&#39;s nice <br/>
but I wish there was something like that for magic resist.<br/>
