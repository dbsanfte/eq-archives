<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983362843">According to Wizard:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I realy only can see that you are in bad mode maybe you can think a bit<br/>
&gt; before replying, and if you dont have to say anything useful take a break.<br/>
&gt; Only useful was that you say about your warrior at 3 lv but other things<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I apologise if I seem a little harsh, but the gist of the argument is<br/>
usually the same: unless you are in a competition with other players by<br/>
the game &quot;physics&quot;, you are only in competition in your own mind. That&#39;s<br/>
not a competition one &quot;wins&quot;. You do not get brownie points by being<br/>
able to take a mob N levels above your normal and expected target, except<br/>
if you are in a race to level. EQ is not a race. I laugh at people that<br/>
strut and show off their rubicite and barbed leather whip at level 3, as<br/>
if that was somehow an &quot;achivement&quot;. It may be, for you. Not for me,<br/>
and there&#39;s no &quot;objective&quot; (within the game context) measure that says so.<br/>
<br/>
There are three kind of imbalances that &quot;require&quot; correction:<br/>
<br/>
An imbalance that prevents you from adventuring and getting in a group<br/>
(&quot;we can&#39;t solo&quot; is not an imbalance; EQ&#39;s target is groups, not solo)<br/>
<br/>
An imbalanbce that prevents you from leveling and getting in a rgoup<br/>
with people you want to group with.<br/>
<br/>
An imbalance that make a class so unplayable or so easy that people<br/>
will avoid that class or rush to that class.<br/>
<br/>
The whole twinking issue does not really fall into these categories. It<br/>
might, marginally, be relevant to 2; if you begin a twinked wizard in<br/>
order to level with a twinked warrior friend, you&#39;d level slower...<br/>
if you both solo of course.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; are realy dont help any discusion and your tone is realy arogant.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, I apologise, but after a while, one gets tired of the &quot;grass is<br/>
greener on the other side&quot; recurring arguments. Here, and in other<br/>
classes lists.<br/>
<br/>
The twink problem is a non-problem. Or would you expect a warrior to<br/>
require as few equipment, compared to a wizard of the same level, to<br/>
achieve the same efficiency? After all, the warrior does not have to<br/>
spend all that plat on our spells (and us wizards get off lightly in<br/>
that domain, compared to some other casting classes). Where else do<br/>
you expect him to spend plat.<br/>
<br/>
The only difference is, we cannot twink a wizard with our previously<br/>
known spells. Alas.<br/>
