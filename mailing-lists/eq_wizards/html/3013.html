<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143450241">Twiinking is just part of the game....... It&#39;s a fact and to be honest the<br/>
only people that have problem&#39;s with it are people that are jelous.<br/>
<br/>
I have to ask if you have taken the time to get to level 50 and that person<br/>
start&#39;s a new char. If he, or she desides to twink his new char for the fun<br/>
of it what&#39;s wrong with that. I think to be honest I beleave it&#39;s that<br/>
player&#39;s right and verrant wont do nothing about it!!!<br/>
 Why not. Because there is nothing truly being done wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Hell If the char you love playing now could get a robe that was from the<br/>
plain of fear I am sure for a fact that you who are complaning would for a<br/>
fact take that robe and waer it with pride for the fact that other&#39;s in your<br/>
team couldnt get it for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
If you are going to gripe about any thing them pick something that is going<br/>
to improve the game. Like time for new spells... or new dungon&#39;s.... or<br/>
vamping zone&#39;s that are empty so that there is more hunting grounds. Thing&#39;s<br/>
like that are valid.<br/>
<br/>
This game is made for people to have fun. If a person way of fun is playing<br/>
a level 3 char with ruby armor... I say all the power to him.... emjoy<br/>
fighting your fire bettel is what I say.</div>
