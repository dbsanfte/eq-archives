<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889707786">Yeah maybe i should try that out, i have been to south karana, lake rathtear, and mistmoore of late and i must say that when i came to MM the first time we where only like 6 to 8 ppl in the zone and we a group of 5 made such good XP and loot in 3 hours and nice ppl in the group at that, so i think it was my best 3 hours in the game :-))).<br/>
No killstealers no whining and no dumbass wise guys. just a great time.<br/>
<br/>
The post is finished here only my rant is left:<br/>
<br/>
When i first starting playing RPG on the net it was in Meridian 59 and after some hard time and some dieing from PKillers i foound some great friends and begun seing my deaths as something good. I still talk with some of those ppl from those days and i miss em.<br/>
I thought that Everquest would take me back but oboy i was up for a big disappointment, i thought this game would be about adveturing and make friends. Doing quests, slay creatures of saga and alot of fun. But hell you have to play this game like quake to get something out of it if you arent an real RPlayer. I can admit that iï¿½m not that good at RP but i try sometime and i have also tried to powergame. my paladin who is now lv 17 i took him from lv 1 to 10 in under 20 hours playtime and the only twinking i did was to give him rawhide armor i got from orcs in butcherblock and 5 pp.<br/>
But that wasnt any fun either.<br/>
<br/>
So to make a long story short, couse i think not many ppl want me to write a book here. he hehehe<br/>
<br/>
         I WANT THE FUN BACK IN EQ, NOW<br/>
<br/>
And that dosent mean that evry wizard at lv 10 should run around with Oracle robe etc. etc. but why isnt there more variety on items ? i mean like it is now when your around lv 20 to 30 and are in range of where some nice items can be obtained they are so rare drops, lore item, no drop and camped by much higher ppl.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Signing of for this time<br/>
