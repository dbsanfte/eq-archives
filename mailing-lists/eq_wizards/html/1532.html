<div id="ygrps-yiv-1529871632">I agree that the Eye spell should not automatically allow monsters to know <br/>
who cast.. if you drag it back to you sure.. that makes sense.  BUT, if you <br/>
just look around and let it disappear out there where it ends up, it <br/>
shouldn&#39;t send every mad meany in to try to take the poor little caster <br/>
out.  (Myself being a dark elf...I&#39;m dinky doo compared to some)  It really <br/>
isn&#39;t terribly useful just for that reason alone.  Otherwise, it is kind of <br/>
neat.. but only a novelty, at best.  Kinda like a chinese finger trap you <br/>
share with your friends ... it is neat and funny at first, but it gets <br/>
boring and you toss it in the drawer the next day.<br/>
I don&#39;t keep them memorized either.  Normally I have a slot or two that I <br/>
use just for switching spells around that are not the real important <br/>
offensive spells I need.  That way I can quickly memorize and use them and <br/>
then make space for something else I need/want to use.<br/>
Gaze is much better than glimpse because it makes you be able to see way <br/>
out there...and actually I gave the wrong area for that spell.. I was <br/>
thinking glimpse was the higher level for some reason, glimpse I believe is <br/>
in the wiz guild in neriak, if not there it may be in the cleric guild.  We <br/>
do have it though.<br/>
I am on veeshan and will swiftly purchase the spell for anyone who really <br/>
wants/needs it...just give me a /tell on veeshan.. Alaia is my name.<br/>

&gt;Has anyone found a use for these?  I cannot seem to locate them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ok that is my cynical reply :).  I can actually say that I found a use for<br/>
&gt;these (other can increasing your divination skill for when you get<br/>
&gt;invis--hehe).  I have at times used these spells to get a closer loot at<br/>
&gt;bandit camps and such to better see how many enemies are present (and who<br/>
&gt;has weapons?), but in general these spells are not worth keeping memorized.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I wish that these spells were more a little more useful, but the amount of<br/>
&gt;magnification that you get from glimpse and gaze (its the same spell only<br/>
&gt;gaze lasts longer and you can cast it on others) is just not very useful.<br/>
&gt;If they perhaps doubled the magnification that you had with it, it could be<br/>
&gt;useful (scanning the horizon for hill giants maybe?).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Other than that, I would really like to see some more vision spells with<br/>
&gt;more uses.  Perhaps a night vision spell that gives us better low light<br/>
&gt;vision (perhaps similar to ultravision that the dark elves get).  Heat sight<br/>
&gt;is nice but only useful for humans and erudites.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone got some ideas for cool and useful vision based spells?  Perhaps make<br/>
&gt;it so that if a monster attacks your eye of zomm, it at least won&#39;t then<br/>
&gt;come after you?  I mean come on that really makes no sense.  You are a<br/>
&gt;monster and see this little eye moving around.  You decide to whack it cause<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s annoying you, and somehow you immediately know that the little elf 2<br/>
&gt;miles away casted it?  Things like this make spells like eye of zomm<br/>
&gt;completely useless.  Anyway..  I don&#39;t really know what my point is, maybe<br/>
&gt;that we need to get rid of useless spells or have them improved.<br/>
