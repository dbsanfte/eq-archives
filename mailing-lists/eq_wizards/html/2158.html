<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136672916">So I guess it is dex.  Well fear not those who are dex impaired as myself,<br/>
you will continue more and more at higher levels.  Now that I know wis<br/>
affects mind altering spells, I am thinking about taking on some evil eyes<br/>
with my 93 wis and hope its enough to resist charm :)  hehe if not it might<br/>
be fun to be a pet for a while.. :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Any wizards out there with high dex (gnomes start with 85 dex I believe)<br/>
&gt; care to comment on this?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a gnomish Wizard, I also put 5 of my bonus points into dex (90?), and 3<br/>
into wisdom (70).  It doesn&#39;t seem to matter what is hitting me when I<br/>
recover.  I&#39;ve recovered while being hit by deep reds and Decaying skels.  I<br/>
tend to recover most while being hit by blues, but I have attacked/been<br/>
attacked by blues more than anything else.  Anyway, I pulled this from the<br/>
manual.<br/>
<br/>
Dexterity:<br/>
This is your hand/eye coordination and is used in combat accuracy and spell<br/>
casting capability.  This is<br/>
used in calculating your missile combat skills and aids in determining if<br/>
you<br/>
are interrupted when you are<br/>
hit while casting a spell.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wisdom:<br/>
This is willpower and faith and is used to determine the casting abilities<br/>
of<br/>
Shaman, Druids, Rangers,<br/>
Clerics, and Paladins.  It is also involved in resisting magical spells that<br/>
effect the mind.<br/>
