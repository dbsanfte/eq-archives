<div id="ygrps-yiv-418156125">According to Cristie:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have to assume you&#39;re human.<br/>
<br/>
A marginal improvement over your cloth might be had by hunting frogloks<br/>
in the sewers. Frogloks have netted armor, which is exactly the same as<br/>
cloth, but as light or lighter as small sizes - thus you can scrap 1 or<br/>
2 units of weight. Probably not worth the bother. It wasn&#39;t for me: I&#39;m<br/>
high elf, and thus able to wear small size.<br/>
<br/>
After this, you must relocate to Freeport. Woven armor is gotten out of<br/>
Frogloks too, but you must go down to the Innothule Swamp and their home<br/>
of Upper Guk for this. Woven is about equivalent to patchwork, and can<br/>
be worn by all races & classes, and is light.<br/>
<br/>
Damask is from Najena mostly, equivalent to leather, and limited to casters.<br/>
It&#39;s a tad too high level for you now, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Then you have Gossamer, which is high level stuff :)<br/>
