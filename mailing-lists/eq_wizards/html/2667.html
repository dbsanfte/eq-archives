<b>Subject:</b> Journal Strongbox Quest (Freeport) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1816932408">Has anybody done the journal strongbox quest in freeport?  I keep getting told that the journal strongbox I need to get is in the water by the freeport docks but I cannot find it!  I&#39;ve tried killing the sharks to see if it was loot, and I didn&#39;t get any loot. Can anybody who is familiar with this quest help?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
