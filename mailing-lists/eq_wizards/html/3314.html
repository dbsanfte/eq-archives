<div id="ygrps-yiv-860464522">It would be a suicide run, I was down there with a group of 45ish players<br/>
when I got my rod.  Very doubtful you could navigate and retain you invis to<br/>
the room and back.  Even if you tried to gate out, you would be dead VERY<br/>
fast! ;o)  Best choice to is find a higher level friend to help you get down<br/>
to it, and I never saw any Ice Bone Skeletons in that area.<br/>

I have started my quest for the Staff of the Wheel and currently have 8 of<br/>
the 10 rods.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am missing the one in Guk and the one from the Everfrost caves. But I have<br/>
a few questions since I have spent no time in Guk in 32 levels.<br/>
<br/>
GUK<br/>
1. I need to know the easiest or quickest path to the hand room?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2. Is the room on the Live or Dead side?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3. Will I encounter any Undead frogs along the way?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
EVERFROST<br/>
I know that the rod is surrounded by 3 IBS and that an NPC is in the area. I<br/>
can get by the IBS with Invis to Undead but the NPC could be a problem.<br/>
<br/>
1. Is this NPC within range of the rod?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I will not have a group with me and am only going to attempt this when the<br/>
Hand room is being camped. I may however try a suicide run depending on how<br/>
brave I feel.<br/>
