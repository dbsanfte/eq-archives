<b>Subject:</b> exploits? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-85698447">Besides, what&#39;s the point?  Where&#39;s the challenge to using an exploit?<br/>
Are we racing to get to 50level?  It&#39;s already been done almost a month <br/>
ago...no point to that.<br/>
<br/>
Are we trying to get unique items?  I think everything cool has already been <br/>
found save for a handful of new ones.<br/>
<br/>
So if you&#39;re not racing to get any bragging rights...just enjoy the game the <br/>
way it was intended to be played.  To each his own...but I get no bigger <br/>
thrill than working with friends to get cool items and achieving each level <br/>
one step at a time...who cares how long it takes?  We all KNOW we&#39;ll all get <br/>
to 50Level one day with all the trimmings...so why rush?<br/>
<br/>
I know this isn&#39;t going to sway those of you intent on using exploits to get <br/>
your way.  Do what you must.  Just please keep quiet about it then ok?  or <br/>
even do us a favor and post headers with *exploits*<br/>
