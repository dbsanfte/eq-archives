<br/>
Go over to UO they had only 5-10% of the people twinking at first as well.  Now you have no hope <br/>
of playing unless you twink.  Twinkers do impact all of us that do not twink and the impact will <br/>
only grow worse as a result of idiots like you!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; You&#39;re just upset<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that she gets an advantage you didn&#39;t, right? Well, life is tough like<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Damn right I am upset.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Awww.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;  I play a limited amount of time and I have to compete with everyone else<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Newsflash: no you don&#39;t. If you want to compete, fire up Half Life and compete for frags. <br/>

&gt; &gt;  At similar levels we should have the same ability to compete.<br/>

&gt; &gt;  But with her<br/>
&gt; &gt; twinking I am at the disadvantage.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;  Yes I am upset and yes she should be told to play fair like the rest of us are<br/>
&gt; &gt; forced too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yeah, it&#39;s time for a new order! A revolution! Kind of like 1917, right?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Red Norrath&quot; does have a sound to it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, life is tough like<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that. Whether she gets an advantage or not, is none of your business<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; because it doesn&#39;t really affect you.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It does affect me.  It makes that many fewer creatures at my level available for me to kill <br/>

&gt; &gt;  This makes my job (an already difficult one) even more difficult and that is<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; And remember, she had to work her<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Char something she rightfully earned.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And just WHAT is your point?  Because she has one character at a high level and can play in<br/>
&gt; &gt; areas that I cannot she has somehow earned the right to retard my low level characters<br/>

&gt; &gt; You are obviously a fool<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Obviously. I bow before your superior intellect, mighty one.<br/>
