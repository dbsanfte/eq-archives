<div id="ygrps-yiv-148073613">I suggest evocation as i done!<br/>
<br/>
It is more important to save mana in combat and to cast faster then to cast<br/>
this evacuation spell a sec faster or im wrong oopps now its to late :) i<br/>
have evocation spec. well over 100<br/>

&gt;Hello,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have a question about spell books which I could easily test in game for a<br/>
&gt;small fee, but I never get around to it so I figured I&#39;d see if one of you<br/>
&gt;could help (and save my few GP).  Let&#39;s say I did something stupid (this<br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t happen) like not buy root at lvl4, and already filled all five slots<br/>
&gt;in my spellbook... can I go out and buy root and scribe it over top of one<br/>
&gt;of my lvl4 spells that I think sucks?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also I&#39;m nearing the specialization levels and have read some interesting<br/>
&gt;posts on the subject of what to specialize in.  It comes down to either<br/>
&gt;Alteration or Evocation and I&#39;d like to hear some thoughts about what to<br/>
&gt;choose as my expertise.  I&#39;m leaning toward Evocation based on the sheer<br/>
&gt;fact that in the long run maybe I&#39;ll save mana/time since I blast more than<br/>
&gt;I root or whatever.  But it would be damn nice to have an extra powerful<br/>
&gt;rooting ability or even get gate off while being melee&#39;d.  Who thinks they<br/>
&gt;chose the right one?<br/>
