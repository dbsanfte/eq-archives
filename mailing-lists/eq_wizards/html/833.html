&gt; I don&#39;t know if anyone has been yet, or if they are even implemented yet.<br/>
&gt; But I do know that wizard spells are not the only way to get there.  There<br/>
&gt; are portals located in places around the world that will bring you to<br/>
&gt; different planes (or so I have read).  They are always guarding by<br/>
&gt; exceptionally high creatures though, and wizards would almost always be able<br/>
&gt; to get to those planes (because of their spells) before others would be high<br/>
&gt; enough to kill the creatures garding the portals.<br/>
