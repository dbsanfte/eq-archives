<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496070184"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Question 1:<br/>
&gt; Has anybody killed this guy and what level were you, etc. etc.?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, so no help there, sorry.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Question 2:<br/>
&gt; Is magic resistance used to resist the mind warp?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe so.  It&#39;s used to resist any magic thrown at you, like Lull,<br/>
Blindness, ...<br/>

&gt; Question 3:<br/>
&gt; When I was still 12th level I cast Bind on myself and my<br/>
&gt; friend.  I got a<br/>
&gt; message that I feel bound to the area (or something like<br/>
&gt; that).  My friend<br/>
&gt; did not.  I cast it on him 4 times and he did not get that<br/>
&gt; message.  I tried<br/>
&gt; to cast it by the gnome city if that matters.  The only<br/>
&gt; message that I got<br/>
&gt; was that I had started to cast a spell.  When we died, I<br/>
&gt; appeared near the<br/>
&gt; gnome city and he had a much longer walk.  It appears that<br/>
&gt; the bind did not<br/>
&gt; work for him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, two things to check on:<br/>
<br/>
1. Did you group with your friend?  If he&#39;s not in your group, you<br/>
can&#39;t bind him.<br/>
2. Were you BY the city or IN the city?  You can only bind other<br/>
people to areas IN a city.<br/>
