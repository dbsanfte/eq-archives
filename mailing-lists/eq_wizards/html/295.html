<div id="ygrps-yiv-974277671">I asked the same questions..here are the answers I know:<br/>
 <br/>
1) Yes...Consider the enemy or NPC.  It will tell you how you affect or will<br/>
be effected by that NPC.  Now when you slay something it will tell you what<br/>
faction you effected.  Thats the only way.<br/>
 <br/>
2) Mana score?  No.  You can only guestimate the amount of mana you have.  I<br/>
have figured you have about as much mana as a warrior does Hit Points at<br/>
your same level.  You can get more exact with this by finding out how much<br/>
strength the warrior has.  If you have 115 intelligence and the warrior has<br/>
115 strength...the hitpoints should equal the amount of points in mana you<br/>
have if you are same level.<br/>
 <br/>
    -  this is my theory which I have proven through testing.  Try it out<br/>
and let me know if you find same thing true<br/>
 <br/>
3) Rank in skill with a number?  Nope.  Sorry, Verant told me they did not<br/>
want people fixated on stats.  You can figure out your number though when<br/>
the skill raises.  Keep track of it and you will know what it is.  My wizard<br/>
at lvl 15 has magical skills of 80 (maxed for the level).<br/>

Subject: [eq_wizards] 3 Questions?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1) Is there a way to view all my faction standings?<br/>
 <br/>
2) Where is my mana score at? (not the mana bar)<br/>
 <br/>
3) Is there a way to view my actuall rank in a skill? (the number value, not<br/>
the text range)<br/>
