<div id="ygrps-yiv-575966507">I have to agree with you here.  Waiting for 18 hours for a pair of<br/>
journeyman&#39;s boots was one of my worst experiences in the game.  Especially<br/>
when  after 15 hours it was my turn and I went linkdead and missed it.  When<br/>
I managed to get back on,  I was able to keep my place in line but I missed<br/>
the spawn and the number two person got them.  It took me four more<br/>
agonizing hours before she finally had them again.  My only consulation was<br/>
all the money I got for selling her ear rings later.  After that, I feel it<br/>
would be much better if the item was on the MOB evertime unless they drop<br/>
different things like Najena does.  In that case alternate each time.  Rove<br/>
then Book.  This would speed up te process and in my opinion make the game<br/>
more enjoyable for us all.  Shoot I was so bored I had everyone in the room<br/>
floating....</div>
