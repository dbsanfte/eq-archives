<div id="ygrps-yiv-1959242919">Takes a good group chemistry to get things going. There should defiantly bee<br/>
one group leader and all must workd together.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some of my bad grouping experiences (all in one group)<br/>
<br/>
Bing a new level 5 Wizard I found that I was advancing rather slowly so I<br/>
left Erudin to Qeynos and on the the Plains Out side the city gate I teamed<br/>
up with several others of my skill level. We started off good and exp jumped<br/>
rater quicky. Then eveyone wanted to kill somthing else because there exp<br/>
was not raising fast enough! So the most in the group was running here and<br/>
there attacking monsters and running back to where the rest of the group<br/>
was. Needless to say when you have three people do this then the group might<br/>
as well go solo.<br/>
<br/>
As it turned out most of them died. I Kept my distance knowing that this<br/>
type of group would ultimatly  lead me to hunting down my corpse.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I will admit that the Leader of the group did not help and he was very<br/>
impatient with the members. He would run back and forth never letting us<br/>
know where he was and he would attack Monsters on sight expecting us to back<br/>
him up but we were still back at the last creature or helping a fellow group<br/>
member who had been knocked unconscious and barely excaped death!<br/>
<br/>
When a member would die no one even cared about recovering his items and<br/>
they would walk of into the distance ignoring the fact that the player would<br/>
be back in less that 5 minutes which usually gave us just the right amount<br/>
of time to organize and regain strenght for the next big fight.<br/>
<br/>
So if you find youself in a grou that does not work just leave and find<br/>
another. There are others out there who want to adventure just as much as<br/>
you. Find a group who want to accomplish the same goals.<br/>

&gt;Ok I have a problem....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am a level 8 Human Wizard in Freeport, Xegony server. My problem is I do<br/>
 </span></blockquote>not have any friends playing EQ. My game so far has been solo. The levels<br/>
are coming very slow. I have grouped up with people several times. This<br/>
turns into a nightmare. Most of the time we all just run around aimlessly,<br/>
it takes so much time just to get sometime going its not really worth it.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone have any suggestions? I have a friend who is going to buy the game<br/>
 </span></blockquote>soon, its just hard to wait. It took me 1 week to level up from 7 to 8.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Not to mention Humans can&#39;t see in the dark.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry for the long winning post.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>
