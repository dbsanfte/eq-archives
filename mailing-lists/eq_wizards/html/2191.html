<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-437818070">I was lucky enough recently to acquire a runed totem staff. Unfortunately<br/>
as I had never used a staff before my skill was at &quot;awful&quot; level. No matter<br/>
how much I use it I can not seem to get my 2H blunt skill up. And I am<br/>
fighting blues or higher with it. I poured a bunch of practice points into<br/>
2H blunt, so now it is at &quot;very bad&quot; level, and I do more damage with it,<br/>
but still have never gotten a message saying my skill has gone up. I did<br/>
get a message about my offense skill going up, but that&#39;s it. Is there some<br/>
trick to this?<br/>
