<b>Subject:</b> GZ Verant guy replies to some of wizard questions <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-253845449">Here are reply which i received from a     Geoffrey C. Zatkin     Arch-Magi of<br/>
Norrath because i have mailed this first letter also to verant<br/>
<br/>
Lets say we have possibility to petition for things which he commented Probably<br/>
i included a full comments<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a.) better run from combat teleport spells - shadow step with minimum range -<br/>
 </span></blockquote>faster gate - second bind point (in zone only) it can be some type of faster<br/>
gate for run from combat spells<br/>
<br/>
    Probably won&#39;t happen.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; b.) Better exploration spells like invisible eye of zoom with longer<br/>
 </span></blockquote>duration.<br/>
<br/>
    Probably won&#39;t happen.<br/>
<br/>
Note: i see one post that if we get a longer duration eye of zoom we will be in<br/>
grade to explore dungeons without risk<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; c.) Item locator. As we are item hunters we can have a spell which can<br/>
 </span></blockquote>function as ranger tracker for items in zone so we can see all items in zone<br/>
and we can turn in direction where item is !!<br/>
<br/>
    Won&#39;t happen for sure.  Come on - if there is no risk...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; d.) faster mana recovery then other classes - ( or by higher meditation limit<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lets say (level +1) * 7 or by specific items wizard only later in game) - why<br/>
this you can ask. because in combat other classes have a mana battery<br/>
which is a pet it can defend, attack and also sacrifice and many more long<br/>
duration buffing spells.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    Won&#39;t happen.  Wizards are balanced against every other magic class. Giving<br/>
them more mana would remove 1 year worth of beta testing.<br/>
<br/>
e.) one thing which is not wizard specific but influence us, is to make a<br/>
meditation more diversifying I wish to play a game not to stay looking all time<br/>
in same page or go in WC, kitchen when I meditate it will be nice to have <br/>
 - internal email system<br/>
 - two chat windows so that I can access general all server chat same one which<br/>
we can go in from server screen in one window and to hear what going on in game<br/>
in other window<br/>
- in game class oriented mailing lists<br/>
<br/>
    We probably will be adding something to Med to make it a bit more<br/>
enjoyable.  Up until the end of  Beta, you couldn&#39;t even talk or tell in Med.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; - He is a weakest class in all Norath looking at hit points,  but he is a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>major destructive power in game also.<br/>
<br/>
    Same hp as a Magician, Necromancer or Enchanter.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; - Wizard casts Direct Damage DD spells faster than anyone else and with more<br/>
 </span></blockquote>force than anyone else. We as a class get a DD spell EVERY level and we have a<br/>
best mana damage ratio on them.<br/>
<br/>
    Yep.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; - Wizards have a experience diminution I don&#39;t know how much for sure but it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is near 10 - 15 %.<br/>
<br/>
    Ummm - no.  Wizards, Magicians, Necromancers and Enchanters all get exactly<br/>
the same xp gained from each fight, needed to level, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; - Wizards are very weak at start and at lv 20 start to be traveler and only<br/>
 </span></blockquote>at lv 34 + start to be a force in all ways from solo to group play with all<br/>
line of plane travel and group rescue spells. ( you see that a spells go from a<br/>
5 (1 lv.)- 15 (4 lv) - 35 (8 lv)  80 (12 lv) - 105 (16 lv) all times mana gives<br/>
you cc. 5 shots before go out of mana OOM when you go up in lv you get a some<br/>
additional roots in)<br/>
<br/>
    All magi are weak at the start.  Nothing specific to Wizards.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; - Wizard combat definition is major damage in shortest time!<br/>
&gt; - Enchanter goes with more suptile tactic with pet, weaking enemy or<br/>
 </span></blockquote>charming<br/>
<br/>
    An Enchanter can weaken, but has a hard time doing damage.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;         - necromancer rely on his strong pet and Damage Over Time spells DOT<br/>
 </span></blockquote>where he is a master this spells do in time much more damage then DD spells of<br/>
wizards but..)<br/>
<br/>
    True - over time, a necro does more.  For him to do the damage that you do<br/>
in 15 seconds, he would need 1 min.  Even if his mana to damage ratio is<br/>
better, do the math.  45 seconds less means that you have 45 seconds less<br/>
damage taken.  That is huge.  Wizards get quick kills.  This makes them GREAT<br/>
in a party or SOLO.<br/>
