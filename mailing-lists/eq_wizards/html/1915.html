<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268937912">If it is true that also with enchanters help we cannot hit 6 + i agree to<br/>
petition on this. I hate to read in a necro list that they kill SAND GIANTS<br/>
wich is 35+ monster with a group of 5 and 6 necros 18 and 19 lv !!<br/>
Magicians say that they do same with griffon in EC and are planing on it.<br/>
Why we cant do it? becouse all ours spells are resisted hmmm ! I think that<br/>
verant must put similar hard block on other magic users. Necro is never<br/>
resisted on his life tap spell!<br/>

&gt;&gt; This works very well.  I hunt occasionally with an enchanter friend.  She<br/>
&gt;&gt; would cast the inital debuff to lower magic resistance, the critter<br/>
&gt;&gt; charges, the pet blocks, I root and we both blast.  If we get into trouble,<br/>
&gt;&gt; the pet blocks, I root and we both Gate.  Great system.<br/>

&gt;From what I understand, there is a hard cap on when our spells become <br/>
&gt;completely<br/>
&gt;ineffective, and it was put in to prevent exploits.  I believe the level of <br/>
&gt;this<br/>
&gt;cap is 6 levels above the caster.  I think its great to stick together on a<br/>
&gt;petition, and I feel that this is one issue that needs to be addressed.  <br/>
&gt;Here are<br/>
&gt;my two prposed solutions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) Raise the cap to 9+ levels of the caster<br/>
&gt;2) make the cap 6+ levels of the highest player in the group.<br/>
