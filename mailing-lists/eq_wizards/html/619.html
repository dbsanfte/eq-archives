<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093903226">Hail, I just moved from Faydwer to Antonica and was wondering what a level 6 wizard could hunt? It would also be nice to know what to hunt a couple monsters after level 6 too. All help appreciated, thanks. <br/>

P.S. I think I can manage finding zones anywhere in the area, so don&#39;t feel obliged to describe how to reach the location.</div>
