<b>Subject:</b> Re: Dissapointments with everquest. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-241600392">According to Richard Slater:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; First of all I would like to tell the people that complain about druids and<br/>
&gt; necros being so much better at soloing (or anything) to just forget your<br/>
&gt; wizard and go play a druid or necro.  And also, I would like to state what I<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hehe :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 1) The fact that the /ooc chat lets everyone discuss the solutions of quests<br/>
&gt; or the fact you can buy quest items.  I think anyone should be banned if<br/>
&gt; they give the solution of a quest out in game, I know we cannot stop the ICQ<br/>
&gt; contacts or web sites that do but most of the solutions are givin out in<br/>
&gt; game anyways.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s human nature. Once, I started a paper on &quot;Everquest: a look at the<br/>
first telepathic culture&quot; (if you really look at it, Norrathians are<br/>
telepaths. We can talk to friends we know across the world, tell and tune<br/>
out across wide areas, maintain groups of like minded people we are<br/>
instantly in contact with... all this while running, fighting, or reading<br/>
books)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3) The role playing aspects of the game are very weak, I know that&#39;s what I<br/>
&gt; long for.  When AC comes out I am buying it instantly, it&#39;s the type of game<br/>
&gt; I am looking forward to.  Although I wish they would put a class system or<br/>
&gt; race system in.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you believe that AC will improve on role play, I can already foresee<br/>
you&#39;ll be hugely disappointed. AC is a direct opposition to EQ, and<br/>
is in the same ecological niche in the gaming world - multiplayers hack<br/>
and slashs. The same niche will attract the same people. You&#39;re going to<br/>
get the same powerlevelers, the same campers, the same K00l d00dZ we<br/>
have. From what I can see (no beta access), there will be differing<br/>
details, but not the huge qualitative difference that exists between<br/>
UO and EQ, for example.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4) Classes in everquest should have more uniqueness, I don&#39;t like the fact<br/>
&gt; that wizards are just the masters of DD spells.  I think we should get<br/>
&gt; something special, anything really.  Like special wizard hats or something<br/>
&gt; of the sort.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now that&#39;s a complain I can support. We do not have enough &quot;tools&quot; to<br/>
roleplay. There&#39;s not much difference between characters of different<br/>
but similar class. I do hope that increasing power of 3D cards will<br/>
lead to an EQ2 that can do this (EQ will never have wide customisation)<br/>
