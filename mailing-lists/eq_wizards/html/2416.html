&gt;Well in the 1 fight I wasnt really needed since it was against undead and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;had a number of clerics in the group. But it was<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- me, a ol&#39; lvl 31 wizard<br/>
&gt;- lvl 41 cleric<br/>
&gt;- lvl 39 cleric<br/>
&gt;- lvl 41 warrior<br/>
&gt;- lvl 41 shaman<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And a solo necro that was causing some fuss. Anyways, our group was sitting<br/>
&gt;around and fighting Specters in the Ferrott, then I guess a solo necro was<br/>
&gt;getting bored or kiting or something and started to spook undead or just<br/>
&gt;something. But for some reason one specter after another came flowing out<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the cave. At the end of the fight we killed about 5 of them in a row. Was<br/>
&gt;rather fun.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Another fun fight, is when I was in a tae tower group. We had a zealot,<br/>
&gt;fanatic, protector and a judicator or something and a few other things. I<br/>
&gt;went all out on the judi since it can heal the others and it&#39;s self. The<br/>
&gt;clerics and warriors bashs&#39;s / stuns interupted it perfectly and I nuked<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I sat down and med. Got back up, lobb&#39;d off a few more spells at the other<br/>
&gt;monsters, sat, med. Lobbed off more, stat down and med. When I got back up<br/>

 </span></blockquote>left.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I popped off 2 column of lightnings (130 dmg per mob for about 130 mana),<br/>
&gt;then sat and meditate. ( I had a nice dosage of clarity from an enchanter<br/>
 </span></blockquote>so<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I was getting mana fast)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;anyways it was rather fun and I enjoyed it and actually got to use my area<br/>
&gt;effect spells =) at the end I was OOM tanks about half health cleric OOM.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;OOoh! another fight that we didnt win but no one died. Me and my friends<br/>
&gt;were exploring the keep of Permafrost, a lvl 50 druid asked us if we had<br/>
&gt;ever killed the king, it has some good things and we are about the right<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lvl<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;to do it. We say &#39;no, where does he spawn?&#39; and he showed us the room that<br/>
&gt;the king spawned in. So we got ready and proceded to clear out the room<br/>
&gt;leading upto the king. This fight went quite well and the wizards were<br/>
&gt;needed to out damage the healing of the mobs,. So we sat down and rested.<br/>
&gt;Then for some reason our bard and 1 wizard had to go afk for like 15 or 20<br/>
&gt;mins. So we sat there, waiting, and waiting, and waiting. It got rather<br/>
&gt;dull, but then they finnaly came back. Problem tho - the whole area has<br/>
&gt;respawned. So we carfully plan our next attack. The warrior plunks off an<br/>
&gt;arrow at a mob standing on a ledge. It runs down and around the back of the<br/>
&gt;room picking up ALOT of mobs on the way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So we start to fight, it was quite the fight. I was blasting out spells so<br/>
&gt;was the other wizard, using AE spells, the cleric doing 100% healing on the<br/>
&gt;tanks, the paladin healing and tanking, had to use LOH one. The bard<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lulling<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and charming as much as he can. We finnaly realize that we are being over<br/>
&gt;whelemd. We couldnt take out the healing mobs fast enough to keep going. We<br/>
&gt;had a few dead but low on mana for the others and the tanks were getting<br/>
&gt;weak. So the tanks yell &quot;evac evac evac&quot;, but ack! both wizards are low on<br/>
&gt;mana. I tell the other wizard to sit and med, I toss off a few more spells<br/>
&gt;then start to beat them with my staff. ( these mobs were casting AE wind<br/>
&gt;spells that shifted us around which added to the confusion). Anyways, the<br/>
&gt;wizard finnaly has enough mana for evac and she starts to yell &quot;stand<br/>
 </span></blockquote>close&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;over and over. I dart towards her, I enter her gate just seconds before it<br/>
&gt;kicks in. We all land in north kanara with everyone at about half health<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;saying congrats to everyone. We did not win the fight but it was the most<br/>
&gt;fun any of us had had in a long time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well thats all I got for for now. But wizards are just to much fun =)<br/>
