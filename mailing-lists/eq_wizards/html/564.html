<br/>
I have a simple request Can someone tell me the name of the wizard guildmaster in<br/>
Erudin?<br/>
No i&#39;m no newbie (matter fact I was in Phase 3 and 4) but when the commercial came<br/>
out i had sold my comp :( DOH! so now i&#39;m buying a new one but while I wait i am<br/>
writing a guide for wizards to level 25 and i want to be as accurate as I possibly<br/>
can.<br/>
Thanks alot<br/>
