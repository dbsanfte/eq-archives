 </span></blockquote>it depends ont he compasitiuon of our group....untill recently i would<br/>
regulary be in a group where the primary tank was a monk, and the only<br/>
other tanks were monks...and in that instance root is rather handy, i<br/>
would keep the critter rooted and then if one(or both) of the monk were<br/>
about to die they could back off(this was before they got feign) and i<br/>
would then procede to nuke the critter down....this tactic also works well<br/>
in a all caster group...root it down and then nuke the hell out of<br/>
it...with multiple wizards (or magicans) on it the down time is decently<br/>
low cause your mana drain is spread out....<br/>
<br/>
having said all that, the change really doesn&#39;t bother me, i just wish<br/>
they had told us about it...i almost got killed by a high blue that i had<br/>
been able to solo with no problems the day before the patch...(fortunatly<br/>
a friend happened along and finished it off for me, btu still)<br/>
