<div id="ygrps-yiv-397583907">Actually, PC&#39;s CAN interrupt monster spells, have seen it happen many times<br/>
;)<br/>
<br/>
As for your party of 6 wizards, it is a great idea and you should have great<br/>
success with it, but stick to monsters that are only a few lvls higher than<br/>
you, the harder ones will just resist you and kill the whole party.  Here&#39;s<br/>
a brief example.<br/>
<br/>
When I was lvl 19, a group of us went after LockJaw, a NPC crocodile in<br/>
Oasis.  LockJaw is a 23rd or 24th lvl monster.  At lvl 19, he resisted ALL<br/>
of my spells!!!  Out of a party of 5, 3 of us couldn&#39;t do any dmg with our<br/>
spells, needless to say, when the fighters heard us all shout &quot;He&#39;s<br/>
Resisting&quot;  they were saying &quot;Oh crap!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So, while I don&#39;t see why your group couldn&#39;t be a great success, keep to<br/>
the monsters that are only a couple lvls higher than you.<br/>

&gt;     PCs can&#39;t interrupt monster spells. Well, not that I&#39;ve ever seen. If<br/>
&gt; someone can refute this, then let me know. So I&#39;m not sure if your ROOT<br/>
&gt; example is really a good one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, while on the subject of killing things, I thought of something that<br/>
I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; like to try.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d like to form a 6 player all wizard party. I&#39;m on the Solusek Ro<br/>
server,<br/>
&gt; 14th Wizard, would like to have about the same level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Verant, and everyone is always saying that you need to mix classes to<br/>
level<br/>
&gt; and go up the fastest. Here&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Form group.<br/>
&gt; Everyone target same large honking creature.<br/>
&gt; One person shouts &quot; NUKE! &quot;<br/>
&gt; Everyone clicks on shock of lightning<br/>
&gt; BLAM<br/>
&gt; 456 pts of dmg.<br/>
&gt; 1 Shot.<br/>
&gt; 1 Kill<br/>
&gt; Thank you for shopping at Wizzie mart.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Even if it&#39;s still alive and not running away, next volley should be for<br/>
an<br/>
&gt; additional 380pts<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (assuming that 1 person is attacked and spell is interrupted).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; End result after 2 rnds: 836 pts of damage in I figure about less than 10<br/>
&gt; seconds. A Hill giant takes longer than that to kill me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;l stand in front of ANYTHING for 10 seconds. With bind abilities, the<br/>
&gt; entire group is pretty safe for escaping, you don&#39;t have to go far if you<br/>
DO<br/>
&gt; die, which is highly unlikely.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How fast do you think this kind of group is gonna level taking out things<br/>
&gt; like griffawns, griffons, etc...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Only problem I can see is some things have a big magic resistance. I was<br/>
&gt; with a 15th barbarian in North Karanas, and we were feeling brawny. He<br/>
&gt; wailed on a Scythe beetle and brought it back to me and another 13th<br/>
wizard.<br/>
&gt; My shock of lightning was only doing 30-35 pts of dmg. The 13th wizard did<br/>
&gt; 0, nil, zip, zero pts. of dmg.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone wanna try out my idea, and you&#39;re on Solusek Ro let me know.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Here  lets solve the root debate:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Goto the cauldron (a zone off of BB mtns),  and poke an aqua goblin<br/>
shaman,<br/>
&gt; &gt;if you are under lvl 13  he will root you and bash you like crazy.  You<br/>
&gt; WILL<br/>
&gt; &gt;stay rooted while taking that beating  but you CAN shadow step while<br/>
rooted<br/>
&gt; &gt;(I hope they never fix that :-)). Same thing for a ghoul, I learned that<br/>
&gt; &gt;lesson multiple times in the befallen .<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;PS  Speaking of the befallen (unrest-like dungeon in the west commons)<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; &gt;careful just running through doors on lvl 2, there are pits that drop you<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt;lvl 3.  Lvl 3 is A LOT harder than lvl 2 !<br/>
