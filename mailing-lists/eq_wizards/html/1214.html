<div id="ygrps-yiv-50180613">According to Lim Dul:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you can afford it, go for a runed totem staff.  About the same damage and <br/>
&gt; delay, but it includes a small mana bonus and it&#39;s magical so you can hit <br/>
&gt; ghouls.  Going rate is about 20pp.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Given the bonus of runed totem staff (mana +5? come on), if you find a<br/>
Well-balanced Great Staff (which is also magical), you&#39;ll be probably happier.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, those 5 mana *could* means the difference between ignominous death<br/>
and Gating to safety... :)<br/>
<br/>
But do not invest too heavily in two-handed weapons. There appear to be goodies<br/>
that are a must in your off-hand.  My best bet would be the Fanged Skull Stiletto<br/>
(damage ratio: 0.5!!!, double of runed staff), one of the favorite Rogue<br/>
weapons... that we happen to be able to wield :)<br/>
<br/>
But that one is a lot further down the road :(<br/>
