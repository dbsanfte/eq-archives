<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791235076">go to guk.  at lvl 18, u are pretty safe to hunt the first few rooms there<br/>
solo, and can get all the woven u need from the first few rooms.  after<br/>
woven, i had no desire to get gossimer (if it drops in my lap, then i&#39;ll<br/>
take it, but im not gonna go outa my way to get it like I did woven).  i<br/>
have been concentrating on getting specific armor/jewelry pieces to increase<br/>
my INT/MANA.  any additional AC you would gain from gossimer would probably<br/>
not help much at higher lvls.<br/>

&gt;Me personally?  I&#39;m a 18th level wiz dark elf.  That&#39;s why I am limited to<br/>
&gt;wearing cloth types.. I do have a goss robe myself and was just speaking to<br/>
&gt;other items than robes there.  I have a damask item, woven items and a<br/>
&gt;netted piece too.  That is why I mentioned them, but I couldn&#39;t recall<br/>
&gt;where they were picked up other than the damask wrist piece because I just<br/>
&gt;got that in Najena a couple days ago.  I&#39;m too lazy and not scrolling back<br/>
&gt;through all these emails to see what the other person was or if they<br/>
&gt;mentioned it, because I&#39;m going back to sleep!<br/>

&gt;&gt;A marginal improvement over your cloth might be had by hunting frogloks<br/>
&gt;&gt;in the sewers. Frogloks have netted armor, which is exactly the same as<br/>
&gt;&gt;cloth, but as light or lighter as small sizes - thus you can scrap 1 or<br/>
&gt;&gt;2 units of weight. Probably not worth the bother. It wasn&#39;t for me: I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;&gt;high elf, and thus able to wear small size.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;After this, you must relocate to Freeport. Woven armor is gotten out of<br/>
&gt;&gt;Frogloks too, but you must go down to the Innothule Swamp and their home<br/>
&gt;&gt;of Upper Guk for this. Woven is about equivalent to patchwork, and can<br/>
&gt;&gt;be worn by all races & classes, and is light.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Damask is from Najena mostly, equivalent to leather, and limited to<br/>

&gt;&gt;Then you have Gossamer, which is high level stuff :)<br/>
