<div id="ygrps-yiv-1043121966">Well, that&#39;s it for me.  I wish this could have turned out better, but these<br/>
endless debates are time consuming and accomplish nothing.  If that&#39;s what<br/>
you wish to do Michael, then have fun.  I won&#39;t have my email box filled<br/>
with this any longer.<br/>

&gt; Ok, get ready to feel the burn.  &quot;Solric begins to cast a spell...&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry but the description on onelist.com says:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Eq_wizards [English] [For People Over 13] Similar lists<br/>
&gt; &gt;Forum for Wizards within the lands of Norrath<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does it say Forum for those who only want to discuss how to play the<br/>
wizards<br/>
&gt; and not for those who want to note the problems they see in the class and<br/>
&gt; ideas for new spells?  Didn&#39;t think so.  This is the forum for us wizards.<br/>
&gt; Everything and anything about us.  If you want to only see posts that are<br/>
&gt; about playing the game, then read the subjects and delete (that little key<br/>
&gt; below INSERT and to the left of END) the ones that talk about other<br/>
things.<br/>
&gt; Or go and create your own forum with a more narrow scope, but this forum<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; for everything about wizards so deal with it or unsubscribe.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.S.  I am really not a mean person I just felt like going off.  I know I<br/>
&gt; could have said it in a nicer way so please flame me back to make me feel<br/>
&gt; better about myself :)<br/>

&gt; You are very perceptive Valacian and, at least to me, make a lot of sense.<br/>
&gt; I have stated before, several times, that I am very happy with the wizard<br/>
&gt; class as it stands.  Some ppl don&#39;t agree. Very well, as Valacian<br/>
suggested,<br/>
&gt; lets get by this and focus on what we CAN do.  Lets unlock the mysteries<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; the wizard class as it stands now, not what it could be or what it should<br/>
&gt; be.  That&#39;s what the /feedback feature is for in the game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If we wish to continue to argue the different aspects of the wizard class,<br/>
&gt; then maybe we should make a new email list for that specific focus.  Don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; get me wrong, I like a good debate as much as the next person, but I think<br/>
&gt; Valacian is right, we have the potential of scaring ppl away, of doing the<br/>
&gt; opposite of what this list was created for.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks Valacian for the reality check.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I can feel the wrath now...  but I am ready for the comments.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If I may comment - I don&#39;t believe that us discussing what &#39;would be<br/>
nice&#39;<br/>
&gt; for Wizard spells really helps us be Wizards.  I really believe that if we<br/>
&gt; continue to complain or comment on the apparent lack of spells/problems<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; spells that we have, we are not going to achieve what I believe this<br/>
mailing<br/>
&gt; list was setup for.  This list is to share information between all Wizards<br/>
&gt; within Norrath !  We are going to lose potential and current subscribers<br/>
(me<br/>
&gt; and I&#39;m sure others), thus losing valuable shared information because of<br/>
our<br/>
&gt; ranting and raving about our class.  Remember, Verant is probably not<br/>
&gt; reading this forum..<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My suggestion:  Let&#39;s talk about ideas and share information that will<br/>
&gt; help each other play the class that we chose to play.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So far, the most useful thing I have read (besides Spoiler information)<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; the &#39;bug&#39; that allows our Eye of Zoom to unlock doors.  I think that&#39;s<br/>
great<br/>
