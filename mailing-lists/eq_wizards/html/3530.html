&gt; &gt;Just in case you missed the earlier discussion<br/>
&gt; &gt;(several months back), though, remember that Cazic<br/>
&gt; &gt;Gate is essentially suicide at 24.  Unless Verant<br/>
&gt; &gt;broke down and changed it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Just levitate yourself and get as  high a possible over the ground,<br/>
&gt; floating, when you  stop drifting down. Tele then and have an invis<br/>
&gt; &gt;ready for when you appear. This has always worked for me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yeah, I&#39;ve tried this tactic myself a few times.  I&#39;m pretty sure they still<br/>
&gt; aggro me sometimes though...even at 38, I&#39;ve known them to jump on me.  Of<br/>
&gt; course, this happens more often than not when I&#39;m TPing into Cazic with<br/>
&gt; someone else...you&#39;re more likely displaced a little bit off of the pyramid<br/>
&gt; where the lizzies will jump you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually there is an easy way to gate to cazic. if the roamer jump you ,<br/>
just root it , step back and inviso yourself and run away west.<br/>
i used this gate a bunch of time and never got any trouble.<br/>
