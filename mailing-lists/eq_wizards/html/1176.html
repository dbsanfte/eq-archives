<div id="ygrps-yiv-686660713">you will do fine in Unrest.  Just be sure to stay along the walls and run<br/>
away when you see a train coming.  Tormented Dead and death beetles will do<br/>
you fine...also Gtr Skeletons and dark boned skeletons.<br/>

Subject: [eq_wizards] About Unrest<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello fellow Wizards,<br/>
    I recently hit level 12 and am currently traveling with a group in and<br/>
around Daggnors Cauldron. If we are hunting Goblin Mariners or shamans,my<br/>
spells will hit, however if we bring in a Bosun,my spells are completely<br/>
resisted. Some in the group are getting tired of these and want to go into<br/>
Unrest. Will I be able to damage any MOBS there? The group consists of a 13<br/>
Ranger,14 Cleric,Myself 12 Wizard and a 16 Paladin (I know, the exp gap is<br/>
large and I get minimal exp, but heck...these are friends). Can anyone give<br/>
any pointers about what lie ahead in Unrest for our group. Oh By the<br/>
Way.....the NPC&#39;s at the Camp along the coast do NOT Always help protect<br/>
you...We all learned that the hard way against a Tidal Lord!<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for any help,<br/>
Kueken Mith Marr</div>
