&gt;Yep, I also just got 29. Nice too feel needed with your group Teles. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have not had any problem with fizzles since about level 16, so I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;using Inferno Shock and loving it. I don&#39;t know what good Thunder Strike<br/>
&gt;is, though. Is it just useless?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Too bad I failed all my research attempts for level 29 spells. But I<br/>
&gt;think I&#39;ll probably keep using column of Lightning as my AE anyway.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No fizzles at all?  wow.  I think I maxed out my Evocation specialization <br/>
and I still get fizzles now and again.  I figure I&#39;m not going to use the <br/>
new DD until 30.  I find it more efficient to use the frost shock for now <br/>
because we can cast it soo much more at this point.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it was a real nice surprise, but I was able to make my 29lvl AE spells <br/>
when I was 24!  I think I really lucked out on that one.  So I was holding <br/>
it in the bank all this time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not looking forward to &quot;hell-level&quot; are you?  ;P<br/>
