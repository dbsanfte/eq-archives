<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126122983">Phil, I would save it up for your next level to be honest.  The spells are <br/>
increasingly more expensive as you go.  We don&#39;t get much great armor as <br/>
wizards and I just think keeping it around would be more prudent right now, <br/>
maybe someone will be selling a fine steel staff or a runed totem staff <br/>
that you hear.. those would be good buys if reasonable.  I have 50pp in the <br/>
bank and am saving up til I hit my next level to purchase spells personally.<br/>

&gt;If this question isn&#39;t appropriate for this list, let me apologize in<br/>
&gt;advance.... I don&#39;t see many questions like it....<br/>
&gt;Anyway,<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m a lvl 12 Gnome wizard, have cloth armor, worn great staff, Sr.<br/>
&gt;Apprentice Robe and pretty much all the spells that I want (that I can buy).<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve got 25 plat or so in the bank and don&#39;t know what to spend it<br/>
&gt;on....invest in better armor? better staff? magic items? if so, what? don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;know what&#39;s smartest. Would very much appreciate any advice anyone can give<br/>
&gt;me that wish&#39;s they&#39;d bought or didn&#39;t buy at my level. Thanx for any help<br/>
&gt;you can give me.<br/>
