<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501154099">I disagree.  All of the spells, when right clicked upon list the amount of<br/>
mana that they use.  It is silly to say, this spell requires 10 mana per<br/>
cast, but hey, we are only gonna tell you what percentage of your limit you<br/>
have with this nifty colored bar thing.  The other thing to consider is that<br/>
all RPG&#39;s that I have seen/played/heard of are very numerically based.  All<br/>
of them represent stats as numbers, and it just doesn&#39;t feel like a proper<br/>
RPG unless this detail is available to me.<br/>

&gt; To answer your question about mana this is the one and only answer for ya.<br/>
This is<br/>
&gt; an RPG.  In other words pretend it&#39;s your life.  You ARE this wizard and<br/>
in real<br/>
&gt; life you wouldn&#39;t be saying OH Hold Up &lt;insert name here&gt; I only have 10<br/>
mana left.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You just wouldn&#39;t say that you dont have a clue how much mana you have<br/>
you&#39;d just<br/>
&gt; say &quot;wait a second I am feeling exhausted I need to regen some mana&quot;<br/>
&gt; But I do believe it&#39;s unfair that they get to see their HP I personally<br/>
think they<br/>
&gt; should take hp numbers out also.  Because this game is not meant to be<br/>
numerical<br/>
&gt; thus the reason why they didnt include Mana # stam # exp # or skills #<br/>
&gt; you just wouldnt know that you could only run 15 more feet youd know your<br/>
tired and<br/>
&gt; have jkust a lil bit left in ya or how much exp you needed to become<br/>
better youd<br/>
&gt; learn from doing it not saying oh i need to change the oil in my car 3<br/>
more times<br/>
&gt; to be a MASTER oil changer<br/>
&gt; I hope this has enlightened you Please respond back. I love to hear others<br/>
&gt; opinions.<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
