<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043149417"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;By the way, did you do the Thex dagger quest alone, or with a<br/>
&gt;friend?  What level do you recommend?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I did it with a friend.  The big issue is that you have to give an <br/>
item to one NPC and then make it back to another NPC in time before it <br/>
disappears.  My partner made it back in time so we didn&#39;t have to do the <br/>
quest twice over....  just run as fast as you can and you should have ample <br/>
time.  Graffe.com says there is a new twist to it though......*shrug*<br/>
