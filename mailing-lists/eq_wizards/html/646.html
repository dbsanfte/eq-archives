<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029694832">Well I think they have taken some of this in to consideration because it<br/>
seems they added somehting new to last nights patch.  During the game last<br/>
night I received a message while in combat taht stated &quot;You regained<br/>
concentration&quot; and it cast my spells after it told me I lost concentration.<br/>
Could be the first steps...?  Who knows.<br/>
