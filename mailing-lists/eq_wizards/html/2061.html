<div id="ygrps-yiv-419405578">If anything, these suggestions may help verant make our class more<br/>
unique for the expansion. Who knows, maybe they got all the spells lined<br/>
up for us already:<br/>
<br/>
lvl 55- blast, ae blast, teleport, Gooey feet<br/>
lvl 60- blast, ae blast, teleport, Major Major Major Shielding V<br/>
lvl 65- blast, ae blast, teleport, super duper wow look at this sight<br/>
<br/>
...you get the picture ( yeah, the blast animations all look like fire<br/>
bolt )<br/>
<br/>
If we send these changes on, maybe level 50 wizards could have<br/>
familiars. I mean, at that level, and with that kind of power, theres NO<br/>
LIMIT to the stuff we could accomplish. We&#39;re only limited by Verants<br/>
imagination. Scratch that. We&#39;re limited by OUR imagination, or we just<br/>
won&#39;t play :P<br/>

&gt; Dear Brothers and Sisters,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After reading all the petitions, suggestions and well thought improvements to our classes I got but one thing to say, dream on :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Verant thinks we are overpowered, and quite frankly at higher levels we are devastating.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m currently level 31 and *I* can solo very well, so do NOT lose that will, we DO get better and the level is called TWENTY NINE (29).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Would like to coment on a few things.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) Groups, we can&#39;t hit red.  After level 29 or so you wont get close to reds, not even in a full party. :) So, its only a low mid level thing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2) Root/Enstill.  Remember when you got root at level 4 and it was horrible ? Remember how it got better at level 8 ? Same thing with Enstill, at 26+ it gets MUCH better.  Sure, you would recast in battle, but it works great.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3) SoW, Speed Spells.  At level 24 or so you don&#39;t need this, you can teleport pretty much everywhere except planes.  If you need to run, just keep rooting and flee or just buy yourself SoW for a plat or so, dont ask, OFFER the plat.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 4) Petitions to Verant, utility spells ? Perhaps, anything that will make us better in combat, forget it.  We are already devastating.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 5) And Most Important.  Level 20-23 SUCKS !!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can ALMOST solo yellow Giants, HANG IN THERE !<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good luck my friends.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
