I don&#39;t like your tactics and I would harass you till you quit if you did<br/>
that too me, but to each his own.   All I have to say is to the others that<br/>
just read this... Please don&#39;t do this.  His actions are exactly why we can<br/>
never find a group.  He is propagating his own problems.  If your in a group<br/>
with this happening might I suggest one thing.  Line your self up opposite<br/>
the stealer and cast your weakest shock spell on a non engaged MOB that is a<br/>
helper to the one that your stealer is fighting (another bandit) and zap...<br/>
the bandit will tag your stealer on his way to you and your stealer has two<br/>
nasties he has to deal with)  (I apologize ahead of time but I was very mad<br/>
at this post)<br/>

&gt; I probably will get flamed for this for sure, but who cares.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I made it all the way to lvl 12 as an erudite wizard.   I found that<br/>
leveling<br/>
&gt; was very slow indeed and it was getting really boring camping with my<br/>
groups<br/>
&gt; till the sun comes up.   However, i was on a few days ago in the morning<br/>
and my<br/>
&gt; regular group wasn&#39;t on.  I shouted for about 30 min and no one wanted to<br/>
join<br/>
&gt; up with me for bandit hunting.  Out of boredom, i went down to the bandit<br/>
camps<br/>
&gt; to see if i can find a group there(West karanas on top of Hill).  I found<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; group of 6 there camping the bandits so i just sat around shouting for<br/>
groups<br/>
&gt; once again. But while those guys were fighting the bandits, i thought, hey<br/>
might<br/>
&gt; as well try to see if i can kill one solo, if i can&#39;t, then they will<br/>
probably<br/>
&gt; help me anyways.  I attacked one bandit and killedh im in 3 shots with<br/>
Shock of<br/>
&gt; Lightning.  and WOW ! so much XP !!!   so i just kept going.  I got around<br/>
10-15<br/>
&gt; pp in 30 min and gained 1 bubble of xp. normall i gain 1 bubble in 6-8<br/>
hours of<br/>
&gt; playing.   FINALLY ! i found how to have fun with my wizard and not be the<br/>
lamer<br/>
&gt; that spent all his time trying to group and get shitty XP cuz of the split<br/>
&gt; between members !!   who cares if they think i am a kill stealer, its not<br/>
like<br/>
&gt; they can do anything about it HAHAHA.  too bad for them that they wont<br/>
group<br/>
&gt; with me.  I also found some wizards are really stupid, the group  of 6 i<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; stealing from had a lvl 14 wizard and a lvl 11 wizard. and none of them<br/>
could<br/>
&gt; stop me from stealing. its odd but true... ppl just don&#39;t think.. oh<br/>
well.. i<br/>
&gt; hope you all try to just have fun and not give a shit what other ppl think<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; once.   then you might find why Varent say we are a balanced race, i<br/>
personally<br/>
&gt; think we were made to give grief to others heehhe.. j/k   I personally<br/>
think we<br/>
&gt; should be changed to Erudite Magical Theives hehe..<br/>
