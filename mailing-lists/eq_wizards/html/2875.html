<div id="ygrps-yiv-686743443">Well, I was away for 5 days for gencon, and was hoping that they figured<br/>
out something with the practice research books / runes.  I just tried it<br/>
tonite for the first time, and got that &quot;these items dont combine&quot;<br/>
message.  Anyone at ALL have luck with this ever, or any clue if verant<br/>
even knows its bugged?<br/>
