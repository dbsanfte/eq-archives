<b>Subject:</b> What is the best way to raise faction level with the Merchants of Felwithe? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-66230313">Hello, fellow Wizards!<br/>
<br/>
Several weeks ago I participated in a guild war and slew a High Elf not knowing that there would be a faction hit as a result. Well, I can no longer purchase or sell items in Felwithe. I&#39;ve tried everything that I know of to improve my faction standing with the Merchants there, but to no avail. My faction standing with the guards is &quot;amiable&quot; -- It is with the &quot;Merchants&quot; that I need a faction adjustment. Does anyone have any ideas? Suggestions? Personal experience? Would appreciate any and all advice.<br/>
