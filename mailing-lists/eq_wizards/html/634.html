&gt;Subject: Abandoning ship<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Since my groups tend to have a high ratio of tanks to spellcasters, I<br/>
&gt;find myself in an interesting position, and I was wondering what<br/>
&gt;everyone else&#39;s ideas of proper etiquette were regarding gate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;First is easy.  You all ran 20 min to your fav kill spot.  Played for<br/>
&gt;hours of fun.  Night is over.  Do you gate home, leaving your tanks to<br/>
&gt;run thru what might end up being hostile areas (but usually aren&#39;t), or<br/>
&gt;do you run with them?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2nd is harder.  Basically, do you die with your party, or abandon them<br/>
&gt;when there is trouble?  All of this talk of shadowstep gate has made me<br/>
&gt;think Im in the minority here.  My tanks actually tell me they expect to<br/>
&gt;die so I can live, if it comes to that.  BUT - I don&#39;t think its right<br/>
&gt;to leave them. Am I doing them a disservice ?  I would rather try one<br/>
&gt;more time to get that root off on the MOB killing them so we can all<br/>
&gt;live (or die) together.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;#2 has lead me to doing a LOT more solo fighting, cause I hate the idea<br/>
&gt;of either possiblity actually!<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Abandon ship, run, gate, zone or otherwise haul butt.  The tanks know your<br/>
worthless in melee, and if you&#39;ve given it your best shot, they would MUCH<br/>
rather see you survive than to see you die needlessly.<br/>
<br/>
When I played a tank, if I knew the end was near, I told everyone to<br/>
zone... its useless for an entire party to die, when the deaths can be<br/>
limited to just 1 or 2 individuals.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never had the first bit of qualm about running...  Your tanks will<br/>
actually feel better if you get away, because at least they didn&#39;t die for<br/>
nothing.<br/>
