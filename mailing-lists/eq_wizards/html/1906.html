<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106365693">Greetings all,<br/>
<br/>
While hunting Rathe Lake I stumbled upon an odd find. It is a magical item<br/>
called the &quot;Eye of Disvan&quot;. I have performed many tests on the item and as<br/>
of yet it&#39;s magical properties elude me.<br/>
It is translucent to look upon and round, much like a crystal ball. <br/>
Have any of ye gatherers of knowledge out there heard about such an item?<br/>
Any help in solving the mystery of this Lore Item would be greatly<br/>
appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
My thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Mirrin of the Nife.</div>
