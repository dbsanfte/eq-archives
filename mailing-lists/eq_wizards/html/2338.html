this is the _point_ of the game) if you can excape griffons by sitting (but<br/>
only in a certian spot) this is probably a bug... and you can&#39;t &quot;use&quot; bugs<br/>
like tools... ie(don&#39;t attack griffons and be in invulnerable spot...) this<br/>
is cheating... because if you ever saw a griffon in real life... it would<br/>
be the _last time_ you ever saw one _even_ if you were standing in the<br/>
&quot;safe spot&quot;<br/>

How about NPC based exploits.  I had a good friend die last night because<br/>
the aqua-goblin wizard he was fleeing from was pegging him with arrows<br/>
fired through a mountain.  Can non-named NPC wizards even use bows (much<br/>
less those firing vorpal-arrows)?  This same friend has also died from<br/>
unprovoked critters attacking through the walls of shops.   <br/>
<br/>
I was reading last week where someone was 500+ feet up in a tree and being<br/>
attacked by a lion on the ground.  The lion was hitting him and doing<br/>
damage... from 500+ vertical feet!  Okay, I can see what Verant was trying<br/>
to do with this.  They didn&#39;t want people in trees attacking from safty.<br/>
We *should* be able to do this though!  We&#39;ve got got bigger brains and<br/>
opposable thumbs.  A far better solution would be to have the critter run<br/>
like hell and to avoid the area in the future.  Or put in a leopard or a<br/>
cougar, something that can climb trees, into the game (though in reality,<br/>
these would probably run like the dickens too).<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t personnally died this way, so I won&#39;t use the Griffon vs Safespot<br/>
exploit the other guy was mentioning.  The first time I do however, I plan<br/>
to head out there and start blasting as a form of protest.  Consider it<br/>
cheating, or making up exp lost to an unfairly demise, or what have you.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

a bug in everquest to your advantage.<br/>
 Who cares if it&#39;s considered an exploit or not. My rule of thimb is: &quot;If<br/>
it works for you and the game allows it, then do it!&quot;  If it&#39;s considered<br/>
an exploit then don&#39;t tell anyone.  Basically an &quot;Exploit&quot; is anything that<br/>
is considered morally wrong.  Thievery is morally wrong but the game allows<br/>
it.  Just don&#39;t brag about your &quot;exploits&quot; and its&#39; ok.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I don&#39;t agree with his rule of thumb, &quot;If it&#39;s lets you, do it&quot;.<br/>
Hell, a couple of levels ago I stopped rooting snakes because they look so<br/>
pitiful stuck to the ground while I was blasting.  But if a critter cheats<br/>
me and I find a way to cheat it back, I&#39;m gonna do it.<br/>
