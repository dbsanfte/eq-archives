<b>Subject:</b> Re: Piercing or blunt? (Q about weapon skill) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2052345767">Question: what is the formula for max weapon skills for us wizards?  I think<br/>
the formula for offense skill is (level * 4) and defense skill is ((level<br/>
*4) + 4).  Please correct me if I am wrong on those.<br/>
<br/>
As to your skills increasing slowly, that is strange.  When my ranger got to<br/>
about level 17 and he got a screaming mace, his 1h blunt skill was 0.  I<br/>
went to unrest and got permission from the groups there to get some whacks<br/>
in on the mobs they were fighting (many of which were white/black or yellow<br/>
cons).  It took me a while, but skill steadily improved from 0 all the way<br/>
to max of 100 at level 19.  Playing my wizard I have really not noticed<br/>
faster weapon skill gain than what my ranger had (his int was only 80 or<br/>
something).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the advice though.  I am level 10 now and had started with my<br/>
dagger, but moved to 2h blunt and am trying to max that (I asked about the<br/>
formulas cause I don&#39;t know when I will max without).<br/>

This is an EXCELLENT strategy.<br/>
However, you have GOT to do this early in your career.  If you have never<br/>
used a 2H Blunt weapon and then begin using it at Level 16, you will quickly<br/>
be frustrated at the lack of improvement in that skill.  (I know from<br/>
experience)  It won&#39;t take long before you&#39;ll be wondering whether to go<br/>
back to your maxed newbie attack skill (likely piercing) or going to spend a<br/>
whole bunch of practice points to improve it enough to even hit anything.  <br/>
<br/>
I have seen a ton of threads on message boards describing the problem I am<br/>
speaking about above.  There really appears to be a bug or design flaw here.<br/>
For example, last night I basically meleed for 4 hours straight because we<br/>
had a very efficient group fighting mostly blues which meant very little<br/>
downtime. (with a Ranger pulling constantly)   My 2H Blunt skill improved<br/>
once and I was actually surprised to see it.  I am a Lvl 17 Wiz with my 2H<br/>
Blunt skill at 20.  With an INT of 140, and the skill being so low, you&#39;d<br/>
think it would improve very rapidly like the newbie days.   <br/>
<br/>
I really wish I had realized to try and max all three skills from the very<br/>
beginning because it sure seemed easy to do back then.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, If you want to just focus on two skills instead of three, the two<br/>
primary skills would unarguably be Piercing and 2H Blunt.  I have done a lot<br/>
of research on weapons, and I haven&#39;t found one 1H Blunt weapon that you<br/>
would likely choose over one of the other two weapon types available to you<br/>
at most levels. (assuming there&#39;s not a hidden gem somewhere)<br/>

		With the high intelligence of a wizard it is very easy to<br/>
max out all three<br/>
		(pierce, 1&2H Blunt).  At the start of a new level I start<br/>
off with my great<br/>
		staff, then I move on to my trusty cracked staff, and I<br/>
finish off the level<br/>
		with my snake fang.  During level 4 and 5 I tried to work on<br/>
my hand2hand, but<br/>
		alas I am not a monk.  Also something I&#39;ve noticed, you can<br/>
improve on your<br/>
		throwing skills by attacking &quot;con green&quot; mobs.  The simple<br/>
reason I go through<br/>
		all of this is because sooner or later Verant will probably<br/>
introduce new<br/>
		weapons to the game, and whatever skill it uses, I want to<br/>
be ready.<br/>
