<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037848804">According to Cristie:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Good point.. hadn&#39;t thought of that but it makes perfect sense.  Maybe the <br/>
&gt; video card companies should just send everyone a great  400 meg 3d <br/>
&gt; card...heh.. don&#39;t we wish...wonder if they will ever make something like <br/>
&gt; that in our lifetime... I suppose 3d would be a thing of the past at that <br/>
&gt; point...probably just have little bitty people in our box to do the stuff <br/>
&gt; for us.  Freaky thought.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is also the point of the Christmas (I think) expansion set. One of<br/>
the thing they said is that they fully expect 3D cards to have improved<br/>
a lot by the time, so the lower end will rise.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, just color swap some effects, and you get a large palette of<br/>
effects. No programming at all :)<br/>
