<b>Subject:</b> Recovering corpse on Erudin <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094673375">Can anyone give me advice on how to recover my corpse? I am a human wizard<br/>
level 8 and traveled to Erudin for the first time, where I was attacked by<br/>
an NPC necro in Toxxulia. I can&#39;t even get near my corpse again, which was<br/>
teleported into a building or something (a &quot;beguile&quot; spell was cast on me,<br/>
when it wore off the NPC killed me). Any help GREATLY appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
