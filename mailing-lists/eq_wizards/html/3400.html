<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Cloak, I&#39;ve been camping crocs in Guk but haven&#39;t found one yet.  The <br/>
&gt;&gt;staff<br/>
&gt;&gt;of wheel rod stories kinda scare me so I might wait till I can find a <br/>
&gt;&gt;group<br/>
&gt;&gt;to do that one.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;You won&#39;t. Not for all of them. The only ones who would help you are<br/>
&gt;real high levels who know lower guk and who can pull the deepwater &gt;gobs<br/>
&gt;out of the way in oasis while you get the rod. All the other rods are<br/>
&gt;easy. A group of your level would only end up dead. At best, someone<br/>
&gt;will die and you will get away with the rod.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh no...I was talking about the rune of scale for the Runescale cloak?   I <br/>
understand it was supposed to be carried by saltwater crocs in the back <br/>
regions of Upper Guk?  Sure hope I&#39;m camping the right spot hehe.<br/>
But anyway, I think I&#39;ll try do the Staff of Wheel over this weekend.  I&#39;ve <br/>
been reading the adventures of people on the Graffe site lately...really <br/>
interesting the different ways people have been doing this quest. =)<br/>
