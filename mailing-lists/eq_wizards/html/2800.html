<b>Subject:</b> Re: Some loot sources <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-856269993">I have found that a good loot source was fire-beetle eyes.  They sell for<br/>
nearly 2 and a half silver, and newbie often kill them for the xp and leave<br/>
the bodies lying around.  If you go to North Ro zone, near Freeport, and<br/>
just stay in the newbie area near the inn (do not go in the desert) you will<br/>
find an absolute abundance of fire beetles and skeletons.  A lot of times<br/>
one beetle will give you two eyes, and the bone chips from the skeletons<br/>
bring in another 2 silver.  And sometimes the skeletons have weapons,<br/>
including the cracked staff, which you can sell for 1 platinum.  2 silver<br/>
doesn&#39;t really sound like a lot, but there are SO many beetles there that<br/>
you can easily rake in some coin there.<br/>
<br/>
The other big cash source is willowisps, but you will be hard-pressed to<br/>
kill them with your spells at level 8.  But their loot is usually gold, plus<br/>
a lightstone that you can sell for platinum to players.<br/>
<br/>
One other place you can try, although you should probably wait until level<br/>
10 or so, and bring a partner, is in the ocean of tears.  Take the ship out<br/>
from Freeport.  Before you go, get someone to bind you right outside the<br/>
bank.  Then take the ship out toward Faywder.  Right before it zones into<br/>
Butcherblock, it passes between some small island-rocks with aqua goblins.<br/>
Hop off the ship and swim to the rocks.  You and your partner can take on<br/>
the goblins.  Their spawn points are clear, they spawn quickly, and each one<br/>
will give you a bow and some arrows.  Each bow sells for about 2 and a half<br/>
gold, and the arrows are 7cp each, I think.  Bring some backpacks, and kill<br/>
gobs until the packs are full.  You will be encumbered, but it won&#39;t matter<br/>
because you can gate back to the bank in Freeport.  You&#39;ll pull in about 5<br/>
plat per trip that way, and level from the gobs pretty well, too.  Just<br/>
don&#39;t attack the sirens on the rocks.  They will leave you alone if you<br/>
don&#39;t attack them.<br/>
<br/>
In case your friends can&#39;t gate, they can wait in the water and, when they<br/>
see the ship approach, swim up to it and let it run into them.  They will<br/>
pop up right on the deck and can sail back along with the ship.<br/>
<br/>
My final suggestion is to get a good group together and hunt in Blackburrow<br/>
or Paw.  The gnolls have enough cash to keep everyone happy.<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting!<br/>

&gt; I have a little problem,  hop you could help me out,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m and Erudit ,  I reached lvl 8 yesterday and I can&#39;t buy any spell lvl<br/>
3<br/>
&gt; cause I miss money.   Everything I kill don&#39;t give me enough money.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m hunting around Queynos Hill,  BB,  West Karana and I barely reach 60<br/>
&gt; gold in bank,  I really don&#39;t see how to make more money and lvl 3 spells<br/>
&gt; are something like 4 or 5 platinum.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; can you give me any advice on how to make more money disgarding XP for<br/>
now.<br/>
&gt; I was told the Kerra Islan is a good place so I made the trip back to<br/>
erudin<br/>
&gt; but I couldn&#39;t find anybody in the Island and nobody at Erudin to organize<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; group to the Island. It seems like nobody knows Kerra ...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you in advance for your help<br/>
&gt;<br/>
