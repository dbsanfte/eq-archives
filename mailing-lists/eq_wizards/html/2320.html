<b>Subject:</b> Thoughts on Kill Stealing <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-705507407">To me, kill stealers are nothing but lowly thieves who take unfair advantage of their ability to cast greater damage. To my way of thinking, there is no excuse for kill stealing whatsoever and those who do, bring a very bad rep to the Wizard&#39;s class. All of my friends look negatively upon kill stealers and so do I -- and we &quot;remember&quot; who they are.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re rationale for kill stealing is to simply &quot;powergame&quot; or to avoid boredom while gaining exp, then you&#39;ve chosen the wrong class. Just try putting yourself in the other players&#39; shoes. How would you feel if you were risking life and limb to gain some exp only to have some schmuck come along who happens to have the ability to cast and hit at a higher damage level than you?<br/>
<br/>
Kill stealing wizards will suffer in the long run. As the old saying goes, &quot;What goes around, comes around.&quot; Karma exists! There is mystical justice at play in Norrath and those who distort the &quot;balance&quot; will suffer the consequences.<br/>
