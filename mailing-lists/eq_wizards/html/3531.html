<b>Subject:</b> Brain Bite - City of Mist spawn <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639646708">Last Sunday, my guild had a raid in City of Mist consisting of 3 groups<br/>
of 45th - 55th levels.  We cleared most of the second level where the<br/>
human skeleton is, but he was not up.  Is there a way to get him to<br/>
spawn?  Is there a placeholder?  Was kind of frustrating to finally make<br/>
it in that far and then he is not even there.  I even had someone in FV<br/>
restart the quest to see if that would make him spawn, but it did not<br/>
work.  Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Also, regarding the buffed Lord.  There are actually two different Lords<br/>
that can spawn when you kill the Reavers.  One is similar to a Reaver<br/>
(100% magic resistant and did not cast) and the other is very nasty,<br/>
wiped out the whole group in about 20 seconds.<br/>
