<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971130608">For a 12 lv i found that PAW is ideal place. South karanas is not a too<br/>
dangerus place and here you can find also a centour village to sell goods,<br/>
In paw there are some nice places where snakes spawn they dont group and<br/>
you can sit in their nest killing it one after another as they spawn, also<br/>
dungeon is not too crowded and many times a party will accept a wizard as<br/>
root machine to help against trains. It is excelent dungeon to solo ans to<br/>
group play. <br/>
<br/>
p.s. im now lv 15 and im in highold pass hunting orcs, very interesting and<br/>
specific place requiring all diferent tactics and here realy wizards have<br/>
some worth ehehehe.<br/>

&gt;Ok, i have a question. I played a wizard in the beta of this game, i got the <br/>
&gt;game same day as it came out. I&#39;ve been playing in the qeynos area for these <br/>
&gt;past months and now i moved to freeport. I&#39;ve noticed so many people that <br/>
&gt;are in their 20&#39;s in levels even 30&#39;s. I&#39;m only at level 12 and struggling <br/>
&gt;to go up from here. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s that most of the players are <br/>
&gt;teenagers who play all the time since it&#39;s summer vacation or people just <br/>
&gt;don&#39;t have lives but i play as much as my life let&#39;s me, as long as it <br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t interfere with work or hanging out on the weekends and i seem to go <br/>
&gt;up so slow. I&#39;m hunting now in the commonlands, I like to play solo and play <br/>
&gt;in groups when i get a chance if I&#39;m in the mood. Can someone tell me a good <br/>
&gt;hunting spot or what&#39;s going on cause this is really starting to stress me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thx,<br/>
