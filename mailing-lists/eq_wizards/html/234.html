<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126184508">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anyone has seen the effect of having (or not having)<br/>
high intelligence.  I kinda messed up and didn&#39;t really think through on<br/>
what I should distribute my bonus points to.  I have around 104 int, and<br/>
put the rest of the bonus points in strength and some other, i don&#39;t<br/>
remember.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, I&#39;m at lvl 9, and was thinking of maybe starting over, while<br/>
I&#39;m at a fairly low level.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
