<div id="ygrps-yiv-379809484">Okay, for one I&#39;m sick of this shit about buggy software and weak ass Wizards.  I tell you what, I mudded for many a year and in comparison this game has its flaws, spells, combat etc.  On the other hand I see active fixes once a week if not more.  The environment here that Verant and company have created is the best in existence, bar none.  None I say, this place is the shit.  Beutiful outdoors as well as mobs and races.  This is fuckin unreal, and with the almost no lag, damn i lagged more on a text based mud.. this world is incredible.  What the hell are you people talkin about bugged.  Jesus!  think windows 98 has any flaws, oh well it was just created by the largest richest company on the face of the fuckin planet.  Give it a rest.<br/>
<br/>
Also now that you have me goin, the Wizard class rocks if it is not the single greatest class in the game to you, you need to be piss tested cuz yer on drugs.. heh.  I love my Wiz and at times I get pissed because of this or that but man at times.. RAW POWER!! and no one can stop it.  Nothin better than goin to Highhold Pass and someone else steal killing from you.  Man do they cry when you get your timing down and they only get about 2 out of 10 kills.. *cackle*<br/>
<br/>
Moral is give the guys some credit for creating a state of the art.. the very best entertainment that your dollar can buy, and lay off all the crying about bugs and bugless software.. right.<br/>
