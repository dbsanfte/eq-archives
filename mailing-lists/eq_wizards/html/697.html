get, everything up to this point was almost equivelant to a magician or an<br/>
enchanter. It just gets better from here on out.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Hey as a wizard I have always run from Corflunk, but last night I saw him<br/>
coming down the path at me and I was all alone, but I said &quot;What the hell I<br/>
am 12th now!&quot;<br/>
and I kicked his tail.�� Even melee!! Like 3 shock of lighnting and a few<br/>
staff blows and DEAD ogre.� hehe he hardly touched me!�� Anyway where do I<br/>
need to go now that I have his head?�� I mean where do I get the quest?<br/>
�<br/>
Thanks<br/>
�<br/>
P.S.� I love Shock of lightning!<br/>
