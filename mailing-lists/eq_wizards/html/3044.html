<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482123951">I have something i want to try some time.  I want to put an item on a bat<br/>
and then tell all the newbies, ro go find it.  Who ever brings me the item<br/>
will get a reward.  Myabe a tentacle whip for the fighter typs or my water<br/>
crystal staff for the casters.  Ot could be fun.  The other night I was<br/>
bored and was going through teh Najena dungeon arming the skels with all the<br/>
old rusty weapond I had found earler.  I even gave one a tentacle whip to<br/>
see if hed use it.. He did and it looked cool.  I killed that one to get my<br/>
whip back</div>
