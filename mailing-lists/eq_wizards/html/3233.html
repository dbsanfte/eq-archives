On The Rathe server, High Quality Bear Pelts sell to other PCs for 10p each and High Quality Cat/Wolf pelts sell for 1p.  I would try for at least this much if you can.  The High Quality Bear pelts are in high demand because many people want 10 slot backpacks (which themselves can be sold for over 100p).<br/>

&gt; I have a fang dagger from an asp. Was going cracked staff for awhile till I saw that the dagger does better damage.<br/>

&gt; Thank you for the advice. I appreciate it. :)<br/>

&gt; Last night I met a group of higher levels (30ish) and got to joking with one of them. He gave me a raw silk cloak out of the blue! So I gave him a HQ bear skin and after some quick negotiations with his friends, he offered to buy all the other quality pelts I had in the bank. I didnt know the &#39;market value&#39; so just said whatever he felt was right, and got 30 plat out of it for 8 pelts. More than Ive EVER had before in my life! Any future pelts I catch, Im to let him know. This is what I love about EQ.<br/>

&gt; A pity theres no Gate to Other Server spell. Wouldnt that be something? :)<br/>
