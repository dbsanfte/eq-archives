&gt;		&gt;Playing my wizard I have really not noticed<br/>
&gt;		&gt;faster weapon skill gain than what my ranger had (his int<br/>
&gt;was only 80 or<br/>
&gt;		&gt;something).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well INT is definitely supposed to mean faster learning.  But in the<br/>
&gt;scenario of meleeing, in general it may not be much of a difference when you<br/>
&gt;do it so much.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;		&gt;As to your skills increasing slowly, that is strange.  When<br/>
&gt;my ranger got to<br/>
&gt;		&gt;about level 17 and he got a screaming mace, his 1h blunt<br/>
&gt;skill was 0.  I<br/>
&gt;		&gt;went to unrest and got permission from the groups there to<br/>
&gt;get some whacks<br/>
&gt;		&gt;in on the mobs they were fighting (many of which were<br/>
&gt;white/black or yellow<br/>
&gt;		&gt;cons).  It took me a while, but skill steadily improved<br/>
&gt;from 0 all the way<br/>
&gt;		&gt;to max of 100 at level 19. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That is why I suggested there is a bug or design flaw.  The only common<br/>
&gt;thread of all the complaints on message boards is they were all Level 14 or<br/>
&gt;higher mage classes using the 2H Blunt (Runed Totem Staff) skill for the<br/>
&gt;first time and it was hardly improving at all, even though they were at 0!!<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve had my RTS for three levels now and the only reason I am at skill of 20<br/>
&gt;on 2H Blunt is because I pumped 15 practice points into it after spending a<br/>
&gt;whole level of going nowhere with that skill.  Something&#39;s not right here.<br/>
