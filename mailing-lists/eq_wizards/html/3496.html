<div id="ygrps-yiv-359176790">i&#39;ve been doing the dwarves lately and without sow or jboots i wouldn&#39;t dare<br/>
solo them, even at 37.  they hit for 90+ and have a fair amount of hit<br/>
points.  i did do the ones at the stones and the pair in front of kaladim<br/>
with a level 42 enchanter.  its a lot easier when she has one charmed and<br/>
after the pet wins its almost dead or very hurt itself.  that&#39;s my only<br/>
experience with the dwarves so far.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I am currently level 34, and I am almost level 35. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Without getting into the debate about whether<br/>
&gt; &gt; Wizards should or should not solo, does anyone know<br/>
&gt; &gt; if I can solo the dwarves at the BB dock at level<br/>
&gt; &gt; 35?  I have killed them in a group and I have seen<br/>
&gt; &gt; level 35 pet classes soloing them, but I am not sure<br/>
&gt; &gt; if a wizzie can solo them at 35.  Anyone soloed them<br/>
&gt; &gt; at 35? If not, has anyone soloed them?  If so, what<br/>
&gt; &gt; level?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks,<br/>
