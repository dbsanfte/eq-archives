for me.  Im trying my hand at something else now. But id love tot rade tips <br/>
and tricks of what I did. My original intentions was to be a wizard and I <br/>
played him to 15 and got  bored of grouping Im not much with groups if people <br/>
I dont know.  I really only group with friends, you tend not to die as <br/>
much...So I started a necro and played him to 24 and then leveld my wizard a <br/>
bit....I decided to play my necro luckily I was on a brand new server...bnd I <br/>
was high level on server....So I got all hunting spots to me and a select <br/>
few...nowadays we have to share...but it was great...I can give ya guys where <br/>
we hunted all the time if ya want.for some tips... level 1 through 5 theres a <br/>
secret spot in ak anon with lotsa newbie stuff where I hunted cause no one <br/>
else knows about it....5 to 8 I had to do jobolds and group....8 to 12 took <br/>
me a day to do all you had to do was hunt in valley solo fairly easy ...12 to <br/>
20 was in oasis like most people....20 to 24 was in lake rathe at aviak <br/>
gaurds...24 to 34 was in south karanas....and the next levels like 34 to 46 <br/>
were spectres then we just item hunted and I gained my xp from that.</div>
