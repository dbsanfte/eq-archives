<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552864141">Greetings and Good day.<br/>
<br/>
I am Gaedin, a 5th level High Elf Wizard on Veeshan who spends his days <br/>
wandering around Kelethin sniping at Orc Centurions.  I do actually have a <br/>
question.  Could one of you 8+ levelers out there tell me which Rank 3 <br/>
scrolls are worth buying?  <br/>
<br/>
Many Thanks and drop me a line sometime if you want to go hunting...</div>
