<div id="ygrps-yiv-952323640">Actually I don&#39;t believe it was done to make PVP players harder but to protect <br/>
those who choose not to PVP.  I can understand why you say these things <br/>
make your lives harder tho.  However, I have to say that I support Verant on this <br/>
one.. there are just too many jerks out there who give PVP a bad name with <br/>
their antics.<br/>
