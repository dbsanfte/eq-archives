 </span></blockquote>I dont agree with this becouse your solution will ruin all structure on wich<br/>
game is based to beter explain it i can say that n online RPG games there<br/>
are 2<br/>
approachs to class solution one is skill based where you develop what skills<br/>
you wish like in UO where this is too free so all go around with a so<br/>
called GM<br/>
warriors-mages and EQ approach based on a true class where this class is so<br/>
hard coded that you dont have too much possibility to go out of a strict role<br/>
wich you choose. <br/>
 Verant chose this aproach to create some very diferent classes wich are in<br/>
most cases oriented to group play, they balanced it by necesary time to gain<br/>
final level 50. some classes are more powerfull on early levels  and are week<br/>
later but all are created around idea that in similar time can reach final<br/>
level. Early levels are lower of 20 from 20 to 40 are mid levels and from<br/>
40 to<br/>
50 are high levels. And a diference of any class with diferent stiles of play<br/>
give you very god replayability only what i must admit is that for changing<br/>
class when you have played it 1 year is realy hard to start over for another 1<br/>
year or more only to see what you have alredy seen in new role.<br/>
<br/>
PS. wizard have negative hit on xp not so big as multi class but not much<br/>
lower<br/>
if a multi have a 25 % wizard is i think something like 10 - 15%. <br/>

&gt; I have never played a Necro (not in my roleplaying style), but from what<br/>
&gt; people say, they are fairly well rounded and in game terms they provide a<br/>
&gt; nice roleplaying oppurtunity and fill a void for &quot;evil misunderstood&quot; type<br/>
&gt; class, like the shadowknight.<br/>
&gt; �<br/>
&gt; Of course the Magic-User Class would have to have some spells removed, but a<br/>
&gt; lot of the spells are also common.<br/>
&gt; �<br/>
&gt; Just some wishful thinking guys and girls, dont take it to seriously or to<br/>
&gt; heart...it will never happen anyways! ;-)<br/>
