<div id="ygrps-yiv-1984075242">I have found a Runed Totem staff to be handy in a few areas.<br/>
<br/>
a - When I am OOM and just need to put the beats to something that wont kill<br/>
me in melee first.<br/>
b - When I am OOM in a group fighting magical monster and need to put the<br/>
beats to it<br/>
c - When I am OOM solo fighting a magical monster and need to put the beats<br/>
to it.<br/>
<br/>
Basicly I only use my staff when I am OOM and need to put the beats to<br/>
something *grin*<br/>
<br/>
But trust me, when you start to whack at ghouls and wisps and lurking<br/>
mummies and you and your group ends up OOM, you will find that staff very<br/>
handy, also the lower delay and higher attack value over a woren staff is a<br/>
nice addition. Also, if you find yourself in a group where a melee-damager<br/>
type guy has the 2HB skill but no magic weapon, it can be handy to toss it<br/>
over to them if you trust that they will indeed return it.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;After many levels of wishing I finally got my Runed Totem Staff for<br/>
&gt;the bargan basement price of 13 pp (though I&#39;m quite broke now).<br/>
&gt;However it isn&#39;t as effective as I thought. Anything that is tough<br/>
&gt;enough to need a good damage weapon I generally can&#39;t hit ( I believe<br/>
&gt;my 2h blunt is maxed ) and anything that isn&#39;t that tough I can nuke<br/>
&gt;in no time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So my question is should I sell it for 20 pp and buy more of my ranks<br/>
&gt;spells ( i&#39;m level 12 and only have Shock of Lightning and bind<br/>
&gt;affinity ) If so which spells should I buy? Or should I stick with<br/>
&gt;the staff. Just want some friendly advice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;TIA<br/>
