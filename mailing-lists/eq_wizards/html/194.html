<div id="ygrps-yiv-239759977">You&#39;re right, it does take us long to cast, and is very hard to time casts<br/>
at higher lvls.  That&#39;s why if root doesn&#39;t work for me i&#39;m pretty much<br/>
either going to be able to run successfully, or I&#39;m going to die.  But, it<br/>
is true that wizards cast faster than any other spell casters, so can you<br/>
imagine what it must be like for them?  As for mana regeneration I don&#39;t<br/>
have a clue, hopefully we will get spells or something that will speed up<br/>
this process because it is terribly long.  Do other classes regenerate mana<br/>
quicker than us?<br/>

&gt;    I&#39;m confused.  I am a level 17 Wizard on Fennin Ro.  I find that the<br/>
&gt;only way I can nuke an opponent is to Root him first because it is utterly<br/>
&gt;impossible to Nuke, say, Ambassador DVinn while he&#39;s piercing you.  I am<br/>
&gt;excellent at timing casts, and they just attack to fast for us to get the<br/>
&gt;cast before their next hit, and most likely, they will.  I don&#39;t see at all<br/>
&gt;how Wizards cast fast, that&#39;s one of our fallbacks, the other is the long<br/>
&gt;waiting times for mana regeneration.  But no worries.  There are things you<br/>
&gt;may get that help restoration of mana.  Back to casting... It&#39;s terribly<br/>
&gt;slow, Flame Shock takes a LONG time to cast, and it is impossible to cast<br/>

&gt;you, because Root casts relativlely fast, but Root hardly holds.  And my<br/>
&gt;Alteration is maxed.  I have 142 INT, soon to be 148.  I get 5 casts out of<br/>
&gt;Flame Shock for 102 Dmg each on enemies with lower magic resistance.  Ok,<br/>
&gt;well, that was a fun chat.  I still love my Wizard and would never give him<br/>
&gt;up for any other class.<br/>
