<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460029925">According to PHAEDRA WHITLOCK:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Im here. Fighting my way out of Lvl 21. Or trying to... So few good places to hunt, so few people to group with. *sighs*<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Piecemealing it is taking awhile. Spent a morning camping Emperor Crush and Dvinn, afternon at the Gorge slaying Eyes, Evening Aviaks. So boring, and this stuff will be green at 22 I suspect (well, not the aviaks, but those are Soooooo camped).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Honestly, I don&#39;t fully remember how I spent level 21, but, if I think I got<br/>
this right, I was hunting gnolls at Highhold, mainly for the good faction hits.<br/>
Most of these were still blue, so they gave good xp, at least until people<br/>
started to appear and camp them too.<br/>
	(unlike orc side, gnoll side cannot support more than three-four people)<br/>
