<div id="ygrps-yiv-695790617">I recently made the trip from Faydwer to Freeport, and I went to the wizard<br/>
guild in town to see what quests they had.  Everyone I talked to, after<br/>
going through the dialog, when I got to the point where they would give the<br/>
actual quest, always said something to the effect that &quot;The word is that you<br/>
are neither friend nor foe.  You need to prove yourself with us first&quot;.<br/>
What do I need to do so I cam actually get quests from the humans?  I am a<br/>
High Elf Wizard.<br/>
