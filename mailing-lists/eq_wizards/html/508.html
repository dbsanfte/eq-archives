<b>Subject:</b> Shadowstep-Gate Success Stories?? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323326610">I hear a lot of talk about this tactic.  Mostly success stories. However, I<br/>
have had less success counting on this tactic than I expected.  I usually<br/>
Shadowstep a mere 10yds or so away which isn&#39;t enough distance to even run,<br/>
much less Gate.  (when I Shadowstep just for fun/testing, it works great!)<br/>
Am I the only one having little success with this tactic because the<br/>
distance often isn&#39;t great enough?  Is it dependent on having &#39;open space&#39;?<br/>
(in other words, in a dungeon will this work very well or will you &#39;hit&#39; a<br/>
wall and stop)<br/>
