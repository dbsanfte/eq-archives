<div id="ygrps-yiv-1896325040">Well, since many think the combining of the rods has to do with research, I went<br/>
ahead and borrowed a bunch of Wisdom items from a friend (since this commonly<br/>
helps against failures for trade skills).  I also got a wisdom buff from a high<br/>
level Enchanter friend.<br/>
<br/>
I succeeded the first try and got the staff!  Not sure if wisdom had anything to<br/>
do with it, but I guess it didn&#39;t hurt.  :)<br/>

&gt; I have started my quest for the Staff of the Wheel and currently have 8 of<br/>
&gt; the 10 rods.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am missing the one in Guk and the one from the Everfrost caves. But I have<br/>
&gt; a few questions since I have spent no time in Guk in 32 levels.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; GUK<br/>
&gt; 1. I need to know the easiest or quickest path to the hand room?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. Is the room on the Live or Dead side?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3. Will I encounter any Undead frogs along the way?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; EVERFROST<br/>
&gt; I know that the rod is surrounded by 3 IBS and that an NPC is in the area. I<br/>
&gt; can get by the IBS with Invis to Undead but the NPC could be a problem.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. Is this NPC within range of the rod?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I will not have a group with me and am only going to attempt this when the<br/>
&gt; Hand room is being camped. I may however try a suicide run depending on how<br/>
&gt; brave I feel.<br/>
