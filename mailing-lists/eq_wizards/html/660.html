<div id="ygrps-yiv-572256330">This is nuts.  Wizards have it tough already getting to high levels.  Until<br/>
lvl 12 or so you are effectively a magician with no pet (and therefore a<br/>
pretty weak magician.)  If they hurt wizards offensively there would have to<br/>
be some change defensively to offset it.  I mean, wizards only real way to<br/>
survive is nuke the critter into oblivion fast enough that it can&#39;t take<br/>
down your paltry hit point pool through your nearly nonexistant AC.  I<br/>
seriously think this is just a rumor, though.  EQ is balanced to be PvE, and<br/>
a Wizard is, in general, not better off than any other classes.  I mean, at<br/>
high levels you may be the only one who can solo a Hill Giant, but after you<br/>
do that a young lion could maul you because it takes all your mana to kill<br/>
the giant.  I think the drill here is remain calm and then if they gimp the<br/>
wizards flood them with polite feedbacks on why this was bad.  Heck, Wizards<br/>
were gimped right near the end of beta, too, and feedbacks seem to have<br/>
improved that situation.<br/>

&gt; Yes.  That is disturbing.  I have created this character based only on the<br/>
fact that I would be able to dish out the most damage later on in the<br/>
game...   If this rumor became true..  and my initial assumption turned out<br/>
to be all for naught..  then I&#39;d end up starting another character.. which I<br/>
DO NOT want to do...<br/>

&gt; &gt; Can this rumor be confirmed or denied?  Most disturbing.<br/>
