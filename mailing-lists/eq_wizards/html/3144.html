<div id="ygrps-yiv-564759851">I still think that they should have something that restores some mana<br/>
that you could buy at the stores.  I told this idea to a friend of mine<br/>
and he said that would make Wizards have infinate mana.  So I said what<br/>
if there was something like a &quot;Wizards Pouch&quot; and It could hold like 10<br/>
of these mana restoring items and the items can only be placed in this<br/>
bag.  And a wizard can only have one bag.  That would limit the amount<br/>
of these items to 10.  Therefore making us better at soloing but wouldnt<br/>
let us have infinate mana.</div>
