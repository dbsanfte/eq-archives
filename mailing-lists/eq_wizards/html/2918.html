<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064309101">I got all of my level 34 spells that I needed/wanted in Neriak -- that <br/>
probably doesn&#39;t help you light races, but I&#39;d assume if Neriak had it, then <br/>
so would the library in Erudin.  Try checking the Cleric guilds for Nullify <br/>
Magic -- I think that&#39;s where I got mine.  Not sure about ThunderClap that <br/>
may be research only, but I couldn&#39;t tell ya.  Common Portal exists, but I <br/>
believe it is a level 39 spell.  Some web pages have said that Common Portal <br/>
is 34, but if you actually look at the scroll before ya buy it it&#39;s 39.  <br/>
Regardless, check Neriak&#39;s 3rd Gate and you can find it there, on the second <br/>
floor of the library.<br/>
<br/>
Hope I didn&#39;t lead anyone astray.<br/>
