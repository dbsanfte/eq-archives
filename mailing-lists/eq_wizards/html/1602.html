&gt;Gee I wish I could be on your server.  5-10pp seems ridiculously low<br/>
&gt;for the mithaniel marr server.  Although even 10pp pieces seems like<br/>
&gt;an impossibility to me. This server seems to be dominated by guild<br/>
&gt;campers and privateers.  In the time I have been here (on nearly<br/>
&gt;constantly) for instance there is one and only one person offering int<br/>
&gt;raising bracelets (Radigan) and I beleive they are ac+3, mana+15 and<br/>
&gt;he is asking a FIRM 15pp each.  I bought an entire set of banded<br/>
&gt;armour (for my bard who is stinking rich by my wizards standards and<br/>
&gt;can make 30 pp in 5 hours of play) less cloak for nearly that price!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As for other items, I have seen a few auctions for woven, magical<br/>
&gt;staffs or other lore items.  When they are auctioned they are gone<br/>
&gt;immediately and the prices they fetch are insane (unless you know the<br/>
&gt;camper .... err seller).  I have seen simple pieces of netted at<br/>
&gt;starting prices of 30pp!  As for the majority which are never<br/>
&gt;auctioned they are either camped then kept within the camping click or<br/>
&gt;selfishly horded to prevent anyone else from attaining them.  Like I<br/>
&gt;have said before the game should actually be renamed to everGREED,<br/>
&gt;GREEDquest, PRIVATEERquest, BARTERquest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I guess on a bright side I have heard stories (actually I know of<br/>
&gt;several lucky Bast@#ds) that have aquired the runed totem staff for a<br/>
&gt;mere 20pp.  Which is close to the asking price of the FS GS here in<br/>
&gt;mithaniel (over priced land of powergammers) marr.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have a 9th level wizard that currently walks Narrath in a shoddy sr<br/>
&gt;apprentise robe with a worn great staff.  I have lost count of the<br/>
&gt;number of times I have died as a result of trying to do the last 3<br/>
&gt;points of damage to a fleeing creature swinging once in what seems<br/>
&gt;like every 10 seconds yet not willing to wasted the precious 8 mana to<br/>
&gt;frost the critter to death.  Or was forced to run as a result of 2<br/>
&gt;successful blows from an enemy.  Sye....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have only been able to buy 8 spells TOTAL and have 7pp in the bank.<br/>
&gt;I played yesterday and had one of the most productive (highest kill to<br/>
&gt;time ratios) nights I can recall and after 18 straight hours of play I<br/>
&gt;had aquired 8pp! :(  How is one ever to afford anything?  You can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;fight for it as it is camped. In the slim chance that you do get the<br/>
&gt;opportunity to fight, Varent has reduced the odds of anything good<br/>
&gt;dropping so low after the latest patchs (and keep in mind it must be<br/>
&gt;your turn to loot) that I have projected I would age 30 real years<br/>
&gt;before I could ever hope of aquiring one decent item!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t even want to think about the 12th level spells and the fact I<br/>
&gt;will have to play 7 by 24 for a week to buy one spell!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Guile (disillusioned wizard) of the 9th circle.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Goss yields an AC of 8, and is magical, yet I don&#39;t know what the<br/>
&gt;magic does<br/>
&gt;&gt; exactly.  I have one.  I have no idea what you could auction it for<br/>
&gt;because<br/>
&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t plan to give it up anytime soon.. or at least til I get a<br/>
&gt;Flowing<br/>
&gt;&gt; black robe :)... I would guess, however, you could probably ask<br/>
&gt;8p-10p+ and<br/>
&gt;&gt; get it.  I don&#39;t recall what the jr. and sr. app robes went for in<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;&gt; guild.. that might be a good reference point though.  I&#39;m sure there<br/>
&gt;will be<br/>
&gt;&gt; a difference of opinion on this, but thats my take at least :).<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt;I am a 14th Level Wizard and am wondering what robes and armor I<br/>
&gt;should<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;be searching for.  I have heard that Gossimer Robes are some of the<br/>
&gt;best<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;robes, is this true?  If so, any idea on how much they fetch at an<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;auction?<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;For other armor pieces, I have heard woven is good.  What about<br/>
&gt;Mesh?<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Can Wizards use Mesh or is Woven armor the armor of choice?  Again,<br/>
&gt;any<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;ideas for prices on woven and/or mesh?<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;Thanks,<br/>
