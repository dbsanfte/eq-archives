<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194260575">How about this one?  I was in unrest trying to retrieve my corpse.  Well I<br/>
ran in a barbed bone (probably the one that killed me originally, heh) along<br/>
with his pal a ghoul.  I couldnt see the way out because I had no light<br/>
source and was stunned and spun around.  I had no hope of running so I just<br/>
hit gate and prayed (not much chance of gating out while being hit on due to<br/>
the long casting time).  The first time it was interrupted but the second<br/>
time I continued casting after being hit twice or three times for a total of<br/>
over 50 damage by the skeleton and ghoul.  To my level 20 character the<br/>
skeleton conned red (around level 25).  This is the most extreme and lucky<br/>
example I have seen of continuing casting, and my dexterity is only 74.  My<br/>
wisdom is 93, so I would tend to think that wisdom has more of a bearing<br/>
that dexterity, although I have seen more people attribute continuing to<br/>
dex, so I am not sure.<br/>
<br/>
One thing is for sure, I didnt continue much against ANYTING including blues<br/>
until about level 12 or 15.  This makes me thing that your channeling skill<br/>
has some bearing on this as well.  At level 21 now I do get interrupted<br/>
quite a lot, but I also continue a lot.  If this trend continues, I figure<br/>
at higher levels you will continue more often than you get interrupted.<br/>
<br/>
Any wizards out there with high dex (gnomes start with 85 dex I believe)<br/>
care to comment on this?<br/>

&gt;if you wanted to keep it balanced you wouldn&#39;t be allowed to use it every<br/>
&gt;couple of seconds!!! maybe every six minutes like mend. i think a better<br/>
&gt;idea would be the it would do more damage and that spell when using<br/>
&gt;concentrate would not be able to be interrupted (ever heard &quot;soandso<br/>
&gt;regains concentration and continues casting&quot;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Never in my life  =).  It&#39;s a pretty much unspoken rule, that if anything<br/>
&gt;connects with my character, my spell is interrupted.  What stat determines<br/>
&gt;this anyway?  I&#39;ve heard people say wisdom, but I can&#39;t picture how eq<br/>
&gt;would connect wisdom and the ability to focus on a single task.  &lt;shrug&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, whatever it is, I&#39;m going to plink some points down in it with my<br/>
&gt;next casting character.<br/>
