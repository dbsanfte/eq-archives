<div id="ygrps-yiv-106772085">According to Rich Mulawa:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; give them weapons, armour, magic items and cash to be more effective <br/>
&gt; at soloing thru the early levels.  I have seen one level 7 wizard in <br/>
&gt; full netted with a glowing crook and what I am sure are 2 +15 mana <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Full Netted isn&#39;t hard to achieve. Netted is found on low-level frogloks<br/>
(and is worth a few percent more than equivalent cloth in stores), and<br/>
these guys aren&#39;t far. Even a level 7 wizard should be able to go to<br/>
Innothule or the Qeynos sewers - if he is careful - and get some.<br/>
<br/>
For me, mighty high-elf wizard, netted is almost useless. Except for<br/>
the &quot;magic&quot; mention, it weights as much as the small pieces of clothing<br/>
(excepting: pants, girth, shawl) I can afford. For humans it is probably<br/>
more desirable.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; bracers and 2 +5 mana rings.  Come on!  At 9th I can&#39;t even afford all <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The rest of the stuff smells strongly like twinking. I had two insigna<br/>
rings by level 7 (which I promptly lent to a monk friend, who has more use<br/>
of them than I do), but that&#39;s because you can pick a pair for a single<br/>
PP. Glowing crook? No way :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the useful spells through 8th level and am stuck worth a junky worn GS <br/>
&gt; but this yahoo is walking around in 200 to 250pp worth of stuff and <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At level 9, you can solo blue-conning Desert Tarantulas in North Ro.<br/>
Typical loot per tarantula: Chitin (4-5s), Spider Silk (1 out 2-3, 1g7s),<br/>
and Poison Sacs (1 out of 5, 4g5 each). I usually make a platinum per 2/3<br/>
bubble of XP. And I can reassure you, I&#39;m alternating between the worn<br/>
great staff and the dinky tarnished dagger (to get a tarnished dagger,<br/>
find a smith, or contact a scout of Tunare - one of their quests yield<br/>
a tarnished dagger).<br/>
<br/>
I am now 10, and I already have bought since I got there the 3 levels 12<br/>
spells I mainly want: Shock of Lightning, Bind Affinity, Cancel Magic.<br/>
After I&#39;ve bought Resistant Skin, the cash I&#39;ll be making will go into<br/>
extra items purchase, should I find one of interest offered for sale.<br/>
<br/>
Once I hit 12, I&#39;ll immediately start purchasing all level 16 spells I want,<br/>
and then resume getting cash for items.<br/>
<br/>
Strong hint: Buy the spells first. Take fishing if you need to (about 1pp<br/>
in 30-40mn, but boring as hell).<br/>
