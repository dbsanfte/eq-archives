<div id="ygrps-yiv-986556405">Whatever you choose is good.  Think of it this way.  Your stats also are<br/>
roll played.  I.E. my 15th level Wizzie has 118 Intel and 55 strength..but<br/>
has 90 CHARISMA and 90 STAMINA.  His wisdom is now 99 with help of an item.<br/>
Anyway, point here is that your wiz will be just fine.  <br/>
<br/>
Mana is to a wizard as Hitpoints are to a fighter class.  Some fighters have<br/>
500pts at level 17, some get the 500pts at 18.  Doesnt really matter.  You<br/>
will enjoy your wizard and learn the positive and negative effects of your<br/>
choices.<br/>
<br/>
Mine is that I have about 480 mana at level 15 but I cannot carry more than<br/>
55 in loot.  <br/>

I only have 100 Int, figured that was enough, but as a human I&#39;ve got some<br/>
other better stats. I don&#39;t see any REAL detriment till perhaps later on.<br/>
Later on we&#39;ll have less mana, so perhaps 1 less damage spell goes off. So<br/>
far I haven&#39;t really noticed a big deal. However, let me point out that what<br/>
you&#39;re doing is playing the numbers. It&#39;s like having a D&D character with<br/>
18/00 str. Sure, it&#39;s nice, but if we all played them then it&#39;d get stale<br/>
fast.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just my opinion, and that&#39;s why I stopped putting points into my int<br/>
at 100/<br/>
