<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600948609">Does anyone know what level you should be to fight the aqua goblins in the Ocean of Tears?  I am level 10, and tried soloing one of them, and it got the better of me, even though it conned blue.  Was this just bad luck, or do I need to go back when I am a higher level?</div>
