&gt; I heard rumours that they made root less effective for us in this last patch<br/>
&gt; in an effort to make PVP servers more balanced.  Any truth to this?  That<br/>
&gt; would definitely suck!  All the more reason to group now then ever.<br/>

functioning normally.  By the way, I keep here people saying that they never<br/>
rooted before 12.  Did you solo?  What was your tatics?  I started rooting and<br/>
nuking at 4 and I haven&#39;t stopped since.  Even if it kept the mob off of me 1/4<br/>
of the fight, it was still meant the difference of life or death to me.  By<br/>
level 10ish (I think, its been a while since then) I was rooting Grizzleys in<br/>
the Karanas, and often finishing them off before root would break.</div>
