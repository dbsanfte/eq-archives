<div id="ygrps-yiv-668193480">HAHA!  So...you no like da lump eh?  :)  Yeah, it does look pretty dumb <br/>
huh?...I was pretty disappointed the first time I saw that thing.  Much <br/>
cooler to carry one of those totem or idol things because it looks so much <br/>
neater.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it would be nice of them to give us something to &quot;wow&quot; ourselves <br/>
over...especially since we have to wear these bath robes almost our entire <br/>
lives.  It&#39;s real fun to collect cool things to wear for other classes.  Not <br/>
much for us....even that Observer robes look kinda...err....soft (if you <br/>
know what I mean? ;) .    Wouldn&#39;t it be neat to have *one* unique item, <br/>
weapon, or robes that each class would have?  (ie. like the special sword <br/>
the Paladins get?)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Sounds good, just add my little comment about the Skull of Jhen&#39;Tra.<br/>
&gt;Wizard look stupid in those robes anyway, so at least let us have a &gt;cool<br/>
&gt;skull in our hand to impress our big weapon, shiny armor wielding<br/>
&gt;friends. It&#39;s not like there aren&#39;t any skulls in the game. I mean,<br/>
&gt;there are dozens of different undead skeleton types. But still we are<br/>
&gt;screwed over. When I hold the skull now, it looks like I have a lump &gt;on<br/>
&gt;my wrist. They just use the usual bag placeholder object, but a &gt;little<br/>
&gt;enlarged.<br/>
