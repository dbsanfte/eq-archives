<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068861550">I just reached lvl 20, got all my spells, and I guess am a little<br/>
dissapointed. I do enjoy blasting for 170 points of damage, but it&#39;s<br/>
almost as if Verant has made these new spells EASIER to resist. For<br/>
instance, I fight Orcs in oasis. Low blue orcs and they are resisting my<br/>
new shock spell. They NEVER resist my 16th level lightning bolt. You<br/>
would think that a higher level spell would be as or harder to resist.<br/>
<br/>
Another example is enstill. This ONLY works on greens. There is no blue,<br/>
white, yellow, red that I have found that is successfully enstilled. In<br/>
fact, when I fight the 20th level orcs that con black to me, they always<br/>
resist. Yet root works on them about 25% of the time. I was hoping that<br/>
when I got enstill it would be easier to solo because it is more<br/>
powerful, alas it isn&#39;t so.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t tried my new gate spells due to the fact that I would have a<br/>
long run back to Neriak after trying them. The sight spell is fairly<br/>
useless, and I don&#39;t know what to fight to make use of the elemental<br/>
shield ( which would only help me anyway and not a group ).<br/>
<br/>
I am heading to Lake Rathe now and hopefully my spells work better<br/>
there. If not, mayhaps we should petition to get this change. I mean<br/>
come on, I am about as useful as a 16th level wizard against red if<br/>
BLUES resist my new 20th level spells. While monsters are getting<br/>
progressively better I seem to be getting progressively incapable to<br/>
handle them.<br/>
<br/>
On the feedback thing, the magicians and enchanters have shown that it<br/>
is possible to get Verants attention and get them to change things. If<br/>
what I&#39;m doing is whining then so be it, I am merely pointing out what I<br/>
noticed upon reaching 20, and it doesn&#39;t seem good.<br/>
