<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1650975575">1. Whenever you are engaged in battle, wether you think you can win<br/>
   or not, always type /loc before or during battle. That way when<br/>
   or if you die you can scroll up in the chat window and get a <br/>
   general idea asto where your corpse is.<br/>
<br/>
2. Never run after losing your sticks(warriors). The beast will catch<br/>
   you anyways and all you will do is waste a couple hours looking<br/>
   for your corpse cause it is not with the others.<br/>
<br/>
3. Before you train up from leveling. Make sure you have researched<br/>
   what skills you will really need for the next level.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope these help. Feel free to add to this list.<br/>
