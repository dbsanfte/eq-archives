<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;M ygroup was killing Hill Giants in the Rathe mountains when i happened to<br/>
&gt;notice something.  The big boys resist cold spells much more than they do<br/>
&gt;fire spells.  I am lvl 35 and most of them are yellow to me.  Just a lil<br/>
&gt;food for thought.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I spent some time killing those suckers too.  Good fun!  Not so sure <br/>
out the resistance though, I&#39;ve been sticking to my lvl 24 ice (frost?) <br/>
spell for the past 10 levels as my initial strikes.  I&#39;ve had no problems <br/>
getting them to hit despite the giants being red to me when I was 32-33.  <br/>
I&#39;ve felt the shock spells have been fairly reliable so far.  I&#39;ve heard <br/>
weather patterns affect our spells too but I haven&#39;t devoted the time to <br/>
confirm that. :)<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t those giants and cyclops make the coolest sounds when dying? :)<br/>
