<div id="ygrps-yiv-2096851209">According to James Dwyer:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As far as being in a group, many many people appreciate my help as a<br/>
&gt; wizard. I also have seen many people asking for magic user help. I guess<br/>
&gt; they are starting to learn that all the mages are good for something!<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, I often see them telling me to &quot;BLAST&quot; &quot;BLAST&quot; in the<br/>
&gt; midst of battle when my better judgement tells me that I will get mobbed<br/>
&gt; if I do so quick. My response of course, &quot;Dark Elf is about to die.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The answer is, of course to group with people who appreciate wizardry,<br/>
and know when to defer to you for tactical combat.<br/>
<br/>
I often put in blasts *during* combat. But I count how many blows the big<br/>
tanks does, and rarely fire one off before he&#39;s done almost as much as I<br/>
do. Exception being when he&#39;s dropping in life, then I move away, nuke,<br/>
nuke as fast as possible. When the mob switches focus to me, I suffer<br/>
the blows (and practice my combat :) while he finishes it.<br/>
