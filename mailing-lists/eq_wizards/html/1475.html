<div id="ygrps-yiv-337550582">To get to the freeport docks without facing the guards, go to w.freeport and <br/>
while facing the guards, head right and hug the wall. Eventually you&#39;ll find <br/>
a secret passage. Go through that (it can get kinda confusing) and then <br/>
you&#39;ll eventually see some water. Go in that and then when you get out into <br/>
the open, take a left and follow the wall. You should soon see the docks.</div>
