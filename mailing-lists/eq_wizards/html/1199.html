<div id="ygrps-yiv-793410600">I am the opposite.  I can&#39;t imagine very many reasons why a sane human (or <br/>
demi-human) would spend years developing a skill and then give it away for <br/>
free.  Outside of a valid roleplaying reason I would find that poor gaming.<br/>
<br/>
Calyn was raised to be heavy artillery in the orc wars.  He really dislikes <br/>
the merchant life and so does not set prices.  He accepts what others gives <br/>
him, but he would be insulted if he was given nothing.  He would take that <br/>
as meaning his value is nothing.<br/>
<br/>
The only time he bound someone for nothing was when the character was on his <br/>
way back from a sea voyage to get his corpse.  The poor fellow had nothing, <br/>
so he was bound for free.  The character did actually come back and pay him <br/>
a few gold, though.  Kind of restores my faith in people when things like <br/>
that happen.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I don&#39;t know why but it has never made sense to me to charge for services<br/>
&gt;such as binding, invis, and language training.  Perhaps it is just the<br/>
&gt;personality of my character that he enjoys helping others and gets full<br/>
&gt;satisfaction out of the good deed itself, not needing any sort of physical<br/>
&gt;compensation.<br/>
