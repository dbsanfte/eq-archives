<b>Subject:</b> The worth of a Wizard (long) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-659930603">Hail my fellow wizards, I have been on this newsletter since it began, 95 <br/>
digests ago.  I love seeing all the diffrent opinions about the wizard class, <br/>
but have to say that I am really middle of the road on most of the issues.  I <br/>
was hoping this list would be more a a sharing of battle tactics, etc.  But that<br/>
<br/>
has not been the case since digest 5 or so.  Now it seems everyone wants to be <br/>
the solo death machine in many cases.  Sorry while I love the idea of it, as <br/>
many authors do too,(Richard Rahl or the Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind<br/>
<br/>
or Rand Al&#92;&#39;Thor of Robert Jordan&#92;&#39;s Wheel of Time just leap to my mind) it is <br/>
just not feasible in a game like this.<br/>
<br/>
Now I solo, usually for 2 kills and then party up.  I HATE soloing, others love <br/>
it. Oh well just me I guess, but I prefer to group with all of my characters (on<br/>
<br/>
this server I have a Dark Elf Enchanter, Dwarf Warrior, Halfling Druid, Wood Elf<br/>
<br/>
Ranger, Gnome Necro, Barbarian Rouge, and my newbie SK Troll - I am a glutton <br/>
for punishment, everyone says SK Troll is hardest and worst class, i will prove <br/>
them wrong I hope)  Now because I play so many diffrent types of charcters I get<br/>
<br/>
a good perspective of the roles and groupings of the various characters.  I <br/>
still have more class/race combo&#92;&#39;s I want to try but for now I am full on <br/>
bristlebane.  Now as a wizard I just rock the hell out of these monsters, no one<br/>
<br/>
comes near it.  The fastest battles solo for me are with my wizard, root blast <br/>
blast blast dead.  With other characters it is not this way at all.  I just hate<br/>
<br/>
the down time and the feeling of unprotected once am really oom or hurt, <br/>
regardless class or race.  So I group up all the time. <br/>
<br/>
Guess who is the easiest person for me to find a group with? Ahhh you guessed <br/>
it, it is my Erudite Wizard, Zakrul.  Now I don&#92;&#39;t know if it is my server or <br/>
what but I always get /tells from people asking me to join them.  Feel bad <br/>
having to turn down so many.  Mostly the warriors/rangers/paladins love us <br/>
wizards, try playing one, you will see how frustrating kill steals can be.  With<br/>
<br/>
me no one can outdamage us in a dungeon to take our kills.  With me I sit around<br/>
<br/>
and let them get beat on until they say &#92;&#39;Zak&#92;&#39; then I stand up and put down the<br/>
<br/>
monster with one shot.  Or they say &#92;&#39;Zak root&#92;&#39; and I will root it for them. <br/>
You <br/>
must find a balance within yourself and your group to be successful.  Wizards <br/>
are the final blow, the hail mary, the stealth bomber.  The monsters sit there <br/>
beating our fighters, monsters say &#92;&#39;hehe we are going to eat good tonight!&#92;&#39;, <br/>
they never see the gangly fellow in the purple robes sitting 30 paces away.  <br/>
When they do see me, it is in their dying breath.  Not to say I don&#92;&#39;t die, or<br/>
my <br/>
groups don&#92;&#39;t, but this is rare and usually due to sloppy play, unlucky train,<br/>
or <br/>
just miscommunications.<br/>
<br/>
Now as far as all of the gripes and complaints my fellow Wizards have, I love <br/>
it.  To be complacent is to be dead, we are wizards, of course we are going to <br/>
think out of bounds, want more might, more knowledge, it is what we are.  I <br/>
really think there are some great ideas here, but they should be lv 34 - 44 lv <br/>
spells.  I think that wizards SHOULD be weak and underpowered until the higher <br/>
levels.  After all it takes years to master the arcane arts IMO so I would think<br/>
<br/>
that a person starting the arcane school would maybe be a middle level guy while<br/>
<br/>
the martial artist who started at the same time could be a grand master.  I am <br/>
not detracting from them, I am just putting into perspective the kind of mental <br/>
will it would take to control the force of magic verse (not to say martial <br/>
artiest don&#92;&#39;t have lots of control:o).  As far as the spells below, love em, <br/>
will be doing feedback on them.<br/>
<br/>
 Summon - Teleports group member inside the zone to your location<br/>
 Phase - Teleports yourself to location of other group member inside zone<br/>
 Tap Afinity - Teleport group member to their own bind spot<br/>
 Haste - Increases movement rate for self only.<br/>
 Group Gate - Slow casting spell which teleports group to your bind spot,<br/>
 doesn&#92;&#39;t leave anyone behind<br/>
 Retreat - Evacuate version of group gate<br/>
<br/>
I would add to this list <br/>
Okiel&#92;&#39;s Inferno 8-13 dmg shield lv 16 (cast on one person at time).  <br/>
Okiel&#92;&#39;s Fireshield 20-26 dmg sheild for whole party lv 30<br/>
Okiel&#92;&#39;s Firewall 35-40 dmg shield for whole party lv 44<br/>
Okiel&#92;&#39;s Blaze 60dmg shield for single player lv 49<br/>
<br/>
I think this would round out this series very nicely, it could be a 30sec <br/>
duration for in combat only, would be in line with our damage spells, not really<br/>
<br/>
a buff cause is so short on durations.  Also does not do ureasonable damage to <br/>
unbalance the game.  As I play so many characters my wiz is only lv 12, higher <br/>
up guys let me know if the damage numbers sound about right or to high/low.  <br/>
Anyway sorry for long post just had to do it :)<br/>
<br/>
May our paths cross<br/>
