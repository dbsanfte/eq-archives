<b>Subject:</b> Wizard spells in Freeport? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1641023189">Sorry all I must be dumb or something, but although I found 2 wizard<br/>
guildmasters in the magic user area in Freeport, I cannot find the vendor<br/>
that sells level 8 wizard spells.  I explored the area around the floating<br/>
building, and on the inside I have looked in the downstairs area and the<br/>
upstairs.  Can anyone confirm / deny that these spells are actually sold in<br/>
Freeport and if so give me a general location of the vendor?  Are there<br/>
other areas in the building that I am not seeing?  Thanks.<br/>
