<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077594007">Hail...  Wizard spells work a different way then other casters.  The other<br/>
casters (I&#39;m not sure if magicians are included in this) either do full dmg<br/>
or no dmg.  Wizards have there dmg vary over a range.  This may seem  bad to<br/>
you now, but it&#39;s not.  Wizard spells get completely resisted less than<br/>
other caster spells.  So when you&#39;re doing 40 dmg (on a 83 dmg spell), but<br/>
everyone else is getting completely resisted you won&#39;t feel so useless.<br/>
BTW, Necro life draining spells are impossible to resist, it will do the<br/>
same amount of dmg every single time he casts it no matter what.<br/>

&gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt;so i get some questions for hard gamers :)<br/>
&gt;1. First i am a fan of quest :). But in freeport, the arcan scientist don t<br/>
&gt;want to give me any quest :(. I know that i must raise my faction if i want<br/>
&gt;to make quests for them but how ???? Killing deathfist centurion and so<br/>
&gt;raise faction with commond resident. Are the scientist residents ? If i can<br/>
&gt;not do any quest for them then how to raise my faction with them ? What the<br/>
&gt;monsters who raise faction with scientist ?<br/>
&gt;2. Second, a wizzard is useles vs red monsters... Yesterday i was fighting<br/>
&gt;with 3 friend same level as me orc warrior from blue ro red. For the blue,<br/>
&gt;np. But for the white yellow and red don t even try with a caster group..<br/>
&gt;Why ? Normally shock of lightening can do 82 dommage... In three hours<br/>
&gt;fighting with orc, 3 or 4 times i do 82 hp dommage... But usually i do 12,<br/>
&gt;14 , 4 or whatever but not the max... I have tried fire spel, ice spel,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>same<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;they don t resist the whole dommage but they resist very well.. So i go<br/>
&gt;fighting crocodile.. Deep water croco.. Considering red.... and same : i<br/>
&gt;nearly never do max dommage (nearly never the half dommage in fact sigh :(<br/>
&gt;). I can understand that if they are red i need a level 16 spel to hurt<br/>
 </span></blockquote>them<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;bad (i am currently 15) but that s really stupid.. If i try to kill red<br/>
 </span></blockquote>with<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;friends and that i dont  dommage the monsters i am useless vs red creatures<br/>
&gt;cause my spels are resisted !! In others words, you must kill blue<br/>
 </span></blockquote>creatures<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;to be sure you do the max dommage... But one of my friend is necro level<br/>
&gt;15... And you know what ? HE ALWAYS do the max dommage he can handle... ok<br/>
&gt;it s only 42 for the attack spel but he always do 42, same for war undead<br/>
&gt;always the max !!!! i regret that with these fact a wizzard can nearly not<br/>
&gt;kill more then blue creatures... By the way, i have killed some days ago a<br/>
&gt;dervish thug alone cons. yellow for me.. And all my spel were working at<br/>
&gt;max... Any idea ? it s just a question of magic resist ? Why the necro spel<br/>
&gt;does always max dommage ? (and are never never resisted at all ! Heat<br/>
 </span></blockquote>blood,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;war undead life tap and so ! )<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks for all the help !<br/>
