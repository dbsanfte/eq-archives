&gt;Yeah, I&#39;ve had a problem, as I get higher level, with this not always<br/>
&gt;working.  I&#39;ve gotten to the point where I&#39;ll jump, crouch and run around,<br/>
&gt;it seems to stop me MOST of the time. LOL<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On the up side, I&#39;ve been rather shocked at how things DON&#39;T interrupt me as<br/>
&gt;much.  At level 30, multiple things can be pounding on me,and I still can<br/>
&gt;sometimes gate a gate, DD, or root off.  Cool!<br/>
