<div id="ygrps-yiv-1164448731">which leads me to believe that the skull still is used in some fashion to<br/>
unleash its magical properties to the user.  But what?<br/>

Subject: [eq_wizards] Runed totem and skull<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
i just spent an entire day at Verant Int. it was a helluva lotta fun. I met<br/>
the guy who developed all the spells, went to lunch with smed, etc. I even<br/>
had a chance to ask him about the runed totem and that skull. RUMOR. you can<br/>
do no such thing. his GM character has one and it&#39;s called the staff of<br/>
discord and you probably get it if you kill the priest of discord. other<br/>
than that, the runed totem staff is ONLY the runed totem staff and cannot<br/>
into something else....</div>
