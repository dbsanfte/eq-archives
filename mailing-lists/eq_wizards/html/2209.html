<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191292547">I just want to know why, whenever there is a tournament, that the root spell <br/>
is band.  I wonder if the people that hold these tournaments realize no <br/>
wizard would ever show up to one of these things.  Warriors must be getting <br/>
pissed off because they always lose!!!  And one other thing, my friend is a <br/>
level 27 cleric and he said they never go out without a wizard.  he said <br/>
their group hated lower level wizards but after level 20 they always needed <br/>
one.  gives me hope because i&#39;m only level 12.<br/>
