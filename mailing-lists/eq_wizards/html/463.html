<div id="ygrps-yiv-1808226963">Soloing is very hard at you lvl.  If you do, root right away, stand back and<br/>
hope you have enough mana kill it.  Never solo anything higher than blue, or<br/>
else it will be instant death.  In a group, stand way back, as far as you<br/>
can and still be in range to cast spells, this limits the creatures desire<br/>
to stop attacking the tanks and go after you.  Also, be patient, let the<br/>
tanks do the work.  You have the potential to make battles go much much<br/>
faster by throwing everything you have at the creature, but in doing so you<br/>
do more dmg than the tanks and make the creature attack you.  When a fight<br/>
starts, stand back, let the tanks get some hits in, then throw a spell or<br/>
two at the creature then wait so more. When the creature is close enough<br/>
that you can kill it with a spell, cast it, and kill it.  Doing this should<br/>
keep the creatures attention focussed on the tanks and not you.  But make<br/>
sure you always watch the health meters of your tanks, if someone looks like<br/>
they may be in trouble let loose and nuke.  Also try and finish a battle<br/>
before the tanks have lost too much health, otherwise you will have to wait<br/>
an infuriatingly long time for them to regen hp&#39;s.  (This isn&#39;t as bad if<br/>
there is a cleric in the party)  That&#39;s basically all you can, get used to<br/>
it.. when you hit 12th and your spells get more powerful the creatures will<br/>
turn your way even quicker.  Btw: do you have a full set of armour yet?  If<br/>
not go out and buy whatever you don&#39;t have right now.  Even crappy cloth<br/>
armour makes an amazing difference when it comes to keeping you alive.<br/>
Well, that&#39;s all the advise I can offer, hope it helps.<br/>

&gt;Hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I play a High Elf Wizard. He is currently 10th lvl. The first 9 levels went<br/>

&gt;<br/>
