<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567574668">I think that only getting spells every 4 lvls is stupid.   I think that<br/>
we (or everybody) should get spells every lvl or every other lvl.<br/>
Especially for wizards.  My friend who is a lvl 5 enchanter almost has<br/>
more spells then I do.  They gave us so many useless spells.  Like the<br/>
low lvl Sphere of light.  I havent had the need for any other damage<br/>
spell besides shocks or bolts.  Then again I am also at a low lvl.<br/>
