<div id="ygrps-yiv-622856009">What lvl are you? At 30+ almost everywhere you&#39;ll go will be a dungeon, and <br/>
try going into one of those solo.  But the thing with lvl 30+ is that you <br/>
cannot do it solo, or it&#39;s very difficult, considering most of the mobs you <br/>
want are in dungeons.  If you haven&#39;t made some close friends or regular <br/>
groups by then, you&#39;ll be doing a lot of nothing or more whining.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;THIS IS MY LONG RESPONSE TO THOSE WHO DISLIKE MY WAY OF PLAYING:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      Personally, i don&#39;t think my KS reputation will go as far as you <br/>
&gt;claim.<br/>
&gt;First of all, there are probably around 2000 - 3000 people playing on the<br/>
&gt;server.  At this point, I haven&#39;t traveled around too much, but i rarely <br/>
&gt;see<br/>
&gt;people from Erudin that i&#39;ve grouped with or talked to in the past.  I play<br/>
&gt;around the Qeynos area, usually West karanas, so its not too far from my <br/>
&gt;home<br/>
&gt;town.  With a population of approximately 2000 - 3000 players on the server <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;a zone population of around 30-50 ppl, no one gives a shit about my name or <br/>
&gt;if i<br/>
&gt;have KS from them before or not.  So my reputation is pointless at this <br/>
&gt;time and<br/>
&gt;i don&#39;t give a shit if people hate me.  There are some people i steal from <br/>
&gt;often<br/>
&gt;and they do hate me to some extent, but i don&#39;t really care about that.  <br/>
&gt;Since<br/>
&gt;they can just go else where if they don&#39;t want me to KS from them, but i <br/>
&gt;can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;travel solo too much since i die easily as a wizard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      On the power gaming / whining issue of my personality.   YES ! I LOVE <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;powergame !  Currently, i play around 6 hours/day after work, and 12 - 15<br/>
&gt;hours/day on the weekend.  I love to level just for the hell of it, don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;really<br/>
&gt;care too much about Role Playing, although I do RP sometimes.  But not very<br/>
&gt;often.  maybe only 20-30% of the time I am on.  Power Gaming keeps the fun <br/>
&gt;in it<br/>
&gt;for me,  I don&#39;t like spending a lot of time doing NOTHING.  Its more fun <br/>
&gt;for me<br/>
&gt;to see that i&#39;ve gained some lvl after spending x amount of time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      You also inform me that people like to train stuff to me after i KS <br/>
&gt;from<br/>
&gt;them, maybe this is the issue in dungeons but i don&#39;t goto dungeons often.  <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;like to stay out doors cuz dungeons are just too messy with tones of ppl <br/>
&gt;around.<br/>
&gt;So there is little risk for me to get trained.  Sometimes people try to <br/>
&gt;train<br/>
&gt;bandits at me(west karanas), but they just end up dying themselves with me<br/>
&gt;stealing a few off their trains. This has happened quite a number of times <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;its not a problem for me to deal with.  I also had other Wizards from <br/>
&gt;groups<br/>
&gt;standing behind me in an attempt to train, but i usually keep an eye on my <br/>
&gt;msg<br/>
&gt;board to see when they cast, and i wait for them to cast first.  If they <br/>
&gt;don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;cast and just waiting for me to make the first move, i usually cast a weak<br/>
&gt;spell(shock of frost) on the mob and let them cast harder to train <br/>
&gt;themselves.<br/>
&gt;I also had this happen quite a few times.  But again, its not a big <br/>
&gt;problem.  It<br/>
&gt;is also funny sometimes the people i KS from think that if they just go in <br/>
&gt;while<br/>
&gt;i med, or something, then i won&#39;t have mana to KS from them.  But i usually <br/>
&gt;med<br/>
&gt;anywas out of habbit even though i have full mana, i usually just keep <br/>
&gt;pressing<br/>
&gt;F8 and keep an eye on who is attacking etc through the msg board.  Those <br/>
&gt;people<br/>
&gt;who go in too fast are usually unprepared and not organized,  they get in<br/>
&gt;trouble themselves and ask for their group to help.  But a lot of times <br/>
&gt;their<br/>
&gt;groups don&#39;t have clerics or other types of healers(a lot tanks around west<br/>
&gt;karanas)  so they end up dying and then get mad at me cuz i didn&#39;t KS the <br/>
&gt;bandit<br/>
&gt;so they could live.  I&#39;ve had this happen 3 times so far.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      After saying that, i see a lot of skill involved in KS , not just <br/>
&gt;over<br/>
&gt;power but to see when to KS and when to wait.  There is much more strategy<br/>
&gt;involved with KS than just grouping and kill/med all the time.  Its more <br/>
&gt;fun for<br/>
&gt;me to go around picking ppl&#39;s kills when i don&#39;t have a group so i can <br/>
&gt;still lvl<br/>
&gt;and not just sit around doing dick all.  I tried the method of looking up <br/>
&gt;using<br/>
&gt;/who lvl, for ppl who are my lvl, but  a lot of ppl are anonymous(as am I) <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;the people who are not, i usually ask.  They either are already grouped<br/>
&gt;themselves or are logging off(maybe thats just an excuse).  I don&#39;t blame <br/>
&gt;people<br/>
&gt;for not grouping with me, they do their stuff i do mine.  And i don&#39;t care <br/>
&gt;if<br/>
&gt;they blame me for KS their kills.  In a non-PVP environment, i do whatever <br/>
&gt;i<br/>
&gt;want, they do whatever they want.  If they don&#39;t like how i operate , they <br/>
&gt;can<br/>
&gt;try to train me, but it has NEVER worked so far.  Trains usually hate them <br/>
&gt;way<br/>
&gt;more than me and shadow step works quite nicely most of the time.  The only<br/>
&gt;times I die is when i am stupid for not saving enough mana for shadow step <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;then gate, or that some mob spawns beside me while i am attacking.   It <br/>
&gt;does not<br/>
&gt;happen often, but its always my fault when it happens.  It is, however, <br/>
&gt;NEVER<br/>
&gt;due to the fact that someone else purposely tried to kill me.  Maybe this <br/>
&gt;will<br/>
&gt;be different if i am in a dungeon, but again i don&#39;t goto dungeons and <br/>
&gt;won&#39;t go<br/>
&gt;anytime soon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      To those people who are very ANTI--KS, i used to be just like you.  <br/>
&gt;Anonyed<br/>
&gt;at everyone who stole from me or my group, but now i just do whatever i <br/>
&gt;want, i<br/>
&gt;group a lot as well, and i KS the rest of the time.  It puts more fun into <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;game for myself since i love to PowerGame and lvl fast.  Do what you will , <br/>
&gt;try<br/>
&gt;to KILL those darn KSer if u wish, if they die, its their fault for being <br/>
&gt;stupid<br/>
&gt;and not carefully looking at the situation at hand.<br/>
