Words are the prime research ingredient for a magician like runes are for a <br/>
wizard. I do not know which magician spell it is used for since im not a <br/>
(poor) magician :). Words have the same value as a rune, about 1pp and some <br/>
gold if you sell it in a store, but i strongly suggest that you sell it to a <br/>
magician since it is really really hard to find both runes and words and us <br/>
spellcasters should support each other. I suggest taking max. 2pp for it.<br/>
