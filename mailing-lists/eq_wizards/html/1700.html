<div id="ygrps-yiv-1577436813">Very well said.  I would have to agree with you on this one.  I have tried<br/>
not to get into the discussion about this type of thing but I feel that what<br/>
was said here deserves some attention.<br/>

&gt; If you are playing +PVP then I can see twinking have a negative effect<br/>
&gt; on gameplay, but in -PVP it doesnt. &quot;Then all the honest players will be<br/>
&gt; left behind&quot; from your post suggests that you think the game is a race<br/>
&gt; to get to the finish line. Well, words in, the race was won by some<br/>
&gt; halfling rogue who reached lvl 50 before you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you don&#39;t like others twinking, don&#39;t adventure with them. Sneer at<br/>
&gt; them because they&#39;re &quot;rich snobs who got money from mommy and daddy&quot;.<br/>
&gt; Challenge them to a duel, show them that it&#39;s not the size of the sword<br/>
&gt; that matters, and then take the bigger sword from them when you win!<br/>
&gt; Laugh at them when they die. Roleplay the jealous commoner who has to<br/>
&gt; work for his/her way in this world. And feel better knowing that you are<br/>
&gt; the true winner of the race to have fun and enjoy the game!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You know what I&#39;m tired of? People trying to enforce their playing<br/>
&gt; styles on others. They think that just because a person does something<br/>
&gt; that they don&#39;t like (but doesn&#39;t actually hurt them) that the person<br/>
&gt; should be banned! Bah! Just as in real life there are people born with a<br/>
&gt; silver spoon up their a**. There are people who like to powergame and<br/>
&gt; dont roleplay. Live with it. Learn from it. And go buy yourself a<br/>
&gt; platinum spoon with your hard earned money. Then wave it in their face,<br/>
&gt; type /rude &lt;twinker&gt;, and go on your merry way.<br/>
