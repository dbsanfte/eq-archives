 </span></blockquote>Not that I know of.  No faction messages are given.  What you DO get<br/>
is good xp and great loot (lightstones and greater lightstones).  Make<br/>
sure you have a magic weapon to hit them with, because if you don&#39;t<br/>
and mana runs out, you&#39;re dead as a doornail.  Also make sure there&#39;s<br/>
only one around, because they DO assist and believe me, you don&#39;t want<br/>
two wisps on you.<br/>
