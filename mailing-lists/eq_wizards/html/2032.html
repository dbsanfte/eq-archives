<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620606455">Familiars would be great.  I love the idea.  Have any of you seen the<br/>
picture of the fairy dragon that was posted as a screen shot of the day?<br/>
That would be AWSOME flying around your head just providing even a little<br/>
more mana and the visual would be GREAT!   Make them do like 1-2 points of<br/>
damage with a chance of root in the sting and almost no hps.  Change thier<br/>
wing colors with your level and make them give us like 5-100 more mana<br/>
(level dependent).  That would be Amazingly awsome.<br/>
