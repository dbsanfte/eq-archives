<div id="ygrps-yiv-1001907970">Well, runes, words, pages, etc are suppost to only be found on creatures<br/>
that are 16th level or higher. I find them on high level warriors in S Ro...<br/>
Found them in Upper Guk on high level frogloks... Its just a chance that a<br/>
creature that is 16th or higher will be carring them. I don&#39;t think the type<br/>
of creature matters. The creature doesn&#39;t have to be magical either.<br/>
<br/>
Once you get high enough to kill the higher level creatures you will start<br/>
finding them.<br/>

Does anyone know a website where it says where to find runes or which<br/>
monsters have specific runes because i&#39;m approaching 16 and i haven&#39;t seen a<br/>
rune in the game yet. And plz don&#39;t copy that thing that says it spawns on<br/>
magical creatures and some number or people will have runes that don&#39;t<br/>
pertain to thier class. Thanks for the assist<br/>
<br/>
