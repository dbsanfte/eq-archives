<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1732251520">I&#39;ve been subscribed to the list in digest form so I&#39;ve been pretty<br/>
much just lurking.  Anyway, some of the recent comments have got me to<br/>
thinking, and I thought I&#39;d drop a couple of comments, hopefully some<br/>
of which may prove helpful.  In no particular order . . .<br/>
<br/>
1) I think that discussions about new spells or spell modifications<br/>
are interesting, but they won&#39;t result in any patches in the short<br/>
term.  About the only way I can see Verant changing things is if they<br/>
don&#39;t see wizards hitting the upper levels (45 - 50) at about the same<br/>
rate as the other classes, and it&#39;s probably too early now to tell if<br/>
that&#39;s the case.<br/>
<br/>
2)  Having said that, the discussion might be good more for the long<br/>
run. If we come up with some good, well balanced ideas.  For instance<br/>
(???), wouldn&#39;t it be nice if wizards weren&#39;t just the masters of<br/>
space but of time.  How about a short term (say 6 to 10 seconds) haste<br/>
spell which affected movement and casting time etc. (maybe 3x), but<br/>
with a rapid burn on fatigue or a slow effect afterwards?  Allow for<br/>
that quick dash to safety, or a desperate burst of energy in a fight<br/>
gone bad?<br/>
<br/>
3)  It also seems to me that they&#39;ve been fiddling with our spells<br/>
pretty regularly.  I&#39;ve never been all that impressed with shadow step<br/>
or root, but I&#39;ve noticed recently that I will get several of my Roots<br/>
resisted consecutively on blues when previously I rarely had problems.<br/>
Am I imagining things here or have they changed something?  With<br/>
shadow step, it has always been pretty random but it seems they&#39;ve<br/>
expanded the range.  Last night while playing around with it near the<br/>
gates of Qeynos, I cast it once and zoned to Qeynos hills.  Not sure<br/>
if this is a good thing, and I haven&#39;t tried it in a dungeon.  I just<br/>
imagine jumping out of the &#39;ole frying pan and landing in some place<br/>
much much hotter.<br/>
<br/>
4)  There has been some complaining about Eye of Zomm.  It&#39;s all<br/>
valid, as far as I can tell &lt;g&gt;, but along with the open doors trick,<br/>
you may not know that you can also slap a gaze onto the eye to see eve<br/>
n further.  One other fun thing you can do with it is to see beyond<br/>
zone borders.  Not useful in a<br/>
game sense, but interesting if you want to tell how the zones are put<br/>
together.  (The world is flat folks and, as near as I can tell, it<br/>
rides on the back of a grizzly bear &lt;g&gt;.)<br/>
<br/>
5)  One other thing to keep in mind about Eye of Zomm is that Verant<br/>
may later add some useful conjuration spells to the wizard class.  Who<br/>
knows?  However, what many higher level wizards have discovered is<br/>
that it can be a serious pain trying to get stats to increase when<br/>
they are disproportionately low--i.e. when you have neglected them for<br/>
a long time.  You may want to use the Eye spell for a while each level<br/>
to keep conjuration up just in case.<br/>
<br/>
6)  Same thing holds true for weapon skills.  If you ever end up in a<br/>
duel with another spell caster, you might find throwing especially<br/>
useful.  Pick up some shirkens from a local monks guild or someplace<br/>
and practice when you are low level.  Advancing later can be tough,<br/>
and you can advance this skill higher than your normal offensive<br/>
skills, I believe.<br/>
<br/>
7)  Recently, we&#39;ve had a bit of spam.  I guess that&#39;s to be expected<br/>
and endured.  What I find more annoying are all of the people that<br/>
repost the spam in their replies.  For those of us getting this list<br/>
in digest form, it just gives us the same wad of garbage to wade<br/>
through again and again.  Please don&#39;t do that.<br/>
<br/>
8)  Some of you are looking for good areas to hunt.  After about level<br/>
11 or so, I recommend that you spend a bit of time in N. Karanas.  You<br/>
are near Paw if you need cash or a change of pace, the beetles are<br/>
excellent xp (pincers up to level 15, borers for the next couple, and<br/>
then scythes).  I&#39;ve been soloing there for some time.  The zone<br/>
*looks* scary because of the griffs, but it keeps down the riffraff.<br/>
Plus the mobs don&#39;t spawn or enter the teleport area (4 large pillars)<br/>
unless trained, so it makes for a reasonable safe zone.  Zone boundary<br/>
and guards are nearby, etc.  The cash is low (unless you have a lucky<br/>
run with wisps), but with an agility of 85 or higher you can outrun<br/>
the beetles which makes them especially nice targets.  No need to<br/>
Root.  Shoot, run, shoot, run, shoot, close and finish.  I&#39;ve seen<br/>
wizards level from about 12 to 20 there, and come back later for some<br/>
of the bigger mobs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
9)  If you are running and you know you are going to die, head for the<br/>
biggest mob.  There is much less xp loss against mobs that are higher<br/>
level.  Getting killed by a hill giant or a griffon at level 14 isn&#39;t<br/>
that big of a deal.  Getting killed by something that you con green<br/>
can cost you almost a whole bubble at the same level.<br/>
<br/>
Heh.  More than I intended to write.  I have other things to say, but<br/>
they can wait for another day.  Couple of questions though.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve purchased some netted the other day (cape, pants, shawl) and<br/>
didn&#39;t see any weight or AC advantage over cloth.  Is there any<br/>
benefit to netted and, if not, what should I be buying?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone on The Rathe interested in setting up a language exchange as is<br/>
going on on other servers?<br/>
<br/>
My apologies for the long post.  I&#39;ll try and keep my verbal vomiting<br/>
down in the future &lt;g&gt;<br/>
