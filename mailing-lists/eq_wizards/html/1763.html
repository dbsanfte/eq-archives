&gt; &gt;  At similar levels we should have the same ability to compete.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;Says who? Do you have the same starting point in life as the rich kid<br/>
&gt; across the street? No, you<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;don&#39;t. As I said, life is tough like that. EQ doesn&#39;t stand for equal,<br/>
&gt; buddy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then again, EQ is not life.  It&#39;s a game.  If you want real life, you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; need to turn on your computer.  But in a game, there&#39;s nothing that says<br/>
&gt; that at similar levels we shouldn&#39;t have the same ability to compete.  This<br/>
&gt; is a judgment call.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So you&#39;re saying that since there is nothing that disproves that theory,<br/>
it&#39;s correct? No, that is not the way logic and argument works.<br/>
<br/>
If you (or anyone else) claim that all characters on Norrath at the same<br/>
level should be equal, please prove it.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, there is no indication that it should be so.<br/>
