<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963567667">Ak&#39;anon has them.  One of the merchants in the Library common area sells<br/>

&gt; The kicker of it is that I am a GNOME.  I have been to every city.  Even<br/>
&gt; the Troll and oger city with other characters.  There re NO Gnome sized<br/>
&gt; robes.  Not even in Ak&#39;Akanon.  I lost my guild robe when I was first<br/>
&gt; starting out.<br/>
