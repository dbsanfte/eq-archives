<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039487509">I never really rooted and I still dont that much.  I do root more now<br/>
then at a lower level.  I just usually got far enough back and got at<br/>
least 2 spells off before I started getting hit.  Then I would just beat<br/>
the crap out of whatever I was fighting and I usually win.<br/>
