<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435430336">I like that idea about root.  That would be a very minor yet nice thing for<br/>
us.<br/>
 <br/>
I also like the idea of being able to customize spells (a little bit).<br/>
Maybe have trade offs like if you want your Shadow step to teleport you more<br/>
in a straight line then you would have to use more mana when casting it or<br/>
maybe it would have to take a little longer to cast.  I really do think that<br/>
we should be the master of our spells and at least any spell we research (I<br/>
too think it would be fun to have to research all spells past first level -<br/>
of course the components would have to be easy to find) we should be able to<br/>
customize a bit.  That would make us feel a little more like wizards and not<br/>
just &quot;battlefield artillery&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
Good ideas!<br/>

Ok, I&#39;ll grant you that maybe we shouldn&#39;t know when Root is about to end.<br/>
How about, as it wears off, the *victim* (he he) starts to move slowly at<br/>
first towards us and then faster, faster etc.    Then we would be able to<br/>
decide whether to run or not...  Or, even better, get rid of Root and<br/>
O&#39;Keils Radiation and replace with an offensive/holding spell, something say<br/>
similar to Bigby&#39;s Crushing Hand.  Imagine the animation for that one!  A<br/>
high wailing keening noise as a giant, disembodied, ghostly hand flies from<br/>
our fingertips, grows and wraps around our foe, slowing/stopping him in his<br/>
tracks and adding a modest amount of crushing damage to boot!  &lt;ahhhh...<br/>
drool...&gt;  Who wouldnt want that spell?  AND it fits in with &quot;Best defense<br/>
is offense&quot;.  I would sacrifice Root and O&#39;Keils for that spell or something<br/>
like it.<br/>
 <br/>
As for Fade and Shadowstep, I cant speak for Shadowstep, but I have been<br/>
teleported EVERYWHERE with Fade.  Backwards, Forwards, sideways, 1 foot to<br/>
really far away!  Gee.  Thats helpful.  Hmmm.  I am a Wizard.  Physically I<br/>
am extremely weak.  Blown away by a stiff breeze kinda weak.  I approach my<br/>
mentor.  &quot;Please&quot;, I beg him &quot;can you show me how to harness this tremendous<br/>
power we have to help me escape an angered creature.&quot;  &quot;Of course, buy this<br/>
spell of Fade and you will be put safely beyond the reach of your foes.&quot;  He<br/>
smiles warmly and kindly at me all the while accepting my hard earned gold.<br/>
I run out of the shop so intent on my shiny new spell, that I don&#39;t notice<br/>
the mocking laughter from behind. &lt; A random distance and direction is sheer<br/>
lazy programming.  OK lets see, generate 2 random numbers, apply to current<br/>
coords.  There, thats it for that spell&gt;  Traditionally in fantasy<br/>
literature, Wizards dont go about popping themselves somewhere they cant<br/>
see...thats a good way to end up part of a rock or tree... Hey Verant,<br/>
heres any easy fix for you.  Make Fade go in the direction we are facing a<br/>
minimum distance...make it a quick escape spell.  Put the onus on the Wizard<br/>
to face himself in his chosen escape routes direction.  Things start to go<br/>
bad, Fade and run like hell.  Done. Wouldnt really need Shadowstep then<br/>
would we??? Frees up another spell...hmmm.<br/>
 <br/>
I read somewhere a Verant programmer said he only had so much room in a<br/>
database for spells...thats kind of sad really...maybe that is why there are<br/>
some missing animations and shared animations.<br/>
Personally, I would rather have to research and or quest for ALL OF OUR<br/>
SPELLS,  IF and only IF we could design them the way we wanted...  so that<br/>
my Fade was different than someone elses... but I know that is a pipe dream<br/>
so dont flame me for it okay?<br/>

Sorry about the long post, happens when you are a fast typer...</div>
