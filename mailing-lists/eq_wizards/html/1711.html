&gt; &gt; You&#39;re just upset<br/>
&gt; &gt; that she gets an advantage you didn&#39;t, right? Well, life is tough like<br/>
&gt; &gt; that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Damn right I am upset.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Awww.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I play a limited amount of time and I have to compete with everyone else<br/>
&gt; in the game.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Newsflash: no you don&#39;t. If you want to compete, fire up Half Life and compete for frags. There&#39;s<br/>
competition. EQ is not.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  At similar levels we should have the same ability to compete.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Says who? Do you have the same starting point in life as the rich kid across the street? No, you<br/>
don&#39;t. As I said, life is tough like that. EQ doesn&#39;t stand for equal, buddy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  But with her<br/>
&gt; twinking I am at the disadvantage.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No! You are where you would be anyway. She has some advantage, but it&#39;s not an advantage OVER YOU.<br/>
Unless you are playing on Rallos Zek or +pvp you are very misguided as to the true nature of EQ.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  While she coasts yet another character to the upper levels<br/>
&gt; AT MY EXPENSE!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How exactly is it at your expense?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Yes I am upset and yes she should be told to play fair like the rest of us are<br/>
&gt; forced too.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, it&#39;s time for a new order! A revolution! Kind of like 1917, right?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Red Norrath&quot; does have a sound to it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well, life is tough like<br/>
&gt; &gt; that. Whether she gets an advantage or not, is none of your business<br/>
&gt; &gt; because it doesn&#39;t really affect you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It does affect me.  It makes that many fewer creatures at my level available for me to kill in<br/>
&gt; an HONORABLE way.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, come on! Are you saying you&#39;re having difficulty to find kills because of twinkers? The % of<br/>
twinkers in the game is probably 5-10 MAX. Norrath is crowded, no doubt, but don&#39;t blame twinkers<br/>
for hunting hardships.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  This makes my job (an already difficult one) even more difficult and that is<br/>
&gt; why twinking is the WORST POSSIBLE OFFENSE.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Uh, no. Don&#39;t you find kill stealing or Guild camping worse? Man, it looks like you&#39;re really fired<br/>
up about this, eh?<br/>
<br/>
Listen, if you&#39;re on Solusek Ro, I might help you out, you know? Would 10-20pp help the revolution?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And remember, she had to work her<br/>
&gt; &gt; way to level 22 before that as well, so she is only giving her other<br/>
&gt; &gt; Char something she rightfully earned.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And just WHAT is your point?  Because she has one character at a high level and can play in<br/>
&gt; areas that I cannot she has somehow earned the right to retard my low level characters<br/>
&gt; development (see above) making it even more difficult for me to get to my &quot;rightfully earned&quot;<br/>
&gt; 22nd level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As I said, the twinker&#39;s affect on hunting is negligible, at best. Can you prove the contrary?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; You are obviously a fool<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Obviously. I bow before your superior intellect, mighty one.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and most likely a twinker. I can only hope you are not on my server.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hah. I&#39;m level 13, and I have 60pp in the bank. All rightfully earned. I can hardly play enough with<br/>
one character, let alone two or more.<br/>
<br/>
Ever hear the phrase &quot;I might disagree with your opinion, but I&#39;ll fight to the death to let you<br/>
voice it&quot;? Well this is the same. I might frown upon twinkers, but I&#39;ll do anything to preserve<br/>
their freedom to do as they wish.<br/>
<br/>
Do you disagree, comrade?<br/>
