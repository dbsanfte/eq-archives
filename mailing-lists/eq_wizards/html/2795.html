<div id="ygrps-yiv-405511789">I have a little problem,  hop you could help me out,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m and Erudit ,  I reached lvl 8 yesterday and I can&#39;t buy any spell lvl 3<br/>
cause I miss money.   Everything I kill don&#39;t give me enough money.<br/>
I&#39;m hunting around Queynos Hill,  BB,  West Karana and I barely reach 60<br/>
gold in bank,  I really don&#39;t see how to make more money and lvl 3 spells<br/>
are something like 4 or 5 platinum.<br/>
<br/>
can you give me any advice on how to make more money disgarding XP for now.<br/>
I was told the Kerra Islan is a good place so I made the trip back to erudin<br/>
but I couldn&#39;t find anybody in the Island and nobody at Erudin to organize a<br/>
group to the Island. It seems like nobody knows Kerra ...<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance for your help<br/>
<br/>
Massue,  Erudin WIZ lvl 8</div>
