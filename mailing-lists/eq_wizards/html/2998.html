<div id="ygrps-yiv-89119368"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;personally the<br/>

Yeah, having the item spawn every time may help.  Kinda like how you would <br/>
play a single-player game where you kill the big baddie and win a prize a la <br/>
Zelda heh.  It still gives you the sense of acheivement and it will satisfy <br/>
those who need the items....you get it and you move on!  (one would <br/>
hope....) :)<br/>

Hey! by the way, Cazic is a great spot for those in their 20&#39;s.  I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
hang around without a group though...but if you&#39;re in a solid group you <br/>
can&#39;t beat the xp there.  I average 2 to 3 bubs of xp a night not to mention <br/>
pulling in near 100pp everytime I get back to town.  Heheh...last night I <br/>
was so encumbered poor Lim had to nearly crawl into town.  (one wonders <br/>
where a skinny wizard carries all the backpacks?  heh)<br/>
