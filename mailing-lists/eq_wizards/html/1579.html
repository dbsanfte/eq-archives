<div id="ygrps-yiv-521806419">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I have a 21st Lvl Dark Elf Wizard.  I&#39;ve fought many places with many different people and<br/>
here is some of what works and doesn&#39;t work...<br/>
<br/>
As for solo battle tactics the only thing I can say it NOT to be touched by the enemy. As<br/>
soon as they get up to you, it is very difficult to unload your mana on it.  I tend to get<br/>
as far as I can from the baddie and then cast lighting bolt as my first DD spell.  I&#39;ve noticed<br/>
that a lot of the time Force Shock is reisisted (grumble grumble).  Then it is a toss up to enstill<br/>
them or &quot;nuke&quot; them again. Either way seems to work well and hopefully they are dead.  If they<br/>
do manage to get up to me. I use shock of lightning, even if the baddie hits me I usually regain<br/>
consentration ( If the baddie cons as a blue. Whites and higher hit hard enough that you rarely<br/>
regain consentration).  Also if you are looking for killer exp for soloing I&#39;ve found that it the best<br/>
exp movement on my bar is found in the elements. (Think it over. :-) )<br/>
<br/>
Grouping can be hard for a wizard. There are not many tells, &quot;Looking for a wizard for group!&quot;<br/>
I&#39;ve spent 20 min at a time in Cazic &#39;Thule asking if any group needs a wizard. Just about any<br/>
other class that asks gets a group.  But once in a group things can go well.  The main thing I have<br/>
noticed is when your party pulls something I can cast a DD 83 - 125 damage spell and the mob will<br/>
NOT turn and come to me.  It is always the first thing I do. I&#39;ll usually then sit and med the mana back from<br/>
that blast. As long as you hit the mob from time to time you will be fine. But if you unload your mana like<br/>
a crazy manic your party will not beable to get the mob off you even with the most furious taunting skills.<br/>
<br/>
In a place like Cazic &#39;Thule I tend to use my level 12 and 16 spells (Execpt for Enstill) to do the damage.<br/>
The lizards just seem to resist the higher level spells at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
Well hope you found this helpful in this sea of crazy info.<br/>
Take Care. If you ever want to share some languages look me up on the Mithaniel Marr Server.<br/>

P.S.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone verify what I saw in Kedge Keep. I went in there just to go there and scope it out. I saw<br/>
no lvl 31st Sword Fish guarding entrance and inside (though I dared not to venture far) I saw no life<br/>
of any sort.  Have they not put in the mobs for that area???!!!</div>
