<div id="ygrps-yiv-477457967">if any of you happened to save the screenshot of EQSS&#39;s June 15th update, i&#39;d really like to have it. it&#39;s a picture of some really cool wizard opening the gate to the plane of hate. it looks like a huge brick wall with a mouth in the middle and a red eye on the top. the mouth has a bluish portal in the middle and it looks damned cool... if anyone has it email me personally</div>
