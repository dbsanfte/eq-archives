<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951865613">The reason an animal can attack through a wall is:<br/>
<br/>
There would be safe spots..A bear could not fit through a door....If you were losing a battle all you would have to do is run for shelter....Hey why do that just stand in there an cast spells....Get it?<br/>

&gt; Err.... not to be a party pooper, but ever seen Jaws? They can explain shark attacks any way they want. But probably the most glaring example of this is the inn just off the road in Western Karanas near the border to Northern Karanas. Was messing around with 2 other fellows looking for grizzlies back when I was 10th lvl. We stopped in the inn to resupply when a lioness strolls through the wall in the corner and starts to maul me. Then a lion started mauling another person so we finished off the lioness and proceeded to kill the lion. Suddenly I saw the text a hill giant hits Kebik for 90 pts of damage....a hill giant bashes Kebik for 50 pts of damage...dead. Then this guy starts in on me. hits me twice and I&#39;m still running, opened the door....he misses me...Take 5 steps and then I see the LOADING PLEASE WAIT..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Me dead. Alright, I can understand a hill giant ripping off a roof and beating the crap out of us. That&#39;s acceptable...sort of...but the lions walking through the wall is just wrong. Am I making a point here? No. Probably not. I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is, yes there&#39;s glitches and bugs. I knew everything would not be totally worked out, because there&#39;s always new things that crop up and they&#39;ll eventually be worked out. I&#39;d still rather play with all the bugs and all, than not play is what it boils down to.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, while I&#39;m on the subject I&#39;ll plug myself.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone interested in joining a guild? If you&#39;re on Solusek Ro and are interested please /tell me or reply to this post via email to me. Don&#39;t post a reply because I&#39;m sure that will piss off a ton of people. We&#39;ve got basically 2 rules.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1. Be helpful to other EQ players (rpging, and evil vs good issues aside I really can&#39;t think of any reason to be a prick to anyone lvls 1-7, we were all newbies once, and there&#39;s more coming. Unless they&#39;re complete losers, ummmm Hamblen a 3rd dwarf comes to mind.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2. No whining. This means no bitching and griping about graphic glitches, unfair monster tactics etc... /petition it, and move on.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s about it. See ya&#39;s !!<br/>

&gt; Just to inform everyone.  This behavior where monsters can attack through solid object is not a glitch.  It is a choice they have made, the code to turn clipping on for monsters is there.  It would be very easy for them to make it so that monsters cannot attack through things, but they have chosen to allow this.  I personally can&#39;t think of any reasons why they would allow this to happen, but I&#39;m sure they have their reasons.<br/>

&gt; thats has always been there. It just doesnt happen often unless you get to<br/>
&gt; higher levels. At lvl 12 I see it occur maybe 1 out of every 25 to 30<br/>
&gt; interrupts, and even then only if im fighting greens and low level blues<br/>

&gt; &gt;Well I think they have taken some of this in to consideration because it<br/>
&gt; &gt;seems they added somehting new to last nights patch.  During the game last<br/>
&gt; &gt;night I received a message while in combat taht stated &quot;You regained<br/>
&gt; &gt;concentration&quot; and it cast my spells after it told me I lost concentration.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Could be the first steps...?  Who knows.<br/>
