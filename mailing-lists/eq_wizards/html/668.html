&gt; skill as root,<br/>
&gt; (abjuration?) at each level, I cast a ton of fades to<br/>
&gt; increase that skill<br/>
&gt; and make sure its at its maximum.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing right or wrong here, but most of my mage<br/>
skills seem to be close to maxed.  I&#39;ve only had one fizzle at Bind<br/>
(out of 30 casts or so).  I&#39;m not going to bother with useless spells,<br/>
because everything seems to be going up nicely by itself.  Of course,<br/>
this may change as I level up, so I&#39;ll keep your advice handy.<br/>
