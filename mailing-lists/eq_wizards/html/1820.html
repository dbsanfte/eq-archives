&gt;Don&#39;t mean to bash you, but this is *not* a solution.  I am at level 16 and<br/>
&gt;I notice that the higher I get, the less and less well I fare in melee.  I<br/>
&gt;have a runed totem staff as well and I can hit ok against blue creatures,<br/>
&gt;but against a red where my spells are being resisted I can barely even<br/>
&gt;scratch the mob in melee...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is what I was talking about in an earlier post, but was assured by<br/>
many others that it gets better at higher levels, like in the 20&#39;s to 30&#39;s<br/>
(I&#39;m 11 now). I thought at the time that this was a ridiculously long time<br/>
to wait for the game to get better for wizards. Why SHOULD it have to take<br/>
so long? Now I see from someone with a lot more experience than I that it<br/>
doesn&#39;t get better. I think we need to seriously petition Verant about the<br/>
shortcomings of the wizard class. We need more buff spells to help<br/>
ourselves and our parties, and spells of protection, like you mentioned. It<br/>
seems to me that this is the sort of things wizards should be able to do<br/>
anyway. <br/>
