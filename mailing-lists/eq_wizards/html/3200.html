From 17 up to 19, Gators in Oasis seemed to pretty<br/>
much never resist it (meaning it worked about 1 in 3<br/>
times). Stuff in E Karana, up to lvl 20, just<br/>
basically always ignored it.  Except the Chasm<br/>
Crawlers.<br/>

&gt; I had the same problem, so i just step in kinda<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is definitely a feel thing.  Nuking slow is a<br/>
tactic for a tank-heavy group which involves long<br/>
fights. If I&#39;m in a caster heavy group, which takes<br/>
things down quickly, I&#39;ll generally just chain cast<br/>
and keep my fingers crossed.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; at your level shadowstep and then gate is a great<br/>
&gt; escape method...i&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; found that when you hit the really high teens though<br/>
&gt; that everythign moves<br/>
&gt; really fast and shadow step doesn&#39;t help as much<br/>
&gt; anymore...of course by<br/>
&gt; then the mana you spend for root is trivial, so root<br/>
&gt; and gate become a<br/>
&gt; decently effective strat...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My experience has pretty much been opposite that.  If<br/>
I&#39;m in a wide open area, Shadowstep/Gate is my only<br/>
prayer for escape (course, it also makes corpse<br/>
retrieval very frustrating).  Getting to higher levels<br/>
(late teens) just meant that Channeling was higher, so<br/>
Gate is less likely to be interrupted when they do<br/>
catch up to me.<br/>
