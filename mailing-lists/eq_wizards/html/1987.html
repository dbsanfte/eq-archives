<b>Subject:</b> Re: About cancel magic <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2092449790">I also am not too sure what the function of Cancel Magic is... I believe it<br/>
can undo roots but that seems to be about it....<br/>
Yesterday a druid friend and I were grouped fighting evil eyes.  He was<br/>
charmed and I finished the eye.  Even after the eye died, my friend was<br/>
still charmed and continued to attack me.  I then rooted him(we play on<br/>
Rallos Zek), he clicked all of his buffs off(which can still be done when<br/>
you are charmed), then cast cancel magic on him.  It said that he felt a bit<br/>
dispelled yet it did not cancel the charm.  Does cancel magic only give you<br/>
a chance to cancel the charm?  I thought that canceling charm would have<br/>
been one of the main purposes of this spell.  Also we tested cancel magic by<br/>
him casting stinging swarm(DOT) on me and me canceling.  It seems to work<br/>
sometimes, but not always... it may have something to do with being grouped<br/>
or not...  Does anyone have any data on how this spell works and when it<br/>
will work?  Also should cancel magic work against Necro DOT&#39;s?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
Do cancel magic take away Debuffs before buffs? or does it take away the<br/>
buff upper.<br/>
If I have these shields:<br/>
Lesser shielding<br/>
Resistant skin<br/>
See invisible<br/>
Drowsy<br/>
<br/>
Whould it take away Lesser shielding couse it is the first or does it take<br/>
away drowsy first becouse drowsy is a debuff?<br/>
<br/>
Hope you understand my question<br/>
