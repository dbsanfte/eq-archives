<div id="ygrps-yiv-1063845231">You can trade, sell, destory, mutilate, spindle, etc the robes you find on<br/>
NPC&#39;s that you kill.  This means your tank could give the robe if they<br/>
wanted to.<br/>

Do you have to be the one to LOOT the robe from him in befallen or can a<br/>
TANK loot the body then give you the robe???  Cus it would stink to have to<br/>
try to kill him again if a TANK accidentaly looted his body . . .  (I you do<br/>
kill him for his robe right?)</div>
