<div id="ygrps-yiv-222975401">Heh oh Neil.. we all have our days.. I certainly am no stranger to that.. did you read MY post about the no-no though?  I really hope everyone reads it and takes it to heart.  I am in the midst of writing a complaint to 989 or verant .. whoever the hell wants to listen to me, about the way the guide treated me and the accusative nature of their remarks.  I had good feelings about the staff and now I&#39;m not so sure.<br/>
