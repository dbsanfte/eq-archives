<b>Subject:</b> Wizards of Xegony! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-130520270">Greetings, I am a wizard on the great Server of Xegony. Seeing as we are<br/>
one of the greatest classes out there we wizards should know each other.<br/>
I propose a gathering of names of all the wizards we can find! I see all<br/>
these posts about sharing languages here, and trading items there, but<br/>
most of the time they are on different servers and what not.<br/>
<br/>
How many wizards on this list are from Xegony? Email me your character<br/>
names so I can put this list together and we will be able to share our<br/>
knowledge, experience, and adventures together. I would be most<br/>
interested in getting a group of like-minded, like-leveled wizards<br/>
together and seeing how we fare. Sharing languages and whipping mobs<br/>
into iobs, we can show those other classes that we are a force to be<br/>
reckoned with!<br/>
