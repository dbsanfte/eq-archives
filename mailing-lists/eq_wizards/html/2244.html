<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314524422">I believe this is the difference between being grouped the large majority <br/>
of time and soloing.  Soloing being much slower.  I have played around 9 or <br/>
10 days real time on my main character and am now level 16.  I could have <br/>
been much higher by now had I grouped a lot more than what I have.  I have <br/>
wasted time just puttering along myself.  But my main focus isn&#39;t on <br/>
leveling...although when I get close I sure like to be bumped to get new <br/>
spells.  :)<br/>

&gt; &gt;To his defense, I am level 20 now and also disillusioned with the wizard<br/>
&gt; &gt;class.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Of course hindsight is 20/20 but I&#39;ve invested over 6 realtime<br/>
&gt; &gt;days into my wizard and am too stubborn to give up on him. The spells of<br/>
&gt; &gt;the wizard are very limited. Sure we can do the most damage in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;shortest amount of time, but it&#39;s not THAT much more. But other than<br/>
&gt; &gt;that, we can teleport like the druid, and that&#39;s all!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is incredible to me..... I just turned lvl 13 and my played time is 9<br/>
&gt;days and 12 hours. Are you doing something special or am I just wasting a<br/>
&gt;lot of time?<br/>
