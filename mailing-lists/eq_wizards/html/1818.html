&gt; language lessons<br/>
&gt; on Solusek Ro. He was running around clutching his head and<br/>
&gt; screaming.<br/>
&gt; Passing out and all. Too funny. But to get to the meat of<br/>
&gt; the story, yes.You<br/>
&gt; DO have to zone to see an improvement or a new language.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I&#39;d just like the add coming to these language exchanges can be<br/>
very much worth your time.  After Saturday&#39;s session (hosted by<br/>
Zalbar) I now speak 4 languages excellently, and about 8 others around<br/>
average.  Even though not all of them are useful, I think it&#39;s fun to<br/>
be able to speak to everyone in their own language.<br/>
