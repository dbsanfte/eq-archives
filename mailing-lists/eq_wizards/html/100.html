     You don&#39;t need to be in a group. me and another wizard increased our lang while on the boat.. we used /tell and were not grouped but my skill in the lang he was speaking went up to below average from awfull :) I changed a social hot button so we both totally spamed each other with giberish text but it worked well <br/>

          You increase skill in languages by listening to your group talk that language.  You cannot improve by speaking, only listening.  And I&#39;m fairly sure you have to  be in a group. Tandayen, Dark Elf Wizard  <br/>
