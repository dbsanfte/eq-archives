&gt;I have an idea. All the other spellcasting classes have pets (including<br/>
&gt;hybrids with their charms). Instead of getting a pet, since we are so<br/>
&gt;mana dependent ( and the other classes have pets which do WAY more for<br/>
&gt;the mana then we can do with DD over time) we get a familiar.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
How about some other possible other effects ...<br/>
<br/>
At the very high levels it could regenerate mana (the mana we have stored<br/>
in it, not the mana stored in us).<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s large enough, we could use it for a pack animal. We&#39;re (generally)<br/>
not that strong and hey, it&#39;s not fighting - throw some saddlebags on it. =)<br/>
