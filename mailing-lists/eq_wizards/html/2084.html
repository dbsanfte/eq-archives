<div id="ygrps-yiv-820717883">I gave up my wizard quite some time ago, they really are quite weak, only<br/>
good for two things, grouping and stealing kills.  What do other spell<br/>
casting classes have that we lack?  Pets of course.  The steel skin, leather<br/>
skin line of spells should be altered in such a way that wizards from low<br/>
lvl&#39;s (perhaps 8) can summon a sort of wall.  This wall would be sort of<br/>
like a pet (graphically how it would show does&#39;nt concern me) but without<br/>
offensive capabilities, it would simply soak damage and allow a wizard to<br/>
not be interrupted.  For example, wizard A wants to solo an even fight orc,<br/>
so he summons his wall of whatever, that soaks 50 damage without the wizard<br/>
actually being hit, the wizard can skip the risky root opening shot and get<br/>
right to damage.  This would put wizards on an even playing field with other<br/>
magic classes, they NEVER root for their opening shot, that&#39;s what their<br/>
pets are for, we should&#39;nt have to rely on root either, we need something<br/>
more definite like this wall idea.  It&#39;s the only thing that would get me to<br/>
play the wizard class again.</div>
