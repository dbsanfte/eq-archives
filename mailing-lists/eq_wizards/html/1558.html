<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1063067310">According to Dan Alexander:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Real good idea... until the boat crashes and we get dumped back on the<br/>
&gt; dock, or in the water.  Still, if other folks are willing to risk it, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; game.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A good meeting point also is the great room in the tunnel from Commonlands to Ro.<br/>
Zone border is nearby (so you can hop and check at times), and so on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;*  People can wait at the docks and hop on or hop off as needed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Any stable place is better regarding that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;*  Convientent for people already traveling between Fawdwer and Freeport<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As would any place.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;*  No spells<br/>
&gt; &gt;*  Plenty of fishing available<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not on the boat. Ever tried fishing on it? I get the message that I must be on<br/>
ground (or something like that) to fish. That&#39;s a travelling boat, not a<br/>
fishing trawler :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;*  Boat zones periodically so skills can be checked<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>See above.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;*  A wide variety of people ride the boat, so it may be possible to pick up<br/>
&gt; &gt;other languages that you didn&#39;t plan on.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a good point.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;* And lastly, I think its just a really novel idea!  :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can&#39;t beat that one!<br/>
