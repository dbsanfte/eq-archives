<div id="ygrps-yiv-379582653"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; <br/>
&gt; i hope you guys understand that just about all of the high level <br/>
 </span></blockquote>wizards don&#39;t even HAVE weapons. i would much rather have 2 shimmering <br/>
orbs than a staff i barely hit with, but that&#39;s at high level, now i&#39;m <br/>
very much content with my newly bought Runed Totem staff.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes this is true at high level.  Until then you must melee.  So my <br/>
question stands what weapon is best?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; oh and about the making money issue: sometimes your lucky. I was at <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the dervish camp in Northern Ro on Fennin Ro and for some reason for <br/>
about 6 turns every derv that was on my turn had a BRONZE weapon! i <br/>
got 3 bronze rapiers! (3pp per rapier) i made 30pp in two hours !<br/>
<br/>
I am truely happy for you.  However, I went to NRO (with my bard I <br/>
will take Guile soon) and was squished twice fortunately exp loss is <br/>
inversely proportional to the creature level that kills you so other <br/>
than leaving an ugly mark there was no big problem with it.  On the <br/>
issue of luck, I have received 2 bronze weapons in all my time in NRO <br/>
and 1 or 2 gems.  How much time have I spent there you ask?  I have 5 <br/>
thats FIVE backpacks in the bank filled with derv rings that I cannot <br/>
pay people to take FROM me!  So please don&#39;t tell me about LUCKY ways <br/>
to make money.  I need real advice on tried and true ways to earn <br/>
money to equip my character.<br/>
