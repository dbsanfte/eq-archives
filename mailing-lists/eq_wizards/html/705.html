<div id="ygrps-yiv-370728274">&lt;&lt; Question 1: Has anybody killed this guy and what level<br/>
were you, etc. etc.?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
		He is a tough bastard and I have never seen anyone even get<br/>
close because of the guards and his charm spells.<br/>
<br/>
		&lt;&lt; Question 2: Is magic resistance used to resist the mind<br/>
warp?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
		Yes it is, you can resist the spells and you will thank the<br/>
heavens when you do.<br/>
<br/>
		&lt;&lt; Question 3: When I was still 12th level I cast Bind on<br/>
myself and my friend.  I got a<br/>
		message that I feel bound to the area (or something like<br/>
that).  My friend did not.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
		Self-cast bind will work anywhere in the world but if you<br/>
want to bind someone else they have to be in your group and they have to be<br/>
in a city zone. You can bind someone anywhere in Greater Faydark because<br/>
Kelethin is located in that zone but if you want to bind someone near<br/>
Steamfont you have to actually enter Ak&#39;Anon because the city is a separate<br/>
zone.<br/>
<br/>
		&lt;&lt; Question 4: Has anybody else experienced this?  Any<br/>
ideas?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
		Lego&#39;s and slavers are aggressive by nature and the worse<br/>
your faction is the harder it is to pull them off. I have heard that it is<br/>
possible to have a creature frenzy on you(which is the point where they<br/>
can&#39;t be taunted off of you) before you even attack if your faction is bad<br/>
enough.<br/>
<br/>
		Not sure about the keys as I never spent any time in<br/>
Crushbone, too many jerks around.<br/>
<br/>
		Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
		Yours,<br/>

		PS - Another funny one here, when you kill a Crushbone orc<br/>
they say &quot;You will have all the Crushbone legions on YOU tail for this. I<br/>
bugged this and they said that they will go back and fix those types of<br/>
errors after all the &quot;important&quot; game play issues are resolved.</div>
