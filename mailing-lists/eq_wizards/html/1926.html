<div id="ygrps-yiv-545919362">According to Donald Taber:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When I went there to kill Foragers and Hunters I was 13th and could solo<br/>
&gt; 3 on my own.  I would say you could probably solo them at 8th to 10th level.<br/>
&gt; You do have to be careful with the Hunters because they will attack you on<br/>
&gt; sight, so you can end up with others joining the fight.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can just solo one at level 8 (soloed some of them at that time, but<br/>
never got woven at the time). I haven&#39;t met Froglok foragers, only fishermen,<br/>
and those are rumored to have woven too.<br/>
