<b>Subject:</b> Interesting tactic to damage monsters... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-792759222">This weekend I was experimenting with an interesting new tactic to cause<br/>
damage to monsters.  The problem was that I really couldn&#39;t verify how well<br/>
it works, because I&#39;m not certain if monsters take damage from falling or not.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But what I would do is hit a monster from long distance with a spell, then<br/>
run up a VERY VERY steep cliff.  Once at the top of the cliff I wait till<br/>
the monster hits me, then I hit the fade button.  9 times out of 10, fade<br/>
takes me to the bottom of the cliff.  The monster then jumps off the cliff<br/>
to get me, and I&#39;m assuming it takes some damage from the fall.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I did this a couple times... the biggest problem is finding suitable cliffs<br/>
to fade from, and the second worst problem is being careful not to fall in<br/>
myself.<br/>
