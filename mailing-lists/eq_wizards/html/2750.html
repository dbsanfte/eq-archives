<b>Subject:</b> Water Crystal Staff <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-978222912">Water Crystal Staff looks neat , but why pay 300 plat ? or even 100 plat ? when<br/>
you can get it for free ?<br/>
<br/>
If you have 300 plat to buy the staff, than you must be at least lvl 25 to be<br/>
able to save up that much cash(no tweakers)<br/>
<br/>
Webclaw is the goblin that has the staff, and its only lvl 25-30<br/>
<br/>
a team of lvl 21s can take him out easily.<br/>
<br/>
he spawns at approximately 8 locations around Lake Rathe<br/>
<br/>
One of which you can wait for him is across from the Madman.<br/>
<br/>
Another place is at the central Flame Alter island.  at the base of the alter,<br/>
just sit with ur group and he will eventually walk by.<br/>
<br/>
Or you can find a ranger and seek him out.   He&#39;s really not that hard to find.<br/>
<br/>
People seem to think Water Crystal staff should sell for so much , even though<br/>
the stats are not so good.  He just want to sell for a lot cuz they are greedy<br/>
and not many ppl know where Webclaw Spawns.<br/>
<br/>
btw, Webclaw is a named Goblin, i can&#39;t remember his last name.<br/>
<br/>
have fun ! and get ur guild to help !</div>
