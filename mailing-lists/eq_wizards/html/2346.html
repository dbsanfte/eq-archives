&gt; Hm. Methinks you can &quot;Exploit a bug&quot; and call it cheating :P<br/>
&gt; But usually when you take advantage of a good situation, that situation<br/>
&gt; was not intended by the designers. Actually talking about really good<br/>
&gt; situation, like where you find bronze stuff on decaying skel or<br/>
&gt; somesuch. And I&#39;d call that cheating and exploiting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hm, guess I don&#39;t really differentiate. Give an example where exploiting<br/>
&gt; is not cheating...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, tough! They (Verant) made the game, and now they are trying to punish US<br/>
for playing it the way it is! They designed it and they have the bugs in. So let<br/>
them fix the bugs and not tell us &quot;no you can&#39;t do this&quot;. That&#39;s stupid. They<br/>
created the game and I&#39;m playing it the way it is.<br/>
<br/>
furthermore, nowhere on their site do they have a list of exploits that should be<br/>
avoided. They do not give us a list when we log in to the game. Yet, we&#39;re<br/>
supposed to just know them? How stupid is that?<br/>
<br/>
THEY made the design error / bug, and now they expect us not to &quot;exploit&quot; it<br/>
without even letting us know what&#39;s an exploit and what&#39;s not! They are punishing<br/>
us for their laziness / un attentiveness!<br/>
