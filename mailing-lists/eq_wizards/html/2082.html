<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757584471">Heyas, I got no beef with you, and yes, I think that if you keep up thinking<br/>
that a wizard is a crappy class, and want to change it to your needs, thats<br/>
never gonna happen, so why dont u stay on topic first off. The topic for this<br/>
list wasnt &quot;Discuss how a wizard can be made better&quot; so over all, you flamed<br/>
me with a dumb response that made jack for sense.<br/>
I also don&#39;t see why your freakin out so bad, I mean, gosh, I personally<br/>
understand how the wizards work in all games, they ARE NOT supposed to be the<br/>
masters of melee, or other magic kinds, they are supposed to be able to Damage<br/>
the target very fast, thats EXACTLY what they do! If you think a wizard needs<br/>
to be able to get more mana or crap, your insane, I can kill 4-6 blues in a<br/>
row without medding(at lvl 9), and I can take on 3 blues at a time, and I can<br/>
do 1 even! If you dont got what it takes to be a wizard, then just go play a<br/>
Magician so you can summon, go play your trix, wannabee.<br/>
