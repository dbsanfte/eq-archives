<div id="ygrps-yiv-1608293210"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; FYI there is a teleport in south ro<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have seen the teleport pyramid before.  If you actually know how to get<br/>
the spell that takes you there, please tell me.  I would love to have a<br/>
teleport there, but to date I have never seen the actual spell.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, regarding the other question about the Cazic-Thule gate, if you go<br/>
strait west from the teleport pyramid, you will come to the door to<br/>
courtyard.  The path curves a bit, but go as close to strait west as<br/>
possible, and you should be able to find your way out.<br/>
