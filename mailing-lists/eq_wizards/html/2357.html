<br/>
Tips for learning a language within 20mins:<br/>
<br/>
-- find someone who is &quot;excellent&quot; in the language you need<br/>
-- have that person use a hotkey setup with all 5 lines filled in so that <br/>
you get spamed 5 times each time he/she hits the key.<br/>
-- spam away.<br/>
<br/>
Learned Gnome to Excellent once just travelling across the boat.  I learned <br/>
both Old Erudian and Combine just sitting 20 mins each with somebody too.  <br/>
It goes real fast.<br/>

&gt;I have just reached lvl 16 and now have the task of getting runes to make <br/>
&gt;my<br/>
&gt;spells. I gather I need to learn other languages to read the books, I sat<br/>
&gt;talking to another player to learn gnomish and over an hour it increased <br/>
&gt;about 7<br/>
&gt;times. Is there some special way of learning this better or is there a list <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;contains the rune combinations as finding someone to talk to for hours is <br/>
&gt;very<br/>
