<div id="ygrps-yiv-714101557">Of course there would need  to be ways to &quot;balance&quot; it out. But since there<br/>
is a 100% chance all combo&#39;s would be pre-thoughtout by verant. But for a<br/>
more manna efficent or a higher damage spell it would need to have like a<br/>
longer casting time. You cant just have a &quot;better nuke&quot; , there needs to be<br/>
downsides to it aswell =)<br/>

&gt;If they could prevent people exploiting this (and thats a big if)<br/>
&gt;I REALLY love the idea of giving people better (more mana efficient,<br/>
&gt;higher damage, whatever) spells for the work they put into research.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m going to Feedback that if you don&#39;t mind. =)<br/>

&gt;&gt;I think that some of you may of missed the point in my &#39;make research fun&#39;<br/>
&gt;&gt;post. I am a lvl 34 wizard, I have purchased most of my spells from Erudin<br/>
&gt;&gt;and Felthiwe (sp?). But my post was NOT just aimed at wizards, but magic<br/>
&gt;&gt;users in general. If they made all the &quot;run of the mill basic spells to<br/>
&gt;&gt;their class&quot; buyable. Such as<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;- the necromancers pet<br/>
&gt;&gt;- high lvl DD spells for magi and wizards<br/>
&gt;&gt;- the &quot;basic&quot; enchanter spells (no clue what they are)<br/>
&gt;&gt;- magicians pets (arnt those buyable now anyways?)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;But leave the more interesting spells up for research only, and more<br/>
&gt;&gt;powerfull varaints of spells research only.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Research SHOULD be something that is fun and adds to the game enviroment,<br/>
&gt;&gt;not a distracting pain in the ass that makes you wish you were a wis-based<br/>
&gt;&gt;caster since you could just buy all your spells.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Also the suggestion about being able to &quot;Dig Up&quot; runes is to provide us<br/>
 </span></blockquote>with<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;something to do BESIDES KILL THINGS . To many things in EverQuest focus<br/>
&gt;&gt;around one thing - KILLING<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;- To gain any descent amount of exp. you KILL<br/>
&gt;&gt;- To get any sort of loot/items. you KILL<br/>
&gt;&gt;- To make the next level. you KILL<br/>
&gt;&gt;- To find runes. you KILL<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Being able to quest and &quot;search&quot; for runes would add a fair bit to the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>game<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I think.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Anyways, research could also add DIVERSITY to the game. To many people are<br/>
&gt;&gt;exactly the same. Same amour same spells same this same that. The only<br/>
 </span></blockquote>thing<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;that sperats people are their stats. And for wizards it&#39;s basicly maxed<br/>
 </span></blockquote>int<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;and what you can put into the other stats is slow it they dont make that<br/>
&gt;&gt;much of a diff.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;But imagin this..<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;- Sammy the wizard has reached lvl 29. He gates over to Tox forest, and<br/>
&gt;&gt;trundles over to the libary of Erudin and buys his spells. They are the<br/>
&gt;&gt;basic run-of-the-mill spells.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;- Jippy the wizard has reached lvl 29. He gates over to tox forest, and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>buys<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;a few spells. He decideds to hold off on buying his gate spell because he<br/>
&gt;&gt;has some runes that have been rumoued to make a &quot;better gate&quot;, he also<br/>
 </span></blockquote>buys<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;the inferno spell, but dosnt scribe it right away.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;- Jippy wanders off to his lab, he mixes his runes and up comes a<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Portal&quot; spell, but sicne Jippy put hte time and the effort into this new<br/>
&gt;&gt;gate spell, it may be a tad bit faster then Sammies.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;- Next jippy wanders off to his bank account and digs up a &quot;vial of<br/>
&gt;&gt;healing&quot;, and &quot;Erud&#39;s slowing&quot;. He toss&#39;s his inferno spell into his<br/>
&gt;&gt;lexcion, and mix&#39;s in the vial of healing and erud&#39;s slowing. And he<br/>
&gt;&gt;produces a new spell, he scripes this into his book. His spell is more<br/>
 </span></blockquote>mana<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;efficent does a bit more damage, looks like the healing spell with a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>pallet<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;swap. But it also takes longer to cast.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;So Jippy and Sammy are both lvl 29 wizards with all of their lvl 29<br/>
 </span></blockquote>spells.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;But Jippy has some more &quot;exoctic&quot; ones that just arnt standard run of the<br/>
&gt;&gt;mill. It makes the 2 wizards different.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Also, the area effect and root spells should be research only, and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>possibly<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;the self-buff.. Whatever.. but point is<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;- Research needs to be changed so it is NOT a tedious pain in the ass. But<br/>
&gt;&gt;something that is fun, adds diversity to magic users of the same class,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt;does not distract from game play.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;As it stands now I find that research distracts more from game play then<br/>
&gt;&gt;anyhting else.<br/>
