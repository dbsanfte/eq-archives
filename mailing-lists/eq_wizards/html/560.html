I know that you can turn them into Lord Jaylel in the Paladins guild of<br/>
Felwithe. It is a quest that he gives out to paladins, clerics and those in<br/>
good standing with the guild. If you don&#39;t have standing you can still give<br/>
the item to him, but don&#39;t expect much more than a faction raise in return<br/>
for it.<br/>
This can also be done with the Orc Runner pouches. Hope this helps some.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;When will I be able to use this?  I think I need to speak the language of<br/>
&gt;the creature I obtained it from (I got it from an Orc Oracle I slew in<br/>
&gt;Crushbone) Will I also need the research skill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Assuming I need to learn Orcish, does anyone know where I can learn this<br/>
&gt;foul language??<br/>
