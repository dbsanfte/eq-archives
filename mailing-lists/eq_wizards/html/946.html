<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168078247">Your fishing skill does not have a lvl max. I know this for a fact because in beta i had a monk lvl 8 with a fishing skill of 128. Also swimming doesnt either as far as i know of. I swam a lot and have never maxed it either. And trade skills do not max out untill really really high like i believe 150 is max period. You can only put 21 points in a trade skill then you have to improve it by making stuff.<br/>
