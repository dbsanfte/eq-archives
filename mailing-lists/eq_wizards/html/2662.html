<b>Subject:</b> Rubies- Where to Find & QUEST <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1615750363">Hail all. I have been a lurker for a while & I have a question. First, I would like to get my hands on some rubies. Don&#39;t want to pay the 159pp that they sell for in High Keep. (I&#39;m still a poor Wizard.) I have heard that you can get one from the High Shaman in Splitpaw lair. Is this true? Next, on The EQlizer, I have read about a quest. It is involving Lyunga in Innothule swamp. (Only open to dark races) When you hail her she says something about needing a Ruby. When you give one to her you get 1 of three things. 1) Midnight mallot, 2) Bruthchopper, 3rd) A +6 int, +6 wis earing, with some charges of a necro spell on it!!!!!    What a prize!! Has anyone tried this and gotten any? Any other place to get rubies?  As for me I thing I will be camping Splitpaw. Since I&#39;m kinda high for it I&#39;ll see if I can make a deal with the campers. =) May Innorruk Guide Me!!<br/>
