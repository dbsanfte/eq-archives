<div id="ygrps-yiv-597725423">Here&#39;s some information gleaned from an exchange between an anonymous<br/>
player and Verant Game Designer Geoffrey Zatkin:<br/>
<br/>
                                 Anonymous: Out of a team of over 40<br/>
people there is 1 rune of frost.<br/>
<br/>
                                 Geoffrey Zatkin: The runes for ice<br/>
comet are found in places other than on<br/>
                                 the dragons. They are found just like<br/>
other lvl 49 runes - we just also<br/>
                                 threw them so that they would, in<br/>
addition, frequently pop on the dragons.<br/>
<br/>
                                  Anonymous:What about the other rune of<br/>
Astral? It hasn?t been found yet.<br/>
<br/>
                                 Geoffrey Zatkin: Sure it has - we have<br/>
people with a few of them. (person on my server<br/>
                                 has it I think .. not sure)<br/>
<br/>
                                  Anonymous:Add a buyable lvl 49 DD<br/>
spell that does between 800-900 damage for 300<br/>
                                 mana.<br/>
<br/>
                                 Geoffrey Zatkin: Something like this is<br/>
going in next patch.<br/>
<br/>
                                  Anonymous:Make the runes of frost and<br/>
astral just a tad more rare then the others,<br/>
                                 and found off of mobs lvl 45+, not just<br/>
the dragons/50+ mobs.<br/>
<br/>
                                Geoffrey Zatkin: Actually, they are<br/>
right now. (Good to know.)<br/>
<br/>
                                  Anonymous:Have the scroll of ice comet<br/>
found as a no-drop lore item that a SINGLE<br/>
                                 group of lvl 45+s could get.<br/>
<br/>
                                Geoffrey Zatkin: Going to be a quest for<br/>
this in addition to everything else. (very nice)<br/>
