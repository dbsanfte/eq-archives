<div id="ygrps-yiv-708344726">At what level can a wizard begin affecting a Hill Giant, and what level<br/>
affect it decently? Also Sand Giants, if there is a difference.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think around 29 o 30 you can start hurting them.  They will be red still.<br/>
I am 35 now and have seen some blue ones.  Most are Yellow to me with an<br/>
occassional white.  I&#39;m guessing they range from about 33 to 38 but I am not<br/>
sure.  I think the hill giants and sand giants are about the same except for<br/>
thier resistances.  I am pretty sure that hill giants tae more damage from<br/>
heat spells than the do cold.  I am guesing that sand giants are opposite<br/>
but haven&#39;t tried it yet.  They are fun ti kill with a good group, and they<br/>
have really good loot.  Usually a FS weapon worht around 5pp and anywher<br/>
from 10 gp(rare) to over 30 pp.(common)  After 3 or 4 hrs, I usually have<br/>
over 100 pp and so many FS weapons, I cant move.</div>
