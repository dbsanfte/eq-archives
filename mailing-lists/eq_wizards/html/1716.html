<div id="ygrps-yiv-569624094">Location of Erud&#39;s Crossing Isle:<br/>
<br/>
From boat that goes from Qeynos to Erudin it is the stop at halfway point,<br/>
boat will dock there for a couple of minutes...<br/>
<br/>
From boat that goes from Erudin to Qeynos - 1) Ride all the way back around<br/>
to get the dock mentioned above but this is a LONG trip.<br/>
2) As soon as you zone from Erudin to Erud&#39;s Crossing, face off the<br/>
right-hand side of the boat (South, I think), jump and swim straight ahead,<br/>
you can&#39;t miss the Isle, you&#39;ll see it on the horizon fairly quickly...<br/>
<br/>
TIPS:<br/>
The spiders and wisps do help each other so be careful of attracting<br/>
multiples. <br/>
Since the wisps help each other, it is best to hit them from afar and take<br/>
them down the hill to the beach area out of their normal traveling paths...<br/>
<br/>
Wisps require a magical weapon to melee successfully.<br/>
Spiders have nasty poison, don&#39;t fight them without group, even then it&#39;s<br/>
best to have someone who can cure poison<br/>
Snakes have much weaker poison <br/>
DON&#39;T kill the beetles there, they are protected by the Kerran cats that are<br/>
on the island.<br/>
Hopefully you can hook up with someone on the island who can &#39;show you the<br/>
ropes&#39; firsthand ))<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>

&gt; Hunting grounds for a low-level Erudite Wizard?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. Tox Forest (across bridge) hunting Kobolds and Skellies.  If you find a<br/>
&gt; Ranger to help, you can actually level fast, otherwise you&#39;ll be camping<br/>
 </span></blockquote>at<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the Kobold camps and fighting for kills, or wandering and hoping to find<br/>
&gt; something.  Unless they changed the spawn rates since I was there several<br/>
&gt; weeks ago, this can be slow compared to other newbie areas.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. Kerra Isle.  Level 6 is (IMO) about the time you can start venturing<br/>
 </span></blockquote>here<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but need a good group to do well.  Usually there is a lack of tanks in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; area of the world which makes this place more difficult than it should be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3. N. Qeynos then Qeynos Hills  -  I stayed on Odus for a long time before<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ventured across the ocean to Antonica.  When I finally did, my jaw DROPPED<br/>
&gt; at the site of N. Qeynos newbie area.  There were kills as far as you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>could<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; see since it is flat and practically treeless.  I was so amazed at how<br/>
 </span></blockquote>much<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; easier it would have been to level here never having to &#39;search&#39; for kills<br/>
&gt; like Tox Forest.  Even with the increased population, the ratio of animals<br/>
&gt; was still MUCH higher than Tox.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 4. Erud&#39;s Crossing  -  Once you get over 10, you can start to consider<br/>
&gt; stopping at the Isle in Erud&#39;s Crossing and hunt Wisps and Spiders.  This<br/>
&gt; island can be a little dangerous but you can make a TON of money here<br/>
&gt; getting Greater Lightstones.  This place is definitely Wisp Heaven!!  I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>made<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a ton of money here in my low teens and have been way ahead of the money<br/>
&gt; game ever since.  I recommend grouping here like most places.  Spiders<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; nasty poison so beware picking fights.  I can give more strategies on this<br/>
&gt; place but I&#39;ll shut up now ))<br/>
