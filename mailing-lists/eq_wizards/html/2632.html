<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724293540">I was messing around with some friends (whom are all casting classes and me<br/>
as a wiz) tonight and discovered(from a tip) something very interesting...<br/>
At higher levels everyone&#39;s DD spells take a while to cast...  Our secret<br/>
weapon is our level 12 DD spell shock of lightning.  It is hardly ever<br/>
resisted, casts extremely fast AND interrupts casting.  You can chain cast<br/>
this sucker so much faster than other casting classes it&#39;s sick.  Unless my<br/>
buddies went to their lower level spells, I would interrupt them every time.<br/>
Hoping you others out there will share your tips as well.<br/>
