<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145476119">According to Philippe Fuentes:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m and Erudit ,  I reached lvl 8 yesterday and I can&#39;t buy any spell lvl 3<br/>
&gt; cause I miss money.   Everything I kill don&#39;t give me enough money.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m hunting around Queynos Hill,  BB,  West Karana and I barely reach 60<br/>
&gt; gold in bank,  I really don&#39;t see how to make more money and lvl 3 spells<br/>
&gt; are something like 4 or 5 platinum.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kill Gnolls (cash and items), kill any Skeleton with a weapon in hands.<br/>
I can make about a PP in an hour.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; can you give me any advice on how to make more money disgarding XP for now.<br/>
&gt; I was told the Kerra Islan is a good place so I made the trip back to erudin<br/>
&gt; but I couldn&#39;t find anybody in the Island and nobody at Erudin to organize a<br/>
&gt; group to the Island. It seems like nobody knows Kerra ...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kerra might be hard for you at your level. The Wisps are a gold mine (they<br/>
have a random amount of cash on them, up to 3g once, and carry<br/>
lightstones ~1pp and greater lightstones ~4pp at times). But the Kerran<br/>
wisps range from level 10 to 12, and can only be hit by magic weapons.<br/>
Get a mage to summon you a dagger before hunting.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, it IS a perfect spot. I spent 6 hours of playtime at level 13<br/>
there, and made it to level 14, with 45pp in bank. I know a friend who stayed<br/>
there for level 14, when about 1/3 of the wisps became green, and he left<br/>
at level 15 with over 100pp in bank.<br/>
<br/>
Up to three players, you can set a good rotation on the main wisp spawn<br/>
point (cycle of 4 wisps). Don&#39;t camp the 2nd point, if you can find it<br/>
(spawns 1 wisp during the same cycle). But it&#39;s a boring activity.<br/>
Once, I had the entire zone for me. I couldn&#39;t even kill wisps fast enough<br/>
and I died once when I got three of them (deep blue &quot;risky&quot;) on me.<br/>
<br/>
Bring a cleric and a good party with you and you can hunt the zombie sailors<br/>
(weapons).<br/>
<br/>
Note that I doubt the Kerran will regard you amiably, however :)<br/>
