<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755410309">Greg my friend at early levels till about 20 we are the most wussy class around<br/>
but alas it all changes from there~!!!! we get some spells around level 20 that<br/>
can do like 200+ damage also i had a level 50 wiz friend (p3 beta had a gm boost<br/>
him) and the wizards best spell at level 49 does a whoooping 1100 damage heres a<br/>
little about Ice Comet<br/>
Ice comet is a cold based direct damage spell which delivers an obscene amount of<br/>
damage. This is the most powerful spell currently in<br/>
the game delivering over 1100 points of damage.<br/>
<br/>
No other class can do that much damage in 1 hit :) so stick in there and you will<br/>
soon find why we are masters of the realm!<br/>
