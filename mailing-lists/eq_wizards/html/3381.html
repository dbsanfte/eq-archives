<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233388507">I realize that isnt soloing you can try aviak tree when theres no one around <br/>
and kite the avocets and harriers or you can always do gaurds The weaker <br/>
qeynos ones sometimes but the best one I found was when i was level 34 me and <br/>
another level 34 went and took out this one even gaurd he was also corrupt <br/>
and us being evil got great faction his Name was something like Gaurd ummm <br/>
Mccleen or something with a mc in west Karanas near zone to hills at a tower <br/>
with another gaurd conning green he might be a bit tough for you but its <br/>
worth a try</div>
