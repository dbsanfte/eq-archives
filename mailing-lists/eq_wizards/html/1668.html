<div id="ygrps-yiv-308704220">Man why don&#39;t you leave her alone, everyone in the game isn&#39;t gonna fight <br/>
there way to the top some people play that way. Play the game yourself and <br/>
do your thing. It&#39;s kind of painfull to get a 30 day suspension. If you <br/>
really want to do harm to someone look for the people exploiting bugs and <br/>
stuff like that not some tiny little thing like tweaking their characters <br/>
and you never know she might have had something happen to her like for <br/>
example a friend of mine refused to pay a toll in freeport and the guard <br/>
attacked him so he killed the guard now he can&#39;t walk into freeport because <br/>
the guards kill him so he made a new character and transfered all his stuff <br/>
to his new character. Find things out or just mind your own buisness before <br/>
messing up a persons gaming. Her tweaking isn&#39;t doing you any damage so just <br/>
leave it alone.<br/>
<br/>
I mean no disrespect by it but it just bothersme to see people who have a <br/>
fit out of nothing.<br/>

&gt;believable) she says she just knows how to play well! lol... i wish i <br/>
&gt;remembered her name! GMs give a 30 day suspension for twinking muahaha<br/>

&gt;this, I have seen lvl 15 in oracle robes which are found of of lvl 40ish <br/>
&gt;mobs I think. But, what I dont like is how guilds &quot;take over&quot; an item spawn <br/>
&gt;site to supply all of their lower lvls with items takeing away the chacne <br/>
&gt;that others have to get the items.<br/>
