<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-7432418">Am I the only one with the impression that we&#39;re getting screwed when it<br/>
comes to diving up the exp while grouped? I was in a party that ranged from<br/>
level 9 to 12 while I was level 10. Everyone talked about the &#39;great exp&#39;<br/>
they got, while I was thinking &quot;Man they must never get any Exp&quot;. I asked<br/>
about what everyone got after a big fight and the results went something<br/>
like this:<br/>
<br/>
Level 9 got almost a 1/3rd of a bubble<br/>
level 10-12 got close to 1/2 a bubble<br/>
Poor old Cinius the only Wizard in the party saving everyones ass had to<br/>
wait til the next fight to notice a combined total from both fights of 1/4<br/>
of a bubble. Is it like this for anyone else? Hell I get 1/4 of a bubble<br/>
when killing a yellow on my own. In my opinion that makes it worth the risk<br/>
of getting killed by the yellows(happens maybe once out of every 7-10<br/>
kills).<br/>
<br/>
my apologies for the last double mail...had browser problems.<br/>
