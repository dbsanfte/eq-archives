- As a Wizard I am always told &quot;you will come into your own at higher<br/>
levels...then you will really cast hard dmg&quot;  I think they mean level<br/>
49 Ice Comet...but play the whole game to get one spell?  <br/>
<br/>
- Our DD should so more damage (20% more than other class DD or require<br/>
20% less mana)<br/>
<br/>
- Graphical features to all Bath Robe wearers is in dire need.<br/>
  -- You get that nice savants cap, black iron medallion, damask<br/>
leggings, skull of jen tra, different daggers and staff types (no new<br/>
graphics for them...warrior classes see differences in every<br/>
weapon..just about).<br/>
<br/>
Thats it really.  I dont think we need SPEED spells as we are not a<br/>
buffing class.  We are selfish by nature and concentrate on damage.  A<br/>
better damage shield would be nice because Okiels is ridiculous at<br/>
higher levels.<br/>
