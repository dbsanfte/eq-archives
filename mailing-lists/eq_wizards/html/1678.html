<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651183488"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I Have never experienced -PvP players getting hurt from my AE spells.  As a<br/>
matter of fact I target the tanks when launching them.  I know if I&#39;m close<br/>
enough I will take damage, but I have never seen -PvP person taking damage.  I<br/>
think if we could damage -PvP players this would definitely be considered a<br/>
bug, as we could kill PC&#39;s without fear of retribution.  So if it is happening<br/>
with a spell be sure to /bug it.<br/>
