<div id="ygrps-yiv-1665818244">Wait... Can anyone confirm that the Observer&#39;s Staff is 2H Blunt weapon??<br/>
I thought I knew that for sure but after thinking about it and checking on<br/>
it, I can&#39;t confirm.<br/>

		Problem is... I don&#39;t think you have a piercing upgrade &#39;til<br/>
Stiletto and I<br/>
		believe that weapon is designed to be too tough to get until<br/>
Lvl 40+.<br/>
		Although the RTS isn&#39;t perfect, it is pretty good and does<br/>
prepare you (2H<br/>
		Blunt skill) for the Observer&#39;s Staff which I think is<br/>
designed for Lvl 30+.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
		Stats on Oberserver&#39;s Staff:   Dmg 12, Delay 39, +5 INT, +5<br/>
WIS, +30 MANA<br/>
<br/>
		This is obviously an excellent weapon to keep in mind...<br/>
<br/>
		I think the information we keep seeing here lends credence<br/>
to the strategy<br/>
		of keeping all or at least two of your weapon skills up.  I<br/>
won&#39;t duplicate<br/>
		that thread here ))<br/>
