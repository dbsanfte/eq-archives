<div id="ygrps-yiv-720703483">Hm, I hear the magician blast spell at lvl 16 does about 80-95 pts of<br/>
damage. I guess I don&#39;t see why your using flame shock (102 damage at<br/>
lvl<br/>
16). I use the Lightning Bolt ( 117 damage at lvl 16 ) which uses only<br/>
10<br/>
more mana. So you have to aim, I usually tell my group not to fidget<br/>
when<br/>
fighting :P Or just circle stafe the melee for a good position.<br/>
<br/>
The actual damage/mana ratio is the same, ours just does more per blast.<br/>
According to eq stratics the base casting time for magician blast spell<br/>
at<br/>
16 is 3 seconds. Ours is 2 seconds. If this is true then that is an<br/>
advantage on our part.<br/>

&gt; During my adventures over the past weekend I happened to group with a<br/>
&gt; very nice magician and his pet &quot;Gonaker.&quot;  We did very well together<br/>
&gt; and had fun.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The problem was that he made claims that he can strike a target for DD<br/>
&gt; equal to mine.  We were both level 19 and sad thing is, I think he is<br/>
&gt; right!  Can anyone tell me how much mana is used and damage delivered<br/>
&gt; for the magician DD spell (16th level) equivelant to Fire Shock?  I<br/>
&gt; have a feeling it will be the same which is sad really.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Before I rant on my class I will need to know the truth on this matter.<br/>
&gt;  I love being a wizard and believe the long road to true power is a<br/>
&gt; long one.  But we should be doing more damage than a damn magician and<br/>
&gt; plus he gets a pet.  Let me know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
