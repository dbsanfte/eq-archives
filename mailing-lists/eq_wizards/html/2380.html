<b>Subject:</b> Question on skill maximums per level... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-791733291">Hi all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking on this list for awhile and have a question to ask you all.  I read awhile back, a posting from someone who said that a Wizard&#39;s Offense and Defense skills max out at (Level *4).  This seems to hold for me in Offense, as my Offense skill at 25th level topped out at 100.  For some reason though, my defense skill is stuck at 90...  Is this what everyone<br/>
else is exeriencing?<br/>
(Last night, I finally gained 26th level and my Defense went up to 91, so I know it was stopped at 90 until I leveled.)<br/>
<br/>
Also, my Dodge and Throwing skills have stopped advancing at 75.  Is this our limit in these skills as well?<br/>
<br/>
