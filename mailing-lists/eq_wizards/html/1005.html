<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-384637961">Root and blast the hell out of them, typical wizard style. They hit hard and<br/>
fast and it can be tough to get off a good spell while they are doing this. <br/>
<br/>
If you are in a group with a cleric(really just you and a cleric would be<br/>
perfect) have the cleric cast spook the dead on it. When it succeeds the<br/>
crow will turn and run and you can blast it to hell.<br/>
<br/>
If you are looking for solo critters near the Miller farm and the crows seem<br/>
to be a bit tough then I suggest killing grizzlies. They are easy to solo<br/>
and are worth decent exp as well they run when low on health which is always<br/>
a bonus when soloing.<br/>
