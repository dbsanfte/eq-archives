&gt; When I started, I was using a one-handed staff and my skill rose<br/>
&gt; relatively quickly to about 25-30.  I then switched to 2-Handed<br/>
&gt; staff to raise that skill, but it has NEVER gone up (while raising<br/>
&gt; from 6th level to 10th).  I tried seeding the skill with a few<br/>
&gt; training points, and it still has NEVER gone up.  Does the game<br/>
&gt; have an idea of a primary weapon or something?  Or have I<br/>
&gt; just been unlucky on raising the skill?<br/>
