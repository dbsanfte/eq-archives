<div id="ygrps-yiv-136436384">Everything up to lvl 12 is super easy, for lvl 12 to 13 i stayed in misty<br/>
thicket killing sand scarabs, strong giant spiders, strong giant wasp and<br/>
young kodiaks, lvl 13 to 14 i did in south ro, this zone is awesome, there<br/>
is a dune towards the oasis zone point where you can stand and the monster<br/>
just run away, so you step out, bait them back, step back cast and repeat to<br/>
take on yellow mummies and dune terantulas, cheesy but effective.  I did<br/>
this with my druid only doing 36 a hit, a wizard doing 78 would be much more<br/>
effective.  After lvl 14 go to oasis and group, simple as that, at lvl 18<br/>
your options expand to high hold for orc or gnoll groups, permafrost if<br/>
you&#39;re feeling brave, and parts of unrest.  GET ME OFF OF THIS FUCKING LIST</div>
