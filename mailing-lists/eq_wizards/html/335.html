My problem with O&#39;Kiels is that it just doesn&#39;t last that long.... Does the<br/>
duration increase at all? It doesn&#39;t seem to... I haven&#39;t used it in a few<br/>
levels tho so maybe I&#39;ll take a shot at it and give it another chance......<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, back to O&#39;Kiels.  Best instance is when you have a lead tank.  Odds<br/>
&gt; are he will take most of the hits, and prolly from two monsters.  He<br/>
&gt; will get hit about 10 times from one monster before its dead, and<br/>
&gt; another 20 or so from the second (each doing a measly 2 damage you<br/>
&gt; say!!).  That is about 30*2=60 points of damage, all for 15 mana -<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s a HUGE mana/damage ratio there (4.0).  Even with just one<br/>
&gt; monster, 10 hits is 20 dam - that&#39;s 1.33 ratio - better than any other<br/>
&gt; spell you have up to at least 20th if not higher.  Oh- it&#39;s also great<br/>
&gt; practice for your abjuration - a skill that is otherwise lagging<br/>
&gt; horribly cause you don&#39;t need to refresh your shielding that frequently.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lastly - I tend to agree with the person who said this list has a lot of<br/>
&gt; spam, but the problem is it is all basically topic appropriate.  I<br/>
&gt; personally would like to see a more focused list, maybe two lists here,<br/>
&gt; but that isn&#39;t gonna happen.  I already switched to digest when I got<br/>
&gt; hit with the initial 200+ mail, but still!  Any idea from anyone how we<br/>
&gt; can make this more manageable?<br/>
