<div id="ygrps-yiv-1406052713">Goto the official EQ website and read in the Developer section.  You<br/>
will notice that SPECIALIZATION has been implemented now for our use. <br/>
Yes, it was not working before, but is working now and explains how it<br/>
works.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m very happy with the way the Wizard class has<br/>
&gt; been made.  Sitting on your ass is part of being a<br/>
&gt; Wizard...  All the other points you made about a<br/>
&gt; Wizard IS part of being a Wizard...  Specialization<br/>
&gt; will make certain spell types more mana effecient<br/>
&gt; (depending on what you put practice into).<br/>
