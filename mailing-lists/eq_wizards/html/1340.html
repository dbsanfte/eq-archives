&gt; &gt;Dear Valacian,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;What exactly is the difference between root and enstill? And can you cast <br/>
&gt; &gt;them while getting bashed? Somtimes I can sometimes I cant.<br/>

same as root, but has a longer duration (and costs more to cast). HOWEVER,<br/>
the NPCs have the _same_ chance of breaking thru enstill as they do<br/>
breaking thru root. So even though enstill has the _potential_ to last<br/>
longer, it rarely does. So many higher lvl wizzes prefer to keep using<br/>
root rather than enstill since it works more or less the same, and costs<br/>
significantly less to cast. YMMV.<br/>
