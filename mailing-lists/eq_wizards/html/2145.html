&gt;I do not think that a shorter casting time would make that much of a diff.<br/>
&gt;&quot;ooh, I can get off more<br/>
&gt;spells faster just to have a mob turn on me, wow! that is so much better<br/>
&gt;then a magician&quot;. That<br/>
&gt;is just my take on it. I would rather have concentration allow for more mana<br/>
&gt;efficent casting, which<br/>
&gt;can be done by reducing the ammount of mana needed, or by upping the damage<br/>
&gt;done.<br/>

Okay, scratch<br/>
option c) faster casting on a successful check.  =)<br/>
