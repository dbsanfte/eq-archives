<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710319299">I like the Bind Sight spell for the most part but it does have a serious<br/>
flaw. Whenever the PC that you are bound to changes their level in<br/>
respect to yours it stops working. When I say level I mean physical<br/>
orientation in the vertical aspect. The best example I could give is<br/>
Unrest. (A great place for higher teens and low 20&#39;s players.) I cast it<br/>
upon our puller so that he can tag and run back without worrying about<br/>
communicating back to the group. I see what they pull and tell everyone<br/>
to get ready or that the puller is running to zone. It is also really<br/>
helpful if the puller gets rooted or stunned. I can go inside with the<br/>
rest of the party and help the puller since I know where they are within<br/>
the house. (I know the house pretty well since I pull with my wizard<br/>
when I am paired up with just my cleric friend.) If the puller I have<br/>
Bind Sight upon goes upstairs or downstairs the view on my screen<br/>
freezes like the character is stuck. This does not only happen within<br/>
Unrest. I was in Guk last night and it happened when a cleric I had Bind<br/>
Sight upon went downstairs to resurrect  a friend of mine. I was going<br/>
to tell him directions through the use of Bind Sight but as soon as he<br/>
went down the first ramp the Bind Sight broke.<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering if anyone else has had problems with this spell?<br/>
