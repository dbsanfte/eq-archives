<b>Subject:</b> ... Worried about high lvls. <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-408427485">I know that this can not be verified or not right now. But from what I<br/>
understand the runes that we need for our lvl 49 direct damage spell that is<br/>
the holy grail for wizards can only be found off of a lvl 53 dragon that<br/>
would take a few teams to get to and take out. This would make our spell<br/>
very very hard to come by, and would make it a very rare spell to have since<br/>
it would take some effort to get it. So this leads me to the fact that we<br/>
would be using our lvl 44 DD spell ALOT untill we were lucky enough to get<br/>
the runes that we would need.<br/>
<br/>
But, this brings up another thing - the Druids lvl 49 DD spell is EXACTLY<br/>
the same as the Wizards lvl 44 DD spell, and he does not need to research<br/>
it. So he can simply walk off to a vendor and buy it. No biggie, but the<br/>
thing that bothers me is<br/>
<br/>
- there is a high chance the lvl 49 wizard will be using his lvl 44 spell.<br/>
So therefore doing the same damage as a lvl 49 druid.<br/>
<br/>
.. So why bother being a wizard if at lvl 49 there is a high chance of doing<br/>
the same dmg as a druid?<br/>
<br/>
Ahwell.. that is just a bit of a bitch from me. If it is true that the runes<br/>
can only be found off of the ice dragon, I would be very upset, I dont want<br/>
to be a lvl 49 wizard that is just a druid w/o the toys because I can not<br/>
get a party together ( a few parites ) to slay the dragon. Also, chances are<br/>
there would be more then 1 wizard in the group, so we would need to share<br/>
the runes, and decides who would get it via lotto. .. which again would<br/>
lower my chances of getting that spell... just seams somewhat unfair to me.</div>
