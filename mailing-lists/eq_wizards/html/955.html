  Sorry skylee but your wrong about robes not being guild specific when it comes to the illustrious Erudite robes. They give more mana and are guild or class specific. There are certain robes, each being a different color, for all 4 spell classes (wizard, magician, enchanter, necro). </span></blockquote></div>
