<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852963341">Unfortunately I can answer this one, because it happened to me 3 times.<br/>
Gained 12th and then lost it again to the Gnoll Commanders of Black Burrow.<br/>
First time I was scared. I didn&#39;t really want to go and spend all the money<br/>
on the spells again. So, after I was &#39;returning to home point&#39; I immediately<br/>
sat down and started memorizing. Good thing is, your spells are still<br/>
scribed in your spell book. However, the game tells you that &#39;you&#39;re not<br/>
high enough level to memorize that spell&#39;....<br/>
<br/>
Conclusion: Die all your want !!<br/>

&gt;If you just made level 12, buy some spells, go out and die, lose a level<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(back to 11)...   Are you still able to cast those spells?<br/>

&gt;This has never happen to me, but I was wondering what happened?  Would you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>simply not be able to memorize the higher level spells?   Or would you be<br/>
able to memorize them, just not be able to cast them? or would you be able<br/>
to cast them because you have been to that level?<br/>
