<div id="ygrps-yiv-794779961"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Absolutly, as a wizard, you are the groups panic button.  Fighting a steady<br/>
&gt;stream of blues, a group that includes a cleric will almost have no use for<br/>
&gt;us until the puller yells,  &quot;Oh Shit, I pulled something big guys, get<br/>
&gt;ready&quot;  That is when we shine.  With our burns, nobody can save the <br/>
&gt;situation<br/>
&gt;faster than a wizard.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree.  In panic train situations, you may even find that you don&#39;t even <br/>
need to kill the Mobs...you just need to nuke them down to about 20%..that&#39;s <br/>
where they turn tail and start walking away.  That&#39;s one less Mob that the <br/>
tanks have to worry about.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, it&#39;s wise to go after that Mob or else he&#39;ll come back after a <br/>
little rest.  Either finish off that Mob with a nuke, or arrange one of your <br/>
tanks to break off of battle and go after that one.  I think this works for <br/>
Mobs in both Cazic and Mistmoore.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s not as crazy, it&#39;s best to wait a little longer so you can get the <br/>
kill shot and save your group from a chase. :)<br/>
<br/>
Whoohoo, trains are exciting sometimes...when you live of course heh.<br/>
