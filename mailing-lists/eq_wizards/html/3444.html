<div id="ygrps-yiv-101380203">Wow, great information!  Thanks for the tips.  I&#39;ve been hunting with a<br/>
steady group (mostly fellow guild members) since the low teens.  We will<br/>
definitely benefit from this!<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate it,<br/>

&gt; South Karana. Hunt aviaks, centaurs and elephants until you can<br/>
&gt; get into outside Paw Groups. Ive levelled from 22 to nearly 28<br/>
&gt; (last night) in about 3 weeks at Paw. The loot is good (FS<br/>
&gt; weapons, whips sell for 30-50, gloves for 300-500, other Paw<br/>
&gt; armor 10-15) and the money isnt bad, plat, gold and silver.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also try Crushbone Throneroom, aviaks in Rathe, Rathe Mountains<br/>
&gt; (Gt skels), OOT Aviaks and possibly gargoyle, Unrest, Sol A,<br/>
&gt; Najena, Everfrost mammoths (tusks sell amiable cha 100 for over<br/>
&gt; 10 plat), Perma by the zone... Dunno if Befallen is still an<br/>
&gt; option but Highpass maybe, and if you get sow or a druid hunting<br/>
&gt; partner you can kite some of the griffs in EKarana, or try the<br/>
&gt; spiders there if no Sow.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also Pickclaws in HighHold Keep maybe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Luckily you can travel around, and you will need to. 20 wasnt TOO<br/>
&gt; bad for me, but 22 I couldnt find open hunting spots anywhere,<br/>
&gt; till Paw was revamped. Pretty much havent left there since except<br/>
&gt; to bank... Bind spot is at the merchant by the Bank, Gate to NK,<br/>
&gt; run back. 5 minutes away time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good hunting<br/>
