<b>Subject:</b> places to solo from 15 - 27 im asking where to go from  27 to 34 lv and up? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-516511698">Dear friends i have made 27 and after i stay nearly 3 lv in mistmore im<br/>
little bit bored of it, it was a great place from 23 to 27 and it im sure<br/>
it is a place where one can get some more lv if wish but i wish some<br/>
change? What is a god place to make fast this lv 29 any advice where are<br/>
some god spawns with higs spawn rate and easy soloing when my friends are<br/>
not online?<br/>
<br/>
My list of god places for soloing<br/>
<br/>
lv 15 - 20 	Highhold pass orc side, when there is only one group you can<br/>
start taking one of low lv orcs wich spawn here at madly rates and after<br/>
this meditating, beter to go to gnoll side if there are to much kill<br/>
stealers as you will be incriminated of KS by your mare presence as wizard<br/>
there.<br/>
20 - 23 	Lake rathe Aviac guards (near zone to Arena), soulsek A entrance<br/>
tunel(careful of lava), Tentacle terors in najena (root, enstill one and<br/>
run to zone where you can fight other in peace)<br/>
23 - 28	Mistmore lake and canyon area(pull with eye, root one if 2 commes<br/>
and fight near zone), soulsek a safe room near zone to Nefagens lair(<br/>
enstill one, root and kill other in safe room then zone a sec to kobolds<br/>
lair if you dont have enough mana to kill other one, careful if greater<br/>
kobold is not camped zone back and meditate invisible) this two places are<br/>
dangerus in any case as you can pull caster wich have low hip points but<br/>
cast force shock wich is realy dangerus (i have mag resistance 65 and i<br/>
resist one of 8 times :( only)<br/>
<br/>
This was my bit of advices for lower lv any other from 27 to 50 is<br/>
apreciated :)<br/>
<br/>
P.S. i tryed to go to najena but im still to low to solo there in i tryed<br/>
BC room ... died, named necros are to high other dont give me exp anymore,<br/>
ogre captain is lv 27 white to me and it finish very bad... sow runned to<br/>
zone with 5 hp :-)<br/>
