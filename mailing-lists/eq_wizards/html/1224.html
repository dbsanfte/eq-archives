<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767160461">The reason that I believe is listed below in bullet format:<br/>
<br/>
- Wizards hit damn hard! (102 DD at lvl 16 and 117 bolt damage at 16)<br/>
- Ice Comet!  (1100pts damage in one cast...can you say, &quot;Solo the hill/sand<br/>
giant?&quot;<br/>
- Mass Transportation spells (to alternate planes and evacuation spells for<br/>
entire group to gate to safety)<br/>
<br/>
* I rarely hold up my group by meditating.  I normaly cast one spell on the<br/>
MOB and then melee with it and my party members.  If I noticed our health<br/>
dropping significantly I will cast again and kill he beast.  You are not a<br/>
one man killing machine, you are part of a team.  The tanks can take down<br/>
most creatures easily, you are their insurance policy (nuclear policy).<br/>
Cast once per fight as a rule...Root the beast if it is hitting someone<br/>
really hard allowing them to get out of harms way and nuke it!  Be mana<br/>
smart.  The clerics will never use their mana to heal if you always<br/>
obliterate the MOB and waste all your mana...sure the battle takes all of 1<br/>
minute, but you are resting for 5 minutes.  I will sit and med during a<br/>
battle after I cast to ensure I am FM for next round (always watch your<br/>
teammates health bars...if it gets rough..nuke it!)<br/>
<br/>
have fun! and be mana smart<br/>
