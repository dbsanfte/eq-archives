&gt; Anybody know how the secondary spell Chaotic Effect takes place?  Is it<br/>
&gt; level dependant or DEX dependant?  I&#39;ve been assuming it was dependant on my<br/>
&gt; level...but yesterday I was grouped with a bard that was singing a song to<br/>
&gt; increase DEX.  Lo and behold, the staff was going off on spells!  It was<br/>
&gt; pretty cool, it hit for 48 dmg.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m level 28, and with the bard&#39;s buff, my DEX was about 86.<br/>

Dex affects how often a weapon will proc.  Procs are level dependent.  Before<br/>
you hit the level, it will give you a message, but no effects</div>
