<div id="ygrps-yiv-509646639">Pair thyself with a ranger fine wizard, you will no longer ever run aimlessly, <br/>
but have to make the party hold for yee to regain mana.  Trust me, I will <br/>
/tell every ranger in a zone until I find one to join me, sometimes I won&#92;&#39;t <br/>
group with a party of 5, unless one is a ranger (or druid, that can track).  <br/>
Once you realize what an important skill tracking is, you sall never want to be <br/>
without a trusty guide to help you avoid ambush, and take you right to the <br/>
desired enemy.  They are especially usefull for the low level wizard in the <br/>
Toxullia forest, for it is hard to see there and the spawn rate is about 1 <br/>
monster per day.  The Ranger will keep you fighting until your arms can barely <br/>
carry that staff.<br/>
