<div id="ygrps-yiv-653756926"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Final unrelated question:  I know this has been covered before, but I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; want to dig through hundreds of digests. :)  How do I find my way around the <br/>
&gt; Cazic maze from our teleport pyramid?  How do I get to the courtyard?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Go West young man! Hehe - basically thats it.  When you show up, you are<br/>
facing west already.  Just keep heading that way as close as possible. <br/>
Yes, it will fork slightly north and slightly south, just keep the trend<br/>
west (IE - if you veered a little north on the last fork, veer a little<br/>
south on the next).   Note - I have my inviso spell hotkeyed, and as<br/>
SOON as I&#39;m there, I press F1 (target self) and then my inviso key.  I<br/>
usually get invisoed about 75% of the time, but that other 25%, you get<br/>
hit by one mob, that RAPIDLY turns into more.  Either gate out (if you<br/>
are lower level, or unsure of the maze) or I just run like MAD thru, and<br/>
keep going out, and south thru the double doors out the zone.  Of<br/>
course, I never show up there not full heath, with my (X)skin and<br/>
(X)shield spells up, and sow if I can (jboots now).  Even at level 35,<br/>
it is still a risk, as you can get stunned, and blocked in between mobs<br/>
on both sides (usually only if its a returning train to the temple in<br/>
there though).<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and it really isn&#39;t as scary as I make it sound, but if I do<br/>
that, you are less likely to die and have your corpse somewhere lost in<br/>
that maze.  That REALLY sucks...  <br/>
