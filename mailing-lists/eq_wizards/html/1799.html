<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754022749">I started having this problem at Lvl 20 and assumed it was differences in<br/>
the level spells but I&#39;m not so sure... Wonder if they snuck a change in on<br/>
Wizards that is affecting this..<br/>

When I became lvl 12 I went to lavastorm and began to hunt Dragons. Good<br/>
loot and xp. I rooted them and then shoot them. I used Shock of lightning.<br/>
Then when I was half way to lvl 13 the root began to fail. And each time I<br/>
got hurt more and more. And my lightning spell began to fizzel both 4 and 5<br/>
times a row and I had only to run to zone. Now I am a half bubble from lvl<br/>
13 after dieing quite a bit.<br/>
I wonder why the root falters and the Shock of lightning began to fizzle<br/>
when my skill is maxed on lvl and I was almost 13. Not in the start  before<br/>
my skill became maxed. Is this to make us wiz harder to lvl?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any reply<br/>
<br/>
Avari lvl12 soon 13 Wiz Fenin ro<br/>
And now excelent in Old Erudin<br/>
