<b>Subject:</b> sphere of light <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-827027589">I was wondering if you can do the same thing with sphere of light <br/>
that you do for robes..put them in a bag and give it to another player.  I <br/>
know of several people who would like to have a sphere of light, and they are <br/>
willing to pay for it.  <br/>
