<b>Subject:</b> Cazic Gate Tips <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1390039004">Couple of ways to gate into Cazic both with a group and solo....<br/>
<br/>
Group - Cast invisibility on everyone in your group with the exception of<br/>
you and 1 other who can invis(Enchanter, Magician, Shaman, so on). Have the<br/>
other person target you and begin casting invis. After he starts his cast,<br/>
you start your portal. He will invis you and have plenty of time to invis<br/>
himself before your portal goes off(and you only become visible at the start<br/>
of the cast, not at the end so you are safe). This works because of how long<br/>
the portals take to cast.<br/>
<br/>
Solo or Group(if no other invis casters) - Levitate yourself! This will put<br/>
you far enough away from the mobs at the hallways near the teleporter that<br/>
they will only attack you if they are wandering inside the room(which has<br/>
never happened to me and I gate in there all the time). This can also be<br/>
applied to groups without another invis caster, simply invis everyone and<br/>
levitate yourself. When you arrive in Cazic invis yourself immediately.<br/>
<br/>
I too was intimidated by the Cazic gate because I had heard horror stories<br/>
about the place but after a few successful trips in I built my confidence up<br/>
and now use that as my gate if I am going to the Rathe Mountains or Guk or<br/>
anyplace that my other gates won&#39;t get me closer too.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
Yours,<br/>
