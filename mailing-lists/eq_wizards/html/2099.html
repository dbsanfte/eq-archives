<div id="ygrps-yiv-457992683">Ok, i have a question. I played a wizard in the beta of this game, i got the <br/>
game same day as it came out. I&#39;ve been playing in the qeynos area for these <br/>
past months and now i moved to freeport. I&#39;ve noticed so many people that <br/>
are in their 20&#39;s in levels even 30&#39;s. I&#39;m only at level 12 and struggling <br/>
to go up from here. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s that most of the players are <br/>
teenagers who play all the time since it&#39;s summer vacation or people just <br/>
don&#39;t have lives but i play as much as my life let&#39;s me, as long as it <br/>
doesn&#39;t interfere with work or hanging out on the weekends and i seem to go <br/>
up so slow. I&#39;m hunting now in the commonlands, I like to play solo and play <br/>
in groups when i get a chance if I&#39;m in the mood. Can someone tell me a good <br/>
hunting spot or what&#39;s going on cause this is really starting to stress me.<br/>
<br/>
Thx,<br/>
