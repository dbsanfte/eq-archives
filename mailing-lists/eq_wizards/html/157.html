<div id="ygrps-yiv-168136483">Wizard DD spells do a little more dmg than other caster&#39;s up till 20, then<br/>
we sore.  But the whole time a wizards casting time is less than that of the<br/>
other casters, as well our spells are better mana/dmg ratio.<br/>

&gt;&gt;I would say:<br/>

&gt;&gt;Hang in there fellow Wizard, we WILL rule the world *snicker*<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Oonagh the Gnome Wizard<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I offer up this information from the EQ newsgroups most controversial<br/>
&gt;poster, but I believe the information is as good as it gets. I&#39;d like<br/>
&gt;to add the questions though that are the other casting classes DD<br/>
&gt;spells as mana efficient as the Wizard? I always seem to be able to<br/>
&gt;cast many more spells than they can...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here&#39;s Anj&#39;s take on the Wiz hope it helps some of you:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;The Wizard class in EQ is a hard sell to anyone until<br/>
&gt;&gt;they get around level 25 or so. Then you start to really<br/>
&gt;&gt;become one of the finest classes to play in EQ. As you<br/>
&gt;&gt;level and progress towards that level, you will begin to<br/>
&gt;&gt;get a sense of what is possible.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;First, your abjuration, evocation, etc. skills are second to<br/>
&gt;&gt;no other class, including Magicians. Your channeling will<br/>
&gt;&gt;progress to the point where you cast nearly instantly. The<br/>
&gt;&gt;Magician will NEVER get that fast.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Also, you will use less mana per dmg point than a Magician<br/>
&gt;&gt;or any other magic user, and hit with casts for more dmg points<br/>
&gt;&gt;as well.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;In the mid- to high twenties you will start to get good, for a pure<br/>
&gt;&gt;caster, armor and melee weapons, though melee is only a hobby<br/>
&gt;&gt;to your profession of nuclear destruction. You will constantly<br/>
&gt;&gt;irritate the walkers, as you will come to call them, by instantly<br/>
&gt;&gt;flicking invisible, or across the field in a Shadow Step random<br/>
&gt;&gt;port that takes 1 second to cast, or to any of the world&#39;s major<br/>
&gt;&gt;zones with but a cast.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Sure, you won&#39;t be able to summon food or drink, but I bet the<br/>
&gt;&gt;group&#39;s Cleric will give you all you want, since you will be the one<br/>
&gt;&gt;protecting her on the back row while she concentrates on the<br/>
&gt;&gt;tide of battle and the front row&#39;s health. In fact, you won&#39;t be a<br/>
&gt;&gt;good Wizard if you participate in most battles. Your job will be to<br/>
&gt;&gt;conserve precious mana for the important casts. The Griffin is<br/>
&gt;&gt;about dead but flying out of reach back to 3 other Griffins to get<br/>
&gt;&gt;help. CRAAAACCCCKKKKKKK BOOOOOOOMMMMMMM goes<br/>
&gt;&gt;the Wizard and the Griff drops without getting away. The Warriors<br/>
&gt;&gt;are really glad you&#39;d saved your mana for that big cast.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;What I&#39;m saying is the Wiz becomes the nobility of the spell casters.<br/>
&gt;&gt;You are an Erudite Wizard, the most awesome of the Wizards. You<br/>
&gt;&gt;probably have, what, 140 intelligence? Mana in the 400 range ? One<br/>
&gt;&gt;day you will cast Force Bolts over and over in rapid fire and use almost<br/>
&gt;&gt;no mana ! Let that goal motivate you !<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;You will be able to group teleport, a complement to the Cleric&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt;high level group invulnerability when it becomes necessary to<br/>
&gt;&gt;remove the entire group from a disaster in the making. Assume<br/>
&gt;&gt;the red dragon is pulverizing your 6 members and you know<br/>
&gt;&gt;you will all die. The Cleric steps back, shouts &quot;QUIT FIGHTING&quot;,<br/>
&gt;&gt;casts her group divine aura spell, and now the dragon can&#39;t hurt<br/>
&gt;&gt;anyone anymore for 30 seconds. The Wiz jumps up, and starts<br/>
&gt;&gt;a group teleport spell to, say, Greater Faydark Gate. When the<br/>
&gt;&gt;gate holds, the invulnerable spell fades, but you are gone from<br/>
&gt;&gt;the dragon&#39;s grasp anyway. See the potential ?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Nothing packs the punch of a high level Wizard. The ONLY solo<br/>
&gt;&gt;kill of a Giant with witnesses and screenshots was a Wizard as<br/>
&gt;&gt;far as I know.<br/>
