<div id="ygrps-yiv-351955460">Well I thought I had it all finished, I have maxed out my Old Erudian so I<br/>
can read the Cannon of Wizzadry (which I can), and decided to buy the next<br/>
book Doctorine of Wizzadry thinking I could read it as well.  WRONG.  It<br/>
seems to be written in a new langauge, which is unfortunate because I have a<br/>
few languages with just Feeble skill, thus why I can only read part of the<br/>
book.  If anyone out there knows what language this one is written in, I<br/>
would greatly appreciate this info.<br/>
<br/>
Now for new languages, I have been completely trained in Barbarian and<br/>
Gnomish last night and half training in Lizardman (I like this one).<br/>
Getting Kobold tonight, so if you have a language that you are willing to<br/>
trade for one of mine please give me a tell.<br/>
