<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977684916">Sorry to disagree, but if you have been reading the posts carefully, what<br/>
many of us (perhaps not most) want is something to make us unique, not to<br/>
make us powerhouses.  I already feel that we are very powerful and very<br/>
useful, which is why I said I would love to have a familiar that did NOTHING<br/>
at all just because it would give us something unique.  I am not a<br/>
powerplayer and I am very happy with our class, the only thing I see as<br/>
missing is something that makes us different.<br/>

I don&#39;t see why everyone keeps wanting more wizard spells, increase wizards <br/>
spell power, wizards need more of this and that.  Wizards are a VERY<br/>
balanced <br/>
class, verant has admitted this and I have seen it.  Wizards are meant to be<br/>
<br/>
weak at low levels, they are meant to not be able to solo large groups of <br/>
monster and like every other class at upper levels they are meant to be in a<br/>
<br/>
group.  All of the suggestions I have seen to increase wizard spells, give<br/>
us <br/>
a familiar, etc etc, all seem attempts to just give the wizard class that we<br/>
<br/>
&quot;like&quot; more power.  I have played every class to at least level 16 and the <br/>
wizard is by far the most balanced.  If you want to be able to fight large <br/>
amounts of blue monsters play a shadow knight, paladin or warrior.  If you <br/>
want a pet then play a necro or magician.  There is no class that can have<br/>
it <br/>
all and it is my opinion that when wizards voice their opinions for more of <br/>
this and that then all they are wanting is more power.  I truely think that <br/>
these people will never be satisfied until with one spell they can kill <br/>
anything, with one spell they can go to any zone or plane they wish, with<br/>
one <br/>
spell they can destory 6 fire giants etc etc.  A wizard CAN solo and he/she <br/>
has one of the safest positions in a well ordered party.  A wise wizard will<br/>
<br/>
always have emergency mana for a final blast or gate, no tank gets that.  <br/>
Remember its always the tanks that die first.  This response is at no one in<br/>
<br/>
particular, just voiceing my opinon.  Bottom line is that I think if we are <br/>
going to petition verant for things then petition to have more quests added,<br/>
<br/>
more dynamic GM involvement, fix broken quests and give us more history of <br/>
the world.  <br/>
