<div id="ygrps-yiv-1350599109">That&#39;s very interesting.  I am new to my 20th level spells so I&#39;ve just been <br/>
experimenting with them every now and again.  You say enstill sucks?  I&#39;ve <br/>
been very successful with it so far...although I haven&#39;t used it that much <br/>
yet, I LOVE the period of time it takes for a creature to get out of it.  :) <br/>
  Not too many fizzles yet...no more than root I&#39;d say.  Was I just lucky?  <br/>
Granted, Root is still more mana efficient for me right now at 20.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t used the stun spell &quot;Tishan&#39;s Clash&quot; (?) yet. More people hate it <br/>
than like it so far when I ask around.  I know it stuns casters... how long <br/>
does this stun period last?  Does this stun spell cast at a faster rate than <br/>
any of the shock spells?  I&#39;m just wondering if we&#39;d be better off just <br/>
nuking the MoB as fast as we can rather than waste time stunning it?  PLEASE <br/>
prove me wrong. ;)  (I&#39;d love to use new spells)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I very rarely use a root in a group anymore (and enstill really is <br/>
&gt;terrible)<br/>
&gt;since when I group I usually have 3 tanks in the group that do some good<br/>
&gt;damge when they are circled around a Target..I wait till I see the targets<br/>
&gt;health go down a bit then cast...watch the health bar go down someomore <br/>
&gt;from<br/>
&gt;my cast and the damage the Fighters are doing then cast one last time for a<br/>
&gt;take down.<br/>
