<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628536544">I don&#39;t know if any of you visit EQ Casters<br/>
(http://eq.castersrealm.com/), but if you do you probably know that it<br/>
is EQ Enchanters after being redone to a general caster site. After<br/>
their resent Q&A with GZ I sent them an email:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, I thought you have become an all-casters site, but judging by the<br/>
&gt;latest Q&A with GZ, it is still EQ enchanters. No questions or answers<br/>
&gt;about Wizards or Necromancers. I don&#39;t know whether you play any of<br/>
&gt;those, but if you don&#39;t, it might be a good idea to get a staff member<br/>
&gt;to represent each caster race as they seem to betaking second third and<br/>
&gt;fourth places to Enchanters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Make no mistake, I am not telling you how to run your site, and these<br/>
&gt;are not demands. I was just surprised that seemingly the only thing that<br/>
&gt;changed about the site is the name and little more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
````<br/>
Well if you give me questions I will get them answered.  Unfortunately<br/>
the<br/>
majority of the other classes are not very vocal, or organized in<br/>
formulating what they want to know.<br/>

<br/>
So let&#39;s send them some Wizard questions and complaints and let our<br/>
voice be heard! I also advise sending them to Graffe<br/>
(http://www.graffe.com) as he seems to be the closest thing to a<br/>
representative that Wizards have.<br/>
