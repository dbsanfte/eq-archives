<b>Subject:</b> 3 Wizzies? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-561307129">Quite an interesting way to put it...but yeah, I must say it was pretty <br/>
effective the last time I was in a band of 3 or 4 Wizards in Unrest.  A <br/>
couple of us would cast redundant roots and then it was a nuke-fest!  MoBs <br/>
went down FAST!  It was very fun and a different style of play.<br/>
