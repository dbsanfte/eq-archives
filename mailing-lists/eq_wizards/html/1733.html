<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824985229">I have a friend who is teaching me Elvish. He spams me with a macro, &quot;you<br/>
are learning the Elvish tongue&quot;, and I occasionally get a message saying my<br/>
language skill is improving. But then I noticed that the only language I<br/>
have a skill for, besides common, is Erudian, which is at awful level. Does<br/>
anyone know if you can learn the other languages if they are not listed in<br/>
your skills? Thanks.<br/>
