<b>Subject:</b> Everyone says we cast fast.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-753822349">I&#39;m confused.  I am a level 17 Wizard on Fennin Ro.  I find that the<br/>
only way I can nuke an opponent is to Root him first because it is utterly<br/>
impossible to Nuke, say, Ambassador DVinn while he&#39;s piercing you.  I am<br/>
excellent at timing casts, and they just attack to fast for us to get the<br/>
cast before their next hit, and most likely, they will.  I don&#39;t see at all<br/>
how Wizards cast fast, that&#39;s one of our fallbacks, the other is the long<br/>
waiting times for mana regeneration.  But no worries.  There are things you<br/>
may get that help restoration of mana.  Back to casting... It&#39;s terribly<br/>
slow, Flame Shock takes a LONG time to cast, and it is impossible to cast it<br/>
on enemies that can Duel Wield and Bash.  Thankfully Root is there to save<br/>
you, because Root casts relativlely fast, but Root hardly holds.  And my<br/>
Alteration is maxed.  I have 142 INT, soon to be 148.  I get 5 casts out of<br/>
Flame Shock for 102 Dmg each on enemies with lower magic resistance.  Ok,<br/>
well, that was a fun chat.  I still love my Wizard and would never give him<br/>
up for any other class.</div>
