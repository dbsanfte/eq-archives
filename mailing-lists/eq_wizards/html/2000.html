<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008168530">yeah. how embarrassing is it to have to tell ur group that we cant fight<br/>
reds because our spells wont work???  that should be top priority on<br/>
anything we send to verant.<br/>
<br/>
side note: if anybody reading this has made it to lvl 24 and used frost<br/>
shock, please let me (or us) know if the resists for this spell are just as<br/>
bad as force shock and enstill.  I must say that force shock and enstill are<br/>
the only two spells i use regularly on blues and greens that get resisted<br/>
regularly (this is seperate from the resists we get on reds which is another<br/>
issue altogether).  so maybe it&#39;s not a resist issue, but more of a crappy<br/>
spell issue.<br/>
<br/>
a funny note: i was in guk with a lvl 22 shadowknight last week, and i was<br/>
complaining about force shock getting resisted (yeah, he was about sick of<br/>
my ranting but i had to rant to somebody).  well, we got tired of the<br/>
froglock tad in the entrance (lvl 3ish i guess) that was healing the<br/>
monsters we were pulling, so we decided to end his healing expedition.<br/>
after we hit him once he started to run and the sk cast a spell on the<br/>
tad....  low and behold, THE TAD RESISTED.  yes, a lvl 3ish tad resisted a<br/>
lvl 22 sk spell.  hahaha. im sure u dont have to guess who was complaining<br/>
about resists the rest of the evening (believe me, i didnt say a word after<br/>
that little incident)!<br/>
<br/>
maybe we dont have it so bad after all ????<br/>

    that sounds good,  but I think we need to bring up the resist spells<br/>
bug,  in a small party to medium party, there is no problem,  but in a party<br/>
of 6, you take on high red mob&#39;s,  and all the other class can contribute to<br/>
the party in some way even if there spells can not effect the mob,  but the<br/>
wizard class is left standing there with nothing to help out the party.<br/>

        Okay, before the Verant text thing, I posted that we should and try<br/>
to get one (1) thing changed.  Then people posted they wanted a ton of stuff<br/>
to change.  Then I posted a ton of stuff and now they are saying post only<br/>
a couple of things....rrrr.<br/>
<br/>
        Actually, we sound just like a bunch of bickering Wizards, heh, I<br/>
can just picture us all in a dimly lit lecturing hall, trying to figure out<br/>
how to best approach the Master Wizard and tell him his spells suck, while<br/>
trying to second guess which way he will turn us into ash after we do. =)<br/>
<br/>
        Anyway, if we cant come together here, lets at least start sending<br/>
Verant SOMETHING.  Seran is right, I just read on eq.stratics.com that they<br/>
are working on Specialization and it should be implemented in a couple of<br/>
weeks.  So no use bugging them for that.<br/>
<br/>
        If we are only going for a couple of things I would go for :<br/>
<br/>
        Meditate Skill cap of 7 rather than 5 - reason:  Hey, come on, they<br/>
took away 2 points from our combat abilities, at least they could give it<br/>
back to us for mana, right?<br/>
<br/>
        Line of Sight Fade and Shadowstep spells with set minimum<br/>
distances - reason: Well, I came up with it originally (ahem, blush) and it<br/>
would serve a dual purpose of being a good escape spell and help with lower<br/>
level travel, both of which are things we Wizards could desperately use.<br/>
<br/>
        Now, what do you all think...<br/>
