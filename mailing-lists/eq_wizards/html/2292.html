<div id="ygrps-yiv-936855730">This is a very god point. Especially after you get your new spells. even<br/>
more so in Cazic Thule..allthough I would wait till at least 20 before<br/>
venturing there...most of your spells will have no effect on the red<br/>
Baddies.<br/>
<br/>
But Cazic Thule is the place to be if you want good loot and exp at around<br/>
19 if you have a good group. Remember..the higer your Exp the more valueble<br/>
you become!<br/>

&gt; I agree, good point.  On that note, for some of the younger wizards,<br/>
you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; find a percieved hatred of our class in certain areas...notoriously<br/>
because<br/>
&gt; of our abilities to strike from afar, and more likely because you are<br/>
&gt; playing with others who are ignorant of class balance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Places that are sometimes hostile to Wizards include BlackBurrow around<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; Queynos area, and Crushbone over near Felwithe.  I would say those in BB<br/>
&gt; were more hostile to our class...more sensitive to issues about steal<br/>
kills<br/>
&gt; and such.  Of course, there ARE those wizards I have seen that have used<br/>
&gt; their powers to exploit others and place shame on our class.  I&#39;d like to<br/>
&gt; name names...but.......nah.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Once I hit 16...it was amazing how many groups start looking favorable to<br/>
&gt; our class.  Start looking in areas such as Highhold Pass and Unrest...<br/>
&gt; people are always ready to allow a Wizard in the group.  So don&#39;t dispair<br/>
&gt; folks...the wait isn&#39;t THAT long. :)<br/>
