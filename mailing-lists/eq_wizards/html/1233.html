<b>Subject:</b> NPC&#39;s and Language question.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-38237309">I have heard that one can acquire language from sitting near a NPC for awhile. I was wondering if anyone knew the names/locations of NPCs that can teach Old Erudian, Elder Elvish, Combine, and Dragon? Thanks in advance.<br/>
