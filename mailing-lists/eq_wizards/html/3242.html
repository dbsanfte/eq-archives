<div id="ygrps-yiv-2130763788">Hmm, Bonds of Force spell lasts only a few seconds? What the heck is it good for then? Does anyone actually use it for anything? Leave it to Verant to give druids a level 1 snare spell that costs 15 mana, is virtually never resisted by blues, lasts the duration of the kill, and to give wizards a snare-like spell at level 29 that costs 75 mana and lasts a few seconds.<br/>
