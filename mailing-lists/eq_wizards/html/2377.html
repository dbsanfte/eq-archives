This is a prime example of what I call &quot;patience casting&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I very rarely use a root in a group anymore (and enstill really is terrible)<br/>
since when I group I usually have 3 tanks in the group that do some good<br/>
damge when they are circled around a Target..I wait till I see the targets<br/>
health go down a bit then cast...watch the health bar go down someomore from<br/>
my cast and the damage the Fighters are doing then cast one last time for a<br/>
take down.<br/>
<br/>
Now this is a simplistic example that gets more difficult when you pull more<br/>
than 2 ( I really like my stun spell too :-P) however, you have to use the<br/>
/assist command (I made a hotkey) and be Patient..that health bar does not<br/>
instanly show the damage you just did with that 171 point force of shock<br/>
spell....so be patient...and use a smaller spell for the take down..that, my<br/>
wizards sisters and brothers, is what wizards are all about.<br/>
<br/>
(steps down off her soapbox)<br/>

&gt; lemme tell you all about a big fight we had in cazic with 2 troll sk&#39;s, 1<br/>
&gt; monk, 1 ranger, 1 ogre shaman, and me, the lonely little wizard (everybody<br/>
&gt; was in the lvl 24-26 range, me being right smack dab in the middle at<br/>
25)...<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t worry, the moral of the story is at the end if you want to skip the<br/>
&gt; details :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; monk is pulling (he seems to know the maze the best...  and the big fat<br/>
ugly<br/>
&gt; trolls and ogres get stuck in the doorway trying to get out.. hehe.<br/>
anybody<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s been to cazic knows what i&#39;m talking about).  monk pulls 4<br/>
defenders<br/>
&gt; and 1 sent (all conned blue except for sent which conned white).  monk<br/>
comes<br/>
&gt; out, and immediately, the trolls and ranger jump on the sent first (the<br/>
ogre<br/>
&gt; shaman DOES NOT engage, as he is our acting healer). i cast tishans clash<br/>
&gt; (stun) on the sent (great starter spell, as it does a little dmg, and<br/>
gives<br/>
&gt; the melee guys a few free licks). by the time the stun wears off, i blast<br/>
&gt; him (frost shock) once to finish him. the two trolls move to the first<br/>
&gt; defender, monk and ranger move to the second defender. i stun the<br/>
&gt; monk/ranger defender, and turn around and blast (frost shock) the trolls<br/>
&gt; defender (at this point, i&#39;m close to half down on mana). shaman is<br/>
healing<br/>
&gt; the guys that need it, as well as the ranger. monk is hurting the worst so<br/>
i<br/>
&gt; finish off his defender (one blast of frost shock and he becomes a runner,<br/>
&gt; so i cast shock of fire to finish him). trolls easily handle their first<br/>
&gt; defender at about the same time. two defenders left, shaman running oom,<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; well as ranger. i have enough for two more blasts and a stun. trolls,<br/>
monk,<br/>
&gt; and ranger jump on third defender, while i stun the fourth. then i turn<br/>
&gt; around and cast dmg on the third defender that is almost dead to finish<br/>
him<br/>
&gt; (he went REAL quick with 4 melee and my dmg on him). we then turn to<br/>
fourth<br/>
&gt; defender (who is just getting out of his stun), and finish him quickly (i<br/>
&gt; did not need to cast on the fourth defender, so i ended  up having a<br/>
little<br/>
&gt; less than a bar of mana left).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; end of fight, and everybody gave out a big WHEW!  we all congratulated<br/>
each<br/>
&gt; other on a terrific battle, and then went to clean our britches out heh.<br/>
&gt; one of the best we&#39;ve had, and one of the most &quot;organized&quot; (one death and<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; would have been considered a failure).  it just worked out that everybody<br/>
&gt; knew what we were supposed to be doing (no, we didn&#39;t plan on pulling 5,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; it just ended up like that, and we had a zone close by, so we knew we<br/>
could<br/>
&gt; run if needed).  mind you, that at this level, i probably could not have<br/>
&gt; taken one on my own. i probably would have had a resist or two, or maybe a<br/>
&gt; spell that did half dmg, or enstill may falter, etc....  Some of you may<br/>
&gt; say, &quot;well, lets see, 6 of you, five of them, all blue, with one white....<br/>
&gt; your group could have just individually solo&#39;ed them&quot;.  NOT! remember, the<br/>
&gt; whole is greater than the sum of it&#39;s parts :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; all dmg tolled, i didn&#39;t get touched once (everybody else but the shaman<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; less than half health, the shaman was 3/4 health), but i was able to cast<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; the beginning (doing 34dmg) as well as keeping the melee guys from being<br/>
hit<br/>
&gt; as much (although i do wish the recovery time on tishan was a little<br/>
&gt; quicker, as i&#39;m really starting to like it).  if i ever blasted with my<br/>
&gt; biggie twice on a baddie, he woulda come after me (unless the second blast<br/>
&gt; was a finisher of course).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; the point of this msg is to show you that 1.) the stun spell we get at 20<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; not very useful when solo&#39;ing, but it sure did come in handy that night,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; 2.) i don&#39;t care what anybody says, no other spellcasting class could have<br/>
&gt; replaced me in that particular fight (mainly because of the dmg/mana ratio<br/>
i<br/>
&gt; was getting on my dmg spells, as i was casting when the monster was over<br/>
&gt; half dead, which usually means full dmg), and 3.) you can use your big<br/>
&gt; spells in a fight (and should as they are normally gonna be your best<br/>
&gt; dmg/mana ratio spells), and 4.) monsters don&#39;t frenzy you if you time your<br/>
&gt; casts right, and don&#39;t get to rapped up in *blasting* the heck out of the<br/>
&gt; monsters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; if anybody else has any cool or unusual group fights involving us little<br/>
&gt; &#39;ole wizzies, i&#39;d love to hear them, as I&#39;m still trying to master the art<br/>
&gt; of grouping without getting hit...  it&#39;s real tough holding back when you<br/>
&gt; know you can blast that baddie straight to errr. well, a bad place :)<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; also very embarrassing to start your group tell &quot;oom!!! oom!!!&quot; when<br/>
there&#39;s<br/>
&gt; still one or two baddies left :(<br/>

sketchy<br/>
&gt; :)<br/>
