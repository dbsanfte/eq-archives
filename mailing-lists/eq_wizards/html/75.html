<div id="ygrps-yiv-321395216">I disagree with the never run part.. I have often been able to avoid certain<br/>
death by outrunning a creature to a zone or to someone willing to help.  The<br/>
trick is the jump every once in a while when you do run.. that gives you an<br/>
extra boost and allows you to stay out of the reach of the creature chasing<br/>
you.  If you do decide to run though, and you see some people you think may<br/>
help you, make sure you shout out to warn them first, because training<br/>
monsters into people is not the way you want to go if you want to make<br/>
friends.<br/>

&gt;   you anyways and all you will do is waste a couple hours looking<br/>
&gt;   for your corpse cause it is not with the others. </span></blockquote></div>
