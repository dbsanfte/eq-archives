<b>Subject:</b> Hollow Skull <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1912186466">If anybody knows where I can find a hollow skull, please let me know.  If<br/>
you can isolate it down to a specific loc in a specific zone, that would be<br/>
best.  The hollow skull when combined with two rubies (one from the high<br/>
shaman in Splitpaw and one from Lyunga in Innothule swamp) supposedly makes<br/>
a jeweled skull.  Supposedly Yiz Pon in W.Karana says he is being followed<br/>
by a gnoll assassin who soon appears after you talk to him and supposedly<br/>
the skull is found on the gnoll assassin.  The jeweled skull is supposedly<br/>
+5 int +20 mana +20 hp -5 cold resistance.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance<br/>
