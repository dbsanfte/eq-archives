<div id="ygrps-yiv-300522176">I am wanting to gain knowledge in languages but I have a few questions.<br/>
<br/>
As of know I only have access to Common and Edudian. <br/>
<br/>
#1.  How do I get access to other languages.  Do they just appear after you lvl. or do you have to talk to a person first who speaks that language before you get it.<br/>
<br/>
#2.  Someone posted they had 10 languages.  How?  I can&#39;t foe the life of me get another language to show up when I go to the trainer.<br/>
<br/>
#3.  I know combine is the language of the giants, ut what language is the Tier&#39; dal or whatever it is.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any info,<br/>
<br/>
