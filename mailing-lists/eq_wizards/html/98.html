<div id="ygrps-yiv-28058688">You don&#39;t need to be in a group. me and another wizard increased our<br/>
lang while on the boat.. we used /tell and were not grouped but my skill<br/>
in the lang he was speaking went up to below average from awfull :) I<br/>
changed a social hot button so we both totally spamed each other with<br/>
giberish text but it worked well<br/>
