<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220162402">I haven&#39;t played a wizard in a long long time, and<br/>
honestly forgot about this news group. Your best bet<br/>
in terms of information would be to head on over to<br/>
www.graffe.com; there are very active forums there as<br/>
well as a number of very good guides on where/how to<br/>
quad, quests, etc.<br/>
<br/>
J-boots are nice, but SOW potions or druid buffs are<br/>
easy to get. Once you get to 51, J-boots become a bit<br/>
obsolete with the AA Run 3 option, so they may not be<br/>
worth killing greenies over and over. But if you can<br/>
get exp out of it, for sure!<br/>
