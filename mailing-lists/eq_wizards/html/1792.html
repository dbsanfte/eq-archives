<div id="ygrps-yiv-633456455">When I went there to kill Foragers and Hunters I was 13th and could solo<br/>
3 on my own.  I would say you could probably solo them at 8th to 10th level.<br/>
You do have to be careful with the Hunters because they will attack you on<br/>
sight, so you can end up with others joining the fight.<br/>
<br/>
The best place to find them is just inside the zone entrance from South Ro.<br/>
This also leaves easy access to a zone in case things should go bad.<br/>
<br/>
One more piece of advice, stay away from the tower which is on one of the<br/>
islands in that area.  Don&#39;t want to give too much away, but lets just say<br/>
Jojo (or whatever his name is) is not fun.<br/>

&gt; First, thanks for the advice, exactly what I was looking for.  Second, what<br/>
&gt; level/party composition would you recomend for the Foragers and Kolbold Hunters?<br/>
