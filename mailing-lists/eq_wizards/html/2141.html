<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1675652993">Has anyone found any lvl 12 spells (except bind and shock of lightning) that<br/>
are really worth the cost? From reading the descriptions I just don&#39;t see<br/>
how any of them justify the cost of 7 plat (or whatever). So far I&#39;ve shied<br/>
away from area effect spells because I haven&#39;t yet been in a situation where<br/>
I wish I had one...... am I missing something? Would appreciate any<br/>
opinions......</div>
