<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563317120">Calling all people from all over! Ding Ding!*Rings Bell* Ding Ding!<br/>
 I would like anyone to come and teach others, and them in turn teach<br/>
others, and for all of us to learn new and wonderful languages of ANY<br/>
kind on The Rathe server!<br/>
I am a lvl 6 almost lvl 7 High Elf Wizard in Greater Faydark! Plz e-mail<br/>
me with your name, current lvl, race, and any languages you know and<br/>
what your skill is in them(i. e. Excellent, Below Average, etc...)! I am<br/>
going to try to organize a small little language meeting for anyone that<br/>
would like to come! I will not accept any people that want to be given<br/>
money for this meeting, this is expressly for wizards to share<br/>
knowledge, not sell it!<br/>
Again, On THE RATHE server!<br/>
-Malvos, Lvl 6 of The Rathe currently residing in Greater Faydark</div>
