<div id="ygrps-yiv-226450320">This is a post I got off of the post board that I partake in on the<br/>
EQvault&#39;s Bristlebane forum.  I thought that I would share it with all<br/>
of you :)  This is a party of lv 35&#39;s or so.  I know the one wizard was<br/>
35 last I saw him a few days ago and Icewalker was a lv 34 Magician last<br/>
I saw him too :)<br/>

Greetings!<br/>
<br/>
I would like to thank my adventuring party last night for one of the<br/>
most exciting and adventurous 4 hours I have had in a long time. Thanks<br/>
go out to Amura PsyStorm, Trafalgar Firefingers, Ellrick Grayson,<br/>
Icewalker, and Ricric.<br/>
<br/>
We covered so much of Norrath in so short a time, it was always<br/>
exciting. From the frozen plains of Everfrost, to the steaming rocks of<br/>
Lavastorm, we had much fun. Nagafen&#39;s Lair was exciting, as noone was<br/>
there and it was quite spooky with the amount of nasty creatures. We<br/>
even decided to slay our first giants, of both the Hill and Sand<br/>
varieties! It was a personal payback for me, as I grew up in the<br/>
Freeport area and had died by both the Hill Giants in West Commons and<br/>
the Sand Giants of Oasis and North Ro. We even had a great cameo<br/>
appearance by Chette Starlyng, Bristlebane&#39;s beloved Guide, in North Ro<br/>
after the first Sand Giant fell. Thanks for the great time, Chette, and<br/>
all the people who were there!<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to let everyone who has been upset at the supposed<br/>
lameness of Wizards, that they are quite FAR from being mediocre or<br/>
anything other than just truly awesome. Amura and Trafalgar are both<br/>
high level Wizards and are two of the most powerful people I adventure<br/>
with. We could not have done anything without them. Too many people seem<br/>
to be underestimating their value in a party and it&#39;s both demeaning to<br/>
them and an insult to Verant. Every class has it&#39;s ups and downs, and<br/>
each class needs to learn to grow with what they know they can do best.<br/>
Amura is still trying to get Wizards a flying kick... so maybe that<br/>
might help balance them out more in melee. ;) Anyhow, for all you<br/>
wizards who want to see how powerful you will become, please watch Amura<br/>
and Trafalgar in action. I would feel quite naked without having them in<br/>
my group. And for all you warriors out there who are getting fed up and<br/>
frustrated, you also have many great things in store for you. Try<br/>
adventuring with Daeleron, Abrams, or Valhammer and see what a great<br/>
warrior is capable of. They can take and deal damage very well and are a<br/>
solid rock in any group. Verant did an excellant job in class balance,<br/>
and noone should get frustrated with their class unless they are<br/>
suffering from the &quot;grass is greener&quot; syndrome (sorry, forgot who came<br/>
up with this term, but it aptly fits the situation. ;)).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to all I adventured with!<br/>
<br/>
With love,<br/>
