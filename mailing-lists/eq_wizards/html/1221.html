<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093441268">When you are grouped with your monk friend, switch to your persona screen<br/>
and right click on your text box.  Your text box will then switch to your<br/>
language box and allow you to switch what language you are speaking in.  You<br/>
must have a rating of Excellent in any given language to train someone else<br/>
to excellent.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the languages of Combine, Dragon and a few otheres, no one starts<br/>
out knowing them fluently.  A couple other ppl here have already mentioned<br/>
how to become fluent in them, so I won&#39;t get into that now, but it does take<br/>
a lot of time to learn.  Took me 8 hours to learn Elder Elvish, Combine, and<br/>
Dragon to excellent!!<br/>

&gt; According to Ken Morris:<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have never charged for binding services or casting invis on someone.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt; will accept donations if they wish to give them, but I never require a<br/>
&gt; &gt; payment.  However, languages are a whole new ballgame.  It takes a lot<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; time and effort to learn these languages, especially Dragon and Combine.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt; see nothing wrong with expecting some compensation for your time and<br/>
effort<br/>
&gt; &gt; in teaching someone a language.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s something that still eludes me. How does one learn langages? I<br/>
know,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been told that you just chat in a group... but that doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>
work.<br/>
&gt; Does one has to invest one point at guild in it? Then how does you learn<br/>
&gt; Dragon, Combine, or come to think of it, Elder something?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a monk friend, and we group fairly often, yet he has still to get a<br/>
&gt; single piece of proficiency in Elvish, Teir&#39;Dal or Elder Elvish.<br/>
