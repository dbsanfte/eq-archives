<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174357227">I do not think that a shorter casting time would make that much of a diff.<br/>
&quot;ooh, I can get off more<br/>
spells faster just to have a mob turn on me, wow! that is so much better<br/>
then a magician&quot;. That<br/>
is just my take on it. I would rather have concentration allow for more mana<br/>
efficent casting, which<br/>
can be done by reducing the ammount of mana needed, or by upping the damage<br/>
done.</div>
