<div id="ygrps-yiv-408026208">During my adventures over the past weekend I happened to group with a<br/>
very nice magician and his pet &quot;Gonaker.&quot;  We did very well together<br/>
and had fun.  <br/>
<br/>
The problem was that he made claims that he can strike a target for DD<br/>
equal to mine.  We were both level 19 and sad thing is, I think he is<br/>
right!  Can anyone tell me how much mana is used and damage delivered<br/>
for the magician DD spell (16th level) equivelant to Fire Shock?  I<br/>
have a feeling it will be the same which is sad really.<br/>
<br/>
Before I rant on my class I will need to know the truth on this matter.<br/>
 I love being a wizard and believe the long road to true power is a<br/>
long one.  But we should be doing more damage than a damn magician and<br/>
plus he gets a pet.  Let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
