<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141069736">The BALANCE in this situation is that the wizard must rest.  After  a kill<br/>
(especially if it is white or strong blue), the wizard must rest to regain<br/>
almost all their mana.  During this time the others can take kills.  I am a<br/>
wizard and will not KS anything.  I have been accused of it when I was<br/>
helping (so I thought) someone from being killed.  The creature had 3/4 of<br/>
its hp and the paladin fighting it had almost none.  He said he was going to<br/>
lay hands and continue fighting it.  I knew better because the creature was<br/>
at least 4 levels above him (he couldnt have killed it any way).  Most of<br/>
the time I ask if someone needs help, and people thank me as I have thanked<br/>
them for helping me at times.  <br/>
<br/>
I am a little sick of the KS argument.  Reason being is that people are<br/>
stagnant in one spot.  You folks need to travel a bit.  Look at the newbie<br/>
areas...my god, 150-175 people in gtr faydark?  DAMN!  Thats a lot.  Dont<br/>
plan on getting many kills when there are that many people on...sometimes<br/>
you just do not see the other players attacking your  target (game lag or<br/>
visual bug).<br/>

I don&#39;t think the cutting the damage a wizards spell does will reduce <br/>
the amount of KS&#39;ing. I am greatful that my wizard does the damage he <br/>
does with his spells. I have had several other players try to steal my <br/>
kill. I had rooted a monster before I attacked. I got off one spell <br/>
before some fighters(unsure at to exact class) ran up and started <br/>
hacking the monster. I was able to keep my kill and ward off this <br/>
groups attacks on several other of my rooted monsters. This is by no <br/>
way isolated. It happens every time at worste, every other time at <br/>
best. Changing the wizards spell damage would hamper their ability to <br/>
gain levels why doing nothing about KS&#39;ing. I think that the game is <br/>
fair as it is now and would hope that this group does not go out and <br/>
petition for a change.<br/>
