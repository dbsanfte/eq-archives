I have one idea how to check a weapon skill, if you look at your attack<br/>
value it changes as you change weapon it is proportional to your skill in<br/>
this weapon !. So if you gain a skill your attack value will go up (maybe<br/>
only after you zone or disconect as if it is case with languages)<br/>
<br/>
 I think that formula is something like<br/>
<br/>
(Strenght bonus * (level factor)) + (weapon skill * (dexterity factor)=<br/>
attack value<br/>
<br/>
im not sure where dexterity enters in game. But when control this you must<br/>
be careful becouse when you dont have a weapon in hand it count your Hand<br/>
to hand skill !! <br/>
<br/>
If anyone wish to try this you must cast strenght spell on you and see<br/>
change of Attack then put and remove a pair od derwish rings wich give you<br/>
more dexterity and see attack and i think that you will have enough data<br/>
for a little matematic game :)<br/>
