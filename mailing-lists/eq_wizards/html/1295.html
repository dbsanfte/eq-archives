<br/>
I agree. Having &quot;utility&quot; spells that are somehow different to other magic<br/>
classes would be a very good idea that would make us more attractive to parties.<br/>
Any ideas what they could be anyone? Maybe having spells to buff the buffs would<br/>
be fun, scrying spells should also be wizards domain.<br/>
