<div id="ygrps-yiv-385197484">The skull you are looking for comes off Gnoll Embalmbers (Necromancer<br/>
Gnolls) in the Lake Rathe zone after South Karana.  I don&#39;t believe it is<br/>
known how to install this skull on your staff, but it is believed that there<br/>
is an NPC that does it for a price.</div>
