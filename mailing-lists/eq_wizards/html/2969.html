<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105623449">Well heres another suggestion to consider.  What if each NPC that dropped a Rare<br/>
item drop it more frequantly but in the same token also would not spawn if the<br/>
group that killed that last spawn was ina  general vincinity.  Maybe even the<br/>
same zone depending on its location.  Which would cause the group to have to<br/>
leave after it killed the spawn and another group could take their place till<br/>
next spawn and so forth.  Just an idea.<br/>

&gt; &gt;meet many ppl willing to sell there hard earned items for gold.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Verrant are fools who think they shuld keep the number of items down, &gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt;with<br/>
&gt; &gt;making them lore item and no drop. if this keeps up ill go play AC<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;instead.<br/>

&gt; I have to agree with you there Askur.  I can understand why Verrant made<br/>
&gt; things hard to get and rare... but the current method tends to encourage a<br/>
&gt; lot of the parts of the game that is NOT fun.  (ie camping, hording for<br/>
&gt; guildmembers, etc.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t offer a solution...would it be a better game if Verrant made it so<br/>
&gt; every NPC *guaranteed* that you&#39;ll get the item you wanted?  Or if they made<br/>
&gt; things spawn faster so everyone has a chance to kill it? I&#39;m divided....<br/>
