<div id="ygrps-yiv-308418557">It is really a shame that a few bad apples hurt the reputation of an entire<br/>
class.  I try very hard to avoid kill stealing at all costs.  Still, it happens<br/>
sometimes and people accept my apology for the most part, and I usually give<br/>
them a stack of beer and/or homemade food as a token of goodwill.  By sticking<br/>
to this behavior I not only have no real troubles finding groups anymore, but<br/>
I&#39;m even getting /tells now to join parties before I have chance to ask.  At<br/>
first I thought it was my superior group tatics, but its probably the beer :).<br/>
Anyway please don&#39;t stereotype us as a group of killstealers because the<br/>
majority of us are not.  Besides, we all know you Druids are nothing but a bunch<br/>
of powergamers :)<br/>

&gt; well i was playing my druid today, he&#39;s level 11,  and i was fighting a<br/>
&gt; snake.  out of nowhere a wiz comes along and ks&#39;ed the giant snake.  it<br/>
&gt; really pissed me off.  his excuse was, i just want exp!!!  i couldn&#39;t believe<br/>
&gt; it.  now i see why people get so pissed off at us wizards.  i guess i got<br/>
&gt; satisfaction wathcing him and his partner die.  it was great.  now my druid<br/>
&gt; has hatred towards wizards and looks down upon them.  i like to roleplay.<br/>
&gt; now i see why wizards are hated and it&#39;s so hard to find a group.  just<br/>
&gt; wanted to let you know my experience from the outside.<br/>
