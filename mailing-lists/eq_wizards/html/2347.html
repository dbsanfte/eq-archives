<div id="ygrps-yiv-976380970">Two things.<br/>
First, you will never have a project of this magnitude without having some bugs<br/>
making it to release undiscovered.  Software is inherently buggy, its a fact of<br/>
life, get used to it, you will see it happen more and more.<br/>
Second, they have stated that people found exploiting a bug will be warned.  If they<br/>
continue to exploit the bug, then they will be punished.  Its painfully obvious why<br/>
they don&#39;t list bugs.  They don&#39;t want to be forced into policing them 24/7.  If you<br/>
stumble onto something that is a blatent bug, report it so that it gets fixed, and<br/>
move on.  If you find something that could go either way, enjoy it until a GM/Guide<br/>
tells you to stop.<br/>

&gt; Well, tough! They (Verant) made the game, and now they are trying to punish US<br/>
&gt; for playing it the way it is! They designed it and they have the bugs in. So let<br/>
&gt; them fix the bugs and not tell us &quot;no you can&#39;t do this&quot;. That&#39;s stupid. They<br/>
&gt; created the game and I&#39;m playing it the way it is.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; furthermore, nowhere on their site do they have a list of exploits that should be<br/>
&gt; avoided. They do not give us a list when we log in to the game. Yet, we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; supposed to just know them? How stupid is that?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; THEY made the design error / bug, and now they expect us not to &quot;exploit&quot; it<br/>
&gt; without even letting us know what&#39;s an exploit and what&#39;s not! They are punishing<br/>
&gt; us for their laziness / un attentiveness!<br/>
