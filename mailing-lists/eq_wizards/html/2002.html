<div id="ygrps-yiv-645449901"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; The gentleman in the post below reminded me of a bit of<br/>
&gt; advice I always give<br/>
&gt; to lower level wizards when they ask me &quot;What level 8 (or<br/>
&gt; 12 or 16) spells<br/>
&gt; should I buy?&quot;  I tell them to buy them all.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that that is probably sound advice, but it does get rather<br/>
pricey...  At higher levels spells go up to 9 and 10 platinum a piece.<br/>
I&#39;m already saving up for my level 20 spells (need 60 plat I think).<br/>
I like the idea of having all spells just because I like to tinker<br/>
with them and see how they work.  I skipped the spell Eye of Zomm when<br/>
I reached that level but now I&#39;m planning to buy it anyway to raise<br/>
that particular skill.  Also, someone told me it can be used to open<br/>
locked door in Befallen, which is a neat trick!<br/>
