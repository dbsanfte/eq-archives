<div id="ygrps-yiv-152555590">As a 22nd lvl Wizard, I would like to comment on this &quot;wizards being weaker&quot;<br/>
crap (no offense meant).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It appears that yes we wizards<br/>
to a increasing damage amount per circle of spells (near double each time),<br/>
but what troubles me is that the monsters get factorially more hit points.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t quite understand your point here.  Are you saying that we should be<br/>
able to take out creatures in one or two shots???  That&#39;s crazy, it would<br/>
totally unbalance the game.  Of course the creatures are going to get more<br/>
HP the higher lvl you go.  We still do more dmg than any other class in any<br/>
given round.  I can now cast a spell that does 175 dmg.  I can cast this<br/>
spell 6 times and enstill 1 time.  I&#39;m currently taking out yellow Tidal<br/>
Lords solo in the Cauldron and in a group, I have reduced the amount of dmg<br/>
our tanks normally take because the creatures die much faster.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But, as it has been<br/>
pointed out, the wizard is constantly on his ass meditating.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Of course he is, that&#39;s part of being a wizard, or any other magic-using<br/>
class.   Sitting on your ass meditating is not any different for a mage or<br/>
enchanter than it is a wizard, so once again I miss your point here.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;1.  Speed up casting time for Wizards.  This would allow us to cast<br/>
in-between attacks with our newest spells.(the only class that would be able<br/>
to do so).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
First off, our casting time IS faster than the other magic-using classes.<br/>
Secondly, what you purpose about casting in between attacks would seriously<br/>
hinder our class.  As it is now, if we are in a group and attack too often,<br/>
the creature turns to us and starts ripping us a new one.  Not a good thing.<br/>
That&#39;s why you spread your attacks out, never blasting them one right after<br/>
another.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;2.  Lower mana cost for Wizards with Specialization in Evocation more than<br/>
for the other classes.(less ass time)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Since specialization isn&#39;t implemented yet, there&#39;s nothing saying they<br/>
haven&#39;t done this.  We won&#39;t know until it gets added.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;3.  Put stun chances on all of our spells( thus giving us a chance to not<br/>
HAVE to Root every mob we come across) [no yelling that it is there on upper<br/>
level spells, cause I just read that they changed it to disrupt casting not<br/>
stun]&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You need to do a little more research about your higher lvl spells.  They<br/>
were only talking about one spell, Force Shock, that mistakenly said that it<br/>
delivered a 2-sec stun.  It was suppose to read that it disrupts the casting<br/>
abilities of NPC magic-users.  But, Tishan&#39;s Clash, and others like it,<br/>
still stun the ememy.  I know, I use it a lot.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;4.  Alt to number 2:  Make cost go up, but make the spells do better damage<br/>
to mana ratio.  example :  The wizard(lvl 8) runs up to a bear, zap, half<br/>
hps gone, zap, dead bear.  The mage could be left with 1/2 mana at this<br/>
point and still feel great...  Wizards were always suppose to be the<br/>
Artillery of the game, make them that again. (new nickname for Wizard... one<br/>
shot wonder) *chuckle*  This would make the wizard once more sought after so<br/>
that when the party needs that extra little kick he is there, or if he is<br/>
solo he can take about 2-3 blues solo but be breathing hard and oom.   I<br/>
know this would mean that the wizard hardly ever gets hit point loss, but<br/>
with our hps that is not a bad thing... only 3 hits from a red and I&#39;m down<br/>
for good...(remember YOUR own motto as published in your manual : Wizards<br/>
believe that the best defense is a strong offense.)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Once again, you totally lost me on this thread.  We ARE sought after for<br/>
that extra little kick, although there is nothing &#39;little&#39; about being able<br/>
to deliver 175 dmg in one shot.  A warrior of the same lvl with a 2-h sword<br/>
can still only do 40 dmg in one round.  I CAN solo 2-3 blues before I&#39;m out<br/>
of mana.  I&#39;ve been hunting Bosuns and Shamans, both of which are blue to<br/>
me, in the Cauldron and can usually take 2-3 of them before I have to med.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, your post has confused me.  I mean no offense to you and realize<br/>
that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I really don&#39;t believe<br/>
you have thought this out too well.  Part of the reason is because you are<br/>
still pretty low lvl.  The wizard class doesn&#39;t really start standing out on<br/>
its own until around 16th lvl, in my opinion.  But, not everyone can be<br/>
happy playing a wizard.  From what I have read, I think you expect too much<br/>
from this class.  For myself, I&#39;m very happy with the wizard class.<br/>
