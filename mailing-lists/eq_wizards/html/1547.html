<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758562675">All I have to say is -WOW-.  You plan to be level 24 by Sunday or Monday ?  I wish I could level that fast ...  I look forward to hearing your secret solo&#39;ing place even though I have attained the 24th level.  (I will probably still be 24 when you reach 24.. heheheh)<br/>

Well I have finally hit 20th level yesterday and have found a beautiful spot<br/>
to solo in for levels 20-24.  Once I hit 24th Ill let everyone know where it<br/>
is so let the anticipation build.  My Soloing tactics are as many have<br/>
suggested here, Shoot and root....shoot and root.  I would have to disagree<br/>
though from what people have said that there is no major difference in Root<br/>
and Enstill.  I use Enstill now and Love it.  I have gotten into situations<br/>
when I blast the heck out of a mob and run out of mana, I then sit down and<br/>
med for up to 2 bubs of mana then get back in battle and the mob is still<br/>
rooted or has just broken free.  I love Enstill and think the  extra mana it<br/>
uses is worth while.<br/>
<br/>
I expect to reach 24 by Sunday so maybe Monday Ill post where this spot is<br/>
at.<br/>

&gt; I can feel the wrath now...  but I am ready for the comments.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I may comment - I don&#39;t believe that us discussing what &#39;would be nice&#39;<br/>
for Wizard spells really helps us be Wizards.  I really believe that if we<br/>
continue to complain or comment on the apparent lack of spells/problems with<br/>
spells that we have, we are not going to achieve what I believe this mailing<br/>
list was setup for.  This list is to share information between all Wizards<br/>
within Norrath !  We are going to lose potential and current subscribers (me<br/>
and I&#39;m sure others), thus losing valuable shared infortmation because of<br/>
our ranting and raving about our class.  Remember, Verant is probably not<br/>
reading this forum..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My suggestion:  Let&#39;s talk about ideas and share information that will<br/>
help each other play the class that we chose to play.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So far, the most useful thing I have read (besides Spoiler information) is<br/>
the &#39;bug&#39; that allows our Eye of Zoom to unlock doors.  I think that&#39;s great<br/>
!!<br/>
