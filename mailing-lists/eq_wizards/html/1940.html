&gt;    Interesting, but most definitely not going to happen. Don&#39;t waste time<br/>
&gt;asking for them<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In real life, we include things like this in our purposed budgets<br/>
specifically so the bean counters have something to scratch off the list,<br/>
thus increasing the chances of things we really need getting through.  <br/>
They are very cool spells though, and I&#39;d love to have access to them.  <br/>
<br/>
Besides, how is Verant going to know we want new spells and are perfectly<br/>
capable of coming up with them ourselves if we don&#39;t ask for them? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;  Haste - Increases movement rate for self only.<br/>
&gt;    This would be nice to have, but really doesn&#39;t fit our class.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Agreed - I like the idea someone came up with (and I wish I could remember<br/>
who is was so I could give credit) of a line of sight teleport spell. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;  Meditation skill max for level for wizard (Level +1) * 7<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Now this is really a good idea. Maybe not *7, *6 would be fine. Remember<br/>
&gt;&gt; - Specialization skill with some real advantages to our class<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    This is where they could implement the faster med times. Give the wizard<br/>
&gt;    only option to specialize in Medditation. Its a long time to wait, but it<br/>
&gt;    could be a place to implement it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Seven, six - either would be an improvement.  I think it should be a raise<br/>
in the skill cap though, and not something you have to purchase at 16th.  I<br/>
would like the option to Specialize in it at 16th for added benefit,<br/>
though.  (Keep in mind I&#39;m 8th level, so I may be a bit biased. =)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; - resolving a problem of high resistence of DD spells at lv 20 resisted by<br/>
&gt;&gt; (greens and blues )and other ( if this is becouse of stun effect we wish<br/>
&gt;&gt; one spell without this efect at same level)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Absolute must. This is a joke.  Our spells should NEVER be resisted by<br/>
&gt;greens,<br/>
&gt;    and RARELY by blues.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can understand making allowances for named NPCs.  Maybe a 10% chance of<br/>
resisting if the named NPC cons green, 40% if blue.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; - resolving a balance problem of other magic users classes be able to<br/>
&gt;&gt; attack directly (necromancer, lifetap pets) or indirectly (enchanters and<br/>
&gt;&gt; magicians pets, buffs ect) a much higer lv MOBs NP 19 lv against 35 lv<br/>
&gt;sand<br/>
&gt;&gt; giant when our spells are 100% resisted if a monster is 6+ lv.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    This is beyond a joke.  Wizards are the masters of damage.  Well having<br/>
&gt;    our spells not be useless against mobs that melee characters in groups <br/>
&gt;    of our own level can fight would be an excellent start.  And if its all <br/>
&gt;    about wizards being more powerful at later levels all I can say is that <br/>
&gt;    we better be THE most powerful by a fair margin at those levels to make <br/>
&gt;    it worth all the time we were not that powerful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Amen to that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;    And my addition<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Fix whatever was done to increase the amounts and frequency of fizzles.<br/>
&gt;    Having root fizzle more now at 18 than it did at 4 is a joke. A very bad<br/>
&gt;    joke.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Haven&#39;t gotten there yet, but I&#39;ve been practicing this spell since 4th and<br/>
*I* think I&#39;m pretty d*** good with it.  I can see it getting resisted by<br/>
reds, yellows, and maybe whites... but never fizzling.  Not by 18th level,<br/>
having 12 levels worth of experience casting this spell.<br/>
<br/>
The letter looks great.  I think it needs to be run though a spell checker<br/>
once or twice and sent on it&#39;s way.  <br/>
I think we need to attach a list of players in favor of these changes so<br/>
that it doesn&#39;t look like just one player with gripe.  Feel free to add my<br/>
name to the list of supporters of these changes.<br/>
