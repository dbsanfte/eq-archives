<div id="ygrps-yiv-184677263">Dear wizards,<br/>
<br/>
As i pased into new easier life as i get lv 24 and new DD spell (wich<br/>
finaly dont fizzle :-) ) i started to visit a castle mistmore. This place<br/>
is very interesting for solo and gruping wizard as there are many dark<br/>
elves at entrance wich are lv 20 - 24 and in god group is easy to get great<br/>
experience and a place is much less confusing then a Soulsek A or Unrest.<br/>
<br/>
In group of 3 max 4 similar lv you can make a great experience if a puller<br/>
is ok and know when to pull and what to pull. Here i started to use my<br/>
first Area damage spells and im very happy with them. <br/>
<br/>
Tactic:  if a group pull 2 or 3 darkies i wait until they build some hate<br/>
against fighters and then i cast a Ligting storm on them. If casted in<br/>
right moment it will not make them agresive and i will do much more damage<br/>
then using only DD spels. <br/>
<br/>
Example: Storm do Rain damage in 2 waves and i think  sometimes 3 ..(when<br/>
raining ?) it hits for 75 damage and it is 2 waves * 2 targets * 75 a<br/>
whooping 300 damage for a 135 mana ! If it is 3 targets it is 450 damage<br/>
and i once get it on 4 targets for a 600 damage !! .. realy it is all time<br/>
a little bit less,  becouse of partial od rarely full resists, but in any<br/>
case it is more damage then with any DD spell. (shock of this lv do 172 +3<br/>
for lv damage). <br/>
<br/>
Trick is in right timing and god work with group. This tactic is very<br/>
useful if you are fighting many blues wich your fighters and healers can<br/>
handle without serious problems.<br/>
<br/>
When i start to use this tactic i finaly start to understand what roule we<br/>
have in group and why wwe have so much AE spells. We are support<br/>
responsable for a mass damage and this is our PRIMARY role, (i think it<br/>
becouse we get 2 - 3 diferent AE spells for lv  and only 1 maybe 2 DD for<br/>
lv) i know it is not what many of us thinked that role of wizard is but<br/>
Verant have many strange ideas :). ( i read much from high lv wizards that<br/>
they are useles in combat against capital monsters wich are resistent to<br/>
nearly all.. and if they get 3 full resists and 2 partial on Ice comet<br/>
things get bad... ( 2000 mana by by for cc.. 500 - 900 damage )<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When im soloing i have start to use a tactic wich i found on boards...<br/>
<br/>
Pulling with eye... Eye is nice thing to pull a mobs first they don  get<br/>
agresive to it until it is realy near. and when they hit you can pull only<br/>
this room of monsters as target is already killed and they go after a<br/>
caster and passing near other monsters they DONT pull a train. so i can<br/>
pull with right use from Graveyard and still not get trained by all other<br/>
mobs in my way.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that this helps my follow wizards and that i will se here some other<br/>
constructive tactics to use. <br/>
<br/>
And lets hope that Verant finaly admit that there is something wrong with<br/>
wizards :-)<br/>
