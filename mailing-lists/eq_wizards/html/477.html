<div id="ygrps-yiv-1099393059">I&#39;ve found a great Forum site, that soon will be hitched <br/>
up to EQ Stratics.  It not only has class specific <br/>
boards, but also has 4 general game boards, and a board for <br/>
each server.  It&#39;s VERY fast loading, and has a devoted <br/>
following of intelligent and sincere posters.  Stop by and <br/>
check it out, see ffor yourself!<br/>
<br/>
The class-specific boards are brand new, and just waiting<br/>
to be filled with threads.  For an idea what the boards have<br/>
been like to date, check out the main Tavern board.<br/>
