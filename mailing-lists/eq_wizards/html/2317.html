&gt; According to Sergey Bukhman:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1st choice: Speciqlise in nukes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2nd choice: Specialise in root/enstill<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3rd choice: Specialise in shadow step+gate :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You second and third choices use the same skill - alteration.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes. But those are the reason I&#39;d specialise in something :)<br/>
&gt; Apart from Evocation or Alteration, I can&#39;t see anything else that<br/>
&gt; warrant the specialisation over 50.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, picking one over the other is a matter of taste. Specialise in<br/>
&gt; nukes is tempting, but I think that an alteration specialisation might<br/>
&gt; be more profitable if one does solo a lot, or travel a lot.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The only time that mana and fizzles are really crittical is during combat.<br/>
If I fizzle or use more man while creating a portal, who would really<br/>
care?  I think with the travel time that we save people, they will be more<br/>
than willing to spend an extra minute or two meditating.  On the other<br/>
hand, when we are useing DD spells in combat, mana conservation, and<br/>
fizzles are very critical to the groups success.<br/>
