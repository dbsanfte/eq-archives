<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1254044317">well i&#39;m a long time reader first time writer :)  I have to agree with the <br/>
last statement by Cristie.  I don&#39;t care if people twink, don&#39;t get me wrong <br/>
it pisses me off, but i really don&#39;t care.  What i really hate is the guild <br/>
camping.  I don&#39;t want to join a guild but it seems i might have to just to <br/>
get the good equipment.  I think that&#39;s more of a problem then twinking.  I <br/>
say leave twinking alone and concentrate on stuff that could really affect <br/>
you.  just my 2 cents!!!<br/>
