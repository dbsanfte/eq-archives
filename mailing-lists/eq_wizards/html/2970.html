<div id="ygrps-yiv-298836274">as for the item problem, if anyone has ever played a mud which is almost what <br/>
EQ is. i as a immortal on several muds all npcs spawn with the items they <br/>
carry always.  but npcs are also hard as hell to kill takeing a chance and <br/>
spending alot of money on potions of healing which u chug during a fight to <br/>
stay alive.  and in eq npcs with items are still hard anuff to kill and you <br/>
dont have the potions as easy if at all if they want to keep items rare good <br/>
luck. and by getting ur item and going on ur merry way u allow the item to be <br/>
available  with out 50 hours of camping  juce up the respawn and make it <br/>
spawn all the time you would still need groups to get a item and people <br/>
wouldnt make alot of money anyways cause the item would be readily avalible, <br/>
if verants poed about tweeking then just put a lvl limit on the item cant be <br/>
worn till ** lvl thats what muds have and it works very well.<br/>
