&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just discovered that Elven Wine gives a small mana regen boost. My<br/>
&gt; alcohol tolerance is so low though I take an INT hit when I use it, so<br/>
&gt; I only do it when mana is really low, so by time I am FM my INT has<br/>
&gt; recovered too. Never thought I would be using alcohol like warriors do<br/>
&gt; for STR boost, so neglected to build alcohol tolerance. But now it is<br/>
&gt; in upper 20&#39;s and INT hit is not as bad, and recovers faster. Anyway,<br/>
&gt; it is like a poor cousin to Clarity, but helps a bit when you are<br/>
&gt; soloing and want mana back ASAP.<br/>

is in it&#39;s 30&#39;s (I&#39;m a party boy) but you better believe it will be<br/>
maxed by tomorrow if this is true. :)<br/>
