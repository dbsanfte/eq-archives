<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353769452">No, I am pretty sure that only 1 skill can ever go above 50.  I remember<br/>
asking a gm about it, and he that&#39;s what he told me.  Additionally, only my<br/>
primary specialization, evocation, has ever risen above 50.  All the others<br/>
got to 50 and stopped dead.  I had practiced evocation, actually, up to 50<br/>
and wondered why it wouldn&#39;t go higher.  That&#39;s when the gm told me that<br/>
there needed to be 1 point in all of them to get them started before one<br/>
would rise above 50.  I don&#39;t remember if he said that was a bug or<br/>
intentional.<br/>

&gt; Yes but i think it�s 2 skills that can be taken above the 50 mark. and as<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you said it�s much easier just to put the points in at the guild then trying<br/>
with research runes. and above lv 30 the money aint a problem, you make<br/>
atlest 100 plat when hunting HG�s or something like that for an hour or 2.<br/>
