<div id="ygrps-yiv-1312943410">I have to disagree.  Combining the three classes would make a powerhouse... same as multiclassed characters in AD&D.  The reason why they split em all up is because the game is based on &quot;grouping&quot;.  No one, can solo ALL the time by themselves, and hope to compete with the same character grouped with others.  Therefore they made it essential that you seek out a group and party.  Wizards do damage.  They do it very well.  They get some group transports later on, to add to their semi-useful miscellaneous spells.  But thats about all they do.  So.. dont play the wizard character if you want more than that.  The characters that are more &quot;well rounded&quot; are paladins, clerics, and shadowknights.<br/>

&gt; Dear Gregory,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You hit he nail on the head, how many times have we seen a /shout for a<br/>
&gt; wizard..never. Verant need to do something about the mages, enchanters and<br/>
&gt; wizards. I think Ken has a point, combine the lot into one. When Verant split<br/>
&gt; them it sounded a great idea, I thought it was at the time too. But, the<br/>
&gt; reality is quite different, unfortunately.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; I was attracted to playing a wizard by the way the class was described in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the game&#39;s manual, but if I had to do it over again (and I won&#39;t because I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have already put a lot of time into my character, and want to play with my<br/>
&gt; &gt; friends who are of the same level as I), I would pick a druid or shaman<br/>
&gt; &gt; type character. They have great spells, which can also be cast on other<br/>
&gt; &gt; party members, and aren&#39;t so weak in weapons and AC as wizards are. I hate<br/>
&gt; &gt; it when I tell my friends about the spells I can get, only to find out they<br/>
&gt; &gt; can be cast only on myself (shielding, resistant skin, etc.) My ranger<br/>
&gt; &gt; friend casts Skin like Wood on my all the time, I have nothing to<br/>
&gt; &gt; reciprocate. I think wizards as a class are short changed, and have never<br/>
&gt; &gt; seen anyone do a /shout looking for a wizard to join with them as they do<br/>
&gt; &gt; for rangers, shamans, bards, etc. Just my 2 cents.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
