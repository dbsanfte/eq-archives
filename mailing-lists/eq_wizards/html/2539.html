<div id="ygrps-yiv-914403550">Ok, my turn to ask something of you more experienced guys.  Out of <br/>
curiousity and boredom, I did some exploring and finally found my way to <br/>
Cazic Thule.  It was a little scary...saw a lot of lizard trains where <br/>
everything was yellow to reds.  I didn&#39;t really go far in...only up to the <br/>
first courtyard.  Noticed everybody there at the time was between 28-35lvl.  <br/>
I was the lowest person on the totem pole..being only 21.<br/>
<br/>
Any of you been there yet?  Am I way out of my league there?  Good tips for <br/>
me there for rest spots or areas with Mobs more my league?  I heard it&#39;s a <br/>
good promising area for xp.<br/>
<br/>
I want to kill a lizard! :)<br/>
