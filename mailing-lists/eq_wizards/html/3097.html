<br/>
There is no sink to remove anything from the economy. If things<br/>
continue as they are, eventually it won&#39;t only be money that&#39;s<br/>
worthless, it&#39;ll also be the items themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Say, for example, that everyone on the server has 5 or 6 Rubi<br/>
breastplates.  You decide to twink up, say, a new rogue (I&#39;m on a limb<br/>
here, because I don&#39;t know much about armor...assume, for the sake of<br/>
the discussion, that your rogue can&#39;t wear Rubicite).  At this point,<br/>
it&#39;s easier to gate your level 50 wizard over to Greater Faydark and<br/>
trade his Rubi breastplate for a Dragoon Dirk than it would be to<br/>
bother getting the item yourself.<br/>
<br/>
So, no, this situation will not correct itself.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who just hit lvl 31. Money is now meaningless to him. <br/>
Anything good, he has to camp for. He can make money faster, easier,<br/>
and having more fun than he can get the item.  And he has all the money<br/>
he will need until level 50 for spells, and he has all the equipment he<br/>
can ever buy. So, sure, someone could offer him 10,000,000 plat for an<br/>
item...but why? There&#39;s nothing available to him which is worth that<br/>
much.<br/>
<br/>
Money is only viable when people believe it has value. No one past the<br/>
newbie levels believes in the value of plat. Therefore, plat&#39;s<br/>
meaningless.  It&#39;s a lot less trouble to trade, say, a Mistmoore Battle<br/>
Drum for a Sacrificial Dagger, than it is to try to keep track of, say,<br/>
36 billion plat.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Whew, sorry that was so long!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Perhaps money is worthless at higher levels, but<br/>
&gt; will that last forever?<br/>
&gt; When the game went live back in March, money was<br/>
&gt; worthless to buy the best<br/>
&gt; items, too, because no one had many good items.  If<br/>
&gt; you sold your rare item,<br/>
&gt; even for a lot of money, you couldn&#39;t buy anything<br/>
&gt; with the money, since<br/>
&gt; good items were too rare.   The higher levels who<br/>
&gt; trade only for other items<br/>
&gt; with other high levels are doing so because those<br/>
&gt; items are rare.  As time<br/>
&gt; goes on, there will be more and more high level<br/>
&gt; players, and those &quot;rare&quot;<br/>
&gt; items will become not so rare.  Then people will<br/>
&gt; sell them, if only to lower<br/>
&gt; level people who have accumulated money.<br/>
