Well,<br/>
<br/>
  Let me think...I don&#39;t remember the spell names<br/>
exactly, but always have shields up!  Buy the AGATE or<br/>
upper level hit absorber spell reagents for your<br/>
shields...use them ALWAYS in solo efforts.  SNARE,<br/>
SNARE, SNARE.  Use youre snare spells and slow them<br/>
down and nuke away.  If you do not have Jboots...get<br/>
them...they will make or break you as a solo artist.  <br/>
<br/>
  I was there in the days when we first started to<br/>
Quad-Kite spectres in Oasis and then I quad-kited<br/>
wyverns in velious.  Sure, you don&#39;t always win, but<br/>
once you get good at your technique you will win 9 out<br/>
of 10 easily.  <br/>
<br/>
  Also, always have an escape plan.  Set your limits<br/>
of damage or mana when you always will hastily<br/>
RUNAWAY!<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck,<br/>
<br/>

&gt; hi.  My main is a wizard (obviously), though he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; only mid-level.  I <br/>
&gt; mostly play characters over on the E. Marr server.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a couple of questions though.  Is it normal<br/>
&gt; for wizards to die <br/>
&gt; about every five encounters?  I have a definite<br/>
&gt; tendency to get <br/>
&gt; killed.  Also, anything that cons over light blue is<br/>
&gt; almost <br/>
&gt; impossible for me to solo.  Is this normal, or do I<br/>
&gt; need to rethink <br/>
&gt; my strategies?  I am having a lot of trouble finding<br/>
&gt; a group since <br/>
&gt; LDON came out, so this is a pretty important<br/>
&gt; question for me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry for the lame questions, but the only other<br/>
&gt; wizard I know is <br/>
&gt; even lower level than I am, so we aren&#39;t much help<br/>
&gt; to each other info <br/>
