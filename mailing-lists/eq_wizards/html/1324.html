and have won both matches.  The Ogre had the most HP at a little over 780.<br/>

&gt; So, the max damage that you can do will be 1050dmg assuming no fizzles,<br/>
interupts, and no resistance..Im not sure what a warriors HP is like at that<br/>
level, as I have never played one myself (anybody help here?) but I could<br/>
see you being In a lot of trouble when dueling one..if you get a root of and<br/>
manage to take him down from afar with remaining mana all well and good but<br/>
wizards are a very feeble class one on one when it comes to fighting face to<br/>
face, you end up exhausting your mana trying to get a quick root in and then<br/>
backing off to cast dmg spells again..<br/>

&gt; As a 22nd lvl wizard, I most definitely have to disagree with you.<br/>
Wizards<br/>
&gt; can make all the difference on whether your group survives or not.  I can<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; 175 dmg with one cast.  I can cast this spell 6 times.  Believe me, fights<br/>
&gt; go a lot faster and safer with a wizard that can deal out that much dmg.<br/>
&gt; And, when you get 2 wizards in a group, well you can imagine the<br/>
devastation<br/>
&gt; that can happen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lets not forget our group teleportation spells either.  Not to mention, we<br/>
&gt; are the ONLY class that can teleport a group to an alternate plane.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, your statement that &quot;parties can&#39;t be bothered with wizards&quot; is<br/>
totally<br/>
&gt; inaccurate.  I have never had a problem finding a group to adventure with.<br/>
&gt; And, like Valacian stated, I would be more than happy to duel a barbarian<br/>
&gt; warrior with dual wield.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well said Jay. Parties cant be bothered with wizards, they cant buff,<br/>
cant<br/>
&gt; heal<br/>
&gt; &gt; and cant really help parties that much...&quot;we were supposed to be heavy<br/>
&gt; &gt; artillery&quot; but that just is not correct. I think a wizard would be most<br/>
&gt; parties<br/>
&gt; &gt; last choice if they could choose from all the classes.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Its very easy to demonstrate the wizard immbalance; get into an arena<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; dual wield barbarian warrior of the same level and see how you do!<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hmm doesn&#39;t sound too promising eh?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have always played a wizard character class in AD&D and UO but I<br/>
regret<br/>
&gt; &gt; playing one in EQ. I think EQ were nervous about the power wizards in UO<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t want to unbalance the game. I think they swung the pendalum too<br/>
far<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; other way. Root &#39;n&#39; Shoot, if that fails death, thats about it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hopefully e-mails will pour in and tell me how wrong I am. Great, show<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; its<br/>
&gt; &gt; not the case so I feel I have a character with a future!<br/>
