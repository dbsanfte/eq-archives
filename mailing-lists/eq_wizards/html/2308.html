<div id="ygrps-yiv-1807739241">You are missing something.  You just need to actually hold the item in your <br/>
hand (cursor).  You have to actually take it out of your inventory and then <br/>
click done at the bottom so you go back to the spells you have memorized, <br/>
then click the spell and it will tell you about what you are holding.  It <br/>
doesn&#39;t really do a whole heck of a lot though.  Its one of those spells I <br/>
hope they do something for to make it worthwhile.  I find its just a <br/>
novelty pretty much...at least I haven&#39;t found any real use for it yet.<br/>

&gt;Hail fellow wizards of Norrath,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Could some wise wizard please pass along some of their unbound knowledge &<br/>
&gt;explain just how you use the Identify spell? I have it memorized, but I keep<br/>
&gt;getting told I&#39;m not holding the item. Does the spell only work on weapons <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;fit in the melee slots, or am I missing something?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thank ye for thine help<br/>
