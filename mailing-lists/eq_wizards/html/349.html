<b>Subject:</b> Soloing in Kaladim <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-844436771">Well, on someone&#39;s advice, forget whom it was, but I made the trip to<br/>
Kaladim to plumb the depths of Unrest. I&#39;m 14th level and just coming into<br/>
my power right now. Right now the rest of the people in my group are between<br/>
3-5 levels below me. So I figure I&#39;ll just solo and get xps slower, but also<br/>
not hinder their progress either. Where should I go? I&#39;ve gone to the<br/>
chessboard and killed pawns, bishops and their annoying pets, as well as the<br/>
odd King that shows up. A dwarven friend of mine was telling me how his 6<br/>
member lvl 10 party was completely wiped out in Unrest down to the last man.<br/>
I made the following conclusions:<br/>
<br/>
a. Unrest is nasty<br/>
b. My dwarven friend&#39;s party is stupid for not running from something they<br/>
can&#39;t win<br/>
<br/>
I can admire going out gloriously next to your comrade, but not when death<br/>
isn&#39;t permanent.<br/>
<br/>
So, question, if I take my group into unrest what should I be looking to<br/>
kill? Is there somwhere else that is nearby that I should go instead? My<br/>
dwarf friend said to hit the steamfonts, suggestions?<br/>
