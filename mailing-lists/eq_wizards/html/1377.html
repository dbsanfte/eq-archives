<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128325019">I haven&#39;t had too much problem getting into groups.  It&#39;s precisely our <br/>
ability at quick mass-damage that has made me attractive to groups  wishing <br/>
to *keep* our kills away from scavenger kill stealers.<br/>
Save your mana, use it wisely to aid your group by softening kills or my <br/>
finishing a running creature...and when somebody is stealing the kill....zap <br/>
zap zap = your xp.  It&#39;s just a different playing style.  Probably not for <br/>
everybody.<br/>

I have a few 20+/30+ lvl tanks who tell me Wizards are always more then <br/>
welcome in their groups later in the game.<br/>

Sorry, I was not advocating kill stealing, I was just stating the facts.<br/>
And the fact (that I have always hated) is that many wizards start serious<br/>
power tripping at level 12 when they get that lightning spell.  These<br/>
wizards do give us a very bad name.  I would really like to see some more<br/>
utility spells for wizards, a more extensive line of magical force stunning<br/>
spells would be in line with the wizard theme and would make us more useful<br/>
to groups.  Perhaps we could bestow magic resistance on other classes?  Or<br/>
give us more utilities for interrupting other magic using classes to make<br/>
wizards more effective against npc mage types.  All these things would<br/>
increase our usefulness to a group.<br/>
