<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481969547"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I just obtained 12th level and was wondering if it would be<br/>
&gt; worth it to get<br/>
&gt; Al&#39;Kabor&#39;s Frost Spiral?  I have seen the mana cost at 100!<br/>
&gt; and I have never<br/>
&gt; seen a damage code for it....  Any one want to help me on<br/>
&gt; this one?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s an AE spell which means that it can damage several mobs at once.<br/>
Only use it when your tank has a few monsters on him.  The mana cost<br/>
is higher but since it can damage several mobs at once, it&#39;s a good<br/>
deal if you use it in the right situations.  It&#39;s a good thing to<br/>
always have one AE spell loaded in case you get swarmed by mobs.  I<br/>
usually have one AE, one Shock and one Bolt spell in my top three<br/>
slots.<br/>
