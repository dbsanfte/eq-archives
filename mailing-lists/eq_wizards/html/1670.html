<div id="ygrps-yiv-446338827">I think that if it was &quot;nothing&quot; then the GMs wouldn&#39;t bother to give a 30<br/>
day suspension for it.<br/>
<br/>
But it brings up an interesting point--do the GMs consider it &quot;twinking&quot; for<br/>
a player to have more than one character and transfer powerful items from<br/>
one character to another?    Does anyone know just exactly what &quot;twinking&quot;<br/>
is?  Couldn&#39;t it be possible for a high level character to reward a low<br/>
level one with a fine item for some service or other?  How can anyone, GMs<br/>
included, tell at face value whether or not &quot;twinking&quot; is taking place?<br/>

&gt; Man why don&#39;t you leave her alone, everyone in the game isn&#39;t gonna fight<br/>
&gt; there way to the top some people play that way. Play the game yourself and<br/>
&gt; do your thing. It&#39;s kind of painfull to get a 30 day suspension. If you<br/>
&gt; really want to do harm to someone look for the people exploiting bugs and<br/>
&gt; stuff like that not some tiny little thing like tweaking their characters<br/>
&gt; and you never know she might have had something happen to her like for<br/>
&gt; example a friend of mine refused to pay a toll in freeport and the guard<br/>
&gt; attacked him so he killed the guard now he can&#39;t walk into freeport<br/>
because<br/>
&gt; the guards kill him so he made a new character and transfered all his<br/>
stuff<br/>
&gt; to his new character. Find things out or just mind your own buisness<br/>
before<br/>
&gt; messing up a persons gaming. Her tweaking isn&#39;t doing you any damage so<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; leave it alone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I mean no disrespect by it but it just bothersme to see people who have a<br/>
&gt; fit out of nothing.<br/>

&gt; &gt;i saw her again today<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt;believable) she says she just knows how to play well! lol... i wish i<br/>
&gt; &gt;remembered her name! GMs give a 30 day suspension for twinking muahaha<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt;      The wonderfull world of twinking. In a way I dont care if people do<br/>
&gt; &gt;this, I have seen lvl 15 in oracle robes which are found of of lvl 40ish<br/>
&gt; &gt;mobs I think. But, what I dont like is how guilds &quot;take over&quot; an item<br/>
spawn<br/>
&gt; &gt;site to supply all of their lower lvls with items takeing away the chacne<br/>
&gt; &gt;that others have to get the items.<br/>
