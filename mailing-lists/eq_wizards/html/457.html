<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182736798">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I play a High Elf Wizard. He is currently 10th lvl. The first 9 levels went<br/>
very quickly. I was one of the first Wizards in my area and on my servers to<br/>
get to 9th. Now I am finding it very difficult to get past lvl 10. I seem to<br/>
die every time I am on whether grouped or solo. I almost never can get my<br/>
gate spell off in time to get out of trouble.  I do not want to resort to<br/>
Kill Stealing (this is very easy for a wizard)<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have advice on how to advance faster. And combinations of spells<br/>
to use when solo or in a group. I know there are not many options but I am<br/>
hoping I have missed something and someone can help.<br/>
<br/>
I mostly adventure right now with a friend (11th level ranger) in Crushbone.<br/>
He seems to be sucking up most of the experience.(even when we were at the<br/>
same level. The rest of the time I either solo or group (30% each)<br/>
<br/>
Help<br/>
