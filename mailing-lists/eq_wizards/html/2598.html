<b>Subject:</b> Eye of Zomm - Bugged ? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480059074">Last night I was passing through Highhold pass and a<br/>
friend told me to stop by an have a beer with her ( Yeah those rough<br/>
Barb. type women )<br/>
<br/>
So I thought I would try to impress her with my Eye of Zomm. She was<br/>
killing Orc&#39;s on the Kithi side of the<br/>
pass. So I cast the eye - moved it around the ORC spawning area - but<br/>
could not see her.<br/>
<br/>
She, however could see me ( the eye ) - then I noticed when I went to<br/>
meet her that there where a LOT more Players in the area than I could<br/>
see through the eye before .<br/>
<br/>
I asked her to stay there and repeated it again . Out of the 10 players<br/>
present - I could only see 2 through the eye - the others were just not<br/>
visable. I could see all the ORC&#39;s that spawned - just not all the<br/>
players - through the eye.<br/>
<br/>
Is this some form of &quot; cant see all the PC&#39;s through the eye &quot; bug ?<br/>
