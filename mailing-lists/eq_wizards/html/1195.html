<b>Subject:</b> Re: Charging for Services <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049458929">I have to agree with you.  I don&#39;t ever charge anyone for a bind or <br/>
anything else I can do for them.  In fact, I have helped a few newbies to <br/>
the tune of a full plat so they can buy spells when they aren&#39;t getting <br/>
anywhere in the game.  I want other people to enjoy their time as much as I <br/>
enjoy mine.  I find when I give, I get more back in return than I could <br/>
receive charging for my help.  There are always people who will try to give <br/>
me things or money for these services, but I politely refuse and just tell <br/>
them to keep me in mind if they ever come across me in a time of real <br/>
need...i.e. getting whacked to death with 3 red fire ele&#39;s on my butt in <br/>
Lavastorm.. or something of the likes... I can receive help from people who <br/>
remember me helping them at some point.  I would much prefer people to give <br/>
of themselves because I have showed them kindness, not because of a prior <br/>
arranged obligation to pay for my services.  If I were making armor or <br/>
jewelry etc.. it would be different.<br/>
To the same tune, if someone feels OK charging for their skills then so be <br/>
it.  I can&#39;t do it myself.  That is the difference between people, some <br/>
feel okay with it and others don&#39;t.<br/>

&gt;Disclaimer: this is only my opinion so no flames please.  I am only hoping<br/>
&gt;to elicit some other opinions on this subject as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t know why but it has never made sense to me to charge for services<br/>
&gt;such as binding, invis, and language training.  Perhaps it is just the<br/>
&gt;personality of my character that he enjoys helping others and gets full<br/>
&gt;satisfaction out of the good deed itself, not needing any sort of physical<br/>
&gt;compensation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I realize that I will be able to make make up to a plat or more each per<br/>
&gt;bind and a plat or more for invis (depending on how bad they want it) but<br/>
&gt;that just seems unkind.  I remember when I was level 8 just travelling over<br/>
&gt;to freeport.  I only had a couple of my new 3rd circle spells because they<br/>
&gt;were so expensive and I was flat broke.  I saw people auctioning: &quot;Binding<br/>
&gt;at S. Gate, 15gp&quot;, and there was no way i could afford that without selling<br/>
&gt;the few pieces of cloth armor i had left.  I was lucky to find a kind druid<br/>
&gt;that bound me and asked for nothing in return, but I just wonder why so many<br/>
&gt;seek to earn a profit from their abilities rather than just use them to help<br/>
&gt;others and take joy in that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I guess it is just based on your roleplaying style, but even if I have no<br/>
&gt;money and still have spells to buy, I would not ask for or accept any sort<br/>
&gt;of payment for using my talents.  Does anyone else agree with me or do you<br/>
&gt;all think that you SHOULD rightfully earn a profit from using your skills?<br/>

&gt;I am excellent in Dragon, Combine, Old Eurdian, Elder Elvish, and am working<br/>
&gt;on Elder Tier&#39;Dal today.  I will be happy to teach Dragon and Combine for 6<br/>
&gt;runes each.  The rest, I will teach for 3 runes or 5 plat each.  I am<br/>
&gt;located on the Tarew Marr server.  I am firm on the Dragon and Combine btw.<br/>
&gt;I won&#39;t accept money but only runes for those languages.<br/>
