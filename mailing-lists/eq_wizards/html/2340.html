<div id="ygrps-yiv-1793768719">This list should be used to discuss wizards in respect to Everquest.<br/>
Whether it be hints for newbies or ways to improve the class or whatnot.<br/>
I understand that some people are totally happy with the class and some<br/>
people are not. Those who are can just ignore the &quot;improvement&quot; threads. <br/>
<br/>
If you want to discuss quests, grouping, or events...then start a thread<br/>
here on that! Rather than complaining about the complainers (hehe). I<br/>
would be more than willing to discuss anything that is brought up here.<br/>
I just don&#39;t think we should limit the mailing list because several<br/>
people aren&#39;t interested in a certain thread.<br/>

&gt; Hello... I have subscribed to this list for about 2 months now... and<br/>
&gt; I think it&#39;s about time someone said something.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am tired of wizards using this list for griping about class<br/>
&gt; problems. I know that it is not uncommon. The eq_bards list does it as<br/>
&gt; well... But isn&#39;t it time that we said... ok enough... I&#39;m tired of<br/>
&gt; emails that just flame verant. It&#39;s getting to the point where even<br/>
&gt; the emails that try to be constructive still irritate me...<br/>
&gt; This list should be used for constructive purposes... such as helping<br/>
&gt; newbies... verification of quests... or maybe even for grouping<br/>
&gt; together to play online.. or for online roleplaying events... This was<br/>
&gt; not meant as a &quot;lets flame verant&quot; forum. Once this may have been<br/>
&gt; appropriate to talk about here... but it is becoming a constant bother<br/>
&gt; to those who subscribed to this list for game information.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If it comes down to it ... I think it would be apropriate to start a<br/>
&gt; new onelist. Maybe you could call it EQ_petitions but this list is<br/>
&gt; getting to bogged down.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Feel free to reply and voice your opinion.... extra points for<br/>
&gt; agreeing with me.... =)<br/>
