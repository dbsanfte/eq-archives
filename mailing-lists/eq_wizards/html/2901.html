<div id="ygrps-yiv-648486009">A gypsy named &quot;marsella&quot; (I think) has it.  She is in a camp just up the<br/>
road from the bridge in E. karna(I think).  There is a guard tower up on the<br/>
hill from her.camp.  Also be very alert here. hill giants and griffens<br/>
patrol close to this area.  This item may not be working properly, I am not<br/>
sure.  You can get 3 books from her.  The research tome for a greater light<br/>
stone and the two recipe books for a lightstone each.  Good luck.</div>
