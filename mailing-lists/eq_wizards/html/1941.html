<div id="ygrps-yiv-786474313">I think that the gate spells are well placed. Some are gating to &#39;safe&#39;<br/>
places and close to cities. Other&#39;s are gating to not so safe places near<br/>
dungeons and adventure zones. Just last night I travelled all the continents<br/>
within the a span of 30 minutes (getting various stuff) and found it well<br/>
worth it. Gates to our guilds within the city itself would have been a good<br/>
idea I think. But other than that I&#39;m not too worried about the gate stuff.<br/>

Druids btw, are supposed to be the masters of travel.<br/>
