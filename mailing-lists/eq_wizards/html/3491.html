<b>Subject:</b> Dwarves at Dock in Butcher Block <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-705765087">I am currently level 34, and I am almost level 35.  Without getting into the debate about whether Wizards should or should not solo, does anyone know if I can solo the dwarves at the BB dock at level 35?  I have killed them in a group and I have seen level 35 pet classes soloing them, but I am not sure if a wizzie can solo them at 35.  Anyone soloed them at 35? If not, has anyone soloed them?  If so, what level?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
