<br/>
I am very happy as I have just escaped level 30 hell, where you have to do three times as many kills to get same xp. Now I hope I don&#39;t die and lose a whole bub of xp, as happens in level 31. Anyway, I almost didn&#39;t buy Thunder Strike spell because I heard it was resisted a lot, like the terrible Force Strike spell, but no, it is great. I have casted many times on red mobs and hit for full damage, only an occasional resist. And it is fun to see the mob knocked back a bit when it hits. I have used Inferno Strike on the same mobs, and have seen it partially resisted, but Thunder Strike always hits for full. And it goes up 3 dmg per level like the other spells. I keep it loaded at all times now.<br/>

I don&#39;t have any info on the new quests. Anyone know of a good website to find out about them? I have tried Graffe&#39;s site but did not see info about the new ones.<br/>

And I agee with Lim&#39;Dul, the grp teleports are fun. Was just able to help out someone who was stuck in a house in Kaladim, could not leave even when crouching, got stuck in doorway. So I teleported him out.  He was so grateful, and made me feel pretty cool. And it is nice to make some pp teleporting higher level guys who give me /tells asking for a ride. I don&#39;t charge lower level guys, or people who are on corpse retrieval, etc. <br/>
