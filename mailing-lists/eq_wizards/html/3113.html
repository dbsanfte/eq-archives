Subject: RE: Your kidding me<br/>
Flashbacks are caused by a brain hemorrhage, which is caused by bad<br/>
LSD...the rat poison or other harmful type.  I didn&#39;t say all LSD had no<br/>
side effects, I said morning glory LSD (much like paode) had no permanent<br/>
damages.&gt;&gt;	<br/>
<br/>
Your wrong.  Without going into credentials here...look it up or call my<br/>
office..i&#39;ll explain the process of how it is stored in the fatty tissues of<br/>
the body.  Brain hemorrages have absolutely nothing to do with a flash<br/>
back...unless you are speaking of a possible symptomatic response.</div>
