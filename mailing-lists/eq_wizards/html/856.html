I have heard that the formula for mana should be INT/5 and rounded down and <br/>
to this you add 2 and multiply with your level and that gives: Mana = (INT/5 <br/>
+ 2)*level. But when i tested it it seemed more like i had (INT/5 + <br/>
2)*(level+1). But the +1 to level also sounds reasonable enough since normal <br/>
skills are also in that form (like 5*(level +1)). But im by no means sure <br/>
that this is the right formula.<br/>
Note that the INT/5 is rounded down so having 134 in int should give the <br/>
same as 130. Of course you will later on acquire equipment that raises your <br/>
INT so no need to worry that you may have wasted 4 points in INT. It will be <br/>
usefull later on.<br/>
But in conclusion i think that you should have something in the range of <br/>
(INT/5 + 2)*level. Mayby people could post how many mana they think they <br/>
have at which level and we could figure out the correct formula out. At <br/>
level 14 it seemed like i had about 440-450 mana with 142 in INT but mayby i <br/>
got a bit of mana back while testing (casting 4 bind affinity and some minor <br/>
spells), but im not sure. I&#39;ll probably test again when i get enough <br/>
patience to use all my mana while not in combat :)<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helped.<br/>
