<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-5981185">Cat&#39;s Eye Agate is a gem sold by the merchant in town who sells gems and<br/>
stones.  So far I have found this gem in all the towns I have looked in<br/>
(Felwith, Qeynos, Freeport, and High Hold - In the keep).  They usually sell<br/>
for about 2 gold 5 silver, though High Hold sells them for 2 gold 2 silver.<br/>
