<div id="ygrps-yiv-298626092">Me personally?  I&#39;m a 18th level wiz dark elf.  That&#39;s why I am limited to <br/>
wearing cloth types.. I do have a goss robe myself and was just speaking to <br/>
other items than robes there.  I have a damask item, woven items and a <br/>
netted piece too.  That is why I mentioned them, but I couldn&#39;t recall <br/>
where they were picked up other than the damask wrist piece because I just <br/>
got that in Najena a couple days ago.  I&#39;m too lazy and not scrolling back <br/>
through all these emails to see what the other person was or if they <br/>
mentioned it, because I&#39;m going back to sleep!<br/>

&gt;According to Cristie:<br/>
&gt; &gt; You can get some woven armor or damask... we pretty much have to stick to<br/>
&gt; &gt; cloth types but they are much better for certain.  I think we are able to<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have to assume you&#39;re human.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A marginal improvement over your cloth might be had by hunting frogloks<br/>
&gt;in the sewers. Frogloks have netted armor, which is exactly the same as<br/>
&gt;cloth, but as light or lighter as small sizes - thus you can scrap 1 or<br/>
&gt;2 units of weight. Probably not worth the bother. It wasn&#39;t for me: I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;high elf, and thus able to wear small size.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;After this, you must relocate to Freeport. Woven armor is gotten out of<br/>
&gt;Frogloks too, but you must go down to the Innothule Swamp and their home<br/>
&gt;of Upper Guk for this. Woven is about equivalent to patchwork, and can<br/>
&gt;be worn by all races & classes, and is light.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Damask is from Najena mostly, equivalent to leather, and limited to casters.<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s a tad too high level for you now, I think.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Then you have Gossamer, which is high level stuff :)<br/>
