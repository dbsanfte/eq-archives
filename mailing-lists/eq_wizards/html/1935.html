<b>Subject:</b> Here is the Spell list <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1400247132">Due to the overwhelming response, I&#39;ve sent the file to the group.  If<br/>
you respond to this message or the digest, please make sure the file is<br/>
no longer attached.  Feel free to make additions and corrections on the<br/>
spread sheet and E-Mail them Directly To Me (Save Bandwidth).  I will<br/>
then compile the changes and E-mail the updated copy to the group.<br/>
Before opening the spread sheet please note that it is a spoiler.  It<br/>
contains all the spells I have heard about up to level 49, components<br/>
needed to research the spell, and I&#39;ve recently began adding which city<br/>
the spell can be bought.  Most things on the spell list still need to be<br/>
verified.  There are also several columns for casting time, please only<br/>
fill in the first column with your channeling skill, and the casting<br/>
times for the spells you own.  Also, don&#39;t worry about the damage/mana<br/>
ratio.  I&#39;ll finish that after all the cahnges are compiled.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy<br/>
