  The advice I&#39;ve been given is to save all of your points for later use with research, dodge, languages and specializations.  Right now I&#39;m lvl 12 with 57 practice points saved, and all the skills I use are maxed out, you can get them up a lot easier by just buying a cheap spell that doesn&#39;t cost much mana and just casting like crazy until the skill is maxed.<br/>

    I&#39;m currently level 6 and have only used one of my training points to train in meditation. I assume that once I hit a certain level I&#39;ll realize what&#39;s lacking and then train alot in that, but any suggestions would be helpful. I was also saving up for spell research. Is spell research a skill that goes up quickly? Also, what does raising the spell research skill improve? All help is appreciated. Thanks, Lott. </span></blockquote></div>
