<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094216832">Gee I wish I could be on your server.  5-10pp seems ridiculously low <br/>
for the mithaniel marr server.  Although even 10pp pieces seems like <br/>
an impossibility to me. This server seems to be dominated by guild <br/>
campers and privateers.  In the time I have been here (on nearly <br/>
constantly) for instance there is one and only one person offering int <br/>
raising bracelets (Radigan) and I beleive they are ac+3, mana+15 and <br/>
he is asking a FIRM 15pp each.  I bought an entire set of banded <br/>
armour (for my bard who is stinking rich by my wizards standards and <br/>
can make 30 pp in 5 hours of play) less cloak for nearly that price! <br/>
<br/>
As for other items, I have seen a few auctions for woven, magical <br/>
staffs or other lore items.  When they are auctioned they are gone <br/>
immediately and the prices they fetch are insane (unless you know the <br/>
camper .... err seller).  I have seen simple pieces of netted at <br/>
starting prices of 30pp!  As for the majority which are never <br/>
auctioned they are either camped then kept within the camping click or <br/>
selfishly horded to prevent anyone else from attaining them.  Like I <br/>
have said before the game should actually be renamed to everGREED,  <br/>
GREEDquest, PRIVATEERquest, BARTERquest. <br/>
<br/>
I guess on a bright side I have heard stories (actually I know of <br/>
several lucky Bast@#ds) that have aquired the runed totem staff for a <br/>
mere 20pp.  Which is close to the asking price of the FS GS here in <br/>
mithaniel (over priced land of powergammers) marr.<br/>
<br/>
I have a 9th level wizard that currently walks Narrath in a shoddy sr <br/>
apprentise robe with a worn great staff.  I have lost count of the <br/>
number of times I have died as a result of trying to do the last 3 <br/>
points of damage to a fleeing creature swinging once in what seems <br/>
like every 10 seconds yet not willing to wasted the precious 8 mana to <br/>
frost the critter to death.  Or was forced to run as a result of 2 <br/>
successful blows from an enemy.  Sye.... <br/>
<br/>
I have only been able to buy 8 spells TOTAL and have 7pp in the bank.  <br/>
I played yesterday and had one of the most productive (highest kill to <br/>
time ratios) nights I can recall and after 18 straight hours of play I <br/>
had aquired 8pp! :(  How is one ever to afford anything?  You can&#39;t <br/>
fight for it as it is camped. In the slim chance that you do get the <br/>
opportunity to fight, Varent has reduced the odds of anything good <br/>
dropping so low after the latest patchs (and keep in mind it must be <br/>
your turn to loot) that I have projected I would age 30 real years <br/>
before I could ever hope of aquiring one decent item!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even want to think about the 12th level spells and the fact I <br/>
will have to play 7 by 24 for a week to buy one spell! <br/>
