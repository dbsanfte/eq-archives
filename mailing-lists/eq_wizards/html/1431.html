<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-888128281">Greetings,<br/>
    I found a Hollow Skull in Paw the other day and have tried to figure out<br/>
its uses.  No it does nto combine the Skull of Jhen&#39;Tra and the RTS, &quot;If<br/>
even possible at all&quot;.  Supposedly it is used to create some Necro staff but<br/>
I have been unable to find any pices to it yet.   The skull has 2<br/>
compartments and a Combine button.  If anyone know how to use this I would<br/>
greatly appreciate it.<br/>
