<div id="ygrps-yiv-1483314079">On ballance...anybody can ballance a game that olny gives you THREE options<br/>
for race/class!<br/>
I think that Verant has done a pretty good job of ballancing...they just<br/>
need to continue with MINOR tweaking as time goes on to maintain the<br/>
ballance.<br/>
Just my hyumble opinion :)&#39;<br/>

Venlaan 21st Wizard,<br/>
<br/>
Finally pulled out he old bang, fizzle, RUN! Char last night. Was in<br/>
highpass and tried to take a green gnoll. Actually hit him for 171(Was<br/>
shocked at this). Then enstill didn&#39;t work and I got the crap beat out of<br/>
me, but zoned in time. After regen I headed back in. There was a 20th lvl<br/>
ranger. ( I know it&#39;s a hybrid class.)  She took out three blues (Blues to<br/>
me) without a resting period.  And I questioned our &quot;power&quot; as wizards.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I have noticed in Blizzard games. (Don&#39;t get me wrong here) is<br/>
they spent enough time before release finding BALANCE in a game.  Yeah they<br/>
had a ton a problems with cheating but the underlying BALANCE was there.<br/>
Everquest can be a GREAT game if they can work these out.  If you have<br/>
noticed the patches flying around they totally deal with balace in the game.<br/>
Perhpas they should look at the wizard class to see if there is any balance<br/>
there at all.<br/>
