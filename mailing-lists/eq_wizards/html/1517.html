&gt; Do you know what s the purpose of the dexterity ?? I get a cape ac 8 plus 5<br/>
&gt; in dexterity.. And i don t see any change for ac or for sepl. Any idea ?<br/>
&gt; A second question : you just said eye of zom can open door cool : is it<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Agility affects your armour class.<br/>
Dexterity affects your chance of recovering when you&#39;ve been interupted.  I<br/>
put my 5 extra points into this at character creation (into an already<br/>
dexterous gnome), and at level 8 it seems to be making a slight difference.<br/>
I&#39;ve talked to Euridites my level who regain concentration 1 or 2 times a<br/>
night, whereas I&#39;ll regain concentration 5 or 6 times on average.  Mostly<br/>
these recoveries aren&#39;t occuring in battle, but when I cast to quickly after<br/>
running.  Overall I&#39;m very happy with the points spent in dexterity and I&#39;m<br/>
even thinking about blowing some cash on derv rings to improve it more (at<br/>
least until those +int items come along)<br/>
