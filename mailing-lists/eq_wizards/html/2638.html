<div id="ygrps-yiv-966332552">The other big damage spells(Force Shock etc...) that disrupt are resisted<br/>
too often in PvP to be reliable.  The only one that I have used with success<br/>
is Tishan&#39;s Clash which also is resisted so I use it with caution.<br/>
<br/>
As for Rallos Zek, yes I do see many people quitting and I think that their<br/>
reasons for the most part are valid.  The two most powerful classes for PvP<br/>
and dueling in my opinion are the Wizard and Druid(People say Necros too but<br/>
I haven&#39;t seen enough of them in PvP situations to make a judgement on<br/>
them).  There IS skill involved in dueling but the classes weren&#39;t designed<br/>
for balance in PvP.  If a caster knows what they are doing, A melee type<br/>
doesn&#39;t stand a chance.  I have seen a few duels where a well played melee<br/>
class destroys the caster.  A monk with JBoots is a hard fight for a caster<br/>
in an enclosed area...  I have also seen a level 31 Bard annihilate a 35<br/>
Wizard.  And that fight was won with skill and knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
At least these quittin guys are gettin some cash sellin their characters on<br/>
Ebay =)<br/>

ahhh.  i like that. and u can cast about 15-20 of those suckers too for a<br/>
nice 83dmg.  any other spells that disrupt?  from what i can tell, force<br/>
shock and frost shock knock u back a step or two when cast????  i think we<br/>
need another stun spell somewhere between tishan and markar (lvl 20 and lvl<br/>
49).<br/>

ps. euros, ur on rz right? im noticing a LOT of ppl quitting because of the<br/>
terrible combat engine and imbalance in PvP combat.  seems like if<br/>
everything isn&#39;t perfectly setup (ie. a duel) then the outcome is 99%<br/>
predictable (save for guild wars which are non-existent on the server now).<br/>

&gt;I was messing around with some friends (whom are all casting classes and me<br/>
&gt;as a wiz) tonight and discovered(from a tip) something very interesting...<br/>
&gt;At higher levels everyone&#39;s DD spells take a while to cast...  Our secret<br/>
&gt;weapon is our level 12 DD spell shock of lightning.  It is hardly ever<br/>
&gt;resisted, casts extremely fast AND interrupts casting.  You can chain cast<br/>
&gt;this sucker so much faster than other casting classes it&#39;s sick.  Unless my<br/>
&gt;buddies went to their lower level spells, I would interrupt them every<br/>
 </span></blockquote>time.<br/>
