<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As a fellow l4 spellslinger, I proffer my advice. =) The spells I use the<br/>
most right now are Frost Bolt, Minor Shielding, and Root and Icestrike<br/>
(in combination). MS for its obvious protective benefits, Frost Bolt<br/>
because it&#39;s a nice basic offensive spell, Root (to hold a creature) and<br/>
IS (to smack him around with sleet). You&#39;ll need to study Alteration a<br/>
bit or Root will constantly fizzle until you build it up around 10. <br/>
<br/>
Right now my life mainly consists of fishing, practicing spells and<br/>
medidating, with the occasional hunting expedition. =) (Meditating is a<br/>
great skill, if you don&#39;t have it yet get it as soon as you can. It sucks<br/>
waiting around for your mana to trickle back.)<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helped a bit, must be back to work...<br/>
