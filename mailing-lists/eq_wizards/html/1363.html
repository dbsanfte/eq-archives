Im pleased my posting caused so much debate! I guess I&#39;m just nostalgic<br/>
for the old AD&D days when I got my 9th level spells at 18th level and<br/>
bullied all around me, even the Dungeon Master got scared of my 9th<br/>
level spells. <br/>
<br/>
Seriously, Its important for the game that ridiculously high level<br/>
Wizards wield the most power. This is a fundemental aspect of our<br/>
understanding for the Wizard of popular myth. <br/>
<br/>
As a character class We suffer enough for it.<br/>
