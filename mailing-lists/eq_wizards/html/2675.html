    You have to go along the shore to the right of the docks where the boat comes in.  There is a lone man fishing there.  Swim into the water directly in front of him.  There is a lone shark there and the box is underneath it.  <br/>

        Has anybody done the journal strongbox quest in freeport?  I keep getting told that the journal strongbox I need to get is in the water by the freeport docks but I cannot find it!  I&#39;ve tried killing the sharks to see if it was loot, and I didn&#39;t get any loot. Can anybody who is familiar with this quest help? <br/>
          <br/>
        Thanks, <br/>
