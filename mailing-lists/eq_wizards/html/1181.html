<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1829990383">According to Marziani, Michael D.:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sorry all I must be dumb or something, but although I found 2 wizard<br/>
&gt; guildmasters in the magic user area in Freeport, I cannot find the vendor<br/>
&gt; that sells level 8 wizard spells.  I explored the area around the floating<br/>
&gt; building, and on the inside I have looked in the downstairs area and the<br/>
&gt; upstairs.  Can anyone confirm / deny that these spells are actually sold in<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All upstairs. I carefully checked the locations, and the wizard spells<br/>
are almost all sold at the top of the building. If I remember right, it&#39;s<br/>
three stairs up from the entrance.<br/>
<br/>
As I remember, I would get the spells at about 4pp and 2gp, which is why<br/>
I preferred to make my shopping in Felwithe, where they sold to me for 3pp<br/>
and 9gp. And Felwithe has a nice selection of spells, including all the<br/>
high level (up to 49 level) teleports, gates and portals.  Takes about an<br/>
hour to go there, however, depending on where the ship is when you want to<br/>
take it.<br/>
<br/>
And I had the need to see Faydark again at the time. Homesickness, no<br/>
doubt.<br/>
