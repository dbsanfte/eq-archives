<div id="ygrps-yiv-170794621">To add to this, I would counsel that you keep shadowstep memmed until you<br/>
get Yonder at level 29.  Fade pretty much is just to practice the skill<br/>
with, but shadowstep and gate has saved my life more times than I remember.<br/>
And Yonder is even better!  It casts Ultra fast, and you end up with a great<br/>
deal of time to cast gate and get out of there.  Only very rarely has Yonder<br/>
not moved me far enough to cast gate.  Usually I have enough time to cast<br/>
two gates before the mob even finds me.<br/>

&gt; ROOT is the most important spell you can use in a dungeon or in solo... it<br/>
&gt; is the only thing that makes you a true force to be faced!  Here is the<br/>
&gt; accepted method for group / solo for me:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Group:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; let some one pull it... let the tank beat on it for about a count of 15<br/>
&gt; (slow 15... if you get excited count to 30) and unleash with 2 of your<br/>
best<br/>
&gt; DD spells... If one is resisted then you can try a third... but beware...<br/>
&gt; Count another 10 and let loose with another spell...<br/>
&gt; When the creature gets to about 25-40 percent of its life, ROOT it... then<br/>
&gt; nuke as hard as you can.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Solo:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BOLT SPELL BOLT SPELL BOLT SPELL!<br/>
&gt; okay here is the sequence...:<br/>
&gt; cast your most powerful bolt spell at long range.  As the bolt flies out<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; are already in spell reset stage... when the bolt hits you are ready to<br/>
&gt; ROOT... heck half the time I have to keep hitting the ROOT hot key just<br/>
till<br/>
&gt; the monster gets in range!  You will start casting as soon as it gets in<br/>
&gt; range and get the spell off well before it gets to you.  Now to the<br/>
&gt; important part... BACK OFF!  backup  till the monster looks about the same<br/>
&gt; size on the screen as it did when you first cast the first bolt... then<br/>
&gt; recast the bolt..  if the monster breaks after a hit just start recasting<br/>
&gt; the root (it is still out of range like the first time right?) fast till<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; goes off... back up and repeat...  If the creature ever gets into melee<br/>
&gt; range just take a deep breath wait till you see his attack attempt and hit<br/>
&gt; that ROOT!  You should get it off before he can attack you.  (this does<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; mean that he wont get another attack on you)  Then back up till just in<br/>
bolt<br/>
&gt; range and repeat!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the off chance your group is pulling too red a creature for you... mem<br/>
&gt; your fire shield and hold off attacking that thing till it has less than<br/>
25%<br/>
&gt; hps... you have a little better chance at hitting it... plus cast a spell<br/>
&gt; that is one circle back from what your capable of at the time any way<br/>
 most<br/>
&gt; likely a deep red will resist at least partially if not all the time even<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; 25% hps so you might as well do less (max damage) so it doesn&#39;t pull on<br/>
&gt; you...  Oh yea ... bind in the zone near the zone point... and make sure<br/>
&gt; gate is a mem&#39;d spell... if your going to be useless make sure you atleast<br/>
&gt; wont die with the rest of the silly&#39;s.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have few spells, maybe 4/level, and cant wait till we can rearrange<br/>
our<br/>
&gt; spellbooks. So I can move the never-used spells (Root, Fade, lvl 1 damage<br/>
&gt; spells...) to the back out of the way.  :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I think that only getting spells every 4 lvls is stupid.   I think that<br/>
&gt; &gt; we (or everybody) should get spells every lvl or every other lvl.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Especially for wizards.  My friend who is a lvl 5 enchanter almost has<br/>
&gt; &gt; more spells then I do.  They gave us so many useless spells.  Like the<br/>
&gt; &gt; low lvl Sphere of light.  I havent had the need for any other damage<br/>
&gt; &gt; spell besides shocks or bolts.  Then again I am also at a low lvl.<br/>
