<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468716010">I don&#39;t know what happened but I cant seem to get into the game anymore.<br/>
After I select my guy, I hit enter world and then after about a minute, I<br/>
get the &#39;Server not responding&quot; message.  I have reinstalled and repatched<br/>
the game.  Changed my settings for my video and sound cards and a half a<br/>
dozen other things.  Frankly I have ran out of ideas.  Any help here will be<br/>
greatly appreciated.  I want my EQ!!!  My friend has already leveld past me<br/>
and we can;t have that can we?</div>
