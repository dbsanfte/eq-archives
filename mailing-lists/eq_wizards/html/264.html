<div id="ygrps-yiv-471322882"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Hi, I am a level 6 human wizard.  I noticed that my only choice for<br/>
&gt; language currently is the Common one.  Will I ever be able to learn<br/>
&gt; other languages?  In not, would that affect my ability to perform<br/>
&gt; research down the line since that apparantly requires<br/>
&gt; familiarity with<br/>
&gt; certain languages?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just hang out with some of the other races and have them chat to you<br/>
in their own language.  You won&#39;t be able to understand 90% of it in<br/>
the beginning, but your language skill will start to go up slowly, and<br/>
after a while you&#39;ll see your new language as an option.<br/>
I think Old Erudian becomes useful at higher levels for researching of<br/>
new spells.<br/>
