<br/>
Those of you looking for the definitive answer to Mana use, I apologize <br/>
for the disappointment but alas I can only offer my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Levels 1-5<br/>
Mana is cheap and Health is not: Blast the hell out of everything.<br/>
<br/>
After about level 5 Mana is complemented by Health(by that I mean you can <br/>
actually take a bit of damage and survive now) As such, an intelligent <br/>
Wizard will learn to balance the loss of Mana with taking damage. Keep <br/>
in mind that at levels 5 to roughly 8 Mana recovers(in terms of bubbles) <br/>
at about twice the rate of Health. This is important since you can still <br/>
solo comfortably at these levels. If you have lost a bubble of health <br/>
you should have already used 2 bubbles of Mana(sometimes more depending <br/>
on the situation)<br/>
<br/>
Levels 9 and up I solo occasionally but I prefer to have a friend or 2 <br/>
for the most part so that&#39;s what I&#39;ll talk about:<br/>
As the Wizard in the party your job is the hardest. You have to know <br/>
the status of your tank(or party members taking damage), the status of <br/>
the MOB or MOB&#39;s and after all that you must be able to balance your <br/>
Mana(and sometimes your health) with the health of your tanks in order <br/>
to get the most out of your fighting time.<br/>
<br/>
Tanks getting the snot beat out of them? A good Wizard will have no mana <br/>
and have lost a bubble or 2 of health by the end of the fight. A big Mob <br/>
may hit me for between 20 and 40 points a pop which a level 10 Wizard can <br/>
take between 1 and 3 shots depending on the damage done. Needless to say <br/>
your tanks will be able to get in several hits while you&#39;re taking your <br/>
lumps. Save a little Mana so when you back off you can deal that killing <br/>
blow and keep your MOB from running away.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re in a fight that is middle of the road, and you expect your <br/>
tanks to lose 2-3 bubbles of Health you can easily get away with using <br/>
3/4 of your Mana on this kill and still be the first one ready for your <br/>
next fight. When your party first engages the MOB jump in and get a few <br/>
melee hits in. Your tanks will do enough damage to keep the MOB&#39;s <br/>
attention from you. After a few hits step back and cast a couple of your <br/>
offensive spells of choice(shock of lightning etc...) sit down and take <br/>
note of your party members health bars(keep and eye on this at all times) <br/>
as well as the MOB&#39;s health bar. When the MOB is down in health a bit <br/>
jump back in and take a few more melee shots at it. If you did your job <br/>
the MOB will turn and hit you once or twice. Back up and finish him <br/>
off(when his health is low enuff) with your damage spell.<br/>
This last scenario is my most common and usually ends up to be the best <br/>
Exp for the time spent. Most of these Mobs are Yellow cons(a few reds) <br/>
and I usually have 1 sometimes 2 ppl that I work with like this.<br/>
<br/>
As you get higher in levels you will not be able to take a hit or 2 as <br/>
comfortably as you once could so this behavior where I take some of the <br/>
damage will eventually stop. At what level I&#39;m not exactly sure since I <br/>
like sticking my neck out for the rush hehehe!<br/>
<br/>
For weaker MOB&#39;s it&#39;s almost a waste to use more than a spell or 2. Again <br/>
a proper balance of Health and Mana will optimize your adventuring and <br/>
fighting time.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that every situation is different which means I try to fight <br/>
using these tactics but that&#39;s not always possible. For those of you that <br/>
are already up there in level I apologize for typing out what you already <br/>
know. One thing everyone should keep in mind: Never be afraid to use all <br/>
your mana if the situation warrants it; it always takes your tanks longer <br/>
to recover their health than for you to recover your Mana.<br/>
