<div id="ygrps-yiv-1911039825">First off.. you guys are still low lvls.. and everybody does pretty much the <br/>
same dmg... clerics, wiz, shamans, mages.. no real big difference.  But at <br/>
higher lvls us wizards there are no equal.  At 24 you get a 200dmg DD.  at <br/>
30 you get one that does 300dmg plus stuns.  Shamans are weak healers, weak <br/>
fighters, and weak nukers at high lvls.  At high lvls, everybody will ahve <br/>
journeyman&#39;s boots or the new Rings of Running (please don&#39;t ask me about <br/>
them, i do&#39;nt know enough info to really talk about them), so they&#39;re SoW <br/>
will be useless.  Plus, us wiz get teleportation and plane travelling spells <br/>
that no other class except the druid has.  Believe me, at lvl 30+ certain <br/>
classes are pretty much useless.. shamans and mages come to mind (pets are <br/>
crap and their attack spells are crap.. nobody likes the pet eating the exp. <br/>
either).  Tell your shaman friend about the group portals, evacuation, and <br/>
plane portal spells he will never have.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m a level 11 wizard about to turn 12.  Well my friend is a shaman who <br/>
&gt;just<br/>
&gt;turned 14. Well he just brought<br/>
&gt;his new damage spell and he said it does 77 damage, to which i replied kewl<br/>
&gt;my next spell does that amount<br/>
&gt;too. That was a mistake he started laughing and saying things like &quot;why<br/>
&gt;would anyone want to play the wizard<br/>
&gt;when they can play the shaman&quot;.  &quot;the shaman can stand toe to toe like the<br/>
&gt;warrior and do the same damage<br/>
&gt;as the wizard, Ha HA HA HA .....&quot; . Then he went on saying crap like now he<br/>
&gt;knows the shaman is the best<br/>
&gt;class in the game. All he could talk about before was the sow spell, and <br/>
&gt;now<br/>
&gt;it is he does the same damage<br/>
&gt;as the wizard.  My question is this, i thought i picked the wizard so i<br/>
&gt;would not have to hear stuff like this?<br/>
&gt;I thought level 12 was when the wizard started to leave other mage class<br/>
&gt;behind.  Know i have to hear alot<br/>
&gt;aggraviating crap from this shaman, laughing at the wizard class. Dam that<br/>
&gt;is going to suck.  Someone<br/>
&gt;please tell me there is hope out there as far as the damage spells go. </span></blockquote></div>
