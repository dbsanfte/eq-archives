Mistmoore is alright.  I think it&#39;s very suited for us wizzies..most of the <br/>
casters there will fall pretty quickly for a one-on-one.  But I somehow <br/>
gravitated to Cazic more because it had better loot and a better chance to <br/>
group.  I started there at around 24 and the xp skyrocketed well into the <br/>
lower 30&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Paw is an interesting suggestion to.  Last night was my first experience <br/>
back there since the upgrade...most of the Mob&#39;s in there were blue to me at <br/>
34, but I was surprised how well they fought...felt like we were fighting <br/>
yellows.  I think it&#39;s probably easier in Cazic.<br/>
<br/>
Aviaks in Karanas are good between 20-22 I&#39;d say, but you&#39;ll find it <br/>
frustrating not to be able to participate with groups hitting the big-birdy <br/>
Avocates. =)  It got achingly slow with xp at level 23-24.<br/>
