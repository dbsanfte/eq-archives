<div id="ygrps-yiv-631141137">uhhh wizards shouldn&#39;t summon... no matter what. or else magicians<br/>
enchanters and necros would be all the more useles.<br/>
<br/>
i didn&#39;t catch what Phase did... and about the spatial warp... it&#39;s needs<br/>
tweaking but it&#39;s a good idea. BUT if a gnome was twice his own size... he<br/>
still wouldn&#39;t be as big as an ogre ;-)<br/>

&gt;I&#39;ve been thinking a little bit about the spells I presented.  Now, as<br/>
 </span></blockquote>wizards we are masters of transportation, and we do this through<br/>
manipulation of space and time (unlike those strange druids who pray to<br/>
their god and hope he or she drops them off in the right place).<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;I could see phase coming into action around level 12; high enough so it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>doesn&#39;t become unbalancing, low enough to give players a taste of<br/>
teleportation.  Summon, somewhere between 20 and 29.  Summon can and should<br/>
be able to be cast on another during combat, the little &quot;do you wish to be<br/>
summoned Y/N&quot; box should be more then enough of a pain so you can&#39;t just<br/>
have someone sit a little bit back and pull off people who are next to<br/>
death.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;I wouldn&#39;t expect to see the greater summon or phase spell to come in much<br/>
 </span></blockquote>later, perhaps a little something for us for the expasion pack, like a level<br/>
59 spell or something.  You have to have been in the same zone to group up<br/>
with the person after all.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;I doubt we would really see group gate abused as someone said it would, woe<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to the wizard to binds himself in a dragons lair and dies with his party.<br/>
Personally, since evacuate spells drop you and your party off somewhere else<br/>
when things get nasty, the only difference is that you don&#39;t have to walk as<br/>
far to get back to where you want to be.  Plus, as it stands now wizards<br/>
can&#39;t hurt monsters 6 levels above them, a caster heavy party gets worked by<br/>
high level monsters, while a tank heavy party with a goodly number of<br/>
healers does just fine against very high level mobs.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;As for a haste spell, lets make it a bit more &quot;fun&quot;.  Let&#39;s do exactly what<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Verrant doesn&#39;t want us to do, make Norrath smaller.  Well, actually make us<br/>
bigger, it&#39;s all relative.  I humbly present:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Fastus&#39; Spatial Warp (Fastus&#39; optional of course, just a little bit of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>egoism, hey, we all want to have a spell named after us right?) - Doubles<br/>
your size, and because of this self only increase in size, your speed is<br/>
increased, you get 50 strength, and you eat eight times as much.  Imagine<br/>
gnomes: you can walk up to an orge and say &quot;whats up shorty?&quot;  =P<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Maybe add a cast on other varient in the 60&#39;s range for the expantion pack.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think somewhere between level 29 to 39 would be a more then fair for the<br/>
self only varient and would not cause a playbalence issue.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;So, what do you all think?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Fastus Atrox<br/>
