<div id="ygrps-yiv-249755599">Ok guys and girls, I took the liberty of doing some editing to Silverion&#39;s text as well as adding some of the other&#39;s comments, and my own =)<br/>
<br/>
I think that there are some really excellent suggestions here and I also feel that by sending them this we are finally showing some true support for the class we all love.  We are also on the way to making a unique class, instead of just &quot;magical artillery&quot;.  Lets keep bombarding them with ideas and let them sort &#39;em out and deal with game balance issues.  After all, isnt that what we are paying them for?<br/>
<br/>
Ok, what follows is the revised text (feel free to make comments, edit, whatever, just send those emails!!!):<br/>
<br/>
We, the Wizards of the Onelist.com Wizards mailing list, feel the Wizard class requires revision and have compiled the following list:<br/>
<br/>
New Spells<br/>
Summon -     Teleports group member inside the zone to your location<br/>
Phase -         Teleports yourself to location of other group member inside zone<br/>
Tap Afinity -  Teleport group member to their own bind spot<br/>
Haste -           Increases movement rate for self only.<br/>
Group Gate - Slow casting spell which teleports group to your bind spot, doesn&#39;t leave anyone behind<br/>
Retreat -        Evacuate version of group gate<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Changes to existing spells:<br/>
<br/>
Root -             Minimum time duration, with random maxium time duration.<br/>
Fade              Useless, remove completely<br/>
Shadowstep   Change to line of sight, with minimum travelled distance and random max. distance.<br/>
<br/>
Skill Changes<br/>
Meditation skill max for level for wizard (Level +1) * 7.<br/>
<br/>
We also request the implementation of the Specialization skill.<br/>
<br/>
Game Mechanics<br/>
-Investigate the increase of spell failures (fizzles) of lower level spells as Wizard class advances in levels.  Should &quot;simpler&quot; spells fail more often as the Wizard increase in levels, regardless of appropriate skill?  (ie. Root, Shielding etc.)<br/>
<br/>
- Resolving the problem of high resistence of Level 20+ DD spells by greens, blues and higher (if this is the result of a stun effect we wish one spell without this efect at same level)<br/>
<br/>
- Resolving the balance problem of other magic-using classes still able to affect MoBs (in a group situation) that are 6+ above their own levels (Necromancer - Lifetap & pets, Enchanters and Magicians - pets, buffs, etc) while Wizard DD spells are 100% resisted by 6+ level MoBs.<br/>
<br/>
- Better use of time when meditating (acces to main chat server in separate window) <br/>
<br/>
- We wish real official feedback on planned changes or problems which you have with balance in game on an official page which exists but never seems to be updated (eg. id&#39;s Quake .plan files)<br/>
<br/>
We feel the Wizard class has been overlooked far too long and that there is nothing that is truly unique about our characters anymore.  We feel the above changes would go a long way towards rectifying some of the classes shortcomings.  Thanks for your consideration.<br/>
