<b>Subject:</b> Yonder is a Wizard Spell again!!! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-798402993">I was in Qeynos updating my spell book.  I ran into the spell Yonder and<br/>
this time it came back as a Wizard only spell.  This means that Verant<br/>
either remodified Yonder, or their are two varieties of the spell, and<br/>
Akanon merchants carry the wrong copy.  Also Bonds of Force is a level<br/>
29 spell based on Alteration and costs 15 mana to cast.  Has anybody<br/>
tried it?  Is it a new variety of Root?</div>
