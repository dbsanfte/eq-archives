<div id="ygrps-yiv-846884282">All you need is money, approximately 1-2 gold pieces for first level spells.<br/>
The best place to buy spells if you are a human wizard is near your<br/>
guildmaster in Qeynos or Freeport.   Unlike UO, you do not need a supply of<br/>
reagents to cast spells.  Once you have the spell you can cast as much as<br/>
you like as long as you have sufficient mana, which you can always get by<br/>
resting or meditating.  Meditation is a skill, use it a lot and you will<br/>
regain mana faster.  It&#39;s pretty cool, b/c you can practice as much as you<br/>
want without cost.<br/>
<br/>
I think in higher level spells there are items you need to have in your<br/>
possesion to cast certain spells, but I am level six and haven&#39;t run into it<br/>
yet.  I think it&#39;s rare though.  Good luck!<br/>
