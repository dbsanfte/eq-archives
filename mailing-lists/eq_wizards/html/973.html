<div id="ygrps-yiv-1862913596">I would not count fishing in that analysis... I too am very sure that<br/>
fishing has a cap... or at least it does for my character on Cazic-Thull.<br/>
<br/>
(it seems to be the level+5 times 5)<br/>

&gt; Trade Skills I know for sure do not have a level cap for skill.  I have a<br/>
&gt; friend who is a Dark Elf Necromancer on Fennin Ro.  At level 17 he has a<br/>
&gt; Smihting skill 126.  By the level+1 times 5 rule he should be maxed at 85.<br/>
&gt; However, this is not the case.  Any of the trade skills as well as<br/>
swimming<br/>
&gt; (yes I am counting Fishing as a trade skill) have a 255 skill cap but none<br/>
&gt; other based on level that I have seen.<br/>

&gt; &gt;All skills have a cap based on level now. This was implemented towards<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt;end of the beta contrary to what Brad preached about not having to kill<br/>
bats<br/>
&gt; &gt;to become a better fisherman.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;PS -- I have not tested this with any trade skill other than fishing, if<br/>
&gt; &gt;anyone has any information on those please let me know.<br/>
