<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071022645">Ah, hehe. that&#39;s pretty good.  Pretty much the same techniques then...I <br/>
guess you are just braver than I am.  :)  I don&#39;t know what it is....but <br/>
I&#39;ve been having a real hard time getting to level 24.  Spells that I&#39;ve <br/>
been relying on like Force shock are now fizzling like mad against the <br/>
TTs...forcing me to run quite a bit.<br/>
<br/>
One TT alone did quite a number on me last night too...barely made it out <br/>
alive.  Some of my bad performance was probably attributed to the fact that <br/>
I&#39;m trying to practice my long-dormant melee 1H Blunt skills .  I&#39;m a really <br/>
bad hitter.  hehe<br/>
<br/>
I was so embarrassed last night because two normally easy blue and green <br/>
Highhold gnolls killed me on sight.  *sigh* 23 is a cursed level.<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m<br/>

<br/>
&gt;I root one Terror. </span></blockquote></div>
