One last thought:  Spells such as Sphere of Light are not entirely useless<br/>
as they also serve as trainer spells.  They are low mana cost spells that<br/>
let you practice a skill without blowing a chunk of mana at each attempt.<br/>
They have a small amount of functionality, but their real benefit is in<br/>
preparing you for higher lvl spells (e.g. Sphere of Light and Sense Magic<br/>
both train for, say, Invisibility).<br/>
