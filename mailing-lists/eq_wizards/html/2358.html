<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548135939">I think you missed my point. I agree we shouldn&#39;t put up with it, but the<br/>
fact is we do. <br/>
There are plenty of other things we can do with our time, but we make a<br/>
conscious effort<br/>
to decide to buy, play and continue to play this/these games.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;&gt;and usable.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s plenty we can do, we have the right to not play. We have the right<br/>
to play another<br/>
game. We have the right to ask for a refund if we feel they in any misled us. <br/>
<br/>
At the end of the day WE CHOOSE to continue to play this game. It&#39;s not<br/>
Verants fault that <br/>
there isn&#39;t much competition yet.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have worked in a few software companies in my time, one of my most recent<br/>
experiences I spent<br/>
3 years working at Netscape. I have yet to meet a developer that &quot;allows<br/>
themselves the luxury<br/>
of imperfection&quot;. I&quot;m not a heavy coder myself but have worked with many<br/>
coders in my time and <br/>
i can comfortably say 95% of the coders i&#39;ve seen take so much pride in<br/>
their code it&#39;s almost <br/>
sickening. It&#39;s not the coders fault for buggy products, this goes back to<br/>
my earlier statement, <br/>
WE the consumers DEMAND faster and better and Marketing departments in<br/>
Software companies<br/>
feed off this frenzy and drive engineering depts. to develop these products<br/>
that WE DEMAND<br/>
in insane time schedules. Engineers are just the poor slobs that get stuck<br/>
with these schedules that<br/>
are absolutely un-fulfillable , driven by Marketing who is driven by US. <br/>
In software it&#39;s all about supply and demand and &quot;First to Market&quot; <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yes and no .. there is plenty of competition, especially more so today than<br/>
ever in the OS dept.<br/>
you say crap like Windows and everyone hates MS, but we all still run<br/>
Windows (ok not all but <br/>
most PC users do). We ALLOW MS to stay in business and do this to us. Right<br/>
or wrong that&#39;s a <br/>
fact. We can run all different flavors of Linux, Solaris x86, SOC, BE OS,<br/>
Mac OS, Unixes, there are<br/>
options out there. <br/>
<br/>
anyhow .. i can go on for days, i&#39;m not saying you&#39;re right or wrong i&#39;m<br/>
just offering a different point<br/>
of view that is very easy to overlook in the heat of anger or dissapointment. <br/>

&gt;&gt; There is no such thing as bug free software. At least i&#39;ve never seen any<br/>
&gt;&gt; such thing. You live with the fact that<br/>
&gt;&gt; your operating system (i&#39;m guessing most of you are running some sort of MS<br/>
&gt;&gt; Windows) crashes quite often.<br/>
&gt;&gt; We were promised plug-n-play and we got plug-n-pray. Yet we still go out<br/>
&gt;&gt; and buy these buggy pieces of software.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Why ? because at the end of the day it&#39;s usually better than what we<br/>
&gt;&gt; currently have and we are willing to put up with<br/>
&gt;&gt; the bugs that are in it.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;I mean, what are we gonna do? It&#39;s not like there&#39;s anything else, right? If <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Same with M$ - they have no real competition so they allow themselves to <br/>
&gt;release<br/>
&gt;crap like Windows. And same for Verant. There is nothing better than EQ in the<br/>
&gt;RPG department, so they can be buggy and people will still play. The <br/>
&gt;addictivness<br/>
&gt;is in all the RPG&#39;s, and it will exist in Asheron&#39;s Call as well. But this<br/>
 </span></blockquote>time<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;there will be competition and less bugs will be allowed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The adictivness in EQ comes from the socialization and a real sense of<br/>
&gt;achievement. When you get to level 30 in computer game then... wow.. you&#39;re <br/>
&gt;level<br/>
&gt;30 and who cares? When you&#39;re level 30 in a computer game with hundreds of <br/>
&gt;level<br/>
&gt;15s around you, well gee, you feel an accomplishment has been made. A <br/>
&gt;competitive<br/>
&gt;environment is always addictive. Especially when it&#39;s pretty much fun.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But it is not Verant&#39;s invention and they will not be the only one&#39;s to<br/>
