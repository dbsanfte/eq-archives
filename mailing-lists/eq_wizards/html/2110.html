&gt;I for one belive in the power of the wizard and I do know that brad and <br/>
&gt;verant have absolutely no intent of changing them.  I quote &quot;Wizards are by <br/>
&gt;far the most balanced casting class and to change anything to them now would <br/>
&gt;destroy 1 years worth of game balancing&quot;.  <br/>

&quot;balancing&quot; already?  Or are they trying to say that Wizards are the<br/>
standard by which all other magic-using classes are judged?  That would be<br/>
a very cool distinction, but lower our chances of getting the Wizard class<br/>
changed to almost nil.<br/>
