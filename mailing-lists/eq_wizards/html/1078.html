<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314231846">Hey man, me and Albryno are making a SWEET webpage (www.eqfreaks.com) Newayz, we&#39;re going into very in depth detail on each class, starting with the Wizard then going on to the Rogue(I know the Wizards first, not sure about the Rogue)Well, to make this abrupt, would it be ok if we used your<br/>
Spoiler and Put your name on it? I wanna give you full credit, put you under our Afilliates section for your e-mail and all that stuff, but I really think you did a sweet job and other people should know about your hard work, who knows, we&#39;re gonna be asking for people to tell us if they can<br/>
teach others in languages, we&#39;re gonna have a section on that, so you may get to learn Old Erudin :)<br/>

&gt; Watch out, I&#39;m not kidding that a big spoiler is coming up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok, to make a new spell, you just need the book, and the proper runes.  No quills, no paper, just the lexicon and runes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The two spells I have made so far are Project Lightning and Pillar of Fire.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To make Project lightning you use the runes of Periphery and Fulgeration.  For Pillar of Fire you need Proximity and Nagafen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I can make another of both of these.  Tell me if you are interested in buying one of these two spells, or the unbuyable Project Lightning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You also need books for other spells, the spells these books contain are:<br/>
&gt; Wizards Cannon:<br/>
&gt; Identify, Project Lightning, Pillar of fire<br/>
&gt; Doctrine of Wizardry:<br/>
&gt; Enstill, Fire Spiral of Al&#39;Kabor, Cast Force, Column of Lightning, Tox Portal, Shock spiral of Al&#39;Kabor, Energy Storm<br/>
&gt; Ipsors Enlightenment III:<br/>
&gt; Nullify Magic, Circle of Force, Lava Storm, Thunderclab, Immobilize, Common Portal, Frost Spiral fo Al&#39;Kabor<br/>
&gt; Ipsors Enlightenment IV:<br/>
&gt; Gravity Flux, Wrath of Al&#39;kabor, Ice Commet, Super Nova, Paralizing Earth<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As you can see the spells you can research vary from level 16 all the way to the ungodly 1100 damage ice commet at level 49.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sure there are other books, but I havn&#39;t found them.  If you come across them, let me know!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; These spells were read off with below average in old Erudian.  I&#39;d really love it if someone on the Rathe who has excellent would train me in it.  I&#39;ll pay 20pp for the honor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know what paralizing earth is, my guess is that its along the root line of spells.  I guess you *have* to research Ice Commet, Super Nova, etc or buy them from a wizard who made them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You didn&#39;t believe me when I said this was a massive spoiler did you?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One last note, I am almost certain that there are more spells you can research.  I have a rune that starts with a &quot;V&quot;, forget the name of it at this instant.  I already translated all the components required to make these spells from these book, and none of them had this rune as a component.<br/>
