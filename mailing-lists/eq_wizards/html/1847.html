&gt; He also seem to think that wizard having -almost- same damage/mana<br/>
&gt; efficiency as magiciant is quiet ok as long as our damage is dealt<br/>
&gt; slightly faster. This really bugs me. i see no purpose whatsoever in<br/>
&gt; myself doing a mob 1000 damage in 4 shots vs a magiciant doing it in<br/>
&gt; 5.With both of us having used the same mana spent. That is suppose to be<br/>
&gt; a big asset??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the point is that wizards can do a 1000 HP&#39;s in damage about 3 times<br/>
as fast as a magician.  Go to stratistics and read the casting times on some<br/>
of their Higher level spells.  Some cast 20% slower than Gate, and we all<br/>
know how well gate works in combat.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have compiled all of the spell lists from the various sites into a<br/>
MS-Excel Spreadsheet.  It is large so I don&#39;t want to post it on a mailing<br/>
list, but I will if there is enough positive feedback.  Perhaps if I post it<br/>
once everyone can fill in the gaps, Email it directly back to me, and I&#39;ll<br/>
post it a second time after all the feedback is entered.  We can then add it<br/>
to the tome/faq that is being worked on.</div>
