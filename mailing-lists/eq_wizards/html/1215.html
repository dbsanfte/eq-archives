Fought any Evil eyes yet? When your Tank or a companions pet starts hacking<br/>
into your group you&#39;ll wish you had Cancel magic...Charm sucks... Funniest<br/>
thing was seeing our Magician running after we killed the eye and it took us<br/>
a sec to catch on that his Pet was smacking away at him.... In between<br/>
Spells and ROFL we had to kill his pet cause I didn&#39;t have Cancel memorized<br/>
at that time...Came in handy tho when the Next Evil Eye charmed one of the<br/>
Rangers....<br/>
<br/>
Why is it everyone has problems with getting cash? Through normal<br/>
adventuring I, at level 13, have just over 70pp more than enuff to buy my<br/>
5th rank spells and some of the 6th rank spells.... What&#39;s everyone doing<br/>
for cash?<br/>
