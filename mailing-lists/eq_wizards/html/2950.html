&gt; Subject: AE spell. 24th what one is good?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The spells cast Force,Column of lighting and Lightning storm are my 3 AE<br/>
&gt; spells I can make for this level. Do I realy need 3. ?Can you tell me what<br/>
&gt; one or 2 are the best pleas?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure any are &quot;best.&quot;  I use all three, but I&#39;ve talked to some<br/>
wizies who prefer just one or another.  Cast force is very nice in that it&#39;s<br/>
caster centered.  I.e. you don&#39;t have to worry about falling within the<br/>
radius of your own spell.  The column spells have better damage/mana/mob<br/>
ratios but they are *I think* of tighter radius than some of the other AE<br/>
spells (e.g. the spirals and rains)--column of lightning is, for instance,<br/>
excellent for stacked mobs.  Lightning storm has a reasonably good damage<br/>
mana ratio and it has a lesser tendency (IMO) to pull mobs to you.   In fact<br/>
target based AE are often better because your distance decreases the<br/>
tendency to pull the mob (in contrast to Cast Force).  On the other hand,<br/>
when you do pull the mob(s), you are generally further from your tanks and<br/>
it takes longer to get help.<br/>
<br/>
In short, I&#39;d recommend you play with the spells and figure out what are the<br/>
best circumstances for each.  One &quot;good&quot; place to do this is Highkeep, where<br/>
if you pull a nasty, you can generally make it to the guards  (who may or<br/>
may not save you).  Definitely don&#39;t try these in a group you don&#39;t trust.<br/>
Also, note that some AEs (e.g. rains, and cast force) are great at slowing<br/>
down PCs.  If you have a slow machine or are in a group where your tanks<br/>
have slow machines, you may want to avoid those spells.  (Try turning off<br/>
particle effects to help.)<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck.  AEs, when used right, are great spells.  I&#39;ve hit as many as<br/>
6 mobs at a time and that makes for incredible mana efficiency.  One last<br/>
thought:  If you get into a group with another wiz or magician, tell them<br/>
you&#39;d like to practice and ask them to switch to AE also.  Much safer and a<br/>
lot of fun.  Nothing like a good game of ping pong with multiple mobs.<br/>
