<div id="ygrps-yiv-2085103528">Where does it say twinking is illegal? Anyone know? I read the Rules of<br/>
Conduct and the Game Faq and there is nothing there banning the<br/>
ownership of high-level items by low-level characters. Just wanted to<br/>
let people know so that recent posts dont scare people who have high<br/>
level characters sharing the wealth with them.<br/>
