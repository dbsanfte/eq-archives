<div id="ygrps-yiv-640570257">No..there is a difference between *discussing* problems and offering <br/>
fixes...vrs *whining* about problems, and just plain nonsense BS we keep <br/>
hearing over and over again eh?<br/>
<br/>
I want to hear peoples opinions just as much as you do...just that some <br/>
people don&#39;t know how to approach a discussion intelligently.<br/>
