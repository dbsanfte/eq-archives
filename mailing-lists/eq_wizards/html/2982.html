<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-281611785"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;lv 15 - 20 	Highhold pass orc side, when there is only one group you can<br/>
&gt;start taking one of low lv orcs wich spawn here at madly rates and after<br/>
&gt;this meditating, beter to go to gnoll side if there are to much kill<br/>
&gt;stealers as you will be incriminated of KS by your mare presence as wizard<br/>
&gt;there.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Gnoll side is also good but you may need a partner unless the area is<br/>
being camped, or the spawn is broken up a bit<br/>
<br/>
East Karana Reavers are also good in this range  Gorge hounds and the<br/>
snakes out there are good too.  Stay away from the griffon type stuff.<br/>
They may not have alot of HPs but they hit REALLY hard.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;20 - 23 	Lake rathe Aviac guards (near zone to Arena), soulsek A entrance<br/>
&gt;tunel(careful of lava), Tentacle terors in najena (root, enstill one and<br/>
&gt;run to zone where you can fight other in peace)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>20 - mid 30s For soloing the Bird cage in South Karana is pretty good but<br/>
its relatively camped at all hours.  Just be kind to others and if your<br/>
patient you will find stuff to fight.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;23 - 28	Mistmore lake and canyon area(pull with eye, root one if 2 commes<br/>
&gt;and fight near zone), soulsek a safe room near zone to Nefagens lair(<br/>
&gt;enstill one, root and kill other in safe room then zone a sec to kobolds<br/>
&gt;lair if you dont have enough mana to kill other one, careful if greater<br/>
&gt;kobold is not camped zone back and meditate invisible) this two places are<br/>
&gt;dangerus in any case as you can pull caster wich have low hip points but<br/>
&gt;cast force shock wich is realy dangerus (i have mag resistance 65 and i<br/>
&gt;resist one of 8 times :( only)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This was my bit of advices for lower lv any other from 27 to 50 is<br/>
&gt;apreciated :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Personally I don&#39;t like to solo.  Its god awful boring.  They exp may be<br/>
aver so slightly better but those long sessions of medding make it very<br/>
dull when working alone.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;P.S. i tryed to go to najena but im still to low to solo there in i tryed<br/>
&gt;BC room ... died, named necros are to high other dont give me exp anymore,<br/>
&gt;ogre captain is lv 27 white to me and it finish very bad... sow runned to<br/>
&gt;zone with 5 hp :-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well I hate to say it but you missed out on the fun in Najean.  I started<br/>
in Najena at around level 16 and went there off and on till about level 24.<br/>
 Sure the Oger captain and the 3 major NPCs are still good to kill for me<br/>
but najena is definately what I would call a good group dungeon.  There<br/>
aren&#39;t nearely as many trains as some of the other dungeons (guk for<br/>
instance), but its not a place I would recomend for soloing unless you like<br/>
to zone in and out alot.<br/>
<br/>
Although I have never tried it solo I believe I could (at 34th) kill<br/>
cyclopses in the Rathe Mts.  And I have herd that at about 36th a friend of<br/>
mine said he soloed a Hill Giant.  But you better prey your root holds<br/>
because darn they hit hard.  Hill Giants and Griffons are blue into the<br/>
upper 40s. (so I hear)<br/>
<br/>
Again I would just like to mention.  IMO we (wizards) are NOT a solo class.<br/>
 Sure we can solo a bit, assuming our root holds up, but we work great in<br/>
groups.  Once you crack level 29 you become so much more useful to a group.<br/>
 I can sum up this new advantage in four words.     &quot;Evac to North Karana&quot;<br/>
I can&#39;t tell you how many times I have saved my group by keeping this spell<br/>
handy.  I usually wait for the call from the lead group healer.  If he is<br/>
OOM and we still have lost to fight.  its Evac time.<br/>
