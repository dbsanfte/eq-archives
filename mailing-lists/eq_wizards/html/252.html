<div id="ygrps-yiv-213491690">Well, I set my own personal gap of never grouping with someone 3 lvls before me, therefor a maximum of 2.  From what other people have told me, I have no personal knowledge of this, the experience gap can be no more than 3 lvls.  So if you are lvl 8 and you group with someone of lvl 12 you would gain no exp.<br/>

    Since we Wizzies need to be in a group most of the time, does anyone know at what point in the exp gap it is unwise to group with a person.I am now lvl 8 and am grouping with 10 and 11 lvl tanks and am seeing very slow exp movement.Thanks</div>
