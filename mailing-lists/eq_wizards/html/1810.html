<div id="ygrps-yiv-462540001">I can&#39;t believe this discussion has gone on this long.  Good grief.. if you don&#39;t <br/>
like twinking don&#39;t do it and ignore those who do.  I, personally, don&#39;t have a <br/>
problem with it.   Neither do I have any major heartburn about your position <br/>
against it.  I do feel the discussion is getting old tho and am totally against the <br/>
name calling I see starting to occur.  We are a group of human players behind <br/>
these wizard characters we&#39;ve chosen to play.  It is not necessary for others to <br/>
agree with your position.. in fact, I think it&#39;s pretty obvious that it&#39;s not going to <br/>
happen.  Please rise above the name calling.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
