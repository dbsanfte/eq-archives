<div id="ygrps-yiv-350713534">Jeez this discussion is getting heated. If I recall correctly from my<br/>
newbie days that EVERYONE at your level competes with you for creatures<br/>
at your level. Whether they be &quot;cheating twinks&quot; or otherwise. <br/>
<br/>
But the fact remains that Everquest is a &quot;multiplayer&quot; game. That means<br/>
that you must interact with people whether you like it or not. It sounds<br/>
like many anti-twinkers are only worried about getting their &quot;levels&quot;.<br/>
The same can be said about the twinkers. In any environment there will<br/>
be those that will bend or even break rules to get what they want, to<br/>
get levels. <br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to play with these people then I would suggest playing<br/>
Baldurs Gate, or Diablo ii with known friends. Keep in mind that these<br/>
people are out there, whether you like it or not. I certainly dont like<br/>
it when I see a wizard of lower rank decked out with magic items that I<br/>
haven&#39;t even heard of. But I don&#39;t complain about it. Instead, my<br/>
character resents those that had the easy life and KNOWS that he is<br/>
superior to them for working for his goals.<br/>
<br/>
Another suggestion, go start a character on a new server, there won&#39;t be<br/>
any twinkers there until high levels because you cant transfer<br/>
characters. Or better yet, get together a gang of your non-twinking<br/>
friends and show those (probably) anti-social people who has the true<br/>
power! Power comes in numbers, my friends, not possessions. Tell me, on<br/>
your death bed, are you going to be lamenting that you wish you had made<br/>
level 50 in Everquest with all the classes? No you will be lamenting the<br/>
fact that you miss all the friends you made, and laughing at the times<br/>
you showed those stinking twinkers who wears the Journeymens boots on<br/>
your server.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re just playing a solo game, then this is not the game for you.<br/>
It may just well be harder to go solo with all the twinkers about. It is<br/>
not fair. Life is not fair. Getting a group together outweighs any item<br/>
that can be had. There, thats the last I have to say on the subject. Now<br/>
back to wizards, say is there any one willing to twink me a fanged skull<br/>
stilleto on Xegony? Heh, just kidding.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I just started a new caracter in freeport, as i go to newbee area i see all<br/>
&gt; &gt; around me killing snakes and bats was people with full banded mail all lv 1<br/>
&gt; &gt; or 2 i have seen in 6 hours more then 10 full armored people. And i dont<br/>
&gt; &gt; have any problem about it!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you enjoy screwing yourself thats fine with me too.  But I dont need to take and extra 6<br/>
&gt; months to make moderately high level because I have to compete with cheating twinks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If they did not compete with me for creatures at my level I would not give a rats ass.  But they<br/>
&gt; do compete for creatures at my level and make it more difficult for me and you to level.  If you<br/>
&gt; enjoy running around and killing snakes and bats and rats for a real time year of your life<br/>
&gt; thats great but dont screw me with your liberal ill thought ideas.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; If they transfered items from their high lv caracters or if guild give it<br/>
&gt; &gt; to them its ok for me i go around killing my bats and snakes and they do it<br/>
&gt; &gt; in same way without skills they must work much things a same way as you do<br/>
&gt; &gt; a little bit easier but they alredy worked for it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I played a long time a everquest creating some middle lv caracter and i<br/>
&gt; &gt; know  how dificult it is to start it all over if you have find that your<br/>
&gt; &gt; caracter is not what you wish and you decite to start new class.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Im shure that a people wich complain are ones wich have enugh money and<br/>
&gt; &gt; free time to play as long as they wish, ohers wich cannot support to pay a<br/>
&gt; &gt; 10 $ a month and 1 $ a hour (as connection rates to internet go in europe)<br/>
&gt; &gt; i aprove fully to transfer their items to new started caracter. If this is<br/>
&gt; &gt; possible to do in game then its ok to do if you wish to pay 100 $ a month<br/>
&gt; &gt; so that you can have a payed gm controling every transaction in game then<br/>
&gt; &gt; its ok for you send email to Sony saying that you are ready to pay 100 $ a<br/>
&gt; &gt; month to play a game where every move will be GM controled so wou can be<br/>
&gt; &gt; shure that every caracter is not twinked ;-), They willl accept this idea<br/>
&gt; &gt; gladly as soon they start reciving your bucks.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; About guild camping im strongly against it i support idea that if person<br/>
&gt; &gt; wich killes a monster is more then 5 lv higher then loot will be only<br/>
&gt; &gt; normal one and for special items only a 1/3 of normal chance or not at all<br/>
&gt; &gt; so higer lv players wishing one item must buy it from a low lv players. it<br/>
&gt; &gt; will be a nice push to player interaction.<br/>
