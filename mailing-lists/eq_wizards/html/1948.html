<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714020285">I think that if you wish for the moon, the chances of getting any<br/>
changes from Verant will be reduced considerably.  We should concentrate<br/>
on 1 or 2 changes we really need!  I think that the implementation of<br/>
specialization and the ability to affect MOBs of 6+ levels are the two<br/>
most important changes that could be immediately implemented.  I know<br/>
that there&#39;ll be some disagreement about the most important changes, but<br/>
we need to focus or we will be ignored by spreading ourselves too thin.<br/>
<br/>
My 2 cents worth,<br/>

&gt; Ok guys and girls, I took the liberty of doing some editing to<br/>
&gt; Silverion&#39;s text as well as adding some of the other&#39;s comments, and<br/>
&gt; my own =)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think that there are some really excellent suggestions here and I<br/>
&gt; also feel that by sending them this we are finally showing some true<br/>
&gt; support for the class we all love.  We are also on the way to making a<br/>
&gt; unique class, instead of just &quot;magical artillery&quot;.  Lets keep<br/>
&gt; bombarding them with ideas and let them sort &#39;em out and deal with<br/>
&gt; game balance issues.  After all, isnt that what we are paying them<br/>
&gt; for?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok, what follows is the revised text (feel free to make comments,<br/>
&gt; edit, whatever, just send those emails!!!):<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We, the Wizards of the Onelist.com Wizards mailing list, feel the<br/>
&gt; Wizard class requires revision and have compiled the following list:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; New Spells<br/>
&gt; Summon -     Teleports group member inside the zone to your location<br/>
&gt; Phase -         Teleports yourself to location of other group member<br/>
&gt; inside zone<br/>
&gt; Tap Afinity -  Teleport group member to their own bind spot<br/>
&gt; Haste -           Increases movement rate for self only.<br/>
&gt; Group Gate - Slow casting spell which teleports group to your bind<br/>
&gt; spot, doesn&#39;t leave anyone behind<br/>
&gt; Retreat -        Evacuate version of group gate<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Changes to existing spells:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Root -             Minimum time duration, with random maxium time<br/>
&gt; duration.<br/>
&gt; Fade              Useless, remove completely<br/>
&gt; Shadowstep   Change to line of sight, with minimum travelled distance<br/>
&gt; and random max. distance.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Skill Changes<br/>
&gt; Meditation skill max for level for wizard (Level +1) * 7.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We also request the implementation of the Specialization skill.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Game Mechanics<br/>
&gt; -Investigate the increase of spell failures (fizzles) of lower level<br/>
&gt; spells as Wizard class advances in levels.  Should &quot;simpler&quot; spells<br/>
&gt; fail more often as the Wizard increase in levels, regardless of<br/>
&gt; appropriate skill?  (ie. Root, Shielding etc.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - Resolving the problem of high resistence of Level 20+ DD spells by<br/>
&gt; greens, blues and higher (if this is the result of a stun effect we<br/>
&gt; wish one spell without this efect at same level)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - Resolving the balance problem of other magic-using classes still<br/>
&gt; able to affect MoBs (in a group situation) that are 6+ above their own<br/>
&gt; levels (Necromancer - Lifetap & pets, Enchanters and Magicians - pets,<br/>
&gt; buffs, etc) while Wizard DD spells are 100% resisted by 6+ level<br/>
&gt; MoBs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - Better use of time when meditating (acces to main chat server in<br/>
&gt; separate window)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - We wish real official feedback on planned changes or problems which<br/>
&gt; you have with balance in game on an official page which exists but<br/>
&gt; never seems to be updated (eg. id&#39;s Quake .plan files)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We feel the Wizard class has been overlooked far too long and that<br/>
&gt; there is nothing that is truly unique about our characters anymore.<br/>
&gt; We feel the above changes would go a long way towards rectifying some<br/>
&gt; of the classes shortcomings.  Thanks for your consideration.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
