<div id="ygrps-yiv-35490958">While I was purchasing my gate spells I noticed a vendor in Felwithe that has the heat sight spell. You might be taking a boat trip, or if you&#39;re on the solusek ro server, I&#39;ll port over and get it for you. Send me a tell. Invisibility should definetly be available, but you might have to buy it from the enchanter or magician vendors. That&#39;s how I got mine, damned cheap to.<br/>
