<b>Subject:</b> i found something out <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135256280">well i was playing my druid today, he&#39;s level 11,  and i was fighting a <br/>
snake.  out of nowhere a wiz comes along and ks&#39;ed the giant snake.  it <br/>
really pissed me off.  his excuse was, i just want exp!!!  i couldn&#39;t believe <br/>
it.  now i see why people get so pissed off at us wizards.  i guess i got <br/>
satisfaction wathcing him and his partner die.  it was great.  now my druid <br/>
has hatred towards wizards and looks down upon them.  i like to roleplay.  <br/>
now i see why wizards are hated and it&#39;s so hard to find a group.  just <br/>
wanted to let you know my experience from the outside.<br/>
