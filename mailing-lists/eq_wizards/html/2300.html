<div id="ygrps-yiv-399229818">es you will have to put some points into the bind<br/>
wound skill.  One or two is enough.  At first you wont<br/>
see much healing done per bandage but as your skill<br/>
increase, you will heal more damage and use fewer<br/>
bandages.  I&#39;m not sure where the amount healed per<br/>
bandage tops out, I have heard 25 poits per bandage<br/>
but I dont know that for sure.  They are kind of<br/>
expensive to buy at ove 5 sp each and I generally buy<br/>
them 30 at a time.  If you are poor, try to find a<br/>
cleric or mage and get them to summon some for you.  I<br/>
go around healing eveyone that will let me.  It&#39;s a<br/>
good way to make friends and to increase my skill.<br/>
It&#39;s at 44 now and has a long way to go to max<br/>
out..I&#39;m almost lvl 14 now.</div>
