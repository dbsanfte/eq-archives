<div id="ygrps-yiv-497940947">1.  You will find them randomly off of any creature greater than level 12ish,<br/>
and more likely on creatures that are naturally magical.<br/>
<br/>
2.  I&#39;ve always struggled with money.  I hate camping so that leaves me with<br/>
outdoor, wandering mobs.  Well last night the gods were smiling on me.  I<br/>
walked into Northern Ro and killed a Decaying Skel holding a cracked staff,<br/>
kept moving into the desert and killed a scarab that was training a paladin.<br/>
He gave me the loot in thanks both a cracked and pristine scarapice (or<br/>
whatever its).  PL and pings were bad so I moved to the commons, I came out of<br/>
the cave and watched a group of ghouls chasing a person down, so I turned the<br/>
otherway started to run and saw an unlooted ghouls corpse.  I waited and no one<br/>
came to loot it so I bent down and got some serious cash and a bronze mace.  In<br/>
10-15 minutes I just doubled my life savings (8 Plat). Woohoo.  Not bad for a<br/>
Level 8 wizard who only killed one decaying skel and a half dead scarab.<br/>

&gt; 1. Where do I find runes? I haven&#39;t found any at all. I think I asked this<br/>
&gt; before but no one answered it. I&#39;m dying to start researching, but my old<br/>
&gt; erudin is below average only.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. How the heck do I make money ?<br/>
