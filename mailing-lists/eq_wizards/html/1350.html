 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t forget that O&#39;Keils adds 8 to 13 pts onto your fire resistance.  This is<br/>
quite a big buff for so little mana.  It is a must have when going against mobs<br/>
with a fire based attack.  The damage as far as I&#39;m concerned is just gravy.<br/>

&gt; O&#39;keils radiation does pretty much suck.  I don&#39;t understand why it was<br/>
&gt; given to us because we don&#39;t (to my knowledge) get any other damage shields,<br/>
&gt; so it is not like a series of spells or anything like it should be.  I still<br/>
&gt; use it a little at level 10 (and I think it does 3 damage now, not 2) to<br/>
&gt; help our tank out a little, but I think by level 12 or 16 it will be out of<br/>
&gt; my repertoire.<br/>
