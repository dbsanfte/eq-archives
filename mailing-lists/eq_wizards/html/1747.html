&gt; Ok as promised when I reached lvl 24 I would reveal my location for<br/>
&gt; solo-ing.  well I hit it early sunday but ended up back at 23rd last night<br/>
&gt; after dieing 3 times in Cazic Thule.  Where is this secret location you<br/>
&gt; might ask?  Well it is non other than Lake Rathe.  The Lake support Aviak<br/>
&gt; Guards that are great exp and loot for soloing.  There are several Island<br/>
&gt; inside Lake Rathe and have different variations of the Gaurds, ie., !<br/>
guard<br/>
&gt; Post with 1 Guard, or 1 Guard Post with 2 guards or 2 Posts with 1 Gaurd<br/>
&gt; each Post......  So choose you destiny.  I would HIGHLY suggest not taking<br/>
&gt; on the 2 guards at once unless you have someone with you.  Even at lvl 24<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; find it very difficuly to fight 2 solo.  Reason being is that they are Lvl<br/>
&gt; 20-24 but Hit like Lvl 30 Mobs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also a bit of warning.....If you do not have high swimming skills you best<br/>
&gt; get them up there fast.  The Lake supports a Sea Monster (lvl 53 Mob) that<br/>
&gt; hits for over 100+ per shot.  Now there are boats to tkate you from island<br/>
&gt; to island but mostly I swam.  Started with a low swimming and now have 120<br/>
&gt; swimming in 4.5 Lvls.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well Good Luck, and hope this helps all those stuggling to reach 20+.<br/>
