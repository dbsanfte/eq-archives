<div id="ygrps-yiv-1668866558">yes you can fail and i&#39;ll be going for the staff soon as well... lvl 27... <br/>
hehehe. i&#39;ve been told that some people are successful one in 5 to 7 tries. <br/>
the skill uses research. my research is at 60... hope that is good enough.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Late last night I finally got the 10th and final rod for the quest.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Which means tonight I make the trek to Everfrost to get the container.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now I have heard that it is easy to fail at combining the rods, so what<br/>
&gt; &gt; is the best way to succeed?  Should I borrow a friends wisdom items?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Should I dump more training points into research (is this the right<br/>
&gt; &gt; skill)?  Any help would be appreciated.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m currently a 40th level human wizard.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, I got my staff yesterday (at level 29, maybe the youngest ever :)<br/>
&gt;) and I had no problems combining. I also had no problems combining the<br/>
&gt;Jeweled Skull back when I did. I am fairly certain that for quests, it<br/>
&gt;will always work. Have you ever heard of someone failing to combine a<br/>
&gt;quest item?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;P.S. If you&#39;re on Solusek Ro and want to trade me something for the<br/>
&gt;Jeweled Skull, e-mail me, or send a tell to Qenelin in game.<br/>
