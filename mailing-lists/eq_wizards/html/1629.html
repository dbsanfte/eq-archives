 </span></blockquote>Very nice post by the way, keep it up.  Here are some answers for you.<br/>

&gt; 3)  It also seems to me that they&#39;ve been fiddling with our spells<br/>
&gt; pretty regularly.  I&#39;ve never been all that impressed with shadow step<br/>
&gt; or root, but I&#39;ve noticed recently that I will get several of my Roots<br/>
&gt; resisted consecutively on blues when previously I rarely had problems.<br/>
&gt; Am I imagining things here or have they changed something?  With<br/>
&gt; shadow step, it has always been pretty random but it seems they&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; expanded the range.  Last night while playing around with it near the<br/>
&gt; gates of Qeynos, I cast it once and zoned to Qeynos hills.  Not sure<br/>
&gt; if this is a good thing, and I haven&#39;t tried it in a dungeon.  I just<br/>
&gt; imagine jumping out of the &#39;ole frying pan and landing in some place<br/>
&gt; much much hotter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t really noticed any change with roots, as a matter of fact I<br/>
rooted a /con white tarantula long enough this morning to unload all of my<br/>
mana and get the kill without getting a scratch.  One thing I have noticed<br/>
is that everything happens in batches.  I&#39;ll go 20 minutes without a<br/>
problem, and then suddenly I&#39;ll get 3 resists or fizzles in a row on the<br/>
same type of mob.  Another example is that my skills won&#39;t increases and<br/>
then I&#39;ll get 2 skill increases back to back.5)  One other thing to keep in<br/>
mind about Eye of Zomm is that Verant<br/>

&gt; 6)  Same thing holds true for weapon skills.  If you ever end up in a<br/>
&gt; duel with another spell caster, you might find throwing especially<br/>
&gt; useful.  Pick up some shirkens from a local monks guild or someplace<br/>
&gt; and practice when you are low level.  Advancing later can be tough,<br/>
&gt; and you can advance this skill higher than your normal offensive<br/>
&gt; skills, I believe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you can advance you throwing skills on /con greens. Can anyone<br/>
confirm or deny this.<br/>

&gt; 9)  If you are running and you know you are going to die, head for the<br/>
&gt; biggest mob.  There is much less xp loss against mobs that are higher<br/>
&gt; level.  Getting killed by a hill giant or a griffon at level 14 isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; that big of a deal.  Getting killed by something that you con green<br/>
&gt; can cost you almost a whole bubble at the same level.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Very good tip, and its true.  I&#39;ve checked it out myself<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve purchased some netted the other day (cape, pants, shawl) and<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t see any weight or AC advantage over cloth.  Is there any<br/>
&gt; benefit to netted and, if not, what should I be buying?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s lighter, and its free.  Also you can sell the gloves to monks for a<br/>
hefty profit.</div>
