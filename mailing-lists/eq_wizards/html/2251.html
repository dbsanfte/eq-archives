&gt;Verant&#39;s incompetence is not the subject. I think it&#39;s unfair to examine<br/>
&gt;the wizard as a whole class before it&#39;s not completely done.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What level do you get specialization anyway? 20?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s a stated fact. Quit trying to read into everything.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So you just like stating facts for no particular reason or contribution<br/>
&gt;to the discussion at hand? If so, excuse me, because I thought you were<br/>
&gt;trying to make some points about Wizard&#39;s ineptitude as a class, but now<br/>
&gt;I see it&#39;s just a fact.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Let&#39;s see, I&#39;ll have a try at it:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Barbarians are high.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yep, works fine.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Ditto ditto.<br/>

&gt;Dark elves are not really dark, they&#39;re blue.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Can you please cite the spell, the wizard DD spell of the same level and<br/>
&gt;their mana cost and time of casting?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If indeed the spell does more damage, then, yes, you&#39;ve found *one*. But<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m sure that the mana to damage ratio and casting times are better for<br/>
&gt;the wizard anyway.<br/>

&gt;&gt; downtime for the wiz and embarassment because your spells suddenly suck.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Worse-case, the mobs get irritated that you&#39;re even TRYING to shoot them,<br/>
&gt;&gt; and you die very, very quickly.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So the situation you&#39;re describing is when a party with, oh say, a level<br/>
&gt;14 wizard and a level 16 warrior wants to attack a level 20 monster? How<br/>
&gt;often do you see that happen?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And if this does happen, it shouldn&#39;t. A level 14 warrior would not help<br/>
&gt;any anyway. You think he would hit? Or do you think a level 14<br/>
&gt;Enchanter&#39;s buffs would make any difference against a level 20 enemy?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Actually, I would have said &quot;I suck&quot; instead. Appreciate your diplomacy.<br/>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve followed the teachings of Zaeq, North Karana beetle-kiter<br/>
&gt;&gt; extraordinare. What ends up happening is I run to the beetle, hit it, get<br/>

&gt;&gt; wisps give me little exp anymore, many con green at 15th.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The location, as a said, sucks. travel to Freeport and hunt in North Ro,<br/>
&gt;you&#39;ll find it *perfect*. It has as much prey as the Karanas, but<br/>
&gt;significantly less aggressive animals. It also has dervish camps where<br/>
&gt;in a party you&#39;ll get good exp and great loot. You can also take turns<br/>
&gt;and solo them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Some zones are just bad for some levels. The trick is to find a good<br/>
&gt;zone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Did I state that? No. Now that you mention it, they&#39;ve promised it since<br/>
&gt;&gt; retail release, nothing has come of it so far.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The plains are operational. So nyah :)<br/>
