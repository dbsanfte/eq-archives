&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;Example last night I was laughed at when I asked if any one wanted a<br/>
&gt; level<br/>
&gt; &gt; 12 wizard. (by 3 people over shout no less)  If that is the opinion of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; majority of the populace in a game that is suppose to be group only, then<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; say we need something to make us more valuable...&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am not sure who was laughing or for what reason but rest assured that<br/>
&gt; &gt; wizards have no problems finding a group.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One paladin, one mage, and one enchanter.  They were all commenting on the<br/>
&gt; uselessness of a wizard, due to the fact that they could not help with any<br/>
&gt; monster that &#39;counts&#39;.  They also made comment on the close damage ammounts<br/>
&gt; that everyone enjoyed, and how they could buff/debuff as well.  I quote &quot; I<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t group with a worthless experience point sucking wizard if my life<br/>
&gt; depended on it!&quot;  my reply was &quot;one day you may regret you said that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My reply would be to find them and Kill Steal everything they attack for<br/>
a half an hour or so.<br/>
<br/>
Then talk about who&#39;s worthless.<br/>
