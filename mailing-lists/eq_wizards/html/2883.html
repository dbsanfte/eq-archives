<div id="ygrps-yiv-548407252">First.  Make sure you keep all three skills maxed at each level (P, 1hb,<br/>
2hb).  Its not hard to do, if you start from the beginning, and you will<br/>
be glad you did in the long run.  As for your question, the next logical<br/>
weapon would be a Giant Snake Fang.  You should be able to obtain one<br/>
for 4-5gp.  After that you will be working for a Runed totem staff.<br/>
They sell for 10pp on a mature server, but will probably go for much<br/>
more on TZ.  Hope this helps.<br/>

Cheers<br/>
