<div id="ygrps-yiv-1666817495">i agree. i think the fancy teleport stuff we are requesting is a little too<br/>
much, and could get our petition shot down as a whole.  i think the biggest<br/>
thing we should focus on is the resists (at higher lvls) and the<br/>
specialization issues (although this should definately not be a &quot;wizard<br/>
only&quot; issue, as specialization just simply doesnt work for any of the spell<br/>
casting classes).  im fairly happy with our teleport spells, and the only<br/>
thing we are lacking that we should probably have is some type of haste<br/>
spell (like SoW).  fizzles, well, i just havent seen very many of them<br/>
lately, so i dont know if its a &quot;wizard&quot; issue, or just an issue with<br/>
specific spells or characters.<br/>
<br/>
VERANT: PLEASE MAKE ENSTILL AND FORCE SHOCK RESIST LESS OFTEN!  Those are my<br/>
two biggest complaints.<br/>

&gt;I think that if you wish for the moon, the chances of getting any<br/>
&gt;changes from Verant will be reduced considerably.  We should concentrate<br/>
&gt;on 1 or 2 changes we really need!  I think that the implementation of<br/>
&gt;specialization and the ability to affect MOBs of 6+ levels are the two<br/>
&gt;most important changes that could be immediately implemented.  I know<br/>
&gt;that there&#39;ll be some disagreement about the most important changes, but<br/>
&gt;we need to focus or we will be ignored by spreading ourselves too thin.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My 2 cents worth,<br/>

&gt;&gt; Ok guys and girls, I took the liberty of doing some editing to<br/>
&gt;&gt; Silverion&#39;s text as well as adding some of the other&#39;s comments, and<br/>
&gt;&gt; my own =)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I think that there are some really excellent suggestions here and I<br/>
&gt;&gt; also feel that by sending them this we are finally showing some true<br/>
&gt;&gt; support for the class we all love.  We are also on the way to making a<br/>
&gt;&gt; unique class, instead of just &quot;magical artillery&quot;.  Lets keep<br/>
&gt;&gt; bombarding them with ideas and let them sort &#39;em out and deal with<br/>
&gt;&gt; game balance issues.  After all, isnt that what we are paying them<br/>
&gt;&gt; for?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Ok, what follows is the revised text (feel free to make comments,<br/>
&gt;&gt; edit, whatever, just send those emails!!!):<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; We, the Wizards of the Onelist.com Wizards mailing list, feel the<br/>
&gt;&gt; Wizard class requires revision and have compiled the following list:<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; New Spells<br/>
&gt;&gt; Summon -     Teleports group member inside the zone to your location<br/>
&gt;&gt; Phase -         Teleports yourself to location of other group member<br/>
&gt;&gt; inside zone<br/>
&gt;&gt; Tap Afinity -  Teleport group member to their own bind spot<br/>
&gt;&gt; Haste -           Increases movement rate for self only.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Group Gate - Slow casting spell which teleports group to your bind<br/>
&gt;&gt; spot, doesn&#39;t leave anyone behind<br/>
&gt;&gt; Retreat -        Evacuate version of group gate<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Changes to existing spells:<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Root -             Minimum time duration, with random maxium time<br/>
&gt;&gt; duration.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Fade              Useless, remove completely<br/>
&gt;&gt; Shadowstep   Change to line of sight, with minimum travelled distance<br/>
&gt;&gt; and random max. distance.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Skill Changes<br/>
&gt;&gt; Meditation skill max for level for wizard (Level +1) * 7.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; We also request the implementation of the Specialization skill.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Game Mechanics<br/>
&gt;&gt; -Investigate the increase of spell failures (fizzles) of lower level<br/>
&gt;&gt; spells as Wizard class advances in levels.  Should &quot;simpler&quot; spells<br/>
&gt;&gt; fail more often as the Wizard increase in levels, regardless of<br/>
&gt;&gt; appropriate skill?  (ie. Root, Shielding etc.)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; - Resolving the problem of high resistence of Level 20+ DD spells by<br/>
&gt;&gt; greens, blues and higher (if this is the result of a stun effect we<br/>
&gt;&gt; wish one spell without this efect at same level)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; - Resolving the balance problem of other magic-using classes still<br/>
&gt;&gt; able to affect MoBs (in a group situation) that are 6+ above their own<br/>
&gt;&gt; levels (Necromancer - Lifetap & pets, Enchanters and Magicians - pets,<br/>
&gt;&gt; buffs, etc) while Wizard DD spells are 100% resisted by 6+ level<br/>
&gt;&gt; MoBs.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; - Better use of time when meditating (acces to main chat server in<br/>
&gt;&gt; separate window)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; - We wish real official feedback on planned changes or problems which<br/>
&gt;&gt; you have with balance in game on an official page which exists but<br/>
&gt;&gt; never seems to be updated (eg. id&#39;s Quake .plan files)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; We feel the Wizard class has been overlooked far too long and that<br/>
&gt;&gt; there is nothing that is truly unique about our characters anymore.<br/>
&gt;&gt; We feel the above changes would go a long way towards rectifying some<br/>
&gt;&gt; of the classes shortcomings.  Thanks for your consideration.<br/>
