<div id="ygrps-yiv-698633490">I sent it to Verant the other day but they will look at it, let alone<br/>
fix, as fast as anything else they have to work on. What is wrong with<br/>
Eye of Zomm?<br/>

Yes, I have had the same problem.  We were in the Gorge of King Xorbb,<br/>
and I<br/>
had cast it on our puller as he worked his way through the gorge.  He<br/>
would<br/>
climb up and down on the ridges looking for the minos, and when he<br/>
climbed<br/>
above me a certain distance, the same thing would happen--the screen<br/>
would<br/>
freeze.  It looked to me as though he was just sitting there resting,<br/>
but<br/>
his view was so skewed I asked him what was going on.  As soon as he<br/>
returned to my elevation, the sight resumed as normal.  This needs to be<br/>
submitted to Verant.  Perhaps they will fix it as they are going to fix<br/>
Eye<br/>
of Zomm.  :)<br/>

&gt; I like the Bind Sight spell for the most part but it does have a<br/>
serious<br/>
&gt; flaw. Whenever the PC that you are bound to changes their level in<br/>
&gt; respect to yours it stops working. When I say level I mean physical<br/>
&gt; orientation in the vertical aspect. The best example I could give is<br/>
&gt; Unrest. (A great place for higher teens and low 20&#39;s players.) I cast<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; upon our puller so that he can tag and run back without worrying about<br/>
&gt; communicating back to the group. I see what they pull and tell<br/>
everyone<br/>
&gt; to get ready or that the puller is running to zone. It is also really<br/>
&gt; helpful if the puller gets rooted or stunned. I can go inside with the<br/>
&gt; rest of the party and help the puller since I know where they are<br/>
within<br/>
&gt; the house. (I know the house pretty well since I pull with my wizard<br/>
&gt; when I am paired up with just my cleric friend.) If the puller I have<br/>
&gt; Bind Sight upon goes upstairs or downstairs the view on my screen<br/>
&gt; freezes like the character is stuck. This does not only happen within<br/>
&gt; Unrest. I was in Guk last night and it happened when a cleric I had<br/>
Bind<br/>
&gt; Sight upon went downstairs to resurrect  a friend of mine. I was going<br/>
&gt; to tell him directions through the use of Bind Sight but as soon as he<br/>
&gt; went down the first ramp the Bind Sight broke.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am wondering if anyone else has had problems with this spell?<br/>
