<div id="ygrps-yiv-2017379471"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  Summon - Teleports group member inside the zone to your location<br/>
&gt;  Phase - Teleports yourself to location of other group member inside zone<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    Interesting, but most definitely not going to happen. Don&#39;t waste time<br/>
asking for them<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Tap Afinity - Teleport group member to their own bind spot<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    Again would be nice but 99.99% not going to happen.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Haste - Increases movement rate for self only.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    This would be nice to have, but really doesn&#39;t fit our class.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Group Gate - Slow casting spell which teleports group to your bind spot,<br/>
&gt;  doesn&#92;&#39;t leave anyone behind<br/>
&gt;  Retreat - Evacuate version of group gate<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    I really like these ideas, but they&#39;re not gonna happen &#39;cause Verant<br/>
wants<br/>
    the world to stay big and this would shrink it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Meditation skill max for level for wizard (Level +1) * 7<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    Now this is really a good idea. Maybe not *7, *6 would be fine. Remember<br/>
    that one point makes all the differece between clerics and melee<br/>
classes.<br/>
    And it makes game sense.  Wizards burn faster than any other class and<br/>
are<br/>
    more mana dependent, so it only makes sense that they would learn to Med<br/>
    faster than any other class, because it would be that much more<br/>
important to them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; - Specialization skill with some real advantages to our class<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    This is where they could implement the faster med times. Give the wizard<br/>
only<br/>
    option to specialize in Medditation. Its a long time to wait, but it<br/>
could be a<br/>
    place to implement it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; - resolving a problem of high resistence of DD spells at lv 20 resisted by<br/>
&gt; (greens and blues )and other ( if this is becouse of stun effect we wish<br/>
&gt; one spell without this efect at same level)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    Absolute must. This is a joke.  Our spells should NEVER be resisted by<br/>
greens,<br/>
    and RARELY by blues.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; - resolving a balance problem of other magic users classes be able to<br/>
&gt; attack directly (necromancer, lifetap pets) or indirectly (enchanters and<br/>
&gt; magicians pets, buffs ect) a much higer lv MOBs NP 19 lv against 35 lv<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sand<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; giant when our spells are 100% resisted if a monster is 6+ lv.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    This is beyond a joke.  Wizards are the masters of damage.  Well having<br/>
our spells<br/>
    not be useless against mobs that melee characters in groups of our own<br/>
level can fight<br/>
    would be an excellent start.  And if its all about wizards being more<br/>
powerful at later<br/>
    levels all I can say is that we better be THE most powerful by a fair<br/>
margin at those<br/>
    levels to make it worth all the time we were not that powerful.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; - beter use of time when meditating (acces to main chat server in separate<br/>
&gt; window)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    Credits for originality, but lets be realistic here. Not going to<br/>
happen.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; - We wish real official feedback on planed changes or problems wich you<br/>
&gt; have with balance in game on official page wich exixt but its never<br/>
 </span></blockquote>updated<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; !! (look at quake they write all what is in work in one public letter<br/>
 </span></blockquote>.PLAN<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and they are leader on mercat you dont need to hide all in fear of<br/>
&gt; concurents will hit your weak point they will find and try in any case )<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    Amen.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    And my addition<br/>
<br/>
    Fix whatever was done to increase the amounts and frequency of fizzles.<br/>
    Having root fizzle more now at 18 than it did at 4 is a joke. A very bad<br/>
joke.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    If we are going to organize this, the first thing that needs to be done<br/>
is get rid of the<br/>
    &quot;wouldn&#39;t it be nice&quot; thinking and stick with trying to get the problems<br/>
fixed.  Part<br/>
    of fixing the problems is comming up with solutions that make sense to<br/>
Verant and<br/>
    will not unbalance our class.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Trystesa the sick of fizzling, and resisting High Elf wizard</div>
