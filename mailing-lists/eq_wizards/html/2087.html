<br/>
    Just made Level 20 and I was wondering if anyone can tell me where to<br/>
find the spell Enstill or if it is research only.  I&#39;m aware that it can be<br/>
researched, unfortunately I have been unable to locate the correct Runes.<br/>
I&#39;ve searched far and wide with no luck.  Any help would be greatly<br/>
appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
    On another note, what happened to that petition to Verant about our<br/>
class?  Did it ever get sent?  Just curious.<br/>

P.S. Force Shock rules!  171 damage a pop.  Oh my gawd, that&#39;s very nice.<br/>
Hasn&#39;t been resisted yet either.  Maybe this is the level where it all<br/>
starts to come together.  (hopefully)</div>
