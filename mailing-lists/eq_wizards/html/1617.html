 </span></blockquote>At 10th level you should have enough money to armor yoursef head to toe in<br/>
cloth, have a good weapon (I never spent the 20 plat on a Great Staff, used<br/>
a WGS till I got a runed one at 17th, but I could have) and some plat in the<br/>
bank. Location, location location, learn where to go at your appropriate<br/>
level to get cash. In your case, and I&#39;&#39;m assuming you&#39;re 10th. Hit<br/>
Everfrost and camp one of the crossroads. There&#39;s a steady stream of<br/>
goblins, spiderling, decaying skeletons. I&#39;m talking in quantites where, if<br/>
you&#39;re good, you don&#39;t even have time to sit down. The monsters are mostly<br/>
non-aggro, and you can go med way up on a wall. Made a LOAD of cash there<br/>
from 8-10. At one point I was only going after goblins (they carry small<br/>
boxes,bags, backpacks etc), and any decaying skeleton with a weapon. Then<br/>
I&#39;d lumber my encumbered body back to Queynos and CA$H in. I was making so<br/>
much money, I didn&#39;t even care about the xps.<br/>
<br/>
1. With enough money, you can get real equipment and stay out in the field<br/>
longer. I died and my corpse disappeared, before they fixed the bug, lost a<br/>
complete set of cloth armor plus a bunch of other things. No matter, quick<br/>
trip to the bank solved that problem.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Do you really believe that I can be more effective with a snake fang<br/>
&gt;then a GS.  I have to melee quite a bit now and the staff although it<br/>
&gt;seems that I swing it only once every 10 secs and the damage I do is<br/>
&gt;proportional to the creatures HP&#39;s it does hit regularly for 16 points<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is all a question of style, but I&#39;d say to max BOTH out. Use staff<br/>
first, and then use a giant snake fang. If you ever fight a caster, or spell<br/>
casting monster, you&#39;ll be VERY glad of the faster speed of the snake fang.<br/>
You&#39;ll also get in a ton more swings than with the staff.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is where you unload mana. If the creatures running, he isn&#39;t going to<br/>
be turning on you. Safe effective backstabbing. Who said we&#39;re honourable?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;only use my mana to stop a fleeing creature or save my group when<br/>
&gt;things go wrong or to minimize the damage they endure.  My rule is I<br/>
&gt;try to use slightly more mana then the tanks take damage.  This way I<br/>
&gt;recover my mana in about the same amount of time they recover their<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Timing is very important. I usually do 1 hit on the INCOMING mob with the<br/>
biggest spell I got. Of course, this is after the tanks have engaged. 1 shot<br/>
will never pull a mob off and onto me, or at least, it&#39;s never happened to<br/>
me. If we&#39;re in a pretty open area I&#39;ll sit down and med while keeping an<br/>
eye on the groups hp meters, and the combat text. I&#39;ve turned off misses, so<br/>
it&#39;s a much shorter list that&#39;s scrolling by. When the mob hits 1/3 life<br/>
time to get up and monitor the fight, it&#39;s running, burn.<br/>
<br/>
I also play with some smart tanks. They trade off the hits a bubble at a<br/>
time, if it&#39;s not leaving one of them I&#39;ll root, and badly hurt one will<br/>
back off. Alternately if they&#39;re really getting their butts handed to them,<br/>
root n&#39;shoot. Burn to save &#39;em because THEY&#39;RE your armor... : )<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Total agreement with you on this one. Gotta play the game smart, and know<br/>
your role... : )<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Also I have used a staff since day one.  I have practically no skill<br/>
&gt;in one hand piece(?).  How long would it take me to build my dagger<br/>
&gt;skill to 50 (my current 2H blunt skill)?  How much damage over time<br/>
&gt;does the dagger do verses the staff?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No idea. I DO know that it will take a huge number of fights to first see an<br/>
improvement in your piercing skill, but it will be a monumental jump. Not 1<br/>
point. Or so I&#39;ve been told.<br/>
