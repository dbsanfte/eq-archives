&gt;Dont worry,<br/>
&gt;  Most of these characters are the second characters of some high level<br/>
&gt;players.  These players then hand their unused items to friends who<br/>
&gt;then hand them to the newbie character.  <br/>
&gt;  The only problem with this is that the item will not be that useful<br/>
&gt;to the new low level character.  This person will receive the benefits<br/>
&gt;of the robes but due to their low level, will still get pounded by orc<br/>
&gt;pawns without problem.  Level has the majority factor in these cases. <br/>
&gt;Yes it irritates me too.  Im level 21 and still have these stupid Sr.<br/>
&gt;Apprentice robes.<br/>

players they kill and equip the items they get.  There&#39;s a scarry thought!<br/>

&lt;shrug&gt; Just a though.  Of course I also think wizards should get<br/>
dual-wield - not for anything as mundane as physical combat; I just think<br/>
it would be cool to sit by the lake and fish with two poles. =)<br/>
