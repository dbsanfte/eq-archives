<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869509752">As a PK wizard I feel the need to explain to you exactly why i chose to be<br/>
PK.  In the bertoxulous server the highest lvl charcter i believe is lvl 20,<br/>
a significant amount of ppl are camping in Black Burrow waiting in the giant<br/>
snake room for giant snakes to spawn, i generally belive that as the most<br/>
powerful race/class combination (wizard/erudite) i have the right to take<br/>
whatever i want.  Beyond this i follow the warlord as my deity.  As you well<br/>
know, noone likes a kill &quot;stealer&quot;, i have around 30 ppl on my ignore list<br/>
who just can&#39;t deal with the fact that wizards are their superiors.  To shut<br/>
these ppl up once and for all,i turned PK.  Now not only do i take whatever<br/>
monster i want, but i take out any othe PK that i want as well. In the event<br/>
that i am challenged to a duel (this happens quite often) i simply inform<br/>
them that if they turn red we can do it right, otherwise they should just<br/>
sit there and cry.  PKing has it&#39;s advantages, the loot is great and it<br/>
really adds an extra sense of danger to the game, you can be in your newbie<br/>
area heading to your favorite hunting spot, you can still be attacked right<br/>
there and killed by another PK.  Keeps you on your toes and i rather like it<br/>
