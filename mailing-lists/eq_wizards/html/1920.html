<div id="ygrps-yiv-517070051">I don&#39;t agree. Well, then again....we&#39;re 2 different types of players. You <br/>
may enjoy spending day after day soloing creatures over and over again, but <br/>
my fun comes from interacting with other people in groups.  Using <br/>
cooperation and planning, we go after quests and big NPCs.  Nothing more <br/>
satisfying than accomplishing a goal.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I LOVE being a <br/>
Wizard... but this is just my observation.<br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;re in a good team, you can then lead to aspire for tougher <br/>
creatures.  Sometimes it may be foolhardy where the entire party may die, <br/>
but in most cases, creatures within maybe 4 or 5 levels of the strongest <br/>
member in the party is not out of the question.<br/>
<br/>
Given a case where everybody in the party was the same level, I have <br/>
observed many instances where every other member in the group was able to <br/>
contribute to the goal (bards, warriors, druids, rogues, clerics, etc) yet <br/>
my Wizard spells were pathetically harmless.  No buffs, no damage, nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, some goals should be unattainable to us.  For example, some reds should <br/>
have better saving throws than others....but there IS room for some <br/>
balancing in our abilities whereby we can live up to our reputation as the <br/>
&quot;artillery&quot; class on EQ.<br/>

&gt;class.  Well I am a 24th level Wizard who has been solo-ing since lvl 16.<br/>
