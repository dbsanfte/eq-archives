&gt;Ill get 5 of one kind, and the other one I need to combine for the &gt;spell <br/>
&gt;is rare<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah that&#39;s true.  I recently gave a backpack full of runes to a wizard <br/>
friend I know who was just starting his research.  Think I had close to 20+ <br/>
common runes in there.  Some runes are very very common...I didn&#39;t even know <br/>
what to do with them. :)  Sometimes I&#39;ve seen runes randomly held by <br/>
merchants...not sure if they ever carry the rare ones though unless maybe a <br/>
PC sold it to them.<br/>
