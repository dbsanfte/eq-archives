<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007029136"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; Also, you can only teach someone a language one point better than you know it. When they see the &quot;your language skills have &gt;&gt; improved &quot; stop coming, it is time for them to spamm you in that same language, keep going back and forth and soon you both &gt;&gt; will be excellent in the language. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A GM told me that he didn&#39;t think that this &quot;learn one point better than you know it&quot; was an intentional feature, but rather a bug, which would make utilizing it to gain excellent language skill an exploit.  He did say he was not sure, though.  Does anyone else out there have a line on this?</div>
