<b>Subject:</b> Re: The worth of a Wizard (long) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-712524719">OK, a couple of thoughts...I like the idea of cutting back on the number of<br/>
requests...it sounds like we are just whining when we send a huge list of<br/>
demands!<br/>
Some things I think we should cut from the letter:<br/>
Speciallization - Verant is already working on this, and the problem is<br/>
certainly not class specific!  Don&#39;t bug them when they are already working<br/>
on it!<br/>
<br/>
Haste Spell (for fast travel) - Don&#39;t push this one...druids and Shamans<br/>
have Spirit of Wolf and I don&#39;t really think this is appropriate for<br/>
Wizards...maybe the Line of Sight Shadow Step idae would be better...<br/>
<br/>
Max Meditation Skill - Don&#39;t bother, we already have a way to decrease our<br/>
downtime with meditation...anybody ever played a warrior?  lol 20-30 MINUTES<br/>
of healing at high levels!<br/>
<br/>
Chat server access while medding - I don&#39;t think this will ever<br/>
happen...Verant has gone out of their way to make it nearly impossible to<br/>
run multiple programs with EQ (which is GREAT for keeping the hack programs<br/>
at bay!)...allowing for the code to attach to a different server is probably<br/>
just not going to happen...tough to code, and opens the door to hackers.<br/>
<br/>
Official Feedback on Planned Changes - that&#39;s what the test server is all<br/>
about...and I, personally would rather if Verant&#39;s people were working on<br/>
tweaking the code rather than posting messages on the Web about what the<br/>
WOULD be working on if they weren&#39;t writing HTML updates on things they were<br/>
changing...<br/>
<br/>
Keep the letter SHORT and to the POINT.<br/>
Don&#39;t include complaints about other classes...everybody thins THEIR class<br/>
is underpowered (trust me, I&#39;ve heard from just about<br/>
everyvody...well...maybe not the Necros, but we KNOW how THEY are!<br/>

<br/>
Text of my future letter..<br/>
<br/>
Wizards need revision and we on a wizard mailing list have find some<br/>
interesting spell changes to ask for: <br/>
<br/>
 Summon - Teleports group member inside the zone to your location<br/>
 Phase - Teleports yourself to location of other group member inside zone<br/>
 Tap Afinity - Teleport group member to their own bind spot<br/>
 Haste - Increases movement rate for self only.<br/>
 Group Gate - Slow casting spell which teleports group to your bind spot,<br/>
 doesn&#92;&#39;t leave anyone behind<br/>
 Retreat - Evacuate version of group gate<br/>
 Meditation skill max for level for wizard (Level +1) * 7<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We also hope very much in future implementation of<br/>
<br/>
- Specialization skill with some real advantages to our class<br/>
<br/>
- resolving a problem of high resistence of DD spells at lv 20 resisted by<br/>
(greens and blues )and other ( if this is becouse of stun effect we wish<br/>
one spell without this efect at same level)<br/>
<br/>
- resolving a balance problem of other magic users classes be able to<br/>
attack directly (necromancer, lifetap pets) or indirectly (enchanters and<br/>
magicians pets, buffs ect) a much higer lv MOBs NP 19 lv against 35 lv sand<br/>
giant when our spells are 100% resisted if a monster is 6+ lv. <br/>
<br/>
- beter use of time when meditating (acces to main chat server in separate<br/>
window) <br/>
<br/>
- we wish real official feedback on planed changes or problems wich you<br/>
have with balance in game on official page wich exixt but its never updated<br/>
!! (look at quake they write all what is in work in one public letter .PLAN<br/>
and they are leader on mercat you dont need to hide all in fear of<br/>
concurents will hit your weak point they will find and try in any case )<br/>
