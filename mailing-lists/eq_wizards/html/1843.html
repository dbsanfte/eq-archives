 </span></blockquote>Ehehe wizards are very god at dueling at later levels even more but to advance<br/>
you must kill other things and to do this or to go in dungeon where are many<br/>
monstars attacking you start to alue less and less you start to be only root<br/>
machine and eventual nuker as your nukes leave you OOM so soon. the problem is<br/>
not in one kill this is easy for wizard to do, but try to win against 20 blue<br/>
monsters who will do it faster? a group with monk and wizard or group with monk<br/>
and enchanter AND PET or group with a Monk and a cleric or druid or any other<br/>
spell caster go beter in then a wizard. If you change target to red monsters<br/>
all other can give a hand our spells are resisted. <br/>
