Anyone have ANY ideas how to gain faction with the Dark Elves in Nek Forest<br/>
and Neriak?  Since the implementation of faction hits for PvP I am now<br/>
regarded dubiously by most of the guards and have some Drow brethren who<br/>
cannot enter the forest safely anymore.  Yes, it is my own fault for the<br/>
most part, but how can I fix it?  GMs and Guides can&#39;t help, other players<br/>
that I have talked with so far haven&#39;t been of much help, either.  I was<br/>
told to try the Halflings that roam Nek Forest, but that was misleading.<br/>
Even the Leatherfoot Deputy doesn&#39;t help you gain faction in Neriak.  I just<br/>
heard tonight to try Lavastorm and Najena, but I had been there for many,<br/>
many levels and haven&#39;t noticed any gains.  Any advice would be most<br/>
appreciated.  Thanks.<br/>
