&gt;Eeeeesh!  :(  Thanks for the tips...I guess I&#39;ll avoid the area for a bit.  <br/>
&gt;Yeah, I usually don&#39;t like going solo either...but there are sometimes those <br/>
&gt;nights when nobody wants to group and I go off on exploration journeys. :)  <br/>
&gt;Perma is another place I wanted to venture...but it sounds like the goblins <br/>
&gt;there are no fun too. ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you really just want to solo I can give you some suggestions of stuff I<br/>
saw that you could probably fight, but personally I tend to almost always<br/>
look for a group.  Its just not as much fun talking to yourself. :)<br/>
First thing that comes to mind is that I was able to solo Aviak Rooks in<br/>
South Karana at the bird house.  The problem is that you must be a patient<br/>
player because the Bird House is almost always crowded.  Just try to make<br/>
sure you don&#39;t steel someone&#39;s kite, as druids still do that a fair bit out<br/>
there.  No bad faction, exp and loot are ok.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t recomend Centars in SK, because they do use bows.  While that may<br/>
not be a problem, they do fire pretty quick and can distrup spells even<br/>
while rooted.<br/>
<br/>
At 24th I was able to solo wandering Tidal lords in Dagnor&#39;s cauldron.<br/>
Actually I know this one because I was leading a level 15 to unrest when he<br/>
was attacked.  I rooted, I nuked, it died, I got exp.  However at 24th the<br/>
bosuns and occasionally the shamen would attack me if I got too close to<br/>
them.  So pulling from the camps could be bad, as wizards don&#39;t work well<br/>
against two opponents.<br/>
<br/>
I believe wolley mammoths are blue in the mid 20s.  I could be wrong but I<br/>
was just wandering around yesterday and though that was the level the<br/>
people there were.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen people soloing in Mistmore, when you zone in head down the ramp<br/>
and go to the left side of the pond.  Up on that hill is where the soloers<br/>
go that I have seen.  Its safe from trains up on that hill and I believe<br/>
there is only one mob that spawns on top of the hill, but I know there are<br/>
a few on the sides.  Invis works find in this part of the zone.  Just don&#39;t<br/>
expect it to later.  Also if you think you need to train one for the zone.<br/>
Run backwards! most of that stuff can backstab, as some are DE rogues.  Its<br/>
not bad dark elf faction to kill them, atleast I I don&#39;t remember it being<br/>
bad.  My Gnome has killed a few 100 DEs in Mistmore, and still dubious to<br/>
Guards and even Dragoons. (only killed Divvn once and Dorn 2 times:))<br/>
<br/>
Now that I am level 35 and verant has seen fit to turn the Cazic spawn back<br/>
on.  Yeah all the high level spawn in Cazic was turned off on Fennin Ro for<br/>
probably a month.  Anyway, I figured I would go exploring.  Most of cazic<br/>
is green to me, however now that finatics and protectors are spawning near<br/>
the heralds, I have actually found a location where I could solo if I<br/>
wanted to.  I just choose not to.<br/>
<br/>
I am sure there are probably nooks and cranies in many dungeons that you<br/>
can go to solo, but I personally don&#39;t recomend soloing in dungeons.  I am<br/>
personally not big on Guard Killing, unless its for a quest.  Killing<br/>
guards to me is newbie harasment, as many nubies rely on the guards for<br/>
protection in the early levels.  Nothing sucks worse than to be running for<br/>
your life from the Minotaur Hero only to have the guard not there. So that<br/>
pretty much narrows it down to wandering spawn.  I found the 20s to be<br/>
rather easy, but then again I was in groups for 90% of that time.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck.<br/>
