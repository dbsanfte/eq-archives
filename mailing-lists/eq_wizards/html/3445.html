<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082023012">According to PHAEDRA WHITLOCK:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; South Karana. Hunt aviaks, centaurs and elephants until you can get into outside Paw Groups. Ive levelled from 22 to nearly 28 (last night) in about 3 weeks at Paw. The loot is good (FS weapons, whips sell for 30-50, gloves for 300-500, other Paw armor 10-15) and the money isnt bad, plat, gold and silver.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If uncamped, yes, a good opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, Highhold Pass is good for about 2 more levels (once you hit 22,<br/>
you get pitiful experience), at either Gnoll side (solo or small group)<br/>
or Orc side (join one of the big groups that camp there)<br/>
<br/>
Picklaws at 20 is borderline, even the early groups, you&#39;ll get loads<br/>
of resists, as they&#39;re all red.<br/>
