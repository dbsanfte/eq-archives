<div id="ygrps-yiv-829557927">Yes, you can get Runed Totem Staffs at Lake Rathe.  I got mine there.  They<br/>
are at the camp just inside the entrance when coming from South Karana.<br/>
Be aware though that it depends on the time of day.  From 8PM to 7AM (night<br/>
time) skeletons spawn.  From 8AM to 7PM (daytime) gnolls spawn.<br/>
You can get the RTS off the Gnoll High Shaman when they spawn (sometimes).<br/>
You can also get the skull of Jhen Tra off some Gnoll Embalmers.<br/>

in the Lake Rathe zone? If so, I assume they are at the gnoll skeleton camp.<br/>
Am I right?<br/>
