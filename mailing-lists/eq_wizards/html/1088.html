<div id="ygrps-yiv-2016448883">Ok...here&#39;s the deal from an old mage.  Level is most important when<br/>
determining if your spell will take its full damage on the target.  You do<br/>
not need a higher rank spell to cast, you just need to level.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, no one does well against red considering creatures.  Unless you<br/>
have SOW on and are targeting something like an elephant in south karana.<br/>
Even then, you will run out of mana before getting close to killing the RED<br/>
creature.  The higher the creature&#39;s level, the more they can resist your<br/>
spells.  It is that simple.  <br/>
<br/>
I was hitting tentacle terrors (level 20-24) with my shock of fire spell<br/>
(2nd rank spell) and hitting it with Shock of Lightning.  <br/>
<br/>
There are only some critters you can hit that are red (the really should<br/>
consider &quot;pink&quot; since they are in the first level of red above yellow<br/>
COnsiders).<br/>

Hi all,<br/>
so i get some questions for hard gamers :)<br/>
1. First i am a fan of quest :). But in freeport, the arcan scientist don t<br/>
want to give me any quest :(. I know that i must raise my faction if i want<br/>
to make quests for them but how ???? Killing deathfist centurion and so<br/>
raise faction with commond resident. Are the scientist residents ? If i can<br/>
not do any quest for them then how to raise my faction with them ? What the<br/>
monsters who raise faction with scientist ?<br/>
2. Second, a wizzard is useles vs red monsters... Yesterday i was fighting<br/>
with 3 friend same level as me orc warrior from blue ro red. For the blue,<br/>
np. But for the white yellow and red don t even try with a caster group..<br/>
Why ? Normally shock of lightening can do 82 dommage... In three hours<br/>
fighting with orc, 3 or 4 times i do 82 hp dommage... But usually i do 12,<br/>
14 , 4 or whatever but not the max... I have tried fire spel, ice spel, same<br/>
they don t resist the whole dommage but they resist very well.. So i go<br/>
fighting crocodile.. Deep water croco.. Considering red.... and same : i<br/>
nearly never do max dommage (nearly never the half dommage in fact sigh :(<br/>
). I can understand that if they are red i need a level 16 spel to hurt them<br/>
bad (i am currently 15) but that s really stupid.. If i try to kill red with<br/>
friends and that i dont  dommage the monsters i am useless vs red creatures<br/>
cause my spels are resisted !! In others words, you must kill blue creatures<br/>
to be sure you do the max dommage... But one of my friend is necro level<br/>
15... And you know what ? HE ALWAYS do the max dommage he can handle... ok<br/>
it s only 42 for the attack spel but he always do 42, same for war undead<br/>
always the max !!!! i regret that with these fact a wizzard can nearly not<br/>
kill more then blue creatures... By the way, i have killed some days ago a<br/>
dervish thug alone cons. yellow for me.. And all my spel were working at<br/>
max... Any idea ? it s just a question of magic resist ? Why the necro spel<br/>
does always max dommage ? (and are never never resisted at all ! Heat blood,<br/>
war undead life tap and so ! )<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the help !<br/>
