&gt; WOW what a bunch of winning babys Christ...I thought this was going to be<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a fun list. I would never be good<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; enough NEVER!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your derogatory manner will not win you your point or earn you respect<br/>
enough to be even listened too.  I have been listening carefully to the<br/>
points provided and I have to admit the people asking for change have been<br/>
more eloquent and have made better points than &#39;you guys whine alot&#39;.  It<br/>
does seem from the preponderance of evidence that has been presented here<br/>
that there is some lack of balance.  No one has said that the game is<br/>
unplayable as a wizard just that they need some improvement.  Example last<br/>
night I was laughed at when I asked if any one wanted a level 12 wizard. (by<br/>
3 people over shout no less)  If that is the opinion of the majority of the<br/>
populace in a game that is suppose to be group only, then I say we need<br/>
something to make us more valuable...<br/>
