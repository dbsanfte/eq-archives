<div id="ygrps-yiv-412004046">The shaman is a good class, however you must know that they have a shorter<br/>
amount of Mana than you.  You can also ROOT them down and cast on them.<br/>
When at 16 level you can buy Shieldskin which will nullify 100HP damage<br/>
melee to you.  This is very effective.  Also you are hitting as hard as him<br/>
and you are 2 levels lower.  Yes you are more powerful.  WHen you reach his<br/>
level or 16th you will do more dmg than he.<br/>

Everyone likes to think thier class is the best class. But the lvl 12 spell<br/>
is shock of ligthing no? That max&#39;s out at around 83 pnts fo dmg I think,<br/>
starts at 77. So you are doing 77 dmg at 12 where is only doing that much at<br/>
14. When you hit lvl 16 you get a nice 102 dmg spell, and that is currently<br/>
doing 110 dmg for me at lvl 20. But, your lvl 20 DD spell SUCKS. It does 177<br/>
dmg, 2% LESS mana efficent then your lvl 16 one, but it does have a 2 second<br/>
stun, but it RESISTS WAY TO OFTEN.<br/>
<br/>
But anyways, at the low lvls (yes, lvl 12 is a low lvl, hell 16 is even low<br/>
lvl IMO), your DD is very comparable to that of which other class&#39;s can do.<br/>
But in the end we do dish out much more damage. Can you say &quot;1100dmg in 1<br/>
shot&quot; .. can anyone else lay claim to that? not even druids can, their max<br/>
damage is 650 I think.<br/>

&gt;Sorry this is so long.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m a level 11 wizard about to turn 12.  Well my friend is a shaman who<br/>
 </span></blockquote>just<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;turned 14. Well he just brought<br/>
&gt;his new damage spell and he said it does 77 damage, to which i replied kewl<br/>
&gt;my next spell does that amount<br/>
&gt;too. That was a mistake he started laughing and saying things like &quot;why<br/>
&gt;would anyone want to play the wizard<br/>
&gt;when they can play the shaman&quot;.  &quot;the shaman can stand toe to toe like the<br/>
&gt;warrior and do the same damage<br/>
&gt;as the wizard, Ha HA HA HA .....&quot; . Then he went on saying crap like now he<br/>
&gt;knows the shaman is the best<br/>
&gt;class in the game. All he could talk about before was the sow spell, and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>now<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;it is he does the same damage<br/>
&gt;as the wizard.  My question is this, i thought i picked the wizard so i<br/>
&gt;would not have to hear stuff like this?<br/>
&gt;I thought level 12 was when the wizard started to leave other mage class<br/>
&gt;behind.  Know i have to hear alot<br/>
&gt;aggraviating crap from this shaman, laughing at the wizard class. Dam that<br/>
&gt;is going to suck.  Someone<br/>
&gt;please tell me there is hope out there as far as the damage spells go.<br/>
