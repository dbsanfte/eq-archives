<div id="ygrps-yiv-50168563"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t feel to bad about ensnare.  I just got finished &quot;discussing&quot; root and<br/>
ensnare with a couple of high level druids on a message board.  Basically they<br/>
wanted a reliable root spell like wizards instead of their ensnare line.  I<br/>
guess its true,  The grass is always greener on the other side.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bonds of force is NOT as good as the Druid form of Ensnare at my current<br/>
&gt; level 29...<br/>
&gt; It is resisted about the same amount as Enstill and the length of effect is<br/>
&gt; much like our root... random.<br/>
&gt; The druid version of ensnare is not resisted as much, and when it sticks it<br/>
&gt; always lasts for a minute or two.  I see a few uses for this spell but I am<br/>
&gt; dissapointed.  I would rather have the druid version of ensnare for a single<br/>
&gt; mob.<br/>
