<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882075565">I am Lvl 25 and I still use Force Shock on most Mobs I meet.  Especially<br/>
Casters.  I have Frost Shock as my second spell I use because I dont have to<br/>
wait for it to recharge.  I do not understand why people are complaining<br/>
about the resisting factor because I only resist maybe and I say maybe 1 out<br/>
10 mobs.  If I resist it once I use Frost 2 or 3 times then hit it again<br/>
with Force and Boom its dead.  As far as Enstill I have less resists to it<br/>
then I do to Root so I use it more than anything.  And as far as duration I<br/>
hardly ever have a problem with that, I have on several occassions Enstilled<br/>
a mob, then ran out of mana and sat down to meditate for one last shot or<br/>
even 2 shots and the mob is still sitting there looking stupid.  I have had<br/>
numerous occassion had someoen come by and ask if I needed help to kill the<br/>
mob since I was sitting right in front of it and I state &quot;No, hes just being<br/>
a good boy and staying where he was told.  I&#39;ll deal with him in a bit.&quot;  I<br/>
actually have that saying in one of my hotbox keys now ).<br/>

&gt; yeah. how embarrassing is it to have to tell ur group that we cant fight<br/>
&gt; reds because our spells wont work???  that should be top priority on<br/>
&gt; anything we send to verant.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; side note: if anybody reading this has made it to lvl 24 and used frost<br/>
&gt; shock, please let me (or us) know if the resists for this spell are just<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; bad as force shock and enstill.  I must say that force shock and enstill<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; the only two spells i use regularly on blues and greens that get resisted<br/>
&gt; regularly (this is seperate from the resists we get on reds which is<br/>
another<br/>
&gt; issue altogether).  so maybe it&#39;s not a resist issue, but more of a crappy<br/>
&gt; spell issue.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; a funny note: i was in guk with a lvl 22 shadowknight last week, and i was<br/>
&gt; complaining about force shock getting resisted (yeah, he was about sick of<br/>
&gt; my ranting but i had to rant to somebody).  well, we got tired of the<br/>
&gt; froglock tad in the entrance (lvl 3ish i guess) that was healing the<br/>
&gt; monsters we were pulling, so we decided to end his healing expedition.<br/>
&gt; after we hit him once he started to run and the sk cast a spell on the<br/>
&gt; tad....  low and behold, THE TAD RESISTED.  yes, a lvl 3ish tad resisted a<br/>
&gt; lvl 22 sk spell.  hahaha. im sure u dont have to guess who was complaining<br/>
&gt; about resists the rest of the evening (believe me, i didnt say a word<br/>
after<br/>
&gt; that little incident)!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; maybe we dont have it so bad after all ????<br/>

&gt;     that sounds good,  but I think we need to bring up the resist spells<br/>
&gt; bug,  in a small party to medium party, there is no problem,  but in a<br/>
party<br/>
&gt; of 6, you take on high red mob&#39;s,  and all the other class can contribute<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; the party in some way even if there spells can not effect the mob,  but<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; wizard class is left standing there with nothing to help out the party.<br/>

&gt;         Okay, before the Verant text thing, I posted that we should and<br/>
try<br/>
&gt; to get one (1) thing changed.  Then people posted they wanted a ton of<br/>
stuff<br/>
&gt; to change.  Then I posted a ton of stuff and now they are saying post only<br/>
&gt; a couple of things....rrrr.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Actually, we sound just like a bunch of bickering Wizards, heh, I<br/>
&gt; can just picture us all in a dimly lit lecturing hall, trying to figure<br/>
out<br/>
&gt; how to best approach the Master Wizard and tell him his spells suck, while<br/>
&gt; trying to second guess which way he will turn us into ash after we do. =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Anyway, if we cant come together here, lets at least start sending<br/>
&gt; Verant SOMETHING.  Seran is right, I just read on eq.stratics.com that<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; are working on Specialization and it should be implemented in a couple of<br/>
&gt; weeks.  So no use bugging them for that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         If we are only going for a couple of things I would go for :<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Meditate Skill cap of 7 rather than 5 - reason:  Hey, come on,<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; took away 2 points from our combat abilities, at least they could give it<br/>
&gt; back to us for mana, right?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Line of Sight Fade and Shadowstep spells with set minimum<br/>
&gt; distances - reason: Well, I came up with it originally (ahem, blush) and<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; would serve a dual purpose of being a good escape spell and help with<br/>
lower<br/>
&gt; level travel, both of which are things we Wizards could desperately use.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Now, what do you all think...<br/>
