Being a complete newbie, you can imagine that a good portion of my time is<br/>
spent running toward the nearest guard in Tox forest.<br/>
<br/>
However, they rarely if ever actually do anything to help me, and I wind up<br/>
having to zone to make sure that I am safe (from those pesky skeletons that<br/>
seem to come in pairs).  Is there a trick to getting the guards to take the<br/>
heat, or are they supposed to do it automatically?  I was under the<br/>
impression that they were supposed to help automatically.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
