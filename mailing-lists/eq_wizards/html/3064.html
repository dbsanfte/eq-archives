<div id="ygrps-yiv-343458108">I have a rant about the way that magic users are getting a raw deal on pvp<br/>
that is.  Now the lowered our damage when we fight other PC&#39;s.  Hey they<br/>
chose to be that race/class, i chose to be a wizard.  I have to put up with<br/>
just as much pain if not more than they do.  So why are we being punished<br/>
for them choosing to be a warrior type on the pvp servers.  I tend to think<br/>
that this will lead to the other servers even more heavily in the fact that<br/>
all the warrior types say we do to much damage or are ksing everything cause<br/>
of our power.  Yea you with 400 hp at lvl 13 me with barely over 200.  Guess<br/>
he who whines the most in EQ gets the most.<br/>
