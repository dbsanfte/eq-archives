&gt; <br/>
&gt; From what I&#39;ve gathered the research skill is for things like <br/>
&gt; &quot;evocation&quot;,<br/>
&gt; &quot;conjuration&quot;, &quot;diviniation&quot;, etc...<br/>
&gt; Logically, it would be for spell research, and I&#39;m assuming that <br/>
&gt; there&#39;ll be<br/>
&gt; ways to obtain new spells through this. If it were me that was <br/>
&gt; designing it,<br/>
&gt; then we&#39;d need spell components and such. Otherwise, why sell blank <br/>
&gt; scroll<br/>
&gt; sheets, and quills, and ink??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And how would they implement researched spells? I&#39;d hate to think that<br/>
Verant just included a few hidden spells you have to research to access.<br/>
Verant could play a hand in this, perhaps setting a threshold for<br/>
&#39;discovery&#39; (you have to do X research to discover a spell) and then<br/>
write it into the game via the patch server. <br/>
<br/>
Problems:<br/>
a) The newly discovered spell would have to be made available on all<br/>
servers, unless Verant can find a way to only make it available on the<br/>
discoverer&#39;s.<br/>
b) Every time a new spell is discovered, everyone has to get patched. =&#92;<br/>
This wouldn&#39;t be that much of a problem if discovery is limited to<br/>
high-ranking mages.<br/>
c) Verant would actually have to consult with the discoverer about the<br/>
details, like visuals, spell effects, mana cost, etc. Do they really want<br/>
to put this much effort into it? I&#39;d love it if they would, but I have my<br/>
doubts...<br/>
