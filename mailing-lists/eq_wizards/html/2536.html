<b>Subject:</b> Possible Binding Locations <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007519468">Hello all,<br/>
    I an just wondering about the posible locations that we can bind other palyers too. Let me explain. My group all started out in Faydwer. As we moved out of the zones, I was able to bind them inside cities as we went. We are now over in the freeport area and I bind them there, outside the gates, and we have traveled to rivervale, where again, I was able to bind them. Now we want to travel to Grobb or Oggok, and I wonder if there are any &quot;outside city zones&quot; similar to Kelethin that I can bind my friends to. I realize that I can bind myself anywhere, but if my friends have to go inside a city, will they get KOS? Also, how does this work for any DE race that cannot enter rivervale, can they enter grobb or Oggok for binding?<br/>
Thanks</div>
