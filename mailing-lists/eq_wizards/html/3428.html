<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330424222">You must put 1 point into ALL the specialization skills before they will<br/>
rise properly.  Put a few points into the one you want to be your primary<br/>
specialization.  This is so that it will be the first one to go beyond 50.<br/>
The first skill to go beyond 50 becomes your primary specialization, and it<br/>
is the only one that will rise beyond 50.  If you do not have a point in all<br/>
the others to get them started, however, then none of them will rise above<br/>
50.  They all improve naturally as you cast spells of the appropriate<br/>
school, so you need not put more than 1 point into the other schools, only<br/>
your selected primary one, so you will ensure that it rises above 50 first.<br/>
The specialization skill either reduces casting time or reduces fizzling or<br/>
both... I can&#39;t remember now what the gm told me precisely--- it was long<br/>
ago.  Should you change your mind later, though, there is a quest in the<br/>
Temple of Solusek Ro whereby you may reset your specializations and begin<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
As for Research, I have never bothered with practice runes.  The materials<br/>
for them are a quest in themselves, and I have found it easier to simply<br/>
keep research maxed at your guildhouse with one of the trainers for your<br/>
class.  It gets expensive, though---it is costing me about 8 plat per point<br/>
now, but money isn&#39;t nearly the problem that collecting those runes is.  I<br/>
have only had a few failures in research, and they are due to luck.  I had<br/>
research maxed, and still failed 3 times to create one of the level 24<br/>
spells, and this when I was level 29!  I then tried to make a level 34 spell<br/>
and succeeded on the first try.  It&#39;s just a matter of luck.  Just save all<br/>
the runes you find and ask others to do so as well, and then try a spell<br/>
when you are sure you have maxed your research for your level.  Good luck.<br/>

&gt; Hi folks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just got lvl 20 the other day and am wondering about Specialization.  I<br/>
&gt; dumped as many points as I could into &quot;Specialization:Evocation&quot;, but have<br/>
&gt; absolutely no clue as to how it&#39;s supposed to work.  What does it do?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; On another note, when I got to lvl 16, I dumped a point into Research.<br/>
