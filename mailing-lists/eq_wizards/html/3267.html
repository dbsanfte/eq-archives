<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971098166">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I have not had any problem with fizzles since about level 16, so I&#39;m<br/>
using Inferno Shock and loving it. I don&#39;t know what good Thunder Strike<br/>
is, though. Is it just useless?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is a must have when fighting blue and white casters(yellow and red<br/>
resist too often for it to be effective). This spell, along with Force Shock<br/>
and Tishan&#39;s Clash and Markar&#39;s Clash, are interrupters. Also, as you have<br/>
probably noticed, if any of the mentioned spells are not resisted they hit<br/>
for FULL damage every time. But back to the usefulness. When fighting<br/>
casters you can open up with Tishan&#39;s and get 30-50 damage(depending on<br/>
level), interrupt any spell that they were casting and get a 4-6 second<br/>
stun. This gives you just enough time to drop a quicker nuke, in your case<br/>
your 16th or 24th level one, then immediately start in with Thunder Strike<br/>
and generally kill them(if your tanks have been working on them or another<br/>
caster has dropped a spell). Even if it doesn&#39;t kill them the Strike will<br/>
interrupt whatever they were casting(in the case of healers it would have<br/>
been a heal spell at this point) and knock them back a good ways. If that<br/>
gets them low enough on health most will turn and start running away, making<br/>
it easy pickings for the tanks. These tactics have worked effectively for me<br/>
all the way up to the king room in Sol B and the Fort in Lower Guk live<br/>
side(my current camping spots). The combination has allowed my group to take<br/>
4 casters at a time and not lose a single person.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, hope that helps.<br/>
<br/>
Yours,<br/>

PS - Is the interest in this mailing list going away? I haven&#39;t had many<br/>
updates in the past week or so and was wondering.</div>
