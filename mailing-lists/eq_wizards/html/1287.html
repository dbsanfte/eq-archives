<div id="ygrps-yiv-398461994">Well said Jay. Parties cant be bothered with wizards, they cant buff, cant heal<br/>
and cant really help parties that much...&quot;we were supposed to be heavy<br/>
artillery&quot; but that just is not correct. I think a wizard would be most parties<br/>
last choice if they could choose from all the classes.<br/>
<br/>
Its very easy to demonstrate the wizard immbalance; get into an arena with a<br/>
dual wield barbarian warrior of the same level and see how you do!<br/>
Hmm doesn&#39;t sound too promising eh?<br/>
<br/>
I have always played a wizard character class in AD&D and UO but I regret<br/>
playing one in EQ. I think EQ were nervous about the power wizards in UO and<br/>
didn&#39;t want to unbalance the game. I think they swung the pendalum too far the<br/>
other way. Root &#39;n&#39; Shoot, if that fails death, thats about it.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully e-mails will pour in and tell me how wrong I am. Great, show me its<br/>
not the case so I feel I have a character with a future!<br/>
