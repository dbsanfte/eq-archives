<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363192693">Hmm, sounds like that druid didnt know what he was doing...  What lvl did<br/>
you guys duel at and was it in an open area?  Let me give an example of what<br/>
a druid can do to whip a wiz...  At level 29, a druid has a DD for 170<br/>
damage and a heal for 270hps.  A wiz reliable DD does 237dmg.  A typical<br/>
strategy druids would use would go something like this:  DOT which casts<br/>
very fast, then one DD for 170dmg.  Spirit of Cheetah which casts faster<br/>
than even our shadow step series and allows them to run at 6x the speed of<br/>
normal run.  In this time the wiz has gotten off 2 big DD for 474 total dmg,<br/>
or the wiz has used his stun and one DD for only 237dmg.  The stun takes a<br/>
while to recycle so you cant chain cast it.  The druid is now out of casting<br/>
range because Spirit of Cheetah is so fast.  He heals twice and is at full<br/>
health again.  The wiz is down 350hps out of a total of just over 500.  Even<br/>
when the stun recycles the druid need only 1 maybe 2 casts to take you out.<br/>
He DOT again and DD once for another 170 while you got another 2 casts off<br/>
hurting him bad, but all he needs to do now is run away till the DOT kills<br/>
you and you lose exp because of it...<br/>
<br/>
Now there are a couple places within the sequence where a wiz can make<br/>
really mess up a druid&#39;s strategy, but most wizzies ive seen use an<br/>
incorrect sequence of casts and get whipped.  Also there are a few tricks<br/>
that can be done =) but I don&#39;t want to give those away just yet...<br/>

got my butt kicked by a necro at 24.  his pet was on me, and by the time i<br/>
rooted it, i was at less than half health and dropping fast (because of the<br/>
dots).  got off one frost shock that looked like it went for full dmg, but<br/>
died shortly after.  if u can catch a necro without a pet, or with a pet<br/>
that is 2+ lvls below u, then a necro would probably be pretty easy to mop<br/>
up....  although with verant increasing the necro&#39;s dot dmg and making them<br/>
last shorter in duration, it makes them a more viable PvP class, even<br/>
without their pet.<br/>
<br/>
on the other hand, i havent had any problems with druids.  killed one just<br/>
the other day when i was at three quarters health and he was full.  stun<br/>
worked like a charm :)<br/>
<br/>
the only problem i have with the &quot;skill&quot; factor in EQ is the simple fact<br/>
that most of the fights i get into are &quot;impromptu&quot; and start with me having<br/>
less than full health and less than full mana, no resistances cast, no<br/>
leatherskin.  i dont ever complain or bitch and moan about that kind of<br/>
stuff, as that is the nature of the PvP server, but if i were able to fully<br/>
prepare for a fight (like a duel or just pure PK/hunting), then i would have<br/>
my leatherskin on, along with my resistance stuff on, and of course, my good<br/>
stuff bagged...  and it actually might start to get fun :)<br/>
<br/>
just got attacked yesterday morning by a druid after i finished killing the<br/>
drow in paw.  he conned red and i only had about 30% mana when he attacked.<br/>
not much of a fight, as i immediatly had to gate (was close, but gated<br/>
successfully).  that&#39;s what i&#39;m seeing lately on the PvP server and it sure<br/>
is disappointing :(<br/>

&gt;The other big damage spells(Force Shock etc...) that disrupt are resisted<br/>
&gt;too often in PvP to be reliable.  The only one that I have used with<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;As for Rallos Zek, yes I do see many people quitting and I think that their<br/>
&gt;reasons for the most part are valid.  The two most powerful classes for PvP<br/>
&gt;and dueling in my opinion are the Wizard and Druid(People say Necros too<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I haven&#39;t seen enough of them in PvP situations to make a judgement on<br/>
&gt;them).  There IS skill involved in dueling but the classes weren&#39;t designed<br/>
&gt;for balance in PvP.  If a caster knows what they are doing, A melee type<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t stand a chance.  I have seen a few duels where a well played melee<br/>
&gt;class destroys the caster.  A monk with JBoots is a hard fight for a caster<br/>
&gt;in an enclosed area...  I have also seen a level 31 Bard annihilate a 35<br/>
&gt;Wizard.  And that fight was won with skill and knowledge.<br/>

&gt;ahhh.  i like that. and u can cast about 15-20 of those suckers too for a<br/>
&gt;nice 83dmg.  any other spells that disrupt?  from what i can tell, force<br/>
&gt;shock and frost shock knock u back a step or two when cast????  i think we<br/>
&gt;need another stun spell somewhere between tishan and markar (lvl 20 and lvl<br/>
&gt;49).<br/>

&gt;ps. euros, ur on rz right? im noticing a LOT of ppl quitting because of the<br/>
&gt;terrible combat engine and imbalance in PvP combat.  seems like if<br/>
&gt;everything isn&#39;t perfectly setup (ie. a duel) then the outcome is 99%<br/>
&gt;predictable (save for guild wars which are non-existent on the server now).<br/>
