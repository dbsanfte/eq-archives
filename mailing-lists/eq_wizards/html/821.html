<div id="ygrps-yiv-31648167">When I first started of corse all I had was my handy newbie rusty dagger.<br/>
Once I got to about 9 skill I found a staff and have been using one ever<br/>
since.  Now I am 15th level.  Around 13th I noticed that I never saw my<br/>
2hblunt skill going up.  Maybe I just wasn&#39;t meeling enough.  But I stuck<br/>
with the Great Stave.  Near the end of 14th and all through 15th.  Only<br/>
when I am with a party I have been using a Giant snake fang just to try to<br/>
get my piercing up to a semi respectable level.  Now 12 woo hoo :)<br/>
I have noticed that the only time that it ever seemes to increase is when<br/>
the creature is actually beating on me.  If I am just stabbing at a monster<br/>
as it beats on a party member I have never noticed my skill increase.  The<br/>
down side to this is that now at 15th most all blue things will totally<br/>
waste me within a few rounds of melee combat.  So its slow for that reason.<br/>
 I can almost always get the creature to attack me.  I just blast it once<br/>
for 81 dmg (SoL) and then step into melee.  I get the 3rd degree on<br/>
occasion from the clerics because they have to spend extra time healing me.<br/>
 But how else will my defense ever increase?<br/>
<br/>
I have herd and through practice I must agree.  You will never gain melee<br/>
skills (Defense, Offence, Peircing, 1hb, 2hb) if you are meleeing something<br/>
that is green to you.  Your skills will increase faster if you are in melee<br/>
with a yellow or even better a red.  But when the red Dry bones are<br/>
spanking me for 40 a pop 2 hits a round.  200+ hit points dosen&#39;t last very<br/>
long.  Just don&#39;t let yourself drop below 3 bars when using this tactic.<br/>
1. The clerics will get pissed  that they have to waste more mana on you.<br/>
2. As you get lower in health MOBS become harder to taunt off of you.  They<br/>
feel as you and I do.  Might as well kill the wounded one so he dosen&#39;t<br/>
rest up and come back later.<br/>

&gt;Subject: 2-Handed Staff Skill<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When I started, I was using a one-handed staff and my skill rose<br/>
&gt;relatively quickly to about 25-30.  I then switched to 2-Handed<br/>
&gt;staff to raise that skill, but it has NEVER gone up (while raising<br/>
&gt;from 6th level to 10th).  I tried seeding the skill with a few<br/>
&gt;training points, and it still has NEVER gone up.  Does the game<br/>
&gt;have an idea of a primary weapon or something?  Or have I<br/>
&gt;just been unlucky on raising the skill?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                                                            Thanks,<br/>
