<div id="ygrps-yiv-923614777">Conning white being an even fight, that makes sense that the opponent is the<br/>
same level as you.  I asked because people were saying they had never had a<br/>
spell damage an opponent that was &quot;6 levels above them&quot; and wondered how<br/>
they could figure that so precisely.  But maybe it was NPCs and not monsters<br/>
they were fighting.  I lost the original post.<br/>

&gt; &gt;As I understand it, there is no tried and true way to get the exact<br/>
&gt; &gt;level.  Monster levels are not the same as player levels from what I<br/>
&gt; &gt;read.  You can gage it by what kind of monsters you can take on and make<br/>
an<br/>
&gt; &gt;estimation from there.  Of course moss snakes and the like are level<br/>
1..all<br/>
&gt; &gt;the newbie stuff.  I hear that the Ogre guards in Najena are around level<br/>
&gt; &gt;20 or something.. but that is just word of mouth that has passed that<br/>
&gt; &gt;along, I haven&#39;t read anything official to this end.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;How can you tell what level a monster is?<br/>
