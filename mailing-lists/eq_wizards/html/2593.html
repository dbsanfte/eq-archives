<b>Subject:</b> Race diference? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-103244178">as for some time now im wondering about race diferences and balance. Im a<br/>
high elf wizard starting with a 127 int and i build my int until now to 150<br/>
so i have same mana as erudite wizard start with ( a little bit more) i<br/>
have seen that this little mana for my lavel it is not so little it is my<br/>
higest spell ! and some roots more it makes a life much easier i noted i<br/>
can now survive fight against a white monster easyly and blu ones if alone<br/>
are no fear for me any more. and i remain with a little bit of mana to<br/>
invis myself end meditate ehehe.<br/>
<br/>
I wished to ask anyone of you who gets in medium lv 20+ range with both<br/>
races and clases what are advantages of a high elf wich can cover this huge<br/>
diference in mana.<br/>
<br/>
Infravision is not a big one you get a heat sight at lv 16.<br/>
Wisdom ? did elfs realy fizzle so much less then others? i dont think so.<br/>
to compensate a diference in mana they have to have ratio of fizles 3 elf<br/>
to 4 erudites.<br/>
Agility? i get missed many times it is true is this same to erudite?<br/>
Possibility to wear smal items is null for wizards.<br/>
<br/>
Humans are compensated very well with their ability to level faster.<br/>
Dark elf are excelent with a hide ability to med in middle of fight but<br/>
they are easyly KOS.<br/>
<br/>
what you think about other races?<br/>
<br/>
Please i dont wish to talk about &quot;roleplay your race&quot; thing and similar i<br/>
chose my elf as i like him as a race and i know that a races are somehow<br/>
balanced i wish to know this balance works on our wizard example. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

&gt;I just got on the test server over lunch and found the new spell &quot;Bonds of<br/>
&gt;Force&quot; in Ak&#39;Anon.  It is a level 29 spell that is AE and takes 75 mana.<br/>
