<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651756003">when solo&#39;ing, tishans clash isn&#39;t very usefull. but when in a group, it is<br/>
very useful.  for sake of simplicitity, imagine yourself and a pure tank<br/>
(both of u lvl 25ish) grouped together fighting white and yellow mobs (we&#39;ll<br/>
use a white mob as the example).  the tank starts the attack, and is getting<br/>
beat on pretty good.  he&#39;s got a lot of hp and good ac, so he can take it<br/>
for a period of time.  now, if you start casting force/frost shock or any of<br/>
your other high dmg spells, the mob&#39;s gonna come for u (and many times it<br/>
doesnt matter how good the tank can taunt, once he gets on u, he&#39;s usually<br/>
not gonna get off).  and this means u cant get ur big spells off (cast time<br/>
too long at higher lvls) and u cant take the beating the mob is giving you<br/>
once he does get on u (u will end up having to root it).  so, with that<br/>
said, u shouldnt be casting ur big spells early on in the battle.  so what<br/>
do u do for the first half of the fight to help the tank?  well, i usually<br/>
do two things.  melee a bit, although i usually dont do much, if any dmg at<br/>
all...  and cast ur stun spell :)  what the stun spell does is prevents the<br/>
tank from getting hit for a cpl of rounds, and also does a little bit of dmg<br/>
(i think mine does 36 now if im not mistaken).  the stun seems to last a bit<br/>
longer as i progress in lvls, but i cant confirm that.  it might just be my<br/>
imagination :)the 36 dmg is definately not enough to make a mob frenzy on u,<br/>
and the stun can sometimes save the warrior from getting hit 4 to 6 times<br/>
(which can equate to well over 100 dmg at mid 20&#39;s lvl). so i usually cast<br/>
this sucker twice, which gives the tank enough time to get the mob down over<br/>
half, and then i start casting my big spells.<br/>
<br/>
keep in mind, when solo&#39;ing, this spell is virtually useless, but i have it<br/>
memmed at all times when im grouped.  if anybody else has any usefullness of<br/>
this spell, please let me know, as i would love to start using it when<br/>
solo&#39;ing, but just dont see its benefits right now.<br/>

ps. too bad we dont get another stun spell before lvl 49.  the clerics have<br/>
a whole line of stun spells :(<br/>

&gt;I was wondering if anyone could tell me the usefulness of this spell.  It<br/>
&gt;does about 30 dmg and a 2 second stun.  But for the mana used it seems like<br/>
&gt;a waste where as you could just do a dd spell instead since the 2 second<br/>
&gt;stun doesn&#39;t seem to help that much.  Thanks.<br/>
