<br/>
Then again, EQ is not life.  It&#39;s a game.  If you want real life, you don&#39;t<br/>
need to turn on your computer.  But in a game, there&#39;s nothing that says<br/>
that at similar levels we shouldn&#39;t have the same ability to compete.  This<br/>
is a judgment call.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; You&#39;re just upset<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that she gets an advantage you didn&#39;t, right? Well, life is tough like<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Damn right I am upset.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Awww.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  I play a limited amount of time and I have to compete with everyone<br/>
else<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Newsflash: no you don&#39;t. If you want to compete, fire up Half Life and<br/>
compete for frags. There&#39;s<br/>
&gt; competition. EQ is not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  At similar levels we should have the same ability to compete.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Says who? Do you have the same starting point in life as the rich kid<br/>
across the street? No, you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t. As I said, life is tough like that. EQ doesn&#39;t stand for equal,<br/>
buddy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  But with her<br/>
&gt; &gt; twinking I am at the disadvantage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No! You are where you would be anyway. She has some advantage, but it&#39;s<br/>
not an advantage OVER YOU.<br/>
&gt; Unless you are playing on Rallos Zek or +pvp you are very misguided as to<br/>
the true nature of EQ.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  While she coasts yet another character to the upper levels<br/>
&gt; &gt; AT MY EXPENSE!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How exactly is it at your expense?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Yes I am upset and yes she should be told to play fair like the rest of<br/>
us are<br/>
&gt; &gt; forced too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yeah, it&#39;s time for a new order! A revolution! Kind of like 1917, right?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Red Norrath&quot; does have a sound to it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, life is tough like<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that. Whether she gets an advantage or not, is none of your business<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; because it doesn&#39;t really affect you.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It does affect me.  It makes that many fewer creatures at my level<br/>
available for me to kill in<br/>
&gt; &gt; an HONORABLE way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh, come on! Are you saying you&#39;re having difficulty to find kills because<br/>
of twinkers? The % of<br/>
&gt; twinkers in the game is probably 5-10 MAX. Norrath is crowded, no doubt,<br/>
but don&#39;t blame twinkers<br/>
&gt; for hunting hardships.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  This makes my job (an already difficult one) even more difficult and<br/>
that is<br/>
&gt; &gt; why twinking is the WORST POSSIBLE OFFENSE.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Uh, no. Don&#39;t you find kill stealing or Guild camping worse? Man, it looks<br/>
like you&#39;re really fired<br/>
&gt; up about this, eh?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Listen, if you&#39;re on Solusek Ro, I might help you out, you know? Would<br/>
10-20pp help the revolution?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; And remember, she had to work her<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; way to level 22 before that as well, so she is only giving her other<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Char something she rightfully earned.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And just WHAT is your point?  Because she has one character at a high<br/>
level and can play in<br/>
&gt; &gt; areas that I cannot she has somehow earned the right to retard my low<br/>
level characters<br/>
&gt; &gt; development (see above) making it even more difficult for me to get to<br/>
my &quot;rightfully earned&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 22nd level.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As I said, the twinker&#39;s affect on hunting is negligible, at best. Can you<br/>
prove the contrary?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You are obviously a fool<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Obviously. I bow before your superior intellect, mighty one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; and most likely a twinker. I can only hope you are not on my server.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hah. I&#39;m level 13, and I have 60pp in the bank. All rightfully earned. I<br/>
can hardly play enough with<br/>
&gt; one character, let alone two or more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ever hear the phrase &quot;I might disagree with your opinion, but I&#39;ll fight<br/>
to the death to let you<br/>
&gt; voice it&quot;? Well this is the same. I might frown upon twinkers, but I&#39;ll do<br/>
anything to preserve<br/>
&gt; their freedom to do as they wish.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do you disagree, comrade?<br/>
