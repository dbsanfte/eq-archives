<div id="ygrps-yiv-688856979">Human wiz, Int 95. I just yesterday was given a +3 Int amulet, so 98. I hear 100 is THE magic number... Found that out at level 2. :( Wisdom 75 Agi 90 dex 80 (base stats). Two +2 dex Dervish rings and a +5 hp ring.<br/>
<br/>
I had to begin as a human, as we planned to group, me and some friends, and they all wanted to be humans (monks and warriors...) Turned out we rarely see each other due to RL time scheduling problems, and now Im 12th and theyre around 6th so... Thats why I was human, not elven (my fave race).<br/>
<br/>
Also, sometimes I cast, it makes the whooshing You-Are-Casting sound, the time bar runs out, and nothing happens. No message on the screen that it was resisted, that any damage was taken, nor fizzled, nor monster-already-dead-pick-new-target. It used mana... so what happened to my spell?<br/>

&gt; How do you get Root to work? It sucks up half my mana, and so far,<br/>
&gt; never holds even blues (pumas, lions, gt spiders, orc centurions). I<br/>
&gt; wouldnt think of trying it on anything higher. Dont even memorize it<br/>
&gt; any more.<br/>
<br/>
for me it wasn&#39;t viable tull lvl 16 or so...till then it just sucked up<br/>
lots of mana...<br/>
<br/>
just wondering, what&#39;s your INT? cause i don&#39;t rember having as many<br/>
fizzle probelms as you do...<br/>
 <br/>
&gt; Groups, my groups tend to have the critter dead in 5 seconds or less<br/>
&gt; (orc camps) so the 15 rule wont help me.<br/>
<br/>
I had the same problem, so i just step in kinda close and guage off the HP<br/>
bar...when it&#39;s ~1/8th down is generally a good time to start in on the<br/>
critter...<br/>
 <br/>
&gt; And I always have Gate handy. So much better than Fade and Shadowstep!<br/>
&gt; Saved my life yesterday in the dervish camp.<br/>
<br/>
at your level shadowstep and then gate is a great escape method...i&#39;ve<br/>
found that when you hit the really high teens though that everythign moves<br/>
really fast and shadow step doesn&#39;t help as much anymore...of course by<br/>
then the mana you spend for root is trivial, so root and gate become a<br/>
decently effective strat...<br/>
