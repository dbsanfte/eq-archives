&gt; &gt; Since it only costs about 30 to 50pp to master brewing (and alcohol<br/>
&gt; &gt; tolerance at the same time), I am going to test this theory pretty soon.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, I tried it, and it turned out to be BS. Thing is, when you drink,<br/>
&gt; your INT goes down so it looks like your mana bar fills up, when in fact<br/>
&gt; you just get less mana capacity and the current mana you have looks like<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s a lot more in comparison.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s kind of like when you cast shielding on yourself and it looks like<br/>
&gt; your HP go down, when in fact your HP capacity grows and the current HP<br/>
&gt; looks like it&#39;s less in comparison.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I still would like someone with maxed Alcohol Tolerance to try it and<br/>
&gt; see if his mana goes up without his INT going down. Then we&#39;ll have<br/>
&gt; something.<br/>
