<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604134164">This is a nifty idea.  Are you getting the experience for it?  I&#39;ve seen NPC&#39;s fall from high places and die before and have never been able to get any experience for it.<br/>

Subject:	[eq_wizards] Interesting tactic to damage monsters...<br/>
<br/>

This weekend I was experimenting with an interesting new tactic to cause<br/>
damage to monsters.  The problem was that I really couldn&#39;t verify how well<br/>
it works, because I&#39;m not certain if monsters take damage from falling or not.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But what I would do is hit a monster from long distance with a spell, then<br/>
run up a VERY VERY steep cliff.  Once at the top of the cliff I wait till<br/>
the monster hits me, then I hit the fade button.  9 times out of 10, fade<br/>
takes me to the bottom of the cliff.  The monster then jumps off the cliff<br/>
to get me, and I&#39;m assuming it takes some damage from the fall.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I did this a couple times... the biggest problem is finding suitable cliffs<br/>
to fade from, and the second worst problem is being careful not to fall in<br/>
myself.<br/>
