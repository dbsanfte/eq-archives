<b>Subject:</b> Re: Lvl 6... Where to go, where to go <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782576185">According to Nat Russo:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Just made it to lvl 6.  I am presently in North Qeynos and wondering where a<br/>
&gt; lvl 6 wiz should go for good hunting.  Any advice as to what I should do at<br/>
&gt; this level?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good areas at your level:<br/>
<br/>
	Blackburrow. If you learn how to avoid the trains, it&#39;s very easy topside<br/>
		till level 8 or so. As a wiz, you&#39;ll hate the deeps, so I sugggest<br/>
		migrating after that.<br/>
	At level 8 or 9, migrate to Misty Thicket. Safe area, guards not far, and<br/>
		good faction. You can level to 11 there, gaining good faction, and<br/>
		maybe the squad ring (a 80hp heal item, which can save your life)<br/>
Put then all the cash required into a magic weapon; dragoon dirk (will be useful<br/>
at all times), runed totem staff, anything.<br/>
	At level 11 or 12, go back to Qeynos area, bind yourself at the docks (if 12),<br/>
		and go to Erud&#39;s Crossing, and hunt wisps. You can go to 13 easily,<br/>
		and make a good stash<br/>
<br/>
Then, it&#39;s time to start broadening your horizons...<br/>
