<div id="ygrps-yiv-453575729">Most wizards are typically into the studies of the<br/>
arcane arts.  They generally have time for no one or<br/>
nothing else.  The only time most wizards venture out<br/>
is to help someone who may have helped them along<br/>
their way to learning more about the magiks in the<br/>
world.  <br/>
<br/>
My wizard was a grey haired middle aged elf.  As you<br/>
know elves are not small little christmas types but<br/>
tall slender race with fair skin and genuinely good<br/>
looking.  He spent most of his days in his order&#39;s<br/>
guild house learning all he could from the old books<br/>
and manuscripts left from Wizards who have passed on. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I suggest reading any of the Dragon Lance series<br/>
(Raistlin is a perfect example of a great wizard) or<br/>
the Lord of the Rings series (Gandalf is another).<br/>
<br/>
Hope it helps,<br/>
<br/>
