&gt; Being a complete newbie, you can imagine that a good portion of my time is<br/>
&gt; spent running toward the nearest guard in Tox forest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, they rarely if ever actually do anything to help me, and I wind up<br/>
&gt; having to zone to make sure that I am safe (from those pesky skeletons that<br/>
&gt; seem to come in pairs).  Is there a trick to getting the guards to take the<br/>
&gt; heat, or are they supposed to do it automatically?  I was under the<br/>
&gt; impression that they were supposed to help automatically.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>
&gt; Olatan<br/>

Generally though, if you are low on life best just zone because the<br/>
guards are slow to react.<br/>
