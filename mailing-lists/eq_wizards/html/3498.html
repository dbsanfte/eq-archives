<div id="ygrps-yiv-1942131300">Create a Dark Elf and find the where the rod is located and learn the path to<br/>
it.  It is in the water, so once you get past a certain point, you jump in the<br/>
water and swim to the rod.  I have never seen any guards in the water around the<br/>
rod.  Once you have the rod, gate out.  Hope to god that invis stays long enough<br/>
to get to the water.  I actually had it wear off in the middle of the city, but<br/>
was lucky enough to find an &#39;out of the way place&#39; to recast it.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
To anyone who has completed the Ice Comet quest, was wondering how the rod that<br/>
is located in Neriak can be obtained if you are not a Dark Elf or evil race.<br/>
Thanks for any hints.<br/>
