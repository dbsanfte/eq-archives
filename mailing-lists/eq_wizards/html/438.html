&gt;  Greetings everyone. I made the choice, long ago, to use a dagger as my<br/>
&gt; melee weapon as opposed to a staff of some sort. Now I am finding that<br/>
&gt; everyone is speaking of magical staves, and never see talk of magical<br/>
&gt; daggers. Would any of you happen to know where I might be able to find<br/>
&gt; myself a runed dagger of some sort?<br/>
&gt; Thanks much for the answers!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW I think a news group version of this list would be a great idea. I like<br/>
&gt; the list alot, but trying to read 100+ messages every morning before I<br/>
&gt; leave for classes kind of sucks.<br/>
