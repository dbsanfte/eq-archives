Subject: [eq_wizards] Tishan&#39;s Kilt<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone gotten the shadowed ball for the kilt yet?  I camped the other<br/>
day with two of my level 40+ friends (warrior and a cleric) and we killed<br/>
shadowed men nonstop (as fast as was possible.  We were constantly waiting<br/>
for them to respawn, and they respawn in about 5 min or so) for about 3<br/>
hours strait and I saw several shadowed patches, eye, fist, mask, book,<br/>
shining stone, and numberless weapons, but no ball.  Is it possible to get<br/>
it or is it super rare??<br/>
