&gt; This is a totally flase rumor.  Damn I wish I could remember the<br/>
article&#92;&#39;s<br/>
&gt; location on this.  A reporter went to lunch with Smedley and the head<br/>
programmer<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; for the mage classes.  he asked asked them this question and they<br/>
confirmed that<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; it was not true, 100% false.  The head caster programmer said that his GM<br/>
&gt; Character had a Staff of Discord, which is the same staff that the Priest<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; Discord is holding.  Now they didn&#92;&#39;t say this was unattainable for us,<br/>
nor that<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; killing the Priest of Discord would render it to us.  So may be that their<br/>
is a<br/>
&gt; quest to get this staff or something, but there is no way to combine the<br/>
two.<br/>
&gt; They said you have to decide do you want the 2h staff and its magic or the<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; skull with a dagger/fang or whatever.  So Brad you are correct :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Any of you Wizards out there know what skull, you need to combine with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; Ruined Totem Staff...and what NPC combines them for you?<br/>

&gt; &gt;    Unless someone can come right out and give exact NPC names and info<br/>
&gt; &gt; right now, assume that combining the rts and the skull is just a rumor.<br/>
As<br/>
&gt; &gt; far as I know, the staff that Priests of Discord carry are actually<br/>
&gt; &gt; _different_ weapons and not a combo of these two items. No one to my<br/>
&gt; &gt; knowledge has actually been able to combine the two though many like to<br/>
&gt; &gt; claim that it is possible.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; where did this rumor even get started?  the skull goes in a melee slot,<br/>
who<br/>
&gt; &gt; thought up putting it on a staff?  the priest of discords staff is<br/>
&gt; &gt; different, it&#92;&#39;s a staff of discord if i&#92;&#39;m not mistaken<br/>
