there are IBS in Guk. You misunderstood and thought he&#39;s talking about<br/>

&gt; They must have changed the quest then, at least the part that surrounds this<br/>
&gt; rod.  When I began the quest, it was shortly after the patch put the quest<br/>
&gt; in place, and the rod in Everfrost was the first one I got.  I just got a<br/>
&gt; druid to cast enduring breath on me, and then I went invis and had<br/>
&gt; absolutely no trouble finding the rod.  I saw the NPC, and my invis did wear<br/>
&gt; off,  but not while I was around him.  The majority of the tunnels down<br/>
&gt; there were totally empty, so I had no trouble refreshing  my invis.  The rod<br/>
&gt; itself was inside a smaller room with a ramp leading in, and was indeed<br/>
&gt; surrounded by 3 ice bone skeletons, all of which conned green to me at level<br/>
&gt; 29 when I went to get the rod.  They see through invis, of course, and<br/>
&gt; attacked the minute I took the rod.  Nevertheless, they were insignificant<br/>
&gt; enough that I had absolutely no trouble gating even with them attempting to<br/>
&gt; hit me.  I figured that this rod was one of the easiest to obtain.  But<br/>
&gt; again, this was right after the quest was put in.  They may have made it<br/>
&gt; more difficult since.<br/>

&gt; &gt; It would be a suicide run, I was down there with a group of 45ish players<br/>
&gt; &gt; when I got my rod.  Very doubtful you could navigate and retain you invis<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the room and back.  Even if you tried to gate out, you would be dead VERY<br/>
&gt; &gt; fast! ;o)  Best choice to is find a higher level friend to help you get<br/>
&gt; down<br/>
&gt; &gt; to it, and I never saw any Ice Bone Skeletons in that area.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have started my quest for the Staff of the Wheel and currently have 8 of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the 10 rods.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am missing the one in Guk and the one from the Everfrost caves. But I<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; a few questions since I have spent no time in Guk in 32 levels.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; GUK<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1. I need to know the easiest or quickest path to the hand room?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2. Is the room on the Live or Dead side?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3. Will I encounter any Undead frogs along the way?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; EVERFROST<br/>
&gt; &gt; I know that the rod is surrounded by 3 IBS and that an NPC is in the area.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; can get by the IBS with Invis to Undead but the NPC could be a problem.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1. Is this NPC within range of the rod?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I will not have a group with me and am only going to attempt this when the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hand room is being camped. I may however try a suicide run depending on<br/>
&gt; how<br/>
&gt; &gt; brave I feel.<br/>
