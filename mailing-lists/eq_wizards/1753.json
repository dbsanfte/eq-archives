Different posts<br/>\naren&#39;t even using the same definition of twinking.  One thing we all agree<br/>\non--there&#39;s nothing we can do about twinking, however you define it.

Twinking is making<br/>\n&gt; someone elses game time more enjoyable for them.  I have a  hard time with<br/>\n&gt; the points everyone is making against this...what IF you had rightfully<br/>\n&gt; earned the items you have, only to be KOS in an area that you have one<br/>\nhell<br/>\n&gt; of a time getting your body from, and you try and try and try as you might<br/>\n&gt; to get your body and items back, and when all told, you have lost 3 or 4<br/>\n&gt; full levels.  This does happen, I have read posts, I have personally lost<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; full level in no time at all because of similar situation.  Yeah I won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; ever worry about it so much again, and probably the people who have lost<br/>\n&gt; multiple levels won&#39;t go there again either...first time for everything<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; hindsight IS 20/20.  So, whats that person going to do if they are accused<br/>\n&gt; of twinking?  Who can say that these folks (other than level 1-6 or so<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; high level stuff) hasn&#39;t earned it and had a turn of REALLY bad luck?  I<br/>\n&gt; would not venture down that path myself.  And what should they do??   Give<br/>\n&gt; up the items they have rightfully earned just because someone else is<br/>\ngoing<br/>\n&gt; to get their panties in a bunch because they don&#39;t think this person<br/>\nshould<br/>\n&gt; have a given item?  Get real.  Twinking is not taking anything away from<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; other gamers, all the items continue to spawn, it isn&#39;t like they appear<br/>\none<br/>\n&gt; time every 3 weeks in the game or just once and never again.  The stuff<br/>\n&gt; still appears.  The guild camping might be a more important topic to argue<br/>\n&gt; rather than the occasional person who has a special item or two.  If<br/>\nsomeone<br/>\n&gt; came up to you and offered to give you a flowing black robe, a runed totem<br/>\n&gt; staff, or something else special because they like you or felt sorry for<br/>\n&gt; your current situation, can you HONESTLY say, without hesitation, and<br/>\n&gt; without being untruthful that you would NOT accept this item because you<br/>\n&gt; would then be guilty of twinking yourself?  Or is it only if you ask<br/>\nsomeone<br/>\n&gt; to get something for you or you have another character that is high level<br/>\n&gt; sharing things with your lower level character...it seems the folks who<br/>\nare<br/>\n&gt; really against this have problems with tripping over themselves when<br/>\n&gt; confronted with real situations.<br/>\n&gt; I think this whole topic is way out of hand and really needs a rest.
