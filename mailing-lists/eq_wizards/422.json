Why not just save some for later?  Or, just skim<br/>\nthrough them and nuke the ones you don&#39;t need.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot only am I on this list, but I&#39;m also on the EQ_Rangers list, the<br/>\nEQMagicians list, the EQRogues list, the EQMonks list, and the<br/>\nEQNecromancers list (I was somewhat undecided as to which class to play at<br/>\nfirst :) ).  Let me tell you... It&#39;s downright *impossible* for me to read<br/>\nall of the messages before I head to work in the morning.  I just let them<br/>\nstack up for later reading.  Most of the time (in fact, all of the time) I<br/>\njust skim the lists to pick out tidbits of information that I can use.  The<br/>\nrest get nuked.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you don&#39;t really have to worry that this method will make you miss some<br/>\nimportant messages, either.
