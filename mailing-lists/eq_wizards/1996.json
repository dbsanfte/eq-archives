Hopefully this will<br/>\n&gt;get us closer to bring this to a conclusion.  I left the majority of the<br/>\n&gt;spells out only because I really feel that we as a group will never come<br/>\n&gt;to an agreement on them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Malkin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Start Letter-----<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Dear EverQuest Staff,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We are a large group of wizards who have come together through a mailing<br/>\n&gt;list. Through much discussion and debate, we have agreed to send you<br/>\n&gt;this feedback concerning improvements to the wizard. We would like to<br/>\n&gt;thank you in advance for your careful consideration of these<br/>\n&gt;modifications.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1) Spells are 100% resisted by mobs 6+ levels above the caster. In large<br/>\n&gt;groups hunting big prey this level cap turns a wizard from the main<br/>\n&gt;dealer of damage to a useless member in the group. Our suggestion is<br/>\n&gt;that either the cap be raised to 6+ levels of the highest member in the<br/>\n&gt;group, or the cap be raised to 8+ levels higher than the caster.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2) Spells that both stun and damage targets are often resisted by mobs<br/>\n&gt;that /con green and blue. If this is the result of the stun effect, we<br/>\n&gt;would like one spell without this effect at the same level.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;3) Many spell suggestions have crossed this list. Here is one that we<br/>\n&gt;all feel would be a great addition.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tap Affinity - Teleport targeted group member to their own bind spot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;4) O&#39;Kiels Radiation seems that it would be the beginning of a great<br/>\n&gt;line of spells. Why should it end there? Cold and Magic based<br/>\n&gt;buffs/shields would be a very welcome addition.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;5) Wizards seem to be very neglected when it comes to carrying or<br/>\n&gt;wearing items that enhance our appearance. Also, many completely<br/>\n&gt;different spells have the same visual effects.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We would like to thank you again for your time. Any type of feedback<br/>\n&gt;would be greatly appriciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sincerely,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The Wizards of Norrath<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;What was YOUR favorite part?!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Tell other Star Wars fans at ONElist! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
