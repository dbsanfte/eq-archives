Right now I&#39;m lvl 12 with 57 practice points saved, and all the skills I use are maxed out, you can get them up a lot easier by just buying a cheap spell that doesn&#39;t cost much mana and just casting like crazy until the skill is maxed.<br/>\n    ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n    From: James <br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n    Sent: Sunday, April 26, 1998 9:13 PM<br/>\n    Subject: [eq_wizards] training points and spell research<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    I&#39;m currently level 6 and have only used one of my training points to train in meditation. I assume that once I hit a certain level I&#39;ll realize what&#39;s lacking and then train alot in that, but any suggestions would be helpful. I was also saving up for spell research. Is spell research a skill that goes up quickly? Also, what does raising the spell research skill improve? All help is appreciated. Thanks, Lott. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
