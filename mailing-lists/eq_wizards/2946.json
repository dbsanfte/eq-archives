I am finding that I cant get<br/>\n&gt; all the ruins I need to make each levels spells. I know you all have that<br/>\n&gt; problem. Was wondering if any one know&#39;s some one on the Innourkk server<br/>\n&gt; that sells spells?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s RUNES first of all. And second of all, I&#39;m level 25 and I already<br/>\nhave all my runes for all my 29 spells (doubles in most cases, in case I<br/>\nfail) and many runes for 34 and 39. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow? <br/>\n<br/>\nI just have a hot button that auctions that I&#39;m buying runes and I click<br/>\nit every time I enter a zone and every 10 minutes or so later as I stay<br/>\nin the zone. All these runes I got from high levels who have tons of<br/>\nthem and just want to get rid of them. I usually traded or bought most.<br/>\n<br/>\nA good idea about research is to put all points possible each level into<br/>\nit. Personally, I&#39;ve made all possible spells, some twice, and I&#39;ve only<br/>\nfailed twice, maybe three times. Each time you try there is a chance<br/>\nyour skill will go up too.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nSergey<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\nKPS, PUNK (Paramilitary Undercover Nuclear Kamikaze)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
