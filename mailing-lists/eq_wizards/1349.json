Although it is our spell and we may know everything about it, we do<br/>\nnot know everything about the monster we are casting it on.  We don&#39;t know<br/>\nwhat kind of resistances he has, we don&#39;t know how much willpower or mental<br/>\nstrength he has, etc.  Because of this, I think it makes sense that we not<br/>\nknow exactly how long it will last.<br/>\n <br/>\nSome notes on Shadow step and Fade:  1.  Fade sucks.  I can only hope that<br/>\nothers have had better luck with it than I, but Fade has never put me more<br/>\nthan 5 feet from where I was when casted in combat.  Casted out of combat it<br/>\nusually takes me a good distance, but in combat it has never been useful.<br/>\nShadow step is a lot better.  It takes you a much farther distance and seems<br/>\nto work in combat better as well.  I have found (can anyone confirm this)<br/>\nthat fade and shadow step *usually* will teleport you more or less in the<br/>\ndirection that you are facing, but will sometimes be to one side or the<br/>\nother.  I have almost never seen a time when they will teleport you behind<br/>\nwhere you already are.  I keep shadow step and gate memorized right next to<br/>\neach other most of the time, but in a dungeon shadow step loses its<br/>\nusefullness and i will replace it with something else.<br/>\n <br/>\nO&#39;keils radiation does pretty much suck.  I don&#39;t understand why it was<br/>\ngiven to us because we don&#39;t (to my knowledge) get any other damage shields,<br/>\nso it is not like a series of spells or anything like it should be.  I still<br/>\nuse it a little at level 10 (and I think it does 3 damage now, not 2) to<br/>\nhelp our tank out a little, but I think by level 12 or 16 it will be out of<br/>\nmy repertoire.<br/>\n <br/>\nI wish we did get more buffs for groups (that are in line with the wizard<br/>\ntheme), such as raising magic resistance or a better damage shield (I<br/>\nremember some MUDs that had a sweet high level wiz spell called fireshield<br/>\nthat would do THE AMOUNT of damage inflicted on the player back to the mob<br/>\nwith each hit.  Probably a bit overpowered for EQ though :)<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway.. these are my thoughts.<br/>\n <br/>\n-Solric</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
