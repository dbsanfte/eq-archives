Being the case where there","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1465705966\">Well, this is my observation (anybody correct me if I&#39;m wrong):<br/>\n<br/>\nMobs will zero in on the party member that initiates the first hit.  Being <br/>\nthe case where there is one tank pulling, the entire train will usually keep <br/>\nto that one member.  The rest of the train will keep to that tank unless <br/>\nthey are attacked by another member...so it&#39;s often important to use Assist <br/>\nover and over again to validate the MoB your tank is pursuing.  In a <br/>\ncontrolled group, the scenario should be that everybody need only <br/>\nconcentrate on the tank&#39;s HP to do any healing or decision to run.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssuming it&#39;s a free for all party it&#39;s hard to say.  I would assume that a <br/>\nMoB would then target the player with the worst faction.  In a case where <br/>\neverybody has a creature to worry about, it would be the best idea to ask <br/>\nyour tanks to help free you up first so that you can then cast uninterrupted <br/>\nto finish up the battle.  If not possible, I usually try to let my tanks <br/>\nknow that I am occupied...decisions can then be made for everybody to run.  <br/>\nIt then becomes a question of whether the tanks feel confident enough to <br/>\nclean up the train of MoBs. I&#39;ve been in situations where we&#39;ve left a <br/>\nbattle even though I have found myself with nearly 80% mana left...shame it <br/>\nwas wasted, but we lived to fight another day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure about creature intelligence.  So far, the MoBs I&#39;ve encountered <br/>\nall seem to share the same reaction as described above...only difference is <br/>\nusually the size of the trains and/or their bravery. I say bravery only in a <br/>\nsense where some areas like Unrest greens will decide to attack you just on <br/>\na whim.... in a case where you are busy taking on a tomb...it becomes a BIG <br/>\nproblem when a group of small little green beetles decide they want in on <br/>\nthe battle.  :)<br/>\nAnybody have bug spray?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Hypothetical situation:<br/>\n&gt;What happens if you&#39;re in a train situation, a party of 6 players &gt;being<br/>\n&gt;chased by 15+ critters and the party decides to scatter?  If everyone <br/>\n&gt; &gt;stays<br/>\n&gt;together you end up with one group of players leading one group of<br/>\n&gt;critters, but if they scatter...<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Does the train follow one poor bastard?  Does the train split up to &gt;follow<br/>\n&gt;each individual?  Does creature intelligence play a part in this?  &gt;I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt;very<br/>\n&gt;curious about this, as it may change the survival rate of the group<br/>\n&gt;drastically.  If no one has tried it, I&#39;ll try to test it out with a &gt;group<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and a truckload of greens outside Felwithe or something.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
