Sad Story: My formerly 12th level wizard went","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-361997550\">This is a long e-mail because I didn&#39;t want to send a bunch of e-mails.<br/>\nPlease do read the whole e-mail though.<br/>\n<br/>\nSad Story:<br/>\nMy formerly 12th level wizard went into the Minotaur cave in the Steamfont<br/>\nMountains.  We decided to explore.  THIS WAS A VERY BAD IDEA.  Some type of<br/>\nmind warp to over me and I ran right to Meridith (or whatever his name is)<br/>\nand 3 minotaur guards.  But I did not die.  I got stuck in a wall and could<br/>\nnot run out or gate out.  I filed a petition and while I was waiting I tried<br/>\nto fill out a bug report.  But that crashed the game -- power off.  When I<br/>\nlog back on I drop right in front of Meridith and the guards (BAM, BAM,<br/>\nDEAD).  Probably would have had better luck from a guard.  Anyway after 3<br/>\nmore deaths and some help from an enchanter&#39;s invisibility, my friend and I<br/>\ngot our stuff back -- the other members of the party ran.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion 1:<br/>\nHas anybody killed this guy and what level were you, etc. etc.?<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion 2:<br/>\nIs magic resistance used to resist the mind warp?<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion 3:<br/>\nWhen I was still 12th level I cast Bind on myself and my friend.  I got a<br/>\nmessage that I feel bound to the area (or something like that).  My friend<br/>\ndid not.  I cast it on him 4 times and he did not get that message.  I tried<br/>\nto cast it by the gnome city if that matters.  The only message that I got<br/>\nwas that I had started to cast a spell.  When we died, I appeared near the<br/>\ngnome city and he had a much longer walk.  It appears that the bind did not<br/>\nwork for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother Story:<br/>\nI have mostly been fighting in Crushbone, so my standing with the orcs<br/>\nreally sucks.  Sometimes a legionaire or slaver will attack me without me<br/>\nattacking them and the &quot;tanks&quot; have been totally unable to pull them off<br/>\nwhile I am standing and trying to move away.  I don&#39;t think that the &quot;tanks&quot;<br/>\nare at the top of the orcs most wanted list like I am.  If it matters, I<br/>\nhelped kill Crush with a large party.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion 4:<br/>\nHas anybody else experienced this?  Any ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\n****Spoiler****<br/>\nI have figured out what to do with some of the shackle keys that you get off<br/>\nof the slavers in CrushBone.  Each number corresponds to a specific race/sex<br/>\ncombination.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are the combinations that I know:<br/>\nMale Dwarf 16<br/>\nFemale Dwarf 17<br/>\nMale Wood Elf 18<br/>\nFemale Wood Elf 19<br/>\nMale High Elf 20<br/>\nFemale High Elf 21<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion 5:<br/>\nWhat do the other keys do?  So far I know that I have also gotten shackle<br/>\nkeys #15, 23 and 24.  I have not seen any halflings or gnomes, but have<br/>\nheard reports of them.  If you know who to give these keys to or where the<br/>\nother slaves might be (I have not gone in the castle), please reply to the<br/>\ngroup with the answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaugh<br/>\nHas anybody noticed that it is empOREr cruch and not empEROr crush.  The<br/>\nstupid orcs hail empOREr crush to.  I turned that in as a bug.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest Regards<br/>\nMark Mazurik<br/>\nOwner of Mazurik, 11th level wizard (sigh)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
