Froglok Foragers and<br/>\nKobold Hunters carry woven armor.  I managed to get a full set of woven<br/>\narmor (after some trading) by just killing Foragers and Hunters in the Innothule<br/>\n<br/>\nSwamp area.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;there who can give me some advice on what and where to hunt in Guk or<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you go into Guk stay to the first three rooms. do NOT venture past the<br/>\n&gt; circular wooden bridge. You will only die, and it&#39;s a long and dangerous run<br/>\n&gt; from freeport to reclaim your corpse. My troll warrior is level 8 and<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t go past those areas. Also watch out for trains. If there&#39;s a troll<br/>\n&gt; in the tunnel you won&#39;t be able to get by. Sometimes jumping works,<br/>\n&gt; sometimes not. Hopefully it&#39;ll work for you !<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would agree with this, don&#39;t go past the bridge.<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                                    Soren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Zalbar<br/>\n&gt; 20th Wizard<br/>\n&gt; Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; How many communities do you think join ONElist each day?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; More than 1,000!
