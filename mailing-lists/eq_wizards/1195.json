I don&#39;t ever charge anyone for a bind or <br/>\nanything else I can do for them.  In fact, I have helped a few newbies to <br/>\nthe tune of a full plat so they can buy spells when they aren&#39;t getting <br/>\nanywhere in the game.  I want other people to enjoy their time as much as I <br/>\nenjoy mine.  I find when I give, I get more back in return than I could <br/>\nreceive charging for my help.  There are always people who will try to give <br/>\nme things or money for these services, but I politely refuse and just tell <br/>\nthem to keep me in mind if they ever come across me in a time of real <br/>\nneed...i.e. getting whacked to death with 3 red fire ele&#39;s on my butt in <br/>\nLavastorm.. or something of the likes... I can receive help from people who <br/>\nremember me helping them at some point.  I would much prefer people to give <br/>\nof themselves because I have showed them kindness, not because of a prior <br/>\narranged obligation to pay for my services.  If I were making armor or <br/>\njewelry etc.. it would be different.<br/>\nTo the same tune, if someone feels OK charging for their skills then so be <br/>\nit.  I can&#39;t do it myself.  That is the difference between people, some <br/>\nfeel okay with it and others don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 03:16 PM 5/11/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Marziani, Michael D.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Marziani@...\">Michael.Marziani@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Disclaimer: this is only my opinion so no flames please.  I am only hoping<br/>\n&gt;to elicit some other opinions on this subject as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t know why but it has never made sense to me to charge for services<br/>\n&gt;such as binding, invis, and language training.  Perhaps it is just the<br/>\n&gt;personality of my character that he enjoys helping others and gets full<br/>\n&gt;satisfaction out of the good deed itself, not needing any sort of physical<br/>\n&gt;compensation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I realize that I will be able to make make up to a plat or more each per<br/>\n&gt;bind and a plat or more for invis (depending on how bad they want it) but<br/>\n&gt;that just seems unkind.  I remember when I was level 8 just travelling over<br/>\n&gt;to freeport.  I only had a couple of my new 3rd circle spells because they<br/>\n&gt;were so expensive and I was flat broke.  I saw people auctioning: &quot;Binding<br/>\n&gt;at S. Gate, 15gp&quot;, and there was no way i could afford that without selling<br/>\n&gt;the few pieces of cloth armor i had left.  I was lucky to find a kind druid<br/>\n&gt;that bound me and asked for nothing in return, but I just wonder why so many<br/>\n&gt;seek to earn a profit from their abilities rather than just use them to help<br/>\n&gt;others and take joy in that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I guess it is just based on your roleplaying style, but even if I have no<br/>\n&gt;money and still have spells to buy, I would not ask for or accept any sort<br/>\n&gt;of payment for using my talents.  Does anyone else agree with me or do you<br/>\n&gt;all think that you SHOULD rightfully earn a profit from using your skills?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Solric<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Ken Morris [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kmorris2@...\">kmorris2@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Tuesday, May 11, 1999 2:30 PM<br/>\n&gt;To: EQ Wizards<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eq_wizards] Languages<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am excellent in Dragon, Combine, Old Eurdian, Elder Elvish, and am working<br/>\n&gt;on Elder Tier&#39;Dal today.
