Enstill and Titan Clash come to mind, DD spell does some stunning, plus I still got my old Root and Nukes.  The new DD gets resisted A LOT, possibly because of its dual effects, damage & stun.  Would appreciate any insights/combo strategies, especially ones that concentrate on Titan Clash, Enstill, Root, etc etc.  Seems to me\r<br/>\nthat Titan Clash could be pretty useful against\r<br/>\nenemy casters, since it interrupts them.  Oh well, post your experiences.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThank you for you help.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAnglagard Level 20 Dark Elf in Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
