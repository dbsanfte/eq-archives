We cleared most of the second level where the<br/>\nhuman skeleton is, but he was not up.  Is there a way to get him to<br/>\nspawn?  Is there a placeholder?  Was kind of frustrating to finally make<br/>\nit in that far and then he is not even there.  I even had someone in FV<br/>\nrestart the quest to see if that would make him spawn, but it did not<br/>\nwork.  Any suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, regarding the buffed Lord.  There are actually two different Lords<br/>\nthat can spawn when you kill the Reavers.  One is similar to a Reaver<br/>\n(100% magic resistant and did not cast) and the other is very nasty,<br/>\nwiped out the whole group in about 20 seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoren<br/>\nThe Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
