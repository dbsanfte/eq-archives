I have int 150 and<br/>\n+70 mana in items lv 21. my tactic was Cast titan clash to stum cast a<br/>\nforce shock to do damage and then ROOT guy. cast flame shock, flame shock<br/>\n(root if necesary) force shock, and finish it with a flames. It was dead<br/>\ntime betwen two force shocks that i have time to cast in midle 2 flame<br/>\nshocks and i have to wait a bit before start casting a force shock.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I can nearly cast 2 force shocks one after another. i use force, flame<br/>\nforce now and it is much faster damage delivery !!<br/>\n<br/>\nBad thing is that when i soloed this birds a 17 lv enchanter was near me<br/>\nand he soloed them too ! ! He used all mana it is true and was with int 165<br/>\nand some mana items but i can say he was KILLING same guys as i 21 lv wiz i<br/>\nwas feel pissed a little.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny idea how to make my casting serie more eficent in mana or time consuming?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSilverion Dragonirder<br/>\n<br/>\nHigh elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\nFenin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\nmoderator mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
