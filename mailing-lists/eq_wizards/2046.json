I agree wizards should actually be a total wimp up to <br/>\nlvl 20 in my opinion.  After that the wizard should dominate.  I mean no one <br/>\ncan come close to touching him by lvl 40.  I mean it should be the toughest <br/>\nclass to play to lvl 20 so to weed out the week and unwilling.  but the thing <br/>\nis it is still even up to from what i&#39;ve heard at lvl 35.  people still dont <br/>\nreally appreciate the wizard because all the classes do the same or more even <br/>\nthough the wizard is supposed to deliver the most damage.  What&#39;s the point <br/>\nof playeing the most powerful person in the game if he is even with everyone <br/>\nelse.  I mean these people that created the game are supposed to be D&D fans <br/>\nand MUD fans.  What happens to your lvl 1 wiz in D&D, he dies about 1,000,000 <br/>\nit seems like.  But when he reaches around lvl 9 hardly anyone can touch him. <br/>\n This is how i think it should be in EQ.  Just my little rant on why people <br/>\nwant more spells and more power.  sorry if it&#39;s to long.<br/>\n<br/>\nParthon lvl 12</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
