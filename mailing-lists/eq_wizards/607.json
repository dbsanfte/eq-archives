Also... another thing that is misleading...  is the fact that Verant was limited to a certain amount of lines in that bar of experience graphic.  So..  sometimes it takes another (for example purposes only) 100 exp to make the next little yellow sliver of exp to show.  So.. lets say that one person has 95 experience already put towards getting that next &#39;sliver&#39; of yellow to show..  and the other person only has 10 towards it.  they fight something.. and get 10 experience each.  The first person moves passed the 100 mark and his next yellow sliver of experience shows, and the second person has to wait a few more fights to get there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion would be to get a couple people who are the same level...   only group with people your level...    then go fight a &#39;bunch&#39; of things...   enough for a couple bubbles.  You&#39;ll find that you all gain about the same ammount of bubbles.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust MHO.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrev<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tChris Trubiani[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:u1607755@...\">u1607755@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tMonday, April 26, 1999 9:05 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[eq_wizards] Re: Exp gain while in parties.....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Chris Trubiani&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:u1607755@...\">u1607755@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, actually that is impossible.  When you&#39;re in a group everybody in the<br/>\n&gt; group will have their bar move the exact same amount.  The difference is<br/>\n&gt; that for the bar to move that much for the higher lvl characters they need<br/>\n&gt; more exp.  That&#39;s how the steal xp from the lower guys in a group.  Btw, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; not accusing everyone in your group of lying.  But sometimes it can be very<br/>\n&gt; hard to track your xp bar precisely.. it&#39;s very possible the differences in<br/>\n&gt; exp bar movement everyone saw happened because of a little impreciseness,<br/>\n&gt; some rounding, ect, ect...<br/>\n&gt; Another reason why groups are worth it because of solo, is that you don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have as much downtime.. you can fight, fight.. rest a bit fight... and so<br/>\n&gt; on.. whereas soloing sometimes your downtime won&#39;t be big, and others it<br/>\n&gt; will be intermanibly long.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tandayen, Dark Elf Wizard<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
