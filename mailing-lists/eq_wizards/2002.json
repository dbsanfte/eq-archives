At higher levels spells go up to 9 and 10 platinum a piece.<br/>\nI&#39;m already saving up for my level 20 spells (need 60 plat I think).<br/>\nI like the idea of having all spells just because I like to tinker<br/>\nwith them and see how they work.  I skipped the spell Eye of Zomm when<br/>\nI reached that level but now I&#39;m planning to buy it anyway to raise<br/>\nthat particular skill.  Also, someone told me it can be used to open<br/>\nlocked door in Befallen, which is a neat trick!<br/>\n<br/>\nAznyin<br/>\nLevel 17 Erudite Wizard<br/>\nChivalric Order of Norrath<br/>\nCurrent Residence: Rivervale [Solusek Ro]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
