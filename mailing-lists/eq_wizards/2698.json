Things have been slowing<br/>\n&gt;down for good &#39;ol LimDul lately and I&#39;m looking around for something else<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;do besides all the senseless killing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sometimes I wish Verant had more items for us to find...we all know the<br/>\n&gt;items everyone wants (ie.  Observer Robe/Staff, Shimmering Orb, etc)  Too<br/>\n&gt;bad there weren&#39;t enough variety of items so that we don&#39;t have to all camp<br/>\n&gt;for the same things.  Imagine if there were several different varieties of<br/>\n&gt;Observer robes or Different colors of Orbs? Maybe just adjust the stats<br/>\n </span></blockquote>just<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;a fraction to allow for different combinations.  It&#39;s a shame everyone has<br/>\n&gt;to keep butting heads looking for the same things....only to find you look<br/>\n&gt;like everyone else once you get it.  :(  I would think the above types of<br/>\n&gt;changes wouldn&#39;t drastically be difficult under the current game<br/>\n&gt;engine...nor would they ruin game balance...or would they?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I can see their rationale in limiting &quot;rare&quot; items to only 1 NPC.  But<br/>\n&gt;placed in the perspective of 1500 on a server, that poor NPC is typically<br/>\n&gt;going to be camped by everyone who wants that item.  It would be nice to<br/>\n&gt;provide other items that one might choose that would work in lieu of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>camping<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;for days for an item.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;*sigh*  Just dreaming to myself. ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n&gt;Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Congratulations MilitaryEFM.
