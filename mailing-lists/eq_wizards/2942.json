If casted &gt;in<br/>\n&gt;right moment it will not make them agresive and i will do much more &gt;damage<br/>\n&gt;then using only DD spels.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks for the tips.  Question....I would assume you&#39;d need to have your <br/>\ngroup attack each of the Mobs to get their attention eh?  I would assume any <br/>\nMobs that have not been attacked would suddenly turn aggro on you if you <br/>\nsuddenly dropped balls of flame on their heads?  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Pulling with eye... Eye is nice thing to pull a mobs first they don  &gt;get<br/>\n&gt;agresive to it until it is realy near. and when they hit you can pull &gt;only<br/>\n&gt;this room of monsters as target is already killed and they go after a<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll give this tactic a try.  Do you just let them kill the eyeball and wait <br/>\nfor them to find you?<br/>\n<br/>\nFinal unrelated question:  I know this has been covered before, but I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to dig through hundreds of digests. :)  How do I find my way around the <br/>\nCazic maze from our teleport pyramid?  How do I get to the courtyard?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
