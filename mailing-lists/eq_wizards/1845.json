(by 3 people over shout no less)  If that is the opinion of the<br/>\nmajority of the populace in a game that is suppose to be group only, then I<br/>\nsay we need something to make us more valuable...&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure who was laughing or for what reason but rest assured that<br/>\nwizards have no problems finding a group. I can&#39;t count the times that my<br/>\ngroup(I have a few people I constantly group with) will not pull critters<br/>\nwhile I am AFK, they recognize that I do most of the damage in a big fight<br/>\nand they have died without my help many times. I think the problem is that<br/>\nat your level people tend to think that any of the other spell casters are<br/>\njust as good as you(or better because they can buff) but what they don&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand is that you are the supreme damage dealer. You can and will make<br/>\nthe difference in a lot of fights. You need to find people who understand<br/>\nwhat a wizard is meant to do and those that appreciate what you bring to a<br/>\ngroup. Keep looking because those people are out there and they become much<br/>\nmore prevalent at levels 16 and up.<br/>\n<br/>\nYours,<br/>\n~Aereuss Ravins of Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
