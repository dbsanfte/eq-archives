I&#39;ve always had at least 2 characters in whichever <br/>\nonline RPG I ventured to.  My rpg roots are in Neverwinter Nights.  I have <br/>\ncharacters in 2 guilds and those 2 characters have followed me to each game <br/>\nI&#39;ve gone to after the cataclysm destroyed that world.  Therefore I almost <br/>\nalways level slower than others around me because I try to devote equal time to <br/>\nthe two guilds.  I look for others around my level and can almost always find <br/>\nsomeone to hunt with.  Take heart...there are others out there like you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIggie<br/>\nGnome Wizard<br/>\nCazic Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
