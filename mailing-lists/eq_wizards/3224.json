Yeah, I just went back and got those recently.  I was essentially a <br/>\nrat exterminator for a couple days.  :)  The thing that&#39;s irritating about <br/>\nthis quest is that you have to wait for 3 random things:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Cubert doesn&#39;t spawn all the time<br/>\n2) He doesn&#39;t always carry the quest item<br/>\n3) When you bring the item to the NPC..he doesn&#39;t always give you the <br/>\nearring.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow irritating is that?  Is this supposed to be fun? ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
