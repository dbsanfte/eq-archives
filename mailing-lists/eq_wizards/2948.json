Personally, I&#39;ve made all possible spells, some<br/>\n&gt; twice, and I&#39;ve only<br/>\n&gt; failed twice, maybe three times. Each time you try<br/>\n&gt; there is a chance<br/>\n&gt; your skill will go up too.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; Sergey<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; KPS, PUNK (Paramilitary Undercover Nuclear Kamikaze)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Couple of quick (I hope) questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was planning on putting all my training points at every level<br/>\n(post-20) into Research. Should I do this as soon as I level, or wait<br/>\nuntil just before I level (in case I get a couple of Runes to try which<br/>\naren&#39;t yet trivial during the level)? <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard there&#39;s a 5 point per level cap...if I happen to miss a<br/>\nlevel, and not make it to a guild hall, can I put in 10 next level? <br/>\n<br/>\nCan I top the 5 point cap by actually doing Research (since there&#39;s a<br/>\nchance it goes up every time I try to combine runes), or is that a cap<br/>\nbased on my level, like most skills?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, okay, that was three instead of two. I think the sun in Oasis is<br/>\ngetting to me...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nBid and sell for free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
