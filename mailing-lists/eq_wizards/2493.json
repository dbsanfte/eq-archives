I am a lvl 34 wizard, I have purchased most of my spells from Erudin<br/>\n&gt;&gt;and Felthiwe (sp?). But my post was NOT just aimed at wizards, but magic<br/>\n&gt;&gt;users in general. If they made all the &quot;run of the mill basic spells to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;their class&quot; buyable. Such as<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;- the necromancers pet<br/>\n&gt;&gt;- high lvl DD spells for magi and wizards<br/>\n&gt;&gt;- the &quot;basic&quot; enchanter spells (no clue what they are)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;- magicians pets (arnt those buyable now anyways?)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;But leave the more interesting spells up for research only, and more<br/>\n&gt;&gt;powerfull varaints of spells research only.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Research SHOULD be something that is fun and adds to the game enviroment,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;not a distracting pain in the ass that makes you wish you were a wis-based<br/>\n&gt;&gt;caster since you could just buy all your spells.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Also the suggestion about being able to &quot;Dig Up&quot; runes is to provide us<br/>\n </span></blockquote>with<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;something to do BESIDES KILL THINGS .
