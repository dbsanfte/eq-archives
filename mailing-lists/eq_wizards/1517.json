I<br/>\nput my 5 extra points into this at character creation (into an already<br/>\ndexterous gnome), and at level 8 it seems to be making a slight difference.<br/>\nI&#39;ve talked to Euridites my level who regain concentration 1 or 2 times a<br/>\nnight, whereas I&#39;ll regain concentration 5 or 6 times on average.  Mostly<br/>\nthese recoveries aren&#39;t occuring in battle, but when I cast to quickly after<br/>\nrunning.  Overall I&#39;m very happy with the points spent in dexterity and I&#39;m<br/>\neven thinking about blowing some cash on derv rings to improve it more (at<br/>\nleast until those +int items come along)<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy Hunting<br/>\nMalkin The Soon to be Tinkering Gnome</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
