In<br/>\n&gt; addition to my wizard I also I have a 19 level troll warrior that I play a<br/>\n&gt; lot.  Being a troll I tend to hang out quite a bit at Guk.  Of all of the<br/>\n&gt; mage types I prefer to group with wizards while in guk for two reasons.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         1 - The Frogloks in Guk tend to be pretty fast runners sometimes I even<br/>\n&gt; encounter ones that have SOW cast on them.  Whenever the frogloks start to<br/>\n&gt; run you have to either get it rooted, kill it, or be prepared for a possible<br/>\n&gt; train.  I have found that wizards are the most effective at stopping the<br/>\n&gt; frogs in their tracks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         2 - Having a pet while in Guk can be very dangerous.  I have seen numerous<br/>\n&gt; Necromancers bit the bullet because somehow (Lag, Not paying attention,<br/>\n&gt; .etc) their pet took off after a Froglok running into the depths of Guk<br/>\n&gt; thereby causing a train.  Wizards don&#39;t really have this problem since they<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t have pets :).  Of course the other mage types can just not use pets<br/>\n&gt; while in Guk ,but they tend to not be as effective when they don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; their pets.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The above reasons might not hold for other dungeons ,but in Guk I much<br/>\n&gt; prefer to group with Wizards over all other mage types.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Gene<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; BTW most of the mage types that I have grouped with have been in the 17 - 22<br/>\n&gt; level mosly Necromancers and  Wizards.  Just a few Enchanters and Magicians.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Marziani, Michael D.

I do know that we will be highly useful to a group once we get our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; escape and portal spells.  I am pretty sure that any high level group will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have a cleric (to cast group divine aura) along with a wizard (to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cast group<br/>\n&gt; &gt; teleport) in sticky situations.<br/>\n&gt; ...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
