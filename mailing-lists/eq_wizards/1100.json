Wizard spells work a different way then other casters.  The other<br/>\ncasters (I&#39;m not sure if magicians are included in this) either do full dmg<br/>\nor no dmg.  Wizards have there dmg vary over a range.  This may seem  bad to<br/>\nyou now, but it&#39;s not.  Wizard spells get completely resisted less than<br/>\nother caster spells.  So when you&#39;re doing 40 dmg (on a 83 dmg spell), but<br/>\neveryone else is getting completely resisted you won&#39;t feel so useless.<br/>\nBTW, Necro life draining spells are impossible to resist, it will do the<br/>\nsame amount of dmg every single time he casts it no matter what.<br/>\n<br/>\nTandayen, Dark Elf Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Rivi�re St�phane &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Stephane.Riviere@...\">Stephane.Riviere@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Friday, May 07, 1999 5:29 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Please help me :(<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: =?iso-8859-1?Q?Rivi=E8re_St=E9phane?= &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Stephane.Riviere@...\">Stephane.Riviere@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi all,<br/>\n&gt;so i get some questions for hard gamers :)<br/>\n&gt;1. First i am a fan of quest :). But in freeport, the arcan scientist don t<br/>\n&gt;want to give me any quest :(. I know that i must raise my faction if i want<br/>\n&gt;to make quests for them but how ???? Killing deathfist centurion and so<br/>\n&gt;raise faction with commond resident. Are the scientist residents ? If i can<br/>\n&gt;not do any quest for them then how to raise my faction with them ? What the<br/>\n&gt;monsters who raise faction with scientist ?<br/>\n&gt;2. Second, a wizzard is useles vs red monsters... Yesterday i was fighting<br/>\n&gt;with 3 friend same level as me orc warrior from blue ro red. For the blue,<br/>\n&gt;np. But for the white yellow and red don t even try with a caster group..<br/>\n&gt;Why ? Normally shock of lightening can do 82 dommage... In three hours<br/>\n&gt;fighting with orc, 3 or 4 times i do 82 hp dommage... But usually i do 12,<br/>\n&gt;14 , 4 or whatever but not the max... I have tried fire spel, ice spel,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>same<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;they don t resist the whole dommage but they resist very well.. So i go<br/>\n&gt;fighting crocodile.. Deep water croco.. Considering red.... and same : i<br/>\n&gt;nearly never do max dommage (nearly never the half dommage in fact sigh :(<br/>\n&gt;). I can understand that if they are red i need a level 16 spel to hurt<br/>\n </span></blockquote>them<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;bad (i am currently 15) but that s really stupid.. If i try to kill red<br/>\n </span></blockquote>with<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;friends and that i dont  dommage the monsters i am useless vs red creatures<br/>\n&gt;cause my spels are resisted !! In others words, you must kill blue<br/>\n </span></blockquote>creatures<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;to be sure you do the max dommage... But one of my friend is necro level<br/>\n&gt;15... And you know what ? HE ALWAYS do the max dommage he can handle... ok<br/>\n&gt;it s only 42 for the attack spel but he always do 42, same for war undead<br/>\n&gt;always the max !!!! i regret that with these fact a wizzard can nearly not<br/>\n&gt;kill more then blue creatures... By the way, i have killed some days ago a<br/>\n&gt;dervish thug alone cons. yellow for me.. And all my spel were working at<br/>\n&gt;max... Any idea ? it s just a question of magic resist ? Why the necro spel<br/>\n&gt;does always max dommage ? (and are never never resisted at all ! Heat<br/>\n </span></blockquote>blood,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;war undead life tap and so ! )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks for all the help !<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;yakos<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;level 15<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;p.s. thanks for all the guys who tell me where the spel in freeport was :)<br/>\n&gt;in fact i just don t see the stairs to upper level :) thanks again :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Congratulations to TOWERSHIGH, our latest ONElist of the Week.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Visit our homepage and share with us how ONElist is changing YOUR life! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
