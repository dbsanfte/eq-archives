I have dueled at my level and I seem to always win.  I would not want to tackle any level higher than me as my spells might get resisted and than I would be in real trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nValacian - 22nd Level Erudite Wizard, Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tSimon Hinshelwood [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:iktome@...\">iktome@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tThursday, May 13, 1999 4:26 PM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\tRe: [eq_wizards] Ice Comet<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Simon Hinshelwood &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:iktome@...\">iktome@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDear Valacian,<br/>\n<br/>\nGood answer. But are you prepared to put it to the test as an experiment? (serious question) I think<br/>\nsomeone of your level would be appropriate to test the wizards power, or lack of it. Would you be<br/>\nable to cast any spells while he hits you on the head? It&#39;s all well and good doing 1100 damage with<br/>\nan Ice Comet but how long would it take to cast.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS Well done getting to 22nd level, your right it has to be VERY HARD for us until we reach high<br/>\nlevels.<br/>\n<br/>\nValacian wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I would be MORE than happy to enter an Arena with a duel wield barabrian at the same level as me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Valacian - 22nd Level Erudite Wizard, Xegony<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:   Simon Hinshelwood [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:iktome@...\">iktome@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:   Thursday, May 13, 1999 3:54 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:        Re: [eq_wizards] Ice Comet<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Simon Hinshelwood &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:iktome@...\">iktome@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well said Jay. Parties cant be bothered with wizards, they cant buff, cant heal<br/>\n&gt; and cant really help parties that much...&quot;we were supposed to be heavy<br/>\n&gt; artillery&quot; but that just is not correct. I think a wizard would be most parties<br/>\n&gt; last choice if they could choose from all the classes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Its very easy to demonstrate the wizard immbalance; get into an arena with a<br/>\n&gt; dual wield barbarian warrior of the same level and see how you do!<br/>\n&gt; Hmm doesn&#39;t sound too promising eh?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have always played a wizard character class in AD&D and UO but I regret<br/>\n&gt; playing one in EQ. I think EQ were nervous about the power wizards in UO and<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t want to unbalance the game. I think they swung the pendalum too far the<br/>\n&gt; other way. Root &#39;n&#39; Shoot, if that fails death, thats about it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hopefully e-mails will pour in and tell me how wrong I am. Great, show me its<br/>\n&gt; not the case so I feel I have a character with a future!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Simon<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  bringing the world together.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Part 1.2    Type: application/ms-tnef<br/>\n&gt;            Encoding: base64<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGive back to your community through &quot;Grow to Give.&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\nSee homepage for details.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
