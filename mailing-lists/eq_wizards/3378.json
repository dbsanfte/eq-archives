I was also invisable at the time.<br/>\n&gt; Well I got stuck in the window.  Suddenly I popped out and fell backwards<br/>\n&gt; into the lava pool.  At the time I had major shield, Leather Skin and<br/>\n&gt; Elemntal Protextion on me.  At first I nearly paniced but then I started<br/>\n&gt; banging my 6 key. It was my hot key for gate.  The whole time I was thinking<br/>\n&gt; that this was the end, and I&#39;d never get my corps back. After two tries, I<br/>\n&gt; got a gate off.  When I materialized at m bind point, I had 22 hp left.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From what I hear, I can  consider myself extreamly lucky to have lived.  I<br/>\n&gt; think I would have been a lot luckier if I had not fell in at all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One word - Levitate.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nSergey<br/>\n<br/>\nWorker bees can leave<br/>\nEven drones can fly away<br/>\nThe queen is their slave</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
