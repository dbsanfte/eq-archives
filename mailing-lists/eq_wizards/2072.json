Geoffrey has a lotta time on his hands and way back on may 6th he said he was already working on the new spells for the expansion. not to mention completely overhauling the enchanter spells and *gasp* some of the wizard spells! so just hang in there. don&#39;t petition because it&#39;s pointless. wait a while and if nothing good comes around. THEN petition. if they see a petition, turn it down, then see the same one in a couple months, they&#39;re not going to take it seriously! so just wait.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note. I love the familiar idea! it&#39;s great! BUT don&#39;t ask for it yet. that would take a lot of time that they just don&#39;t have yet. i think the highest level person on the mailing list is definetly the wisest and he loves his level and suggests to hang in there... as do I. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo please. stop the petition. all that&#39;s going to happen is they&#39;re going to look at it, then put the big &#39;ol thing in the trash bin. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy $ .02</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
