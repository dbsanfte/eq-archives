And yes, its rather dangerous, the inviso key is<br/>\nhotkeyed for me when I gate in there now.  Basically, you gate into the<br/>\neast side of what is affectionatly called &quot;the maze&quot;.  The way out is<br/>\nsimple though. You SHOULD be facing west when you gate in (quick sense<br/>\ndirection can confirm).  Just head west. You will see a LOT (a real lot)<br/>\nof side passages.  At times, you might not know which way to turn - just<br/>\nkeep heading as westerly as you can - if in your last turn, you picked<br/>\nslightly more north, this one pick slightly more south.  A few runs<br/>\nthru, and you will know where you are quickly.  Its only about 45<br/>\nseconds to the door out to the courtyard.  If you have picked up a train<br/>\nof Lizardmen, head in the courtyard, take the double doors to your left,<br/>\nand run for the zone - another 40 feet ahead around the corner!  Now you<br/>\nare safe (?) in the Feerrott.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Nek Gate<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This one is rather safe as well- I have used it many times as well, as a<br/>\nHigh elf.  It gates you in at 440 by negative 775.  That is the middle<br/>\nnorth south, but the far EAST side of the zone.  In otherwords, kinda<br/>\nclose to the city entrance.  You should see a few skeletons around you,<br/>\nit is a newbie hunting zone tho, so they will not be a problem.  Head<br/>\nsouthwest to get out to Commonlands, or northwest for Lavastorm.  Again,<br/>\ninviso is your friend if dark elves dont like you, there are plenty of<br/>\nguards patrolling here.  Sure, that first one is green, but it still<br/>\nhits for about 40 per whack, and has plenty of friends coming...<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps<br/>\n<br/>\nMicon Bittermage<br/>\nKarana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
