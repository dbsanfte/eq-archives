Verant need to do something about the mages, enchanters and<br/>\n&gt;wizards. I think Ken has a point, combine the lot into one.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think that a wizard is most hindered one i dont know if on realy high lvs<br/>\n40 + you have advantages for your weeknes with wich we start but other<br/>\nmagic classes are much stronger at early levels like until 20.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When Verant split<br/>\n&gt;them it sounded a great idea, I thought it was at the time too. But, the<br/>\n&gt;reality is quite different, unfortunately.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The main problem is that our class in not ovious time saver as i can say a<br/>\ncleric saves downtime by faster healing, a bard also can do it a druid not<br/>\nonly this but can make for faster onland travel and is strong at DD and<br/>\nmajority of players is not near lv where wizard start to be useful as lv<br/>\nwhen you have group travel. Only solution for this is some type of skill<br/>\nadvancment where you can choose at a creation of caracter some skills wich<br/>\nwill you develop throu play like AC but this is to be seen as it is<br/>\nimplemented. But i like to see this idea also only we must admit that<br/>\nclasses are not finalized until now, lets say magicians pets after 20 lv<br/>\nwhere out of game research comes a little time ago, specizlization on wich<br/>\nwe look as last chance to save a gameplay for us is not implemented yet.<br/>\nthere is much to see and maybe it will look as good as it is in<br/>\nintroduction book :-) <br/>\n<br/>\nThe class solution against skill solutions can be made better, now there<br/>\nare many many holes in sistem wich will need a time to get closed only is a<br/>\nproblem to see how many people will wait until then? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Simon<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Gregory Egan wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: Gregory Egan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gemd@...\">gemd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I was attracted to playing a wizard by the way the class was described in<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the game&#39;s manual, but if I had to do it over again (and I won&#39;t because I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; have already put a lot of time into my character, and want to play with my<br/>\n&gt;&gt; friends who are of the same level as I), I would pick a druid or shaman<br/>\n&gt;&gt; type character. They have great spells, which can also be cast on other<br/>\n&gt;&gt; party members, and aren&#39;t so weak in weapons and AC as wizards are. I hate<br/>\n&gt;&gt; it when I tell my friends about the spells I can get, only to find out they<br/>\n&gt;&gt; can be cast only on myself (shielding, resistant skin, etc.) My ranger<br/>\n&gt;&gt; friend casts Skin like Wood on my all the time, I have nothing to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; reciprocate. I think wizards as a class are short changed, and have never<br/>\n&gt;&gt; seen anyone do a /shout looking for a wizard to join with them as they do<br/>\n&gt;&gt; for rangers, shamans, bards, etc. Just my 2 cents.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Greg (Kronan)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Looking to expand your world?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; ONElist has over 145,000 email communities to choose from!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Looking for a new hobby?
