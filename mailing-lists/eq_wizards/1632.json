I would like to try some 1H weapons to free a hand for useful <br/>\nitems in the future so I went to the newbie area and started wacking <br/>\n/con green critters.  I found I could hit several run to a un <br/>\npopulated area and then stand and punch one creature until it ran <br/>\naway. Then started working another until it ran away eventually <br/>\ncomming back to the original one.  I did this with one group of 3 <br/>\ncrits for over an hour and got absolutely 0 increase in bare hand <br/>\nskill (still at 10 or 11)!  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is going on am I to start on /con blue creatures at level 9.  If <br/>\nso and had I known (ie if the manual had any value at all) I would <br/>\nhave been training 1H skills much early when the creatures could not <br/>\nkill me in 2 or 3 blows!<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone confirm this and/or give suggestions on how at this point <br/>\n(9th) I can improve my 1H fighting skills?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====================================================================<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Richard A.
