I am level 16 (just<br/>\nleveled) so all my experiences with regaining were up to 16. My wisdom is 95,<br/>\ndexterity 85 or 90 (don&#39;t remember). Anyway, the most I regain when casting<br/>\nroot. I almost always get the root off if I&#39;m hit once or twice, for not very<br/>\nhigh damage. Sometimes when I hit for very high damage too. As I told, I once<br/>\ngated with TWO gnolls hitting on me. Regaining concentration may be one of the<br/>\nunknown wizard advantages. Do other classes get it? Are they as successful?<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nSergey<br/>\n--<br/>\nKPS PUNK (Paramilitary Undercover Nuclear Kamikaze)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
