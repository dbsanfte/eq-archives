What the heck is it<br/>\ngood for then? Does anyone actually use it for anything? Leave it to Verant<br/>\nto give druids a level 1 snare spell that costs 15 mana, is virtually never<br/>\nresisted by blues, lasts the duration of the kill, and to give wizards a<br/>\nsnare-like spell at level 29 that costs 75 mana and lasts a few seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreg (Kronan on Innoruuk)&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bonds of force spell is random in duration, just like snare. Sometimes<br/>\nyou can BoF a creature and it will last the entire fight or sometimes you<br/>\ncan use it and it lasts for 5 seconds. One of the main reasons BoF is so<br/>\nhigh level is that it is an area effect spell. You can BoF multiple critters<br/>\nif they are all together but beware that if you cast it on something that is<br/>\nwithin melee range you can bind yourself as well. I use BoF as my opening<br/>\nspell whenever I am soloing. About 50% of the time the spell will last for 3<br/>\nor 4 nukes, about 35% of the time it will last for 1 nuke, and about 15% of<br/>\nthe time it will last until the creature is dead. I am a 38th level high-elf<br/>\nwizard with a 191 Intelligence. Also root is much the same, as far as the<br/>\namount of time it lasts when soloing.<br/>\n<br/>\nYours,<br/>\n<br/>\n~Aereuss Ravins of Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
