I noticed some information<br/>\nin your tome that I can expand on to add to our knowledge.  Mostly I will<br/>\nadd information on the different color robes that can be purchased.  It is<br/>\ninteresting to note the Erudin does things differently when it comes to<br/>\nRobes.  In all other cities, there is only 1 color of Jr. and Sr. apprentice<br/>\nrobe sold and they can be worn by all magic using classes.  In Erudin<br/>\nhowever there are 3 different color robes that are sold and each one can<br/>\nonly worn by 1 of the magic using classes (enchanter, magician, and wizard).<br/>\nI will detail this information below.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Items                   Info/Location<br/>\n&gt;----------------------\t--------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Blue Robe               Erudin, Qeynos<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are 2 types of blue robes, light blue and dark blue.  The light blue<br/>\n(jr. and sr. apprentice) are found in Qeynos and can by worn by all magic<br/>\nusers, while the dark blue (jr. and sr. apprentice) are found in Erudin and<br/>\nare Magician ONLY.  Also I think that only medium sized classes can wear<br/>\nboth of these robes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Red Robe                Erudin<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The red robe is Wizard ONLY, and I think only medium sided classes can wear<br/>\nthem (sorry gnomes).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Violet Robe             Freeport<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again I believe this is for medium sized classes only.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Yellow Robe             Ak&#39;anon (Though I think only gnomes can ware them).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes only gnomes can wear.  I confirmed this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Senior Apprentice Robe  +1 mana only no extra regeneration/+? AC<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Armor class value on Sr. robes are 6.  Also, the Erudite robes are better<br/>\nthan the others as far as I have seen.  The red robe I purchased is +2mana<br/>\n6ac rather than the +1mana 6ac green robe I was previously using.  The other<br/>\nrobes I checked in Erudin had the same +2mana value as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are my corrections/modifications, and now for some additions:<br/>\n<br/>\nJunior Apprentice Robe - 4 AC<br/>\nGold Robe (jr. and sr.) - Erudin (this robe is Enchanter ONLY and can only<br/>\nbe worn by medium classes)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
