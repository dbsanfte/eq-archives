Hold on there, Iggie didn&#39;t say YOU, he said that there are a<br/>\nlot<br/>\n&gt; of +pvp players that are jerks. There are also a ton of -pvp players that<br/>\n&gt; are jerks as well. I&#39;ll tell you about Elyas the loser Paladin on Solusek<br/>\nRo<br/>\n&gt; sometime.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe didn&#39;t say anyone was a jerk.  He said we weren&#39;t important enough to fix<br/>\n+PvP specific problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEnabling +pvp or -pvp is a choice you make, and because Verant has<br/>\n&gt; decided to offer you this choice, it is also up to them to protect players<br/>\n&gt; that don&#39;t share a +pvp view. They&#39;ve given you &#39;free zones&#39; where<br/>\neven -pvp<br/>\n&gt; players are fair game, they&#39;ve given you an entire +pvp server. I don&#39;t<br/>\nsee<br/>\n&gt; what more they can offer?<br/>\n<br/>\nFix the PvP specific bugs.  I don&#39;t care about PvP specific zones.  I play<br/>\nmy wizard on zek where this specific issue isn&#39;t a concern to me since there<br/>\nare no -PvP players to worry about.  I&#39;m just saying this continued attitude<br/>\ntoward +PvP is totally unwarranted.  What did we do to everyone else?<br/>\n<br/>\nAre thee bugs, yes that&#39;s true, but I think that<br/>\n&gt; fixing global bugs that affect everyone will be more of a priority than<br/>\nbugs<br/>\n&gt; that affect a single class.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bug I am concerned with is a global bug.  It affects people of any class<br/>\non all servers.  It just hurts +PvP a lot more.  But the bug is still there.<br/>\n<br/>\n So you have restrictions that I do not have as<br/>\n&gt; a -pvp wizard. It was your choice, so live with it. Learn to get around<br/>\nit,<br/>\n&gt; and I&#39;m sure that you&#39;ll have a much better experience for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHuh?  What are you talking about?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     You also have to remember that it&#39;s THEIR world  you&#39;re in, so you<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; to conform to them, they don&#39;t have to conform to you, even though a lot<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; player suggestions have been implemented. I&#39;m still waiting for a patch<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; will save the choice of how I view servers. Why would anyone want to view<br/>\nby<br/>\n&gt; number of players once you&#39;ve created and levelled your characters is a<br/>\n&gt; mystery to me. : )<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo kidding.  That&#39;s kinda annoying.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Try and remember that there&#39;s nothing that they&#39;ve done is to be<br/>\n&gt; intentionally harmful to the -pvp class, but given a choice the majority<br/>\nhas<br/>\n&gt; to rule, and that majority is -pvp. Their priorities concerning +pvp will<br/>\n&gt; always come first.<br/>\n<br/>\nUm, you are wrong.  Their priority is -PvP.  This should be pretty obvious<br/>\nif you have played the game at all.  -PvP has no real problems (I play<br/>\na -PvP ranger on the Rathe).  +PvP still has a couple HUGE, game balance<br/>\ndestroying issues that would be pretty simple to fix.  From what I read<br/>\nabout the testing on the test server, it looks like they may finally have<br/>\naddressed the issue as the looting for +PvP is supposed to have changed.  To<br/>\ngive you a brief rundown of the current problem, you are a lvl 35 (insert<br/>\nany class here) player.  You accidentally have autoattack on or are playing<br/>\nsong of discord or aoe a critter that is standing near a guard at one of the<br/>\nkelethin lifts.  The guard kills you.  ANY person who comes along can loot<br/>\nyou.  Even lvl 1 newbies.  Goodbye black robe and no way to get it back from<br/>\nthem (four level limit).  Obviously this screws up game balance a bit.  All<br/>\nthey need to do to fix it is apply the same loot ruels they use for MOBs.<br/>\nIf you didn&#39;t kill it, you don&#39;t get to loot it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, non combat spells you should be able to cast on<br/>\n&gt; others. Bind Affinity, O&#39;Keils radiation, Invisibility, great spells, and<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m behind you 110% in that you should be able to use them on others. I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; sure they&#39;ll change it in the future, but how long depends on how hard it<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; to code.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t think it would be that hard as most players can already cast them<br/>\non others, just not +PvP for some reason.  +PvP spells would work exactly<br/>\nas -PvP spells on a -PvP person.  There is no difference whatsoever in how<br/>\nthey should behave.  if a -PvP can cast it on a -PvP, a +PvP should be able<br/>\nto.  The code is all there, and all works, except they aren&#39;t using it.  The<br/>\nonly sane explanation is they are punishing +PvP for something.  BTW, if you<br/>\nare +PvP you can forget about -PvP helping you ever.  They can&#39;t cast<br/>\nhelpful spells on you without becoming +PvP themselves.  Of course, I play<br/>\non zek, where the only real concern is the looting issue I just mentioned.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Zalbar<br/>\n&gt; 14th Wizard<br/>\n&gt; Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: John Cuyle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johncuyle@...\">johncuyle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: 22 avril, 1999 12:08<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eq_wizards] Re: Digest Number 18<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;John Cuyle&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johncuyle@...\">johncuyle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;There you have it, even players say &quot;screw you, +PvP people.
