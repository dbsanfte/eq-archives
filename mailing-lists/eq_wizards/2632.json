Our secret<br/>\nweapon is our level 12 DD spell shock of lightning.  It is hardly ever<br/>\nresisted, casts extremely fast AND interrupts casting.  You can chain cast<br/>\nthis sucker so much faster than other casting classes it&#39;s sick.  Unless my<br/>\nbuddies went to their lower level spells, I would interrupt them every time.<br/>\nHoping you others out there will share your tips as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nEuros Arcane<br/>\nRallos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
