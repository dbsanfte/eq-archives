The reason is because it only lasts about 15 seconds or so.  If you are in a battle with more than one creature, you&#39;re probably going to die anyway.  Not all the time, but a LOT of the time.  O&#39;Keils might be ok against a lot of creatures.  But it doesn&#39;t do enough damage to kill anything by itself..  So, you&#39;ll die before they do.  (except goblin whelps, etc)  ..and if you&#39;re fighting those still, then you should be trying for one on one fights only.  Wizards are basically looking for one on one fights when solo&#39;ing, so they can time their castings between hits.  O&#39;Keils only does 2 dmg per burn, so at higher levels it is almost useless.  The only way to rack up dmg on these is to cast them repeatedly.  It doesn&#39;t stack, so you&#39;ve got to cast on others.  IE. Tanks.  Verant made the game this way on purpose.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDrev<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tMcGraw, T.

It is relatively low in mana<br/>\n&gt; cost and if you get attacked by more than one critter it can help turn the<br/>\n&gt; battle around.

However, let me give you an example of how it saved my life,<br/>\n&gt; once.  We were hunting in Unrest.. (party of 5 or 6 level 11-14s)..   We&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; doing fairly well.. avoiding the really tough ones, etc.. etc..   Our tanks<br/>\n&gt; are doing ok too, but only one of us has a magical weapon, and non magicians<br/>\n&gt; in the party.  Anyway..  we get attacked by a dark boned skeleton.  This<br/>\n&gt; thing was hitting us for HIGH damage, and we almost decided to run from the<br/>\n&gt; very start.  The warriors had the thing down to half health, and it resisted<br/>\n&gt; almost EVERYTHING I cast at it.  So..  I hit all of our tanks with O&#39;Keils<br/>\n&gt; Radiation.  2 dmg here, 2 dmg there..   eventually they started adding up..<br/>\n&gt; and the health of the skel started dropping quicker.  I guess what I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; saying is...   if you have 4 people hitting a monster that is resisting your<br/>\n&gt; spells... you can use O&#39;Keils radiation on your tanks.. and it WILL get<br/>\n&gt; through.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\tJust MHO.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\tDrev<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; From: \tshypht[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:evanschu@...\">evanschu@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; Sent: \tSunday, April 18, 1999 10:18 AM<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; Subject: \t[eq_wizards] Re: O&#39;Keill&#39;s Radiation<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; O&#39;Keills Radation is a damage shield. You cast the spell<br/>\n&gt; on yourself or another person, and everytiem the monster does melee damage<br/>\n&gt; to them, it reflects back some damage. This spell only does 2 damage and I<br/>\n&gt; find it to be useless, the Magi damage shields are MUCH MUCH better. At lvl&gt;<br/>\n&gt; �4 it was reflecting 5 damage, compared to mine that only did 2, and I am<br/>\n&gt; pretty sure that the higher-lvl ones dish out more. I am not sure if we get<br/>\n&gt; any more damage shields tho.<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; \t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; \tFrom: Teri &lt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:greenidminx@...\">greenidminx@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; \tTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; \tDate: Sunday, April 18, 1999 12:00 PM<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; \tSubject: [eq_wizards] O&#39;Keill&#39;s Radiation<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; \tI&#39;m a little confused as t o the effect of O&#39;Keill&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; Radiation.� Would<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; \tsomeone be so kind as to enlighten me to its&#39; proper<br/>\n&gt; purpose and<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; \tusage?<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; \t�<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; \tI&#39;m a level 6 wiz on Fennin Ro.� Please say hello if<br/>\n&gt; you see me about.<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; \t�<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; \t=)<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; \t�<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; \tXimena<br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\t&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; \t\tDid you know that ONElist hosts some of the largest lists on<br/>\n&gt; the Internet?<br/>\n&gt; \t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; \t\tOur scaleable system is the most reliable free e-mail<br/>\n&gt; service on the Internet!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Did you know that ONElist hosts some of the largest lists on the Internet?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Our scaleable system is the most reliable free e-mail service on the Internet!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
