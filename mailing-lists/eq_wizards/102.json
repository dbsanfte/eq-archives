I know I have a book which contains the &quot;recipe&quot; for one of the 16th lvl spells.. I forget the name right now, but something to do with lightning (not lightning bolt).  If this is the AE spell you are looking for at 16th then try the books in your guild.  Hope this helps somewhat.<br/>\n     <br/>\n    Tandayen, Dark Elf Wizard<br/>\n     <br/>\n        -----Original Message-----<br/>\n        From: Ken Morris &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kmorris2@...\">kmorris2@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n        To: EQ Wizards &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n        Date: Saturday, April 17, 1999 2:20 PM<br/>\n        Subject: [eq_wizards] Higher lvl AE spells<br/>\n        <br/>\n        <br/>\n        I am a 20th lvl wizard and have been unable to find any of the 16th or 20th lvl AE spells.  I have looked in every city of Norrath with no luck.  If anyone has any information about where they can be found, I&#39;d be very appreciative ;)<br/>\n        <br/>\n        Talarin High Elven Wizard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
