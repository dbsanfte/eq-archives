I think<br/>\nthe formula for offense skill is (level * 4) and defense skill is ((level<br/>\n*4) + 4).  Please correct me if I am wrong on those.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to your skills increasing slowly, that is strange.  When my ranger got to<br/>\nabout level 17 and he got a screaming mace, his 1h blunt skill was 0.  I<br/>\nwent to unrest and got permission from the groups there to get some whacks<br/>\nin on the mobs they were fighting (many of which were white/black or yellow<br/>\ncons).  It took me a while, but skill steadily improved from 0 all the way<br/>\nto max of 100 at level 19.  Playing my wizard I have really not noticed<br/>\nfaster weapon skill gain than what my ranger had (his int was only 80 or<br/>\nsomething).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all the advice though.  I am level 10 now and had started with my<br/>\ndagger, but moved to 2h blunt and am trying to max that (I asked about the<br/>\nformulas cause I don&#39;t know when I will max without).<br/>\n<br/>\n-Solric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Keith Wiseman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:keithw@...\">keithw@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an EXCELLENT strategy.<br/>\nHowever, you have GOT to do this early in your career.  If you have never<br/>\nused a 2H Blunt weapon and then begin using it at Level 16, you will quickly<br/>\nbe frustrated at the lack of improvement in that skill.  (I know from<br/>\nexperience)  It won&#39;t take long before you&#39;ll be wondering whether to go<br/>\nback to your maxed newbie attack skill (likely piercing) or going to spend a<br/>\nwhole bunch of practice points to improve it enough to even hit anything.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen a ton of threads on message boards describing the problem I am<br/>\nspeaking about above.  There really appears to be a bug or design flaw here.<br/>\nFor example, last night I basically meleed for 4 hours straight because we<br/>\nhad a very efficient group fighting mostly blues which meant very little<br/>\ndowntime. (with a Ranger pulling constantly)   My 2H Blunt skill improved<br/>\nonce and I was actually surprised to see it.  I am a Lvl 17 Wiz with my 2H<br/>\nBlunt skill at 20.  With an INT of 140, and the skill being so low, you&#39;d<br/>\nthink it would improve very rapidly like the newbie days.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI really wish I had realized to try and max all three skills from the very<br/>\nbeginning because it sure seemed easy to do back then.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, If you want to just focus on two skills instead of three, the two<br/>\nprimary skills would unarguably be Piercing and 2H Blunt.  I have done a lot<br/>\nof research on weapons, and I haven&#39;t found one 1H Blunt weapon that you<br/>\nwould likely choose over one of the other two weapon types available to you<br/>\nat most levels. (assuming there&#39;s not a hidden gem somewhere)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tWith the high intelligence of a wizard it is very easy to<br/>\nmax out all three<br/>\n\t\t(pierce, 1&2H Blunt).  At the start of a new level I start<br/>\noff with my great<br/>\n\t\tstaff, then I move on to my trusty cracked staff, and I<br/>\nfinish off the level<br/>\n\t\twith my snake fang.  During level 4 and 5 I tried to work on<br/>\nmy hand2hand, but<br/>\n\t\talas I am not a monk.  Also something I&#39;ve noticed, you can<br/>\nimprove on your<br/>\n\t\tthrowing skills by attacking &quot;con green&quot; mobs.  The simple<br/>\nreason I go through<br/>\n\t\tall of this is because sooner or later Verant will probably<br/>\nintroduce new<br/>\n\t\tweapons to the game, and whatever skill it uses, I want to<br/>\nbe ready.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nCongratulations to &quot;Trail Rider,&quot; our latest ONElist of the Week.  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\nVisit our homepage and share with us how ONElist is changing YOUR life!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
