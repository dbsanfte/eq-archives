I&#39;m on my way tonight<br/>\nto Paw, hoping to get a runed totem staff, and to Qeynos to hopefully get<br/>\nsome of the special quest belts and boots or whatever that any class can wear.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have any leads on other items that someone of my level could<br/>\npossibly get?  With a group of 3-4 people?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd lastly, how much of an impact do +mana items have on meditation?  For<br/>\nexample, if I&#39;m doing good, I may be able to get two rings, a runed totem<br/>\npole and a robe that will give me a total of +16 mana.  Will I notice any<br/>\ndiffernce in my meditation?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nFlik</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
