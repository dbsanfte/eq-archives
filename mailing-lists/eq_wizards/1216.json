I<br/>\n&gt; will accept donations if they wish to give them, but I never require a<br/>\n&gt; payment.  However, languages are a whole new ballgame.  It takes a lot of<br/>\n&gt; time and effort to learn these languages, especially Dragon and Combine.  I<br/>\n&gt; see nothing wrong with expecting some compensation for your time and effort<br/>\n&gt; in teaching someone a language.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s something that still eludes me.
