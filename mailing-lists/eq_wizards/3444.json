Hunt aviaks, centaurs and elephants until you can<br/>\n&gt; get into outside Paw Groups. Ive levelled from 22 to nearly 28<br/>\n&gt; (last night) in about 3 weeks at Paw. The loot is good (FS<br/>\n&gt; weapons, whips sell for 30-50, gloves for 300-500, other Paw<br/>\n&gt; armor 10-15) and the money isnt bad, plat, gold and silver.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also try Crushbone Throneroom, aviaks in Rathe, Rathe Mountains<br/>\n&gt; (Gt skels), OOT Aviaks and possibly gargoyle, Unrest, Sol A,<br/>\n&gt; Najena, Everfrost mammoths (tusks sell amiable cha 100 for over<br/>\n&gt; 10 plat), Perma by the zone... Dunno if Befallen is still an<br/>\n&gt; option but Highpass maybe, and if you get sow or a druid hunting<br/>\n&gt; partner you can kite some of the griffs in EKarana, or try the<br/>\n&gt; spiders there if no Sow.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also Pickclaws in HighHold Keep maybe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Luckily you can travel around, and you will need to. 20 wasnt TOO<br/>\n&gt; bad for me, but 22 I couldnt find open hunting spots anywhere,<br/>\n&gt; till Paw was revamped. Pretty much havent left there since except<br/>\n&gt; to bank... Bind spot is at the merchant by the Bank, Gate to NK,<br/>\n&gt; run back. 5 minutes away time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good hunting<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shannyn, lvl 27 and 80% on Tunare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
