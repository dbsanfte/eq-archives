Let&#39;s say I did something stupid (this<br/>\ndidn&#39;t happen) like not buy root at lvl4, and already filled all five slots<br/>\nin my spellbook... can I go out and buy root and scribe it over top of one<br/>\nof my lvl4 spells that I think sucks?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I&#39;m nearing the specialization levels and have read some interesting<br/>\nposts on the subject of what to specialize in.  It comes down to either<br/>\nAlteration or Evocation and I&#39;d like to hear some thoughts about what to<br/>\nchoose as my expertise.  I&#39;m leaning toward Evocation based on the sheer<br/>\nfact that in the long run maybe I&#39;ll save mana/time since I blast more than<br/>\nI root or whatever.  But it would be damn nice to have an extra powerful<br/>\nrooting ability or even get gate off while being melee&#39;d.  Who thinks they<br/>\nchose the right one?<br/>\n<br/>\nVeron of Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
