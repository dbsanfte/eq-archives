When you&#39;re in a group everybody in the<br/>\ngroup will have their bar move the exact same amount.  The difference is<br/>\nthat for the bar to move that much for the higher lvl characters they need<br/>\nmore exp.  That&#39;s how the steal xp from the lower guys in a group.  Btw, I&#39;m<br/>\nnot accusing everyone in your group of lying.  But sometimes it can be very<br/>\nhard to track your xp bar precisely.. it&#39;s very possible the differences in<br/>\nexp bar movement everyone saw happened because of a little impreciseness,<br/>\nsome rounding, ect, ect...<br/>\nAnother reason why groups are worth it because of solo, is that you don&#39;t<br/>\nhave as much downtime.. you can fight, fight.. rest a bit fight... and so<br/>\non.. whereas soloing sometimes your downtime won&#39;t be big, and others it<br/>\nwill be intermanibly long.<br/>\n<br/>\nTandayen, Dark Elf Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cinius@...\">cinius@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cinius@...\">cinius@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, April 26, 1999 6:28 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Exp gain while in parties.....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cinius@...\">cinius@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Am I the only one with the impression that we&#39;re getting screwed when it<br/>\n&gt;comes to diving up the exp while grouped? I was in a party that ranged from<br/>\n&gt;level 9 to 12 while I was level 10. Everyone talked about the &#39;great exp&#39;<br/>\n&gt;they got, while I was thinking &quot;Man they must never get any Exp&quot;. I asked<br/>\n&gt;about what everyone got after a big fight and the results went something<br/>\n&gt;like this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Level 9 got almost a 1/3rd of a bubble<br/>\n&gt;level 10-12 got close to 1/2 a bubble<br/>\n&gt;Poor old Cinius the only Wizard in the party saving everyones ass had to<br/>\n&gt;wait til the next fight to notice a combined total from both fights of 1/4<br/>\n&gt;of a bubble. Is it like this for anyone else? Hell I get 1/4 of a bubble<br/>\n&gt;when killing a yellow on my own. In my opinion that makes it worth the risk<br/>\n&gt;of getting killed by the yellows(happens maybe once out of every 7-10<br/>\n&gt;kills).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;my apologies for the last double mail...had browser problems.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Cinius(Mith Marr)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Get your free, private email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.excite.com/\">http://mail.excite.com/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Looking for the perfect gift for a friend?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Tell them about ONElist&#39;s 115,000 free e-mail communities! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
