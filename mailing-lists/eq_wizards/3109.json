He&#39;s good experience and drops 15pp <br/>\nworth of weapons everytime (between his axe and longsword -- if ya sell it <br/>\nto an NPC vendor), but you&#39;ll have to kill him a thousand times (or more) to <br/>\ngain any significant faction to enter Nek Forest unhindered.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nErdrick, The Regulators<br/>\n&lt;www.theregulators.org&gt;<br/>\nRallos Zek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
