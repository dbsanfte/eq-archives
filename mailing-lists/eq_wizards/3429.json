Put a few points into the one you want to be your primary<br/>\n&gt; specialization.  This is so that it will be the first one to go beyond 50.<br/>\n&gt; The first skill to go beyond 50 becomes your primary specialization, and it<br/>\n&gt; is the only one that will rise beyond 50.  If you do not have a point in all<br/>\n&gt; the others to get them started, however, then none of them will rise above<br/>\n&gt; 50.  They all improve naturally as you cast spells of the appropriate<br/>\n&gt; school, so you need not put more than 1 point into the other schools, only<br/>\n&gt; your selected primary one, so you will ensure that it rises above 50 first.<br/>\n&gt; The specialization skill either reduces casting time or reduces fizzling or<br/>\n&gt; both... I can&#39;t remember now what the gm told me precisely--- it was long<br/>\n&gt; ago.  Should you change your mind later, though, there is a quest in the<br/>\n&gt; Temple of Solusek Ro whereby you may reset your specializations and begin<br/>\n&gt; again.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As for Research, I have never bothered with practice runes.  The materials<br/>\n&gt; for them are a quest in themselves, and I have found it easier to simply<br/>\n&gt; keep research maxed at your guildhouse with one of the trainers for your<br/>\n&gt; class.  It gets expensive, though---it is costing me about 8 plat per point<br/>\n&gt; now, but money isn&#39;t nearly the problem that collecting those runes is.  I<br/>\n&gt; have only had a few failures in research, and they are due to luck.  I had<br/>\n&gt; research maxed, and still failed 3 times to create one of the level 24<br/>\n&gt; spells, and this when I was level 29!  I then tried to make a level 34 spell<br/>\n&gt; and succeeded on the first try.  It&#39;s just a matter of luck.  Just save all<br/>\n&gt; the runes you find and ask others to do so as well, and then try a spell<br/>\n&gt; when you are sure you have maxed your research for your level.  Good luck.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Nat Russo&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nrusso@...\">nrusso@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi folks,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just got lvl 20 the other day and am wondering about Specialization.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dumped as many points as I could into &quot;Specialization:Evocation&quot;, but have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; absolutely no clue as to how it&#39;s supposed to work.  What does it do?<br/>\n&gt; Does<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it improve with use?  What exactly needs to be used to improve it?  etc...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On another note, when I got to lvl 16, I dumped a point into Research.<br/>\n&gt; Then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at lvl 20 I dumped a bunch more points into research.  I just tried<br/>\n&gt; &gt; researching a lvl 16 spell (pillar of fire, I believe) at lvl 20, and<br/>\n&gt; failed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; miserably.  How exactly do you practice this skill without needing a<br/>\n&gt; MASSIVE<br/>\n&gt; &gt; collection of Runes?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Olatan Ossur  20th Wizard on Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n&gt; &gt; + Olatan Ossur   +<br/>\n&gt; &gt; +  20th Wizard   +<br/>\n&gt; &gt; +  Solusek Ro    +<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
