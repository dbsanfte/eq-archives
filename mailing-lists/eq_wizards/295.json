It will tell you how you affect or will<br/>\nbe effected by that NPC.  Now when you slay something it will tell you what<br/>\nfaction you effected.  Thats the only way.<br/>\n <br/>\n2) Mana score?  No.  You can only guestimate the amount of mana you have.  I<br/>\nhave figured you have about as much mana as a warrior does Hit Points at<br/>\nyour same level.  You can get more exact with this by finding out how much<br/>\nstrength the warrior has.  If you have 115 intelligence and the warrior has<br/>\n115 strength...the hitpoints should equal the amount of points in mana you<br/>\nhave if you are same level.<br/>\n <br/>\n    -  this is my theory which I have proven through testing.  Try it out<br/>\nand let me know if you find same thing true<br/>\n <br/>\n3) Rank in skill with a number?  Nope.  Sorry, Verant told me they did not<br/>\nwant people fixated on stats.  You can figure out your number though when<br/>\nthe skill raises.  Keep track of it and you will know what it is.  My wizard<br/>\nat lvl 15 has magical skills of 80 (maxed for the level).<br/>\n <br/>\n- Ziffnab<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Michael C.
