I <br/>\nfound one WAY back at the beginning and hadn&#39;t a clue one what it was <br/>\nfor.  Of course after I accidentally sold it in a pack to a vendor I found <br/>\nout ... oh well...it was one I wish I had now.  Isn&#39;t that the way it <br/>\nalways runs?<br/>\n         What I do to acquire runes is this, when grouped with people first <br/>\nthing, I state I would appreciate if runes are found people let me have the <br/>\nopportunity to purchase them or they share and I will likewise share any <br/>\nitems I get for loot that they want.  I can&#39;t use the big bronze swords and <br/>\nother warrior/larger class type items..so we do a straight across trade or <br/>\nI pay a plat or something for the rune, so they get something and feel good <br/>\nabout it too.  It is far less than I would pay at a vendor and its <br/>\ngenerally more than they would get were they to sell to a vendor.  It works <br/>\nout well...everyone ends up happy in the end, and most times we get good <br/>\nexp too :)<br/>\n         I do have one question...this may seem obvious for some, but where <br/>\ndo I find the tome to combine the spell components?   I hail from Neriak <br/>\nand I have probably just missed it.  I would appreciate if anyone knows <br/>\nwhere to find this item, please post for the dork here so I can start my <br/>\nspell creation...hopefully...all the comments about the slow skill raising <br/>\nthat goes on makes me leery but I have to try it anyway :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 10:09 AM 6/22/99 -0600, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Jason Smith&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jj@...\">jj@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have only found about 2 runes, I am level 23...  so you aren&#39;t unlucky,<br/>\n&gt;just aren&#39;t many out there...
