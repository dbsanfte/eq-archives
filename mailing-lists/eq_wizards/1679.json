I hear few say <br/>\nleave it alone! I and a lot of other players left twinking alone in UO and <br/>\nlook where that game is now. Same for Diablo. It does effect me and my <br/>\ncharacter cause it will lead to every other player having to twinkle just to <br/>\nplay on even ground. Then all the honest players will be left behind like <br/>\nUO.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwinking the Definition....Giving high level gear to a low level character.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that &quot;low level&quot; is not lower level. I a 10th level wizard gave <br/>\nitems to a fighter who is 7th level. Things I can not use but he can and it <br/>\nhelps our party. He being only 3 levels under me. This just makes sense. But <br/>\nwhen a 20th level character gives items high in value to a less then 10th <br/>\nlevel character that is simply foolish and exploitable.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow at 5th level I did find a mighty magical item that someone had <br/>\nmistakenly dropped. I belive this is fair in the game. But to have a <br/>\ncharacter outfitted by other, in a guild or no, is simply cheating and will <br/>\nruin the balance of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nElkantar Keeper of the Tome of Magi Lore<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
