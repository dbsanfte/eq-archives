If you have or know where I<br/>\n&gt; can get a CGI/HTML script that will allow others to add their comments to<br/>\n&gt; this web page please let me know. What I am looking for is a CGI data base<br/>\n&gt; that allows external entries to be added then automatically updates a FAQ<br/>\n&gt; sheet. The automatic part is a must cause I like to play EQ too much to get<br/>\n&gt; stuck updating a web page. I can screen the page and omit others. I would<br/>\n&gt; really like a CIG data base that would allow me to have a login and password<br/>\n&gt; security that way those pesky fighters could not steal information. Also I<br/>\n&gt; would be able to track who said what about quests or items to glean more<br/>\n&gt; info from then if needed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Elkantar Keeper of the Tome of Magi Lore<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
