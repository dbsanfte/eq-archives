This worked very well I was in a group of 2 wizards (I was<br/>\none), 1 cleric, and 1 druid.  The druid had enough hp to tank so they did so<br/>\nwith the cleric healing them.  The druid would also cast offensive spells<br/>\nwhile tanking and of course myself and the other wizard would blast.  We<br/>\nALWAYS used ASSIST so that we all focused on 1 at a time.  Using this<br/>\ntactic, we could take on several mobs conning red to me (I was the lowest<br/>\nlevel in the group) at once.  ASSIST is by far the key in this setup, which<br/>\nis what you will pretty much always use if both a tank and cleric are in<br/>\nyour group.  If you don&#39;t have BOTH a cleric and tank, you will probably end<br/>\nup having to root and blast at some point unless you arent fighting very<br/>\nhard monsters.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Solric</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
