So if you are a small race, don&#39;t waste your time.  Woven is<br/>\nheavier than cloth.  It generally has a 1 or 2 AC advantage over cloth per<br/>\npiece.  Woven is found rarely on Frogloc Foragers, and Kolbold Hunters in<br/>\nInnothule.  Innothule is also a great place for loot (armor, giant snake fangs,<br/>\nno people) and experience for a level 10 person.  It is about a fifteen minute<br/>\nwalk from Freeport.  Before you go there, purchase all the bear hide armor<br/>\npieces from the Millers in Qeynos Hills.  You can&#39;t beat Bear Hide AC and I<br/>\nbelieve it is wearable by all classes(If somebody could verify this, I&#39;d<br/>\nappreciate it)  You may also want to hunt some Elite Guards in BB before you<br/>\ngo.  Their Neckbands sell pretty good in Freeport.  When/if you head back to<br/>\nQeynos, stock up on Giant snake fangs.  There are like 3 giant snakes in the<br/>\nQeynos area, and you can&#39;t walk 5 feet without stepping on one in the Freeport<br/>\narea.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nMalkin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
