And i dont<br/>\n&gt;have any problem about it!<br/>\n&gt;If they transfered items from their high lv caracters or if guild give it<br/>\n&gt;to them its ok for me i go around killing my bats and snakes and they do it<br/>\n&gt;in same way without skills they must work much things a same way as you do<br/>\n&gt;a little bit easier but they alredy worked for it.<br/>\n&gt;I played a long time a everquest creating some middle lv caracter and i<br/>\n&gt;know  how dificult it is to start it all over if you have find that your<br/>\n&gt;caracter is not what you wish and you decite to start new class.<br/>\n&gt;Im shure that a people wich complain are ones wich have enugh money and<br/>\n&gt;free time to play as long as they wish, ohers wich cannot support to pay a<br/>\n&gt;10 $ a month and 1 $ a hour (as connection rates to internet go in europe)<br/>\n&gt;i aprove fully to transfer their items to new started caracter. If this is<br/>\n&gt;possible to do in game then its ok to do if you wish to pay 100 $ a month<br/>\n&gt;so that you can have a payed gm controling every transaction in game then<br/>\n&gt;its ok for you send email to Sony saying that you are ready to pay 100 $ a<br/>\n&gt;month to play a game where every move will be GM controled so wou can be<br/>\n&gt;shure that every caracter is not twinked ;-), They willl accept this idea<br/>\n&gt;gladly as soon they start reciving your bucks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;About guild camping im strongly against it i support idea that if person<br/>\n&gt;wich killes a monster is more then 5 lv higher then loot will be only<br/>\n&gt;normal one and for special items only a 1/3 of normal chance or not at all<br/>\n&gt;so higer lv players wishing one item must buy it from a low lv players. it<br/>\n&gt;will be a nice push to player interaction.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Silverion<br/>\n&gt;High elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\n&gt;Fenin Ro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Are you?
