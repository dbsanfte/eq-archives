However, if you use tactic 1, the<br/>\nall mobs deal damage over the full time, while using tactic 2, only one mob<br/>\ndeal damage over full time, while one will do damage over only 1/3. Since<br/>\nmobs do the same damage at all time, unless almost dead :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHow this is done is by having the combat leader doing the targetting. Once the<br/>\nleader says &quot;I have a target&quot;, all click /assist. The combat leader is<br/>\nusually the main tank - not necessarily the group leader.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
