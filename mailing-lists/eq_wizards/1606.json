I know a regular great staff is<br/>\n9damage 38delay (damage over time ratio of .237) which is a really good<br/>\nweapon.  The fang is 5damage 27delay (damage over time ratio of .185) which<br/>\nis not as good as a real great staff, but I think it is better than a worn<br/>\none.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would recommend not staying dead set on 2h blunt because some really nice<br/>\nitems come along that you will want to hold in your off hand.  The skull of<br/>\njen&#39;ra comes to mind (which i believe gives +20 mana) among others.  There<br/>\nare some really good 1h piercing weapons out there too, so I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nneglect this skill.  I try to keep both my 2h blunt and my pierce up to max<br/>\neach level so that I will be ready for whatever weapon I happen to come<br/>\nacross.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Solric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Rich Mulawa [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:richard.mulawa@...\">richard.mulawa@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 20, 1999 5:40 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Marziani@...\">Michael.Marziani@...</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Guile&#39;s lament<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Rich Mulawa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:richard.mulawa@...\">richard.mulawa@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMicheal,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your reply.  Sorry to sound like I am yet another whining <br/>\nabout the Wizard class.  I actually love the Wizard class but can&#39;t <br/>\nhelp but be envious of the others I have seen at my level runing <br/>\naround with items that give them 50 extra mana points and AC&#39;s near <br/>\n250 at level 10 and I can&#39;t raise enough money to buy basic spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you really believe that I can be more effective with a snake fang <br/>\nthen a GS.  I have to melee quite a bit now and the staff although it <br/>\nseems that I swing it only once every 10 secs and the damage I do is <br/>\nproportional to the creatures HP&#39;s it does hit regularly for 16 points <br/>\nof damage. The senario is like this I can hit for 64 points in the <br/>\nfirst four strikes then can&#39;t hit for 3 points in 10 strikes while the <br/>\ncreature crawls away from me - not run crawl like a slug, follow, <br/>\nmiss, follow, miss, follow, miss, umph! I am stunned by an ambush of 4 <br/>\ncreatures as I tried to deal the last 3 points to the creature I have <br/>\nalready beaten.  Then I die or run losing the kill and becoming very <br/>\nbitter.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI could kill without meleeing at all but at 9th level I&#39;d use all my <br/>\nmana in every fight and would have to run back to a safe place to med <br/>\nconstantly.  Lately in groups I am a fighting Wizard.  I let the tanks <br/>\nbuild a heathly hate with the creatures then join in with my staff.  I <br/>\nonly use my mana to stop a fleeing creature or save my group when <br/>\nthings go wrong or to minimize the damage they endure.  My rule is I <br/>\ntry to use slightly more mana then the tanks take damage.  This way I <br/>\nrecover my mana in about the same amount of time they recover their <br/>\nlife and neither of us slows the other. If I burn to recklessly I <br/>\ncause the whole group to slow down by having to wait for me to <br/>\nregenerate.  I am concerned that with a snake tooth (6dmg I think) I <br/>\nwould not do nearly as much damage and would be forced to use mana.  I <br/>\nconserve mana at all costs even to the point of nearing death or <br/>\nhaving to flee rather than win the fight.  Mana is life.  If I use it <br/>\nindescrimanantly I risk the lives of my party or I become a burden to <br/>\nthem rather than an asset.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I have used a staff since day one.  I have practically no skill <br/>\nin one hand piece(?).  How long would it take me to build my dagger <br/>\nskill to 50 (my current 2H blunt skill)?  How much damage over time <br/>\ndoes the dagger do verses the staff?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\nGuile<br/>\n=====================================================================<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Richard A.
