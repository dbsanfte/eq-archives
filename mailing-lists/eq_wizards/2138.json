It really depends.  Assuming you have a balanced <br/>\ngroup (ie a healer, a tank or two, and some nukers) more likely than not, <br/>\nyou&#39;ll have enough time in the group during battles to dictate who needs to <br/>\nrun and when.  My regular group finds it best to have the tank buffed up <br/>\nwith SOW so that he/she can run when necessary without jeapardizing (sp?) <br/>\nthe rest of the group.  If it&#39;s a controlled & organized party, the <br/>\ncreature(s) will most likely all be attacking your &quot;pulling&quot; tank.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I find myself in an unfamiliar group I kinda play it by ear.  It&#39;s a lot <br/>\ndifferent playing against orcs in Oasis & CB versus training Dry Bone Skels <br/>\nin Unrest.  Main thing I found helpful is to call out who you&#39;re assisting <br/>\nin a fight so that everybody can zero in on one creature at a time.  /ASSIST <br/>\nis our friend. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI try not to cast too early as to call attention from a tank.  And I try not <br/>\nto cast too little as to have left my tank high and dry.  I think it&#39;s our <br/>\nobligation to make sure we are not engaged in melee during battle so as to <br/>\nnot be interrupted during attacks and so the tanks need not chase the <br/>\ncreature about.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sometimes make judgement calls if I feel that my tank is not going to make <br/>\nit to zone.  I have sometimes let loose on spells to draw some creatures to <br/>\nme....with Shieldskin up, I can afford to absorb some blows where I can then <br/>\nchoose to run them away from the tank or to keep their attention while my <br/>\ntank hits them from behind.  This works OK, but it sometimes results in a <br/>\ngory death. :)  But this is no problem if you trust your party...tanks die <br/>\nfor you...be willing to die for your tanks sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhoa, I&#39;ve talked too much.  Hope these tips help somebody.  I am by no <br/>\nmeans an expert so don&#39;t expect these to work for everybody.  I&#39;d like to <br/>\nencourage everybody to express some of their battle tactics here rather than <br/>\nargue all the time! hehe<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n18 Wiz Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Strategy check:  Which has the better survival rate?  A group running <br/>\n&gt; &gt;away,<br/>\n&gt;or a group that scatters?  (I&#39;m not questioning your qualifications &gt;as a<br/>\n&gt;leader, just wanting to know which has worked better from your point &gt;of<br/>\n&gt;view)  I can see pluses and minuses on both sides of the argument.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
