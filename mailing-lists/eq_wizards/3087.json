Although the <br/>\nlevitate/invis trick I heard sounds promising.  Anyway...I&#39;ve traditionally <br/>\ntaken the LOONG way there following all the walls.  Forgive me if I get the <br/>\nnames of the zones wrong (I hope there are those here who would correct me)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Go to Oasis...follow the right wall until the back side of the zone.  You <br/>\ncan&#39;t miss this huge zone area back there.  I think there is an orc and derv <br/>\ncamp back there.  Greenies but I steer clear anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- S Ro.  Follow right wall again...you&#39;ll encounter orc camps along the <br/>\nway.  Greenies again.  First zone you encounter will lead to Innothule.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Innothule Swamp.  Right again.  I don&#39;t remember bumping into anything at <br/>\nall here.  First zone<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Feerot.  I usually go invis in this zone.  Might be a good idea to go <br/>\ninvis along the whole journey.  Anyway, Cazic is in this zone.  But you have <br/>\nto watch for Ogre guards along the way.  Especially the infamous roaming <br/>\nBouncer Hurd.  So I steer clear by following the left wall till I encounter <br/>\nthe river.  a short swim across to the other bank.  I would say about....30 <br/>\nmore yards along the left wall is the temple entrance guarded by two green <br/>\nto blue lizards.  Viola.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes some time to get used to the place.  But invis will be your best <br/>\nfriend here heh.  That&#39;s my method....the &quot;Lim&#39;Dul Chicken Express&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t found a place with a very detailed map.
