Put a few points into the one you want to be your primary ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1330424222\">You must put 1 point into ALL the specialization skills before they will<br/>\nrise properly.  Put a few points into the one you want to be your primary<br/>\nspecialization.  This is so that it will be the first one to go beyond 50.<br/>\nThe first skill to go beyond 50 becomes your primary specialization, and it<br/>\nis the only one that will rise beyond 50.  If you do not have a point in all<br/>\nthe others to get them started, however, then none of them will rise above<br/>\n50.  They all improve naturally as you cast spells of the appropriate<br/>\nschool, so you need not put more than 1 point into the other schools, only<br/>\nyour selected primary one, so you will ensure that it rises above 50 first.<br/>\nThe specialization skill either reduces casting time or reduces fizzling or<br/>\nboth... I can&#39;t remember now what the gm told me precisely--- it was long<br/>\nago.  Should you change your mind later, though, there is a quest in the<br/>\nTemple of Solusek Ro whereby you may reset your specializations and begin<br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Research, I have never bothered with practice runes.  The materials<br/>\nfor them are a quest in themselves, and I have found it easier to simply<br/>\nkeep research maxed at your guildhouse with one of the trainers for your<br/>\nclass.  It gets expensive, though---it is costing me about 8 plat per point<br/>\nnow, but money isn&#39;t nearly the problem that collecting those runes is.  I<br/>\nhave only had a few failures in research, and they are due to luck.  I had<br/>\nresearch maxed, and still failed 3 times to create one of the level 24<br/>\nspells, and this when I was level 29!  I then tried to make a level 34 spell<br/>\nand succeeded on the first try.  It&#39;s just a matter of luck.  Just save all<br/>\nthe runes you find and ask others to do so as well, and then try a spell<br/>\nwhen you are sure you have maxed your research for your level.  Good luck.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Nat Russo&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nrusso@...\">nrusso@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi folks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just got lvl 20 the other day and am wondering about Specialization.
