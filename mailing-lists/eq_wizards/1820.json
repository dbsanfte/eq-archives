I thought at the time that this was a ridiculously long time<br/>\nto wait for the game to get better for wizards. Why SHOULD it have to take<br/>\nso long? Now I see from someone with a lot more experience than I that it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get better. I think we need to seriously petition Verant about the<br/>\nshortcomings of the wizard class. We need more buff spells to help<br/>\nourselves and our parties, and spells of protection, like you mentioned. It<br/>\nseems to me that this is the sort of things wizards should be able to do<br/>\nanyway. <br/>\n<br/>\nGreg (Kronan)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
