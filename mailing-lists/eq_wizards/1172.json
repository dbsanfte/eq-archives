Affinity<br/>\nis nice, since at that level, your feet start to itch a lot, but never<br/>\nunderestimate your protection first. That can save you your life (and thus a<br/>\nlot of XP).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can always find someone to bind you if you lack it. You cannot have someone<br/>\nelse cast the Shielding on you (other buffs yes.
