A shieldskin spell (absorbs 100HP dmg) and casting<br/>\nRoot or enstill (Root should suffice).  When you are of equal footing<br/>\n(lvl wise) ROOT should hold for at least 2 casts....then ROOT again and<br/>\nCAST 2 more times and he is dead.  I will put it to the test with my<br/>\nlvl 19 Wizard and a equal level dual wielder.  He or she cant hit me if<br/>\nthey cant move towards me.  There is a balance and the fight would be<br/>\nclose. But the root should hold and knowing how quick we can take out a<br/>\ntarget..he should die quickly as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Ziffnab of Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Simon Hinshelwood &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:iktome@...\">iktome@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Simon Hinshelwood &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:iktome@...\">iktome@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dear Valacian,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Good answer. But are you prepared to put it to the<br/>\n&gt; test as an experiment? (serious question) I think<br/>\n&gt; someone of your level would be appropriate to test<br/>\n&gt; the wizards power, or lack of it. Would you be<br/>\n&gt; able to cast any spells while he hits you on the<br/>\n&gt; head? It&#39;s all well and good doing 1100 damage with<br/>\n&gt; an Ice Comet but how long would it take to cast.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; PS Well done getting to 22nd level, your right it<br/>\n&gt; has to be VERY HARD for us until we reach high<br/>\n&gt; levels.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Valacian wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would be MORE than happy to enter an Arena with<br/>\n&gt; a duel wield barabrian at the same level as me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Valacian - 22nd Level Erudite Wizard, Xegony<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
