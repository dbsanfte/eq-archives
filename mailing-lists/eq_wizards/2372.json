Ever seen a stove that only heats to 50 degrees with a promise<br/>\n&gt; to come fix it some time? Ever see a car that only turns left with a promise to come fix<br/>\n&gt; it some time? No. This happens only in computer software, especially high profile games.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Software industry faces two choices:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Refine their products until nothing can be done, release it after three years,<br/>\n\tand ask $300 per copy<br/>\n- Release a working product, release it after a year, and ask $50 per copy<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother problem is that, if you want to release a product that will be used by 100,000<br/>\npersons, and want it bugless, you need to use 100,000 beta-testers over a period roughly<br/>\nequal to the product lifetime... or people will find bugs.<br/>\n<br/>\n(non-regression testing also delay fixing, yadda, yadda)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
