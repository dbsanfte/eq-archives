These are individuals that try to make up for their<br/>\nlack of self-esteem and inferiority complexes by showing everyone that<br/>\nthey are the &quot;coolest&quot; and the &quot;Baddest&quot; in the world of EQ.  As soon as<br/>\nyou put up a new law restricting their exploits, they&#39;ll find other ways<br/>\nto exploit the system.  Its in their make-up, they can&#39;t not cheat!<br/>\n<br/>\nI do suspect that the majority of people on this list that are defending<br/>\ntwinkers are twinkers themselves but why does it really matter?  The<br/>\nbest advice I can give to anyone is when you see an obvious twinker,<br/>\njust add them to your ignore list.  Feel free to share your ignore list<br/>\nwith other friends on your server.  The best way to get to these people<br/>\nis by pretending that they don&#39;t even exist.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nGennin, E&#39;ci<br/>\n<br/>\nJay Hollums wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Jay Hollums&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhollums@...\">jhollums@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Okay I have to comment, I have been Idle too long....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If they had put in the mud&#39;s little trick of level based equip then there<br/>\n&gt; would never be any twinking...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; IE you cant put on that +25 mana ring till your 20th level....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; simple and perfect... problem solved...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ps this has been in muds for DECADES (no I&#39;m not exagerating this) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
