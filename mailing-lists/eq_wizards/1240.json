I don&#39;t think you have a piercing upgrade &#39;til<br/>\nStiletto and I<br/>\n\t\tbelieve that weapon is designed to be too tough to get until<br/>\nLvl 40+.<br/>\n\t\tAlthough the RTS isn&#39;t perfect, it is pretty good and does<br/>\nprepare you (2H<br/>\n\t\tBlunt skill) for the Observer&#39;s Staff which I think is<br/>\ndesigned for Lvl 30+.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tStats on Oberserver&#39;s Staff:   Dmg 12, Delay 39, +5 INT, +5<br/>\nWIS, +30 MANA<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThis is obviously an excellent weapon to keep in mind...<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI think the information we keep seeing here lends credence<br/>\nto the strategy<br/>\n\t\tof keeping all or at least two of your weapon skills up.
