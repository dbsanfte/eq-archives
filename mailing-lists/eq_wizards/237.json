However, let me point out that what<br/>\nyou&#39;re doing is playing the numbers. It&#39;s like having a D&D character with<br/>\n18/00 str. Sure, it&#39;s nice, but if we all played them then it&#39;d get stale<br/>\nfast.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s just my opinion, and that&#39;s why I stopped putting points into my int<br/>\nat 100/<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZalbar<br/>\n14th Wizard<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
