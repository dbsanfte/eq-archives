A question for all of you guys :<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s funny though, I just checked it again and my Conjuration goes up<br/>\n&gt; when casting the Halo of Light spell.  Is it possible it checks<br/>\n&gt; against both?<br/>\n&gt; My Conjuration was at 0 before I got Halo, because I never used (never<br/>\n&gt; got Eye of Zomm).  Since I started using Halo it&#39;s gone up a few<br/>\n&gt; points, very slowly, to 7 now.  So my guess is it checks against both<br/>\n&gt; Divination and Conjuration.  That&#39;s the only explanation I can come up<br/>\n&gt; with.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, Halo Of Light is pure conjuration.
