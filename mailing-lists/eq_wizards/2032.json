Have any of you seen the<br/>\npicture of the fairy dragon that was posted as a screen shot of the day?<br/>\nThat would be AWSOME flying around your head just providing even a little<br/>\nmore mana and the visual would be GREAT!

Change thier<br/>\nwing colors with your level and make them give us like 5-100 more mana<br/>\n(level dependent).  That would be Amazingly awsome.<br/>\n<br/>\nRutreeii the now lusting wizard.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
