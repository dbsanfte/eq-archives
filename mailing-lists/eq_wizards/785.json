You just have to<br/>\nfind a wizard guild / magic shops.  Most towns have them and there are NPCs<br/>\nfor each class in the building.  Certain NPCs won&#39;t talk to you because you<br/>\naren&#39;t a member of their guild (Enchanter, Magician etc.) but just keep<br/>\ntrying everyone in the building and one of the NPCs will be a wizard and<br/>\nwill sell to you.  I personally know of the wizards guild in the palace of<br/>\nErudin and also the Erudin library is a good place to go.  There is also a<br/>\nmagic shop near the bank in Qeynos.  Those are the places I&#39;ve gone.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Billy Sun &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bsun@...\">bsun@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Thursday, April 22, 1999 3:44 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Wizard Spell<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Billy Sun&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bsun@...\">bsun@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In which town beside Freeport, I can aquire Wizard Spell?
