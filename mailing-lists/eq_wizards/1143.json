I asked because people were saying they had never had a<br/>\nspell damage an opponent that was &quot;6 levels above them&quot; and wondered how<br/>\nthey could figure that so precisely.  But maybe it was NPCs and not monsters<br/>\nthey were fighting.

Monster levels are not the same as player levels from what I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;read.  You can gage it by what kind of monsters you can take on and make<br/>\nan<br/>\n&gt; &gt;estimation from there.  Of course moss snakes and the like are level<br/>\n1..all<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the newbie stuff.  I hear that the Ogre guards in Najena are around level<br/>\n&gt; &gt;20 or something.. but that is just word of mouth that has passed that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;along, I haven&#39;t read anything official to this end.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;At 10:37 AM 5/8/99 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;From: &quot;Joe Wallace&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joew88@...\">joew88@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;How can you tell what level a monster is?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
