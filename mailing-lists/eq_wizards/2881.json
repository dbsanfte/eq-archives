Then Great Staff  Fine Steel<br/>\nRuined Totem Staff.  Also when i was in the 8 to 15 range, I likd my giant<br/>\nsnake fang.  It was a pretty good piercing weapon.  I have also seen wizzies<br/>\nwith suriken but have nevr tried to use the throwing skill much.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a different note, find someone to summong bandages for you and leant bind<br/>\nwounds.   Store bought bandages can be expensive but this skill will dave<br/>\nyour life and give you something useful to do when you have no mana and your<br/>\npart y is low on health.  I have used the skill while my group is fighting<br/>\nto help keep a tank going.  Also sevelope your sense direction and fishing<br/>\nskill/  My experience has shown me begging t be downright useless so dont<br/>\nwaste time doiong it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn closing, It is a big game with lot&#39;s of options and things to try.  Be<br/>\ncreative and unique.<br/>\n<br/>\nBob~0</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
