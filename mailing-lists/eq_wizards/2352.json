You are absolutely correct where you won t find the kind of problems you do in","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-533491200\">Comparing software to consumer electronics is not even a fair comparison.<br/>\nYou are absolutely correct where you won&#39;t <br/>\nfind the kind of problems you do in software as you do in other consumer<br/>\nproducts. But ask yourself this question <br/>\nWhy is software inherently so buggy ? <br/>\nThe answer in my opinion is the consumers. We as consumers demand better<br/>\nsoftware day in day out, we always<br/>\nwant the latest and greatest, the better game, the more featured OS, the<br/>\nfancier word processor. I can&#39;t remember<br/>\nhow many posts i read when EQ was still in beta where people we&#39;re<br/>\ncomplaining that the schedule kept slipping and they<br/>\nwanted it NOW. I think Verant did the best they could too satisfy both<br/>\nend&#39;s of the spectrum. <br/>\n<br/>\n1. Keep the consumers happy by releasing the product as soon as possible.<br/>\n2. Keep the consumers happy by releasing the product as stable as it can be<br/>\nin a timely manner. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s always a double edge sword ... you can slip the schedule to fix bugs,<br/>\nbut then they get flamed for slipping. <br/>\nOr you can release on time with more bugs in the software, then they get<br/>\nflamed for releasing buggy software. <br/>\nThe fact is software companies have learned to live and deal with flames<br/>\nbecause you can never please everyone.<br/>\nThe key is findng a good balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no such thing as bug free software. At least i&#39;ve never seen any<br/>\nsuch thing. You live with the fact that <br/>\nyour operating system (i&#39;m guessing most of you are running some sort of MS<br/>\nWindows) crashes quite often. <br/>\nWe were promised plug-n-play and we got plug-n-pray. Yet we still go out<br/>\nand buy these buggy pieces of software.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy ? because at the end of the day it&#39;s usually better than what we<br/>\ncurrently have and we are willing to put up with <br/>\nthe bugs that are in it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of the day WE are just as much to blame as the developers for<br/>\nbuggy software. WE create the demand and<br/>\nthe developers are just trying to meet that demand. <br/>\n<br/>\nI personally think Verant has done a very reasonable job in handling bugs<br/>\nand getting patches out. I don&#39;t expect or ask<br/>\nfor perfection in software because i truly believe it does not exist. All I<br/>\nask is that bugs/problems get dealt with in a timely<br/>\nmanner. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 03:11 PM 6/14/99 -0300, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Sergey Bukhman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sergeyb@...\">sergeyb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;mstokes wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: mstokes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mstokes@...\">mstokes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Two things.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; First, you will never have a project of this magnitude without having some <br/>\n&gt;bugs<br/>\n&gt;&gt; making it to release undiscovered.  Software is inherently buggy, its a <br/>\n&gt;fact of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; life, get used to it, you will see it happen more and more.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Being a software designer, I tend to notice that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Second, they have stated that people found exploiting a bug will be <br/>\n&gt;warned.  If they<br/>\n&gt;&gt; continue to exploit the bug, then they will be punished.  Its painfully <br/>\n&gt;obvious why<br/>\n&gt;&gt; they don&#39;t list bugs.  They don&#39;t want to be forced into policing them <br/>\n&gt;24/7.  If you<br/>\n&gt;&gt; stumble onto something that is a blatent bug, report it so that it gets <br/>\n&gt;fixed, and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; move on.  If you find something that could go either way, enjoy it until a <br/>\n&gt;GM/Guide<br/>\n&gt;&gt; tells you to stop.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thing is, they released buggy software. I paid good money for it, and keep <br/>\n&gt;paying every<br/>\n&gt;month.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;They should take care of it. Their game. My money. Their problem, not mine. <br/>\n&gt;As a<br/>\n&gt;consumer, I shouldn&#39;t even have to think about these things. What happens is <br/>\n&gt;that the<br/>\n&gt;game designers are aware as to how much the gaming public is involved in the <br/>\n&gt;process of<br/>\n&gt;making designing games, so the EXPLOIT us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Have you ever seen a TV released that only shows prime number channels, with <br/>\n&gt;a promise<br/>\n&gt;to come fix it some time? Ever seen a stove that only heats to 50 degrees <br/>\n&gt;with a promise<br/>\n&gt;to come fix it some time? Ever see a car that only turns left with a promise <br/>\n&gt;to come fix<br/>\n&gt;it some time? No. This happens only in computer software, especially high <br/>\n&gt;profile games.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;Sergey<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;KPS PUNK (Paramilitary Undercover Nuclear Kamikaze)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Join a new list today!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-------------------------------------------------<br/>\nSaleen : High Elf Wizard - Xegony<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:saleengt@...\">saleengt@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
