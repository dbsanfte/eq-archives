Look at EVERY merchant in the whole<br/>\nplace....this will mean going up to everyone and right clicking them.  Think<br/>\nabout it, Shielding (new shield spell available) is available to more than<br/>\njust wizards (all mages I think) and you can also use Invisibility (rank 2<br/>\nMagician spell).  You will find them there...trust me.  Keep looking on all<br/>\nfloors and levels.   Also, be sure to buy shieldskin if you plan on soloing<br/>\nor want that extra protection from hits.  Then make damn sure you buy about<br/>\n10 Cat&#39;s Eye Agate gems from the merchant lady when you first get teleported<br/>\ninto the guild.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Ziffnab<br/>\n18th Wizard...Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Riviere Stephane [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Stephane.Riviere@...\">Stephane.Riviere@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 06, 1999 8:38 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Again where and where ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: =?iso-8859-1?Q?Rivi=E8re_St=E9phane?= &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Stephane.Riviere@...\">Stephane.Riviere@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi all,<br/>\ni am near level 16 now (very close in fact) and i need to buy some spell.
