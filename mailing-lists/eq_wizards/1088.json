Level is most important when<br/>\ndetermining if your spell will take its full damage on the target.  You do<br/>\nnot need a higher rank spell to cast, you just need to level.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously, no one does well against red considering creatures.  Unless you<br/>\nhave SOW on and are targeting something like an elephant in south karana.<br/>\nEven then, you will run out of mana before getting close to killing the RED<br/>\ncreature.  The higher the creature&#39;s level, the more they can resist your<br/>\nspells.  It is that simple.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was hitting tentacle terrors (level 20-24) with my shock of fire spell<br/>\n(2nd rank spell) and hitting it with Shock of Lightning.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are only some critters you can hit that are red (the really should<br/>\nconsider &quot;pink&quot; since they are in the first level of red above yellow<br/>\nCOnsiders).<br/>\n<br/>\n- Ziffnab<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Riviere Stephane [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Stephane.Riviere@...\">Stephane.Riviere@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, May 07, 1999 5:28 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Please help me :(<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: =?iso-8859-1?Q?Rivi=E8re_St=E9phane?= &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Stephane.Riviere@...\">Stephane.Riviere@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi all,<br/>\nso i get some questions for hard gamers :)<br/>\n1. First i am a fan of quest :). But in freeport, the arcan scientist don t<br/>\nwant to give me any quest :(. I know that i must raise my faction if i want<br/>\nto make quests for them but how ???? Killing deathfist centurion and so<br/>\nraise faction with commond resident. Are the scientist residents ? If i can<br/>\nnot do any quest for them then how to raise my faction with them ? What the<br/>\nmonsters who raise faction with scientist ?<br/>\n2. Second, a wizzard is useles vs red monsters... Yesterday i was fighting<br/>\nwith 3 friend same level as me orc warrior from blue ro red. For the blue,<br/>\nnp. But for the white yellow and red don t even try with a caster group..<br/>\nWhy ? Normally shock of lightening can do 82 dommage... In three hours<br/>\nfighting with orc, 3 or 4 times i do 82 hp dommage... But usually i do 12,<br/>\n14 , 4 or whatever but not the max... I have tried fire spel, ice spel, same<br/>\nthey don t resist the whole dommage but they resist very well.. So i go<br/>\nfighting crocodile.. Deep water croco.. Considering red.... and same : i<br/>\nnearly never do max dommage (nearly never the half dommage in fact sigh :(<br/>\n). I can understand that if they are red i need a level 16 spel to hurt them<br/>\nbad (i am currently 15) but that s really stupid.. If i try to kill red with<br/>\nfriends and that i dont  dommage the monsters i am useless vs red creatures<br/>\ncause my spels are resisted !! In others words, you must kill blue creatures<br/>\nto be sure you do the max dommage... But one of my friend is necro level<br/>\n15... And you know what ? HE ALWAYS do the max dommage he can handle... ok<br/>\nit s only 42 for the attack spel but he always do 42, same for war undead<br/>\nalways the max !!!! i regret that with these fact a wizzard can nearly not<br/>\nkill more then blue creatures... By the way, i have killed some days ago a<br/>\ndervish thug alone cons. yellow for me.. And all my spel were working at<br/>\nmax... Any idea ? it s just a question of magic resist ? Why the necro spel<br/>\ndoes always max dommage ? (and are never never resisted at all ! Heat blood,<br/>\nwar undead life tap and so ! )<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all the help !<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nyakos<br/>\n<br/>\nlevel 15 <br/>\n<br/>\np.s. thanks for all the guys who tell me where the spel in freeport was :)<br/>\nin fact i just don t see the stairs to upper level :) thanks again :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nCongratulations to TOWERSHIGH, our latest ONElist of the Week.  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nVisit our homepage and share with us how ONElist is changing YOUR life!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
