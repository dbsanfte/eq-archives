If you click<br/>\non news, it will give you the updates going back quite a while.  Farther<br/>\nback than that, though, I&#39;m not sure.  You could try the official Everquest<br/>\nsite; they might have some older ones.  And you can also try Everquest<br/>\nStratics.  They have archived news.  If you scroll down to the very bottom<br/>\nof their main page, there is a link to archived news.  I don&#39;t know how far<br/>\nback it goes, but the last time I needed to look something up I seem to<br/>\nremember it going back several months.  Their pages always list the updates<br/>\nthat the patch server prints out, so you might find them all there.  They<br/>\nare at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eqss.stratics.com/\">http://eqss.stratics.com/</a>    Hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nJW<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: James Blanchard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Redevil001@...\">Redevil001@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, September 15, 1999 8:16 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] back after 3 months and need some help<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;James Blanchard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Redevil001@...\">Redevil001@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I went away for the summer and am finally back, but to my regret, when I<br/>\n&gt; updated my EQ, it only listed the most recent updates and I have no clue<br/>\n&gt; what has gone on in the past 3 months! I also decided to join a pvp-teams<br/>\n&gt; server but I don&#39;t even know the teams! Anyone know where I could get a<br/>\nlist<br/>\n&gt; of all the updates?
