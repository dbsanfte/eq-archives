I might have had to run about<br/>\n50% of the time from the skeletons unless there was someone there to give me<br/>\na hand when i got in too deep, but I only had to run about 5% of the time<br/>\nfrom the aviaks.  There are so many things to fight at this level it is<br/>\nunreal.  The people that complain how they can&#39;t solo should either 1) find<br/>\na group or 2) explore a bit more.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I like to group.  After soloing from level 22 to 24 I was bored<br/>\nout of my mind.  In a group downtime seems so less significant because you<br/>\nhave someone to chat with.  Also grouping affords much greater safety than<br/>\nbeing alone.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Solric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: St Nick [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roeelf@...\">roeelf@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 09, 1999 9:53 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_wizards] I dont know why u play a wizard, but...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: St Nick &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:roeelf@...\">roeelf@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nId like to see you solo one blue at 21rst , you run 80% of the time<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nLooking to expand your world?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nONElist has over 165,000 e-mail communities from which to choose!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
