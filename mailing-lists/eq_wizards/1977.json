It&#39;s not like there aren&#39;t any skulls in the game. I mean,<br/>\nthere are dozens of different undead skeleton types. But still we are<br/>\nscrewed over. When I hold the skull now, it looks like I have a lump on<br/>\nmy wrist. They just use the usual bag placeholder object, but a little<br/>\nenlarged.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is downright embarrassing, folks. It looks like all the non magical<br/>\nclasses got all the cool toys, and we are left to the dogs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, ask them to implement more varied spell animation. It&#39;s laughable<br/>\nwhen both lighting bolt and fire bolt look the same. And Shock of<br/>\nlightning looks red. Come on, it&#39;s really hard to get in to the game<br/>\nwith such lame repeating effects.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease don&#39;t overlook this, because if looks really didn&#39;t matter, why<br/>\nare we playing a 3D MUD, when we could play a regular one?<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nSergey<br/>\n--<br/>\nKPS PUNK (Paramilitary Undercover Nuclear Kamikaze)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
