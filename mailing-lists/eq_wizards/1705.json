Someone from Verant said that they do have<br/>\n&quot;soft&quot; level limits on items where a high level item won&#39;t benefit a player<br/>\nuntil they reach the &quot;soft&quot; level limit that was set for this item.  That<br/>\nfull suit of gossamer, woven, flowing black robes, etc might be better than<br/>\ncloth sure, but not by a whole lot at low levels.  Like another person<br/>\nposted, this twinker will get beaten on just as severely as a newbie in<br/>\ncloth armor.  I do not twink because it cheapens my experience of the game.<br/>\nEach character I make has to earn everything for themself.  If it doesnt<br/>\ncheapen the experience for other players (read powerplayers, losers, morons)<br/>\nthen thats their own problem.  Norrath is a big world, and I know plenty of<br/>\nzones with really good hunting that only have a couple players in them at<br/>\nany one time.<br/>\n <br/>\n-Solric of the 5th circle<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Neil Lambert [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smartass@...\">smartass@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Saturday, May 22, 1999 3:47 PM<br/>\nTo: EQ_Wizards<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Horrifying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ni was in the bank at freeport today when i saw the most horrifying thing<br/>\ni&#39;ve ever seen. a LEVEL TWO erudite magician (how&#39;d she get there??) with a<br/>\nFLOWING BLACK ROBE and RUNED TOTEM STAFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>\n <br/>\nthis should be against the rules</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
