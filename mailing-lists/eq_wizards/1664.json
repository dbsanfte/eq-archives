This is my first (and probably last) mailing list and I didn&#39;t realize that they are only for one-shot answers to questions.  Does anyone know of a good forum (or whatever they are online) where I could go to for Everquest spell complaints/suggestions?  Besides having beta tested for UO, playing Everquest and various info searches, I dont really spend any &quot;social&quot; time online and didnt realize that I was breaking Netiquette rules here.<br/>\n         <br/>\n        Thanks</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
