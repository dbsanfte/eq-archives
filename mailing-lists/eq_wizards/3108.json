I came up<br/>\n&gt; with two ideas besides us getting more mana points.  Other RPG&#39;s like<br/>\n&gt; Final Fantasy, they have potions that restore some mana.  What if we<br/>\n&gt; were to have something like that.  Like a kind of mana potion or<br/>\n&gt; something.  Then we would be more useful in groups, less meditating<br/>\n&gt; time, and we would be able to fight solo....First root when getting low<br/>\n&gt; on mana then bandage and cast.  The second idea that I had was a item or<br/>\n&gt; piece of  equipment (or many items and pieces of equipment) that would<br/>\n&gt; quicken the meditating process. Like a staff that would make our mana go<br/>\n&gt; up 20% faster or whatever.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kodros<br/>\n&gt; Server of Prexus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     GRAB THE GATOR!
