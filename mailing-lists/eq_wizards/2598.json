She was<br/>\nkilling Orc&#39;s on the Kithi side of the<br/>\npass. So I cast the eye - moved it around the ORC spawning area - but<br/>\ncould not see her.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe, however could see me ( the eye ) - then I noticed when I went to<br/>\nmeet her that there where a LOT more Players in the area than I could<br/>\nsee through the eye before .<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked her to stay there and repeated it again . Out of the 10 players<br/>\npresent - I could only see 2 through the eye - the others were just not<br/>\nvisable. I could see all the ORC&#39;s that spawned - just not all the<br/>\nplayers - through the eye.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this some form of &quot; cant see all the PC&#39;s through the eye &quot; bug ?<br/>\n<br/>\nJunerius.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
