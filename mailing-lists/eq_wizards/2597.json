Right now my Int is only 130, but with a<br/>\ndecent group I&#39;m never using more than 20% mana in a fight anyway (unless things<br/>\nget ugly).  I&#39;ve gotten my Dex up to 101 and at level 12 I regain concentration<br/>\nat least once every 2 fights.  That is when the mob gets to me :).  High<br/>\ndexterity and intelligence is great for trade skills.  I&#39;ll gain 2 skill points<br/>\nfor every three to four attempts while baking and brewing, and have a success<br/>\nrate much higher than the spoiler boards predict.  I certainly hopes this holds<br/>\ntrue when it comes to spell research.  I think Gnomes will hold a very clear<br/>\nadvantage in this area.  I just wish we had more choices when it comes to our<br/>\nrobe selection.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nMalkin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
