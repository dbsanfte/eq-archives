I don&#39;t care if people twink, don&#39;t get me wrong <br/>\nit pisses me off, but i really don&#39;t care.  What i really hate is the guild <br/>\ncamping.  I don&#39;t want to join a guild but it seems i might have to just to <br/>\nget the good equipment.  I think that&#39;s more of a problem then twinking.  I <br/>\nsay leave twinking alone and concentrate on stuff that could really affect <br/>\nyou.  just my 2 cents!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nParthon lvl 12<br/>\nSolosek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
