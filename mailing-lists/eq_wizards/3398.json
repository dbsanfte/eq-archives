My xp was crawling when I was getting Aviaks <br/>\nthrough level 23...I headed to Cazic and in one night I almost got 2 levels. <br/>\n  21 might be a bit low, but I&#39;ve definitely seen people there at that <br/>\nlevel.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Im on 3 wizard lists, cant tell them apart honestly.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The Graffe site message board is pretty interesting...loads of info on how <br/>\nto people have been doing quests and such.
