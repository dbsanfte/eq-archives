Unfortunately<br/>\n&gt;&gt;as I had never used a staff before my skill was at &quot;awful&quot; level. No matter<br/>\n&gt;&gt;how much I use it I can not seem to get my 2H blunt skill up. And I am<br/>\n&gt;&gt;fighting blues or higher with it. I poured a bunch of practice points into<br/>\n&gt;&gt;2H blunt, so now it is at &quot;very bad&quot; level, and I do more damage with it,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;but still have never gotten a message saying my skill has gone up. I did<br/>\n&gt;&gt;get a message about my offense skill going up, but that&#39;s it. Is there some<br/>\n&gt;&gt;trick to this?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Greg (Kronan)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Did you know each week we feature a ONElist story?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;How has ONElist changed your life?
