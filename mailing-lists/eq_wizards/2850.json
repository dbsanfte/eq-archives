I&#39;ve been drifting between Najena and SKaranas for a while now and <br/>\nI&#39;m getting bored.  Unrest is hopeless for me because the lag is <br/>\nintolerable.  I heard Cazic is good, but it seems we&#39;re relatively unwanted <br/>\nthere till we are about level 27+ or so.  Any advice?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Ho guys are you stil alive? :)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Two months ago it was 2 digest per day and now heu ONE message per day &gt;:)<br/>\nEveryone is on hollyday or everyone now play another race/classes ? &gt;(there<br/>\nare less wizzard right now :( )<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;WAKE UP ALL WE ARE STILL ALIVE !:) heu i hope so  :) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
