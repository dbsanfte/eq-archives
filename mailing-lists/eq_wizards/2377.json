 we all congratulated<br/>\neach<br/>\n&gt; other on a terrific battle, and then went to clean our britches out heh.<br/>\n&gt; one of the best we&#39;ve had, and one of the most &quot;organized&quot; (one death and<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; would have been considered a failure).  it just worked out that everybody<br/>\n&gt; knew what we were supposed to be doing (no, we didn&#39;t plan on pulling 5,<br/>\nbut<br/>\n&gt; it just ended up like that, and we had a zone close by, so we knew we<br/>\ncould<br/>\n&gt; run if needed).  mind you, that at this level, i probably could not have<br/>\n&gt; taken one on my own. i probably would have had a resist or two, or maybe a<br/>\n&gt; spell that did half dmg, or enstill may falter, etc....  Some of you may<br/>\n&gt; say, &quot;well, lets see, 6 of you, five of them, all blue, with one white....<br/>\n&gt; your group could have just individually solo&#39;ed them&quot;.  NOT! remember, the<br/>\n&gt; whole is greater than the sum of it&#39;s parts :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; all dmg tolled, i didn&#39;t get touched once (everybody else but the shaman<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; less than half health, the shaman was 3/4 health), but i was able to cast<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; the beginning (doing 34dmg) as well as keeping the melee guys from being<br/>\nhit<br/>\n&gt; as much (although i do wish the recovery time on tishan was a little<br/>\n&gt; quicker, as i&#39;m really starting to like it).  if i ever blasted with my<br/>\n&gt; biggie twice on a baddie, he woulda come after me (unless the second blast<br/>\n&gt; was a finisher of course).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; the point of this msg is to show you that 1.) the stun spell we get at 20<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; not very useful when solo&#39;ing, but it sure did come in handy that night,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; 2.) i don&#39;t care what anybody says, no other spellcasting class could have<br/>\n&gt; replaced me in that particular fight (mainly because of the dmg/mana ratio<br/>\ni<br/>\n&gt; was getting on my dmg spells, as i was casting when the monster was over<br/>\n&gt; half dead, which usually means full dmg), and 3.) you can use your big<br/>\n&gt; spells in a fight (and should as they are normally gonna be your best<br/>\n&gt; dmg/mana ratio spells), and 4.) monsters don&#39;t frenzy you if you time your<br/>\n&gt; casts right, and don&#39;t get to rapped up in *blasting* the heck out of the<br/>\n&gt; monsters.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; if anybody else has any cool or unusual group fights involving us little<br/>\n&gt; &#39;ole wizzies, i&#39;d love to hear them, as I&#39;m still trying to master the art<br/>\n&gt; of grouping without getting hit...  it&#39;s real tough holding back when you<br/>\n&gt; know you can blast that baddie straight to errr. well, a bad place :)<br/>\nit&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; also very embarrassing to start your group tell &quot;oom!!! oom!!!&quot; when<br/>\nthere&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; still one or two baddies left :(<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sinlaru Ce`alen<br/>\n&gt; Rallos Zek<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ps. this fight went real fast, so some of my details may be a little<br/>\nsketchy<br/>\n&gt; :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Last chance to earn $5000 for your charity of choice!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Deadline for &quot;GROW TO GIVE&quot; is June 19.
