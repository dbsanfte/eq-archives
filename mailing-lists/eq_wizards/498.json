David&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mcgraw.Thomas@...\">Mcgraw.Thomas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; First off congrats on killing such a tough&gt; �bastard�now let me try and<br/>\n&gt; explain why you shouldn&#39;t be able to learn from that. Take the same<br/>\n&gt; situation with 2 12th level characters and 1 50th level cleric. All are in<br/>\n&gt; the same guild and the cleric wants to help them level up. The 2 warriors<br/>\n&gt; are joined but the cleric is not. The fighters jump the wooly�mammoth and<br/>\n&gt; can actually hit it(which surprised me but if you said you were killing it<br/>\n&gt; then your warriors were obviously able to hit it). They are� pounding on it<br/>\n&gt; but are getting beat down rather quickly and have no real chance of killing<br/>\n&gt; the hairy beast so the cleric jumps in a casts one of his low level heal<br/>\n&gt; spells and all of his buffs(which at 50th level are quite impressive and<br/>\n&gt; make even�a 12th level character a worthy opponent). Now that they are both<br/>\n&gt; healed and buffed they continue the fight. But even with these buffs they<br/>\n&gt; still are getting beat down so the cleric heals them up again(even if the<br/>\n&gt; critter turns on the cleric for healing them he will just sit there because<br/>\n&gt; the mammoth has little to no chance of actually hurting him significantly).<br/>\n&gt; He continues to heal them until they finally manage to beat the mammoth<br/>\n&gt; down. Now the cleric didn&#39;t do any damage to it so he won&#39;t get any exp but<br/>\n&gt; the two warriors who are grouped up do. And with the level difference<br/>\n&gt; between them and the critter they gain an exorbitant amout of experience,<br/>\n&gt; much more than what they actually earned considering they had a max level<br/>\n&gt; character helping them. That is why they implemented it like this, to avoid<br/>\n&gt; this type of situation.<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; You may say this would never happen but I have already seen it on my server.<br/>\n&gt; Not only this type but also the &quot;twinking&quot; of guilds and friends. Granted<br/>\n&gt; there aren&#39;t any 50th level characters yet but there are 30th level clerics<br/>\n&gt; and such wandering around in guilds. Anyway that is my opinion on the<br/>\n&gt; situation.<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; Yours,<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; ~Aereuss Ravins of Tarew Marr<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Gooey Smalls [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smullins@...\">smullins@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, April 23, 1999 7:20 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eq_wizards] Linear game play<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ��� Were you aware that the game of EverQuest is linear game play,<br/>\n&gt; reminiscent of the console RPG&#39;s and single player RPG&#39;s of yore.� &quot;But you<br/>\n&gt; can go anywhere&quot;, you say, well my friend here&#39;s how you are wrong.� Two<br/>\n&gt; groups of 6 formed last night to try to take down a Wolly Mammoth (not a<br/>\n&gt; calf but a full blown lvl 20+ 1000 HP 50 damage a hit and 2 hits a round<br/>\n&gt; mammoth).� Which surprisingly we accomplished this feat with noone over lvl<br/>\n&gt; 12 in either of the two groups on the Bertoxxulous server.� When the great<br/>\n&gt; beast fell noone earned any EXP or could loot the body.� 20 or so peitions<br/>\n&gt; were sent and 2 GM&#39;s showed up, one to help and one to show off his awesome<br/>\n&gt; equipment and levitate there like a pimp.� Basically if a creature is more<br/>\n&gt; than 2 times you lvl you get no EXP even if you kill it fairly, to prevent<br/>\n&gt; exploits and trapping monsters behind rocks.� We later demonstrated for the<br/>\n&gt; GM&#39;s by killing another Mammoth, this time we only lost 1 warrior (the first<br/>\n&gt; time it was 5).� Now they claim it is partly a design flaw and partly a bug<br/>\n&gt; within the game...now my question to you is, do you like being told what is<br/>\n&gt; too strong for you to possibly kill and therefore you get no EXP?� I know I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t care if it&#39;s god and 100 lvl 1&#39;s killed the god of hate...i want the<br/>\n&gt; exp.� I suggest everyone petition and use the feedback option to complain to<br/>\n&gt; verant about this.&gt; � This is a total contradiction of what they claim the<br/>\n&gt; game is about (you know how hard it is to convince ppl we can kill a<br/>\n&gt; mammoth?) and what was our reward? nothing...this is a tragedy...i&#39;m about<br/>\n&gt; to go Colorado on some fools...!<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; Teferi level 12 wizard Bertoxxulous server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Did you know that we add over 1,000 new e-mail communities every day?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Explore a new hobby, discover a new friend, laugh at a new joke!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
