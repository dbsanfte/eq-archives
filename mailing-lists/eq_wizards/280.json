If you dont like doing it.  Stick to adventuring.  The best advice someone can give you, is to play your character how you think your character would play.  Or roleplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone can be a succesful tailor as long as they stick with it.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;re going to need to put a few points towards the skill, else you&#39;ll be wasting a LOT of time and money building your skills up.  I&#39;ve even heard of people putting around 20 points into the skill just to help their success rates out.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn jewelcraft, ...  it is a VERY expensive craft to learn.  Plan on spending a lot of plat just getting your base skill down.  However, the payoff is really good.  Some jewels sell for a couple plat, some sell for hundreds.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if you put lots of time into either of these, it will become profitable.  As I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve found fishing to be. Remember when you first started fishing?  Your skills were so low, you failed lots?   Tailoring is a lot harder to learn than fishing.  ...and Jewelcraft is harder than tailoring.   It all depends on what you think your character would do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways..  hope that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrev<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tLarimus La&#39;shain[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:larimus@...\">larimus@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tTuesday, April 20, 1999 8:36 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[eq_wizards] Trade Skills<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Larimus La&#39;shain&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:larimus@...\">larimus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What is a good trade skill for a Wizard. I&#39;m 12 th level and I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; decent at fishing ( 50 something ) I&#39;m wondering if it would be worth <br/>\n&gt; my time to take up something like tailoring or jewelcraft. Or would <br/>\n&gt; it be just a lot of boring not very profitable work and I should just <br/>\n&gt; stick to adventuring.
