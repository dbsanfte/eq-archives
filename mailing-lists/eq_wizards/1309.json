Damn I wish I could remember the article&#92;&#39;s <br/>\nlocation on this.  A reporter went to lunch with Smedley and the head programmer<br/>\n<br/>\nfor the mage classes.  he asked asked them this question and they confirmed that<br/>\n<br/>\nit was not true, 100% false.  The head caster programmer said that his GM <br/>\nCharacter had a Staff of Discord, which is the same staff that the Priest of <br/>\nDiscord is holding.  Now they didn&#92;&#39;t say this was unattainable for us, nor that<br/>\n<br/>\nkilling the Priest of Discord would render it to us.  So may be that their is a <br/>\nquest to get this staff or something, but there is no way to combine the two.  <br/>\nThey said you have to decide do you want the 2h staff and its magic or the the <br/>\nskull with a dagger/fang or whatever.  So Brad you are correct :)<br/>\n<br/>\nZakrul The Traveler<br/>\nCompanion<br/>\nWizard<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Message: 16<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Any of you Wizards out there know what skull, you need to combine with a<br/>\n&gt; Ruined Totem Staff...and what NPC combines them for you?<br/>\n <br/>\n&gt; Auraelle<br/>\n&gt; E&#92;&#39;ci Server<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message: 19<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;    Unless someone can come right out and give exact NPC names and info<br/>\n&gt; right now, assume that combining the rts and the skull is just a rumor. As<br/>\n&gt; far as I know, the staff that Priests of Discord carry are actually<br/>\n&gt; _different_ weapons and not a combo of these two items. No one to my<br/>\n&gt; knowledge has actually been able to combine the two though many like to<br/>\n&gt; claim that it is possible.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Isand<br/>\n <br/>\n&gt; Message: 23<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 13 May 1999 18:20:42 -0400<br/>\n&gt;    From: &#92;&quot;Brad Fetkovich&#92;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetko1@...\">fetko1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Staff Question<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; where did this rumor even get started?  the skull goes in a melee slot, who<br/>\n&gt; thought up putting it on a staff?  the priest of discords staff is<br/>\n&gt; different, it&#92;&#39;s a staff of discord if i&#92;&#39;m not mistaken<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-----------------------------------------------------<br/>\nThis mail sent through IMP: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://web.horde.org/imp/\">http://web.horde.org/imp/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nONElist:  where the world talks!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nJoin a new list today.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
