I<br/>\nlove Thunderstrike when it works but mine seems to get resisted a lot.  It<br/>\nreminds me of what the Terrors used on me when I was fighting them.  At<br/>\nleast until I learned I could root them and my bolt spell had a longer range<br/>\nthen their spells.  I&#39;d still laugh my butt off as my shamen friend would<br/>\nget blasted by me .
