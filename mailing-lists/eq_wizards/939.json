I do not know which magician spell it is used for since im not a <br/>\n(poor) magician :). Words have the same value as a rune, about 1pp and some <br/>\ngold if you sell it in a store, but i strongly suggest that you sell it to a <br/>\nmagician since it is really really hard to find both runes and words and us <br/>\nspellcasters should support each other. I suggest taking max. 2pp for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRotas Koth, Innoruuk.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
