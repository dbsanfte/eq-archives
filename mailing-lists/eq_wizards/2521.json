Frogloks have netted armor, which is exactly the same as<br/>\ncloth, but as light or lighter as small sizes - thus you can scrap 1 or<br/>\n2 units of weight. Probably not worth the bother. It wasn&#39;t for me: I&#39;m<br/>\nhigh elf, and thus able to wear small size.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter this, you must relocate to Freeport. Woven armor is gotten out of<br/>\nFrogloks too, but you must go down to the Innothule Swamp and their home<br/>\nof Upper Guk for this. Woven is about equivalent to patchwork, and can<br/>\nbe worn by all races & classes, and is light.<br/>\n<br/>\nDamask is from Najena mostly, equivalent to leather, and limited to casters.<br/>\nIt&#39;s a tad too high level for you now, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you have Gossamer, which is high level stuff :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
