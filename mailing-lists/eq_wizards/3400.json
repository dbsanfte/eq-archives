Not for all of them. The only ones who would help you are<br/>\n&gt;real high levels who know lower guk and who can pull the deepwater &gt;gobs<br/>\n&gt;out of the way in oasis while you get the rod. All the other rods are<br/>\n&gt;easy. A group of your level would only end up dead. At best, someone<br/>\n&gt;will die and you will get away with the rod.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh no...I was talking about the rune of scale for the Runescale cloak?   I <br/>\nunderstand it was supposed to be carried by saltwater crocs in the back <br/>\nregions of Upper Guk?  Sure hope I&#39;m camping the right spot hehe.<br/>\nBut anyway, I think I&#39;ll try do the Staff of Wheel over this weekend.
