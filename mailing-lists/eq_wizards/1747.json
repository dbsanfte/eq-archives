Where is this secret location you<br/>\n&gt; might ask?  Well it is non other than Lake Rathe.  The Lake support Aviak<br/>\n&gt; Guards that are great exp and loot for soloing.  There are several Island<br/>\n&gt; inside Lake Rathe and have different variations of the Gaurds, ie., !<br/>\nguard<br/>\n&gt; Post with 1 Guard, or 1 Guard Post with 2 guards or 2 Posts with 1 Gaurd<br/>\n&gt; each Post......  So choose you destiny.  I would HIGHLY suggest not taking<br/>\n&gt; on the 2 guards at once unless you have someone with you.  Even at lvl 24<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; find it very difficuly to fight 2 solo.  Reason being is that they are Lvl<br/>\n&gt; 20-24 but Hit like Lvl 30 Mobs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also a bit of warning.....If you do not have high swimming skills you best<br/>\n&gt; get them up there fast.  The Lake supports a Sea Monster (lvl 53 Mob) that<br/>\n&gt; hits for over 100+ per shot.  Now there are boats to tkate you from island<br/>\n&gt; to island but mostly I swam.  Started with a low swimming and now have 120<br/>\n&gt; swimming in 4.5 Lvls.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well Good Luck, and hope this helps all those stuggling to reach 20+.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shadair J&#39;Axx<br/>\n&gt; 23rd Wizard<br/>\n&gt; Karana<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; With more than 17 million e-mails exchanged daily...<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ....ONElist is THE place where the world talks!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
