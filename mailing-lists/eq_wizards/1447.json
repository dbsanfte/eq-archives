But<br/>\n\tas noted by the fellow below, they only get DD spells every other<br/>\ncircle<br/>\n\twhereas we get them each circle.  So at level 8 both me and my<br/>\nmagician<br/>\n\tfriend did almost the same damage (I think his shock spell did 31<br/>\nwhile mine<br/>\n\tdid 36 and his bolt spell did 40 where mine did 45 for the same mana<br/>\ncost).<br/>\n\tBUT...  At level 12 he is still using his old DD spells for 35 and<br/>\n44<br/>\n\tdamage, where I have a new spell that does 78.  By level 15 he will<br/>\nSTILL be<br/>\n\tusing his level 8 DD spells for 35 and 44 damage, while my lightning<br/>\nwill do<br/>\n\t81.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\tAt level 16 he will get a new DD shock spell (the same one which we<br/>\nwizards<br/>\n\tget) which will bring him again close to the damage that we do<br/>\n(lower by 13<br/>\n\tpoints though).  Something to keep in mind is that at level 16 we<br/>\nalso get a<br/>\n\tDD bolt spell that the magicians do not get, lightning bolt, which<br/>\nstarts at<br/>\n\t118 damage or so (not sure exact figure), so compared to his 91<br/>\ndamage shock<br/>\n\tspell we can still do almost 30 more damage.  And again keep in mind<br/>\nthat at<br/>\n\tlevel 23 he will still be using this level 16 spell while we will<br/>\nhave<br/>\n\tgotten a new and more powerful one at level 20.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo all in all magicians at times come near (but not close) to the<br/>\ndamage<br/>\n\tthat we can inflict, but most of the time they are quite far behind.<br/>\nAnd it<br/>\n\tof course makes sense seeing that they have a pet to protect them<br/>\nand do<br/>\n\tdamage.  We have only ourselves to rely on and I must say that I<br/>\nlike it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t-Solric of the 4th circle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tFrom: &quot;Ken Morris&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kmorris2@...\">kmorris2@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe Mage&#39;s 16th lvl spell is not as powerful as ours, but it is<br/>\nclose.  They<br/>\n\tstart off at 91 dmg we start off with 104 dmg.  Also, they don&#39;t get<br/>\nanother<br/>\n\tDD spell until 24th, where as we get one at 20th and 24th.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tTalarin Kal&#39;Amon, High Elven Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> \t----- Original Message -----<br/>\n\tFrom: Ziffnab MageStorm &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_ziffnab@...\">eq_ziffnab@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n\tTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n\tSent: Monday, May 17, 1999 9:15 AM<br/>\n\tSubject: [eq_wizards] Magicians and Wizards (irritation)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t&gt; From: Ziffnab MageStorm &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_ziffnab@...\">eq_ziffnab@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n\t&gt;<br/>\n\t&gt; During my adventures over the past weekend I happened to group<br/>\nwith a<br/>\n\t&gt; very nice magician and his pet &quot;Gonaker.&quot;  We did very well<br/>\ntogether<br/>\n\t&gt; and had fun.<br/>\n\t&gt;<br/>\n\t&gt; The problem was that he made claims that he can strike a target<br/>\nfor DD<br/>\n\t&gt; equal to mine.  We were both level 19 and sad thing is, I think he<br/>\nis<br/>\n\t&gt; right!  Can anyone tell me how much mana is used and damage<br/>\ndelivered<br/>\n\t&gt; for the magician DD spell (16th level) equivelant to Fire Shock?<br/>\nI<br/>\n\t&gt; have a feeling it will be the same which is sad really.<br/>\n\t&gt;<br/>\n\t&gt; Before I rant on my class I will need to know the truth on this<br/>\nmatter.<br/>\n\t&gt;  I love being a wizard and believe the long road to true power is<br/>\na<br/>\n\t&gt; long one.  But we should be doing more damage than a damn magician<br/>\nand<br/>\n\t&gt; plus he gets a pet.
