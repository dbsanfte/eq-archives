Put one sharpening stone<br/>\n(4cp), and one rusty dagger (free) into a forge and click combine.  At a zero<br/>\nskill level you have roughly a 50/50 shot of making a tarnished dagger.  It<br/>\nwon&#39;t seel for anymore than a rusty dagger, but it raises your smithing skill<br/>\nfor the heck of it, and it gives you something to do with all those daggers you<br/>\nget fishing.  They sell for nothing anyway.<br/>\nI believe the stats on the tarnished dagger are 22/3as opposed to 24/3.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo any bakers out there know what you need to combine meat and bread to make a<br/>\nsandwich.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalkin<br/>\nThe Jack of all Trades Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; great staff and the dinky tarnished dagger (to get a tarnished dagger,<br/>\n&gt; find a smith, or contact a scout of Tunare - one of their quests yield<br/>\n&gt; a tarnished dagger).<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
