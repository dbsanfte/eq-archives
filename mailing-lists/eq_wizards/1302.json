Damn I wish I could remember the article&#92;&#39;s \r<br/>\nlocation on this.  A reporter went to lunch with Smedley and the head programmer<br/>\n\r<br/>\nfor the mage classes.  he asked asked them this question and they confirmed that<br/>\n\r<br/>\nit was not true, 100% false.  The head caster programmer said that his GM \r<br/>\nCharacter had a Staff of Discord, which is the same staff that the Priest of \r<br/>\nDiscord is holding.  Now they didn&#92;&#39;t say this was unattainable for us, nor that<br/>\n\r<br/>\nkilling the Priest of Discord would render it to us.  So may be that their is a \r<br/>\nquest to get this staff or something, but there is no way to combine the two.  \r<br/>\nThey said you have to decide do you want the 2h staff and its magic or the the \r<br/>\nskull with a dagger/fang or whatever.  So Brad you are correct :)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nZakrul The Traveler\r<br/>\nCompanion\r<br/>\nWizard\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Message: 16\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&gt; Any of you Wizards out there know what skull, you need to combine with a\r<br/>\n&gt; Ruined Totem Staff...and what NPC combines them for you?\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n&gt; Auraelle\r<br/>\n&gt; E&#92;&#39;ci Server\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; Message: 19\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&gt;    Unless someone can come right out and give exact NPC names and info\r<br/>\n&gt; right now, assume that combining the rts and the skull is just a rumor. As\r<br/>\n&gt; far as I know, the staff that Priests of Discord carry are actually\r<br/>\n&gt; _different_ weapons and not a combo of these two items. No one to my\r<br/>\n&gt; knowledge has actually been able to combine the two though many like to\r<br/>\n&gt; claim that it is possible.\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; Isand\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n&gt; Message: 23\r<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 13 May 1999 18:20:42 -0400\r<br/>\n&gt;    From: &#92;&quot;Brad Fetkovich&#92;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetko1@...\">fetko1@...</a>&gt;\r<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Staff Question\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; where did this rumor even get started?  the skull goes in a melee slot, who\r<br/>\n&gt; thought up putting it on a staff?  the priest of discords staff is\r<br/>\n&gt; different, it&#92;&#39;s a staff of discord if i&#92;&#39;m not mistaken\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-----------------------------------------------------<br/>\nThis mail sent through IMP: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://web.horde.org/imp/\">http://web.horde.org/imp/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
