I played a wizard in the beta of this game, i got the <br/>\ngame same day as it came out. I&#39;ve been playing in the qeynos area for these <br/>\npast months and now i moved to freeport. I&#39;ve noticed so many people that <br/>\nare in their 20&#39;s in levels even 30&#39;s. I&#39;m only at level 12 and struggling <br/>\nto go up from here. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s that most of the players are <br/>\nteenagers who play all the time since it&#39;s summer vacation or people just <br/>\ndon&#39;t have lives but i play as much as my life let&#39;s me, as long as it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t interfere with work or hanging out on the weekends and i seem to go <br/>\nup so slow. I&#39;m hunting now in the commonlands, I like to play solo and play <br/>\nin groups when i get a chance if I&#39;m in the mood. Can someone tell me a good <br/>\nhunting spot or what&#39;s going on cause this is really starting to stress me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThx,<br/>\n  Atrus (Level 12, Karana server)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
