Bind wound has Saved my life more that I can<br/>\nimagine.  This is the way it works:  Bind wound will heal you or another<br/>\nplayer up to 50% of their health.  I have mastered the skill (took me about<br/>\n4 lvls fighting the Aviak Guards in Lake Rathe).  I can do about a quarter<br/>\nto half a bub of health per bandage depending on who I am healing.  Of<br/>\ncourse those warriros will take a few more bandages but us wizes I get close<br/>\nto a half a bub of hp healed per wrap.  Hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nShadair J&#39;Axx<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Bob Irick &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vampyre@...\">vampyre@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, June 10, 1999 5:54 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_wizards] bandages<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Bob Irick &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vampyre@...\">vampyre@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; es you will have to put some points into the bind<br/>\n&gt; wound skill.  One or two is enough.  At first you wont<br/>\n&gt; see much healing done per bandage but as your skill<br/>\n&gt; increase, you will heal more damage and use fewer<br/>\n&gt; bandages.  I&#39;m not sure where the amount healed per<br/>\n&gt; bandage tops out, I have heard 25 poits per bandage<br/>\n&gt; but I dont know that for sure.  They are kind of<br/>\n&gt; expensive to buy at ove 5 sp each and I generally buy<br/>\n&gt; them 30 at a time.  If you are poor, try to find a<br/>\n&gt; cleric or mage and get them to summon some for you.  I<br/>\n&gt; go around healing eveyone that will let me.  It&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; good way to make friends and to increase my skill.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s at 44 now and has a long way to go to max<br/>\n&gt; out..I&#39;m almost lvl 14 now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
