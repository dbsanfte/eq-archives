Its great xp and good loot.  Just stay out of the house and only<br/>\nhunt in the courtyard as the house is the home to some fairly high lvl<br/>\ncritters.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the record, I don&#39;t believe wizards should solo past 5th lvl.  Your<br/>\nchances of dying increase dramatically when soloing.  Having said that, we<br/>\nall know that we will solo on occasion.  It is definitely easier to solo in<br/>\nthe early lvls than it is the higher lvls.  I currently solo every know and<br/>\nthen in the Cauldron and if I&#39;m not careful, those gobbies will hit me for<br/>\n40-50 dmg a pop.  At that rate, it doesn&#39;t take long to die.  But if you<br/>\nstrategize carefully and leave yourself a way to escape if things go bad,<br/>\nthere&#39;s no lvl that you can&#39;t solo.  But, it does get harder the higher you<br/>\nget, because the rate of dmg increase for the mobs is far greater than the<br/>\nrate of HP and AC increase that you get.  Wizards are meant to group, not<br/>\nsolo.  I have died more times soloing than I ever did with a group.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalarin Kal&#39;Amon, High Elven Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Mata &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mata_eq@...\">mata_eq@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, May 14, 1999 8:44 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_wizards] Ice Comet<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Mata&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mata_eq@...\">mata_eq@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well your words have inspired me to stick w/ it until 16th  . . .<br/>\n&gt; I am in a lull at lvl 14, any suggestions on places to hunt that are good<br/>\n&gt; eps for my lvl?   I have 2 tanks (ranger and paladin both 16th) I am<br/>\nalways<br/>\n&gt; w/  . . .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was 8th when the 16th lvl Paladin started and he is 16th now and I am<br/>\n8th!<br/>\n&gt; grrrrrrrr   I think Early lvls is just hard as a wizard.    I am confused<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; one point.    I hear 1/2 the people saying we SOLO BETTER at high lvls and<br/>\n&gt; 1/2 the people saying we can ONLY solo at low lvls.    Any high lvl<br/>\nwizards<br/>\n&gt; out there have any thought on this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Mata 14th Circle High Elven Wizard (Eci) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
