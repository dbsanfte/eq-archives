The folks that blatantly do it to<br/>\n&gt;spite others are the ones that are the problem.  If you didn&#39;t do that at a<br/>\n&gt;derv camp you wouldn&#39;t get ANYTHING at all.  People would pass you by.  I<br/>\n&gt;have been in that situation before.

I count the number of people in the camp and wait for<br/>\n&gt;&gt;that many dervs to spawn, then i take the next one... regardless of who&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&quot;turn&quot; it is. I figure that i have to be at the end of the rotation so<br/>\n&gt;&gt;everyone there has already had a turn when i go and the person that whines<br/>\n&gt;&gt;to me was on his/her second turn.
