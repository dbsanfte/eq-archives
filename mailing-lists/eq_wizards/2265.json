The folks that blatantly do it to <br/>\nspite others are the ones that are the problem.  If you didn&#39;t do that at a <br/>\nderv camp you wouldn&#39;t get ANYTHING at all.  People would pass you by.  I <br/>\nhave been in that situation before.  Sometimes groups are very greedy and <br/>\ndon&#39;t let the little solo guy next to them take a turn when it would just <br/>\nbenefit them to heal up and rest for a few moments.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 03:47 PM 6/8/99 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Neil Lambert&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smartass@...\">smartass@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;i thought this for a while too but now i am a semi-KSer. please, let me<br/>\n&gt;explain: i spent most of my wizards life trying to keep order at the camps.<br/>\n&gt;Me being a wizard threatened people by saying that if they stole, i could<br/>\n&gt;easily steal every kill from them from then on, and it worked... for a<br/>\n&gt;while. I have tried very hard lately to keep order at camps and nothing<br/>\n&gt;works. so I gave up. I count the number of people in the camp and wait for<br/>\n&gt;that many dervs to spawn, then i take the next one... regardless of who&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;&quot;turn&quot; it is. I figure that i have to be at the end of the rotation so<br/>\n&gt;everyone there has already had a turn when i go and the person that whines<br/>\n&gt;to me was on his/her second turn. I guess you can call it killstealing, but<br/>\n&gt;not many get  mad because i&#39;m not just stealing everything when i have the<br/>\n&gt;mana... but that&#39;s what i do now... i am moving to a new server soon and i<br/>\n&gt;am seriously thinking of just going out and stealing everything i can for<br/>\n&gt;the hell of it. but i don&#39;t think i&#39;ll do it because i&#39;m a nice guy and that<br/>\n&gt;sucks for everyone else<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Cristie &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cristie@...\">cristie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tuesday, June 08, 1999 1:48 PM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eq_wizards] Wizards are fun - don&#39;t ruin it for everyone<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Cristie &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cristie@...\">cristie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Kill stealing is not the way to make friends for personal or the class as a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;whole.  It might serve the purpose of the person at the time, but rest<br/>\n&gt; &gt;assured, those groups/people you steal kills from WILL remember your name<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and later on down the road when you can&#39;t cast/melee your ass out of a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;tight spot, if those folks are around they will more than likely just sit<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and watch you get the crap beat out of you til you die and laugh their<br/>\n&gt; &gt;heads off.  Sad people think this is okay.  I get more exp working with a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;group of 6 than I do alone by far.  The bonus for a full group helps a lot<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and if you find the right spots (not telling mine), you will get more than<br/>\n&gt; &gt;enough cash and goodies to go around.  We normally have a pile of bodies to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;loot and everyone goes away with their pockets full and their exp bumping<br/>\n&gt; &gt;up nicely...AND a good feeling.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;At 04:01 PM 6/8/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:yur@...\">yur@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I probably will get flamed for this for sure, but who cares.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I made it all the way to lvl 12 as an erudite wizard.   I found that<br/>\n&gt;leveling<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;was very slow indeed and it was getting really boring camping with my<br/>\n&gt;groups<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;till the sun comes up.   However, i was on a few days ago in the morning<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;and my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;regular group wasn&#39;t on.  I shouted for about 30 min and no one wanted to<br/>\n&gt;join<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;up with me for bandit hunting.  Out of boredom, i went down to the bandit<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;camps<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;to see if i can find a group there(West karanas on top of Hill).  I found<br/>\n&gt;this<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;group of 6 there camping the bandits so i just sat around shouting for<br/>\n&gt;groups<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;once again. But while those guys were fighting the bandits, i thought, hey<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;might<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;as well try to see if i can kill one solo, if i can&#39;t, then they will<br/>\n&gt;probably<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;help me anyways.  I attacked one bandit and killedh im in 3 shots with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Shock of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Lightning.  and WOW ! so much XP !!!   so i just kept going.  I got around<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;10-15<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;pp in 30 min and gained 1 bubble of xp. normall i gain 1 bubble in 6-8<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;hours of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;playing.   FINALLY ! i found how to have fun with my wizard and not be the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;lamer<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;that spent all his time trying to group and get shitty XP cuz of the split<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;between members !!   who cares if they think i am a kill stealer, its not<br/>\n&gt;like<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;they can do anything about it HAHAHA.  too bad for them that they wont<br/>\n&gt;group<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;with me.  I also found some wizards are really stupid, the group  of 6 i<br/>\n&gt;was<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;stealing from had a lvl 14 wizard and a lvl 11 wizard. and none of them<br/>\n&gt;could<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;stop me from stealing. its odd but true... ppl just don&#39;t think.. oh<br/>\n&gt;well.. i<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;hope you all try to just have fun and not give a shit what other ppl think<br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;once.   then you might find why Varent say we are a balanced race, i<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;personally<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;think we were made to give grief to others heehhe.. j/k   I personally<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;think we<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;should be changed to Erudite Magical Theives hehe..<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Looking for a new hobby?
