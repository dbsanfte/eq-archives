Something needs to be said, and doing it as one voice<br/>\nwould be more effective.<br/>\nThe things I have liked the most, and that are still inline with what a<br/>\nwizard is are the following:<br/>\n<br/>\nSood spell ideas:<br/>\nSummon - Teleports group member inside the zone to your location<br/>\nPhase - Teleports yourself to location of other group member inside zone<br/>\nTap Afinity - Teleport group member to their own bind spot<br/>\nHaste - Increases movement rate for self only.<br/>\nGroup Gate - Slow casting spell which teleports group to your bind spot,<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t leave anyone behind<br/>\nRetreat - Evacuate version of group gate<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I think the most important fix that needs to addressed is finishing<br/>\nthe specialization skills.  I see these as an inportant part to making the<br/>\nwizard what they should be, but as yet are still missing.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Shadowwalker of Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
