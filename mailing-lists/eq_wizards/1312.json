You get this at level 4.<br/>\n&gt; Enstill means a stronger version of Root, it looks like.  Same<br/>\n&gt; definition.  You get this one at level 20.  I would venture to guess the<br/>\n&gt; NPC&#39;s can still resist it if they are able to.<br/>\n&gt; You can always try to cast when you are getting bashed...sometimes you can<br/>\n&gt; pop your spells off and other times you are interrupted and lose<br/>\n&gt; concentration and sometimes you get bashed and regain concentration and<br/>\n&gt; continue casting.  Try to shoot your spells off while the NPC isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; smacking you.. a lot of it is in your timing, unless you have a bunch of<br/>\n&gt; monsters on you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At 12:31 AM 5/14/99 +0100, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Simon Hinshelwood &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:iktome@...\">iktome@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Dear Valacian,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;What exactly is the difference between root and enstill?
