You will find them randomly off of any creature greater than level 12ish,<br/>\nand more likely on creatures that are naturally magical.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  I&#39;ve always struggled with money.  I hate camping so that leaves me with<br/>\noutdoor, wandering mobs.  Well last night the gods were smiling on me.  I<br/>\nwalked into Northern Ro and killed a Decaying Skel holding a cracked staff,<br/>\nkept moving into the desert and killed a scarab that was training a paladin.<br/>\nHe gave me the loot in thanks both a cracked and pristine scarapice (or<br/>\nwhatever its).  PL and pings were bad so I moved to the commons, I came out of<br/>\nthe cave and watched a group of ghouls chasing a person down, so I turned the<br/>\notherway started to run and saw an unlooted ghouls corpse.  I waited and no one<br/>\ncame to loot it so I bent down and got some serious cash and a bronze mace.  In<br/>\n10-15 minutes I just doubled my life savings (8 Plat). Woohoo.  Not bad for a<br/>\nLevel 8 wizard who only killed one decaying skel and a half dead scarab.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1. Where do I find runes? I haven&#39;t found any at all. I think I asked this<br/>\n&gt; before but no one answered it. I&#39;m dying to start researching, but my old<br/>\n&gt; erudin is below average only.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2. How the heck do I make money ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Zalbar<br/>\n&gt; 18th Wizard<br/>\n&gt; Solusek Ro<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
