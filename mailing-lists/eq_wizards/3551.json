They generally have time for no one or<br/>\nnothing else.  The only time most wizards venture out<br/>\nis to help someone who may have helped them along<br/>\ntheir way to learning more about the magiks in the<br/>\nworld.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy wizard was a grey haired middle aged elf.  As you<br/>\nknow elves are not small little christmas types but<br/>\ntall slender race with fair skin and genuinely good<br/>\nlooking.  He spent most of his days in his order&#39;s<br/>\nguild house learning all he could from the old books<br/>\nand manuscripts left from Wizards who have passed on. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI suggest reading any of the Dragon Lance series<br/>\n(Raistlin is a perfect example of a great wizard) or<br/>\nthe Lord of the Rings series (Gandalf is another).<br/>\n<br/>\nHope it helps,<br/>\n<br/>\nZiff<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Deb1958Sec@...\">Deb1958Sec@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Tarew, thankyou for the information.

I want to create from<br/>\n&gt; information I gather my <br/>\n&gt; own wizard, not use someone else&#39;s.  I want to get<br/>\n&gt; to know attitudes, and <br/>\n&gt; blend them all together in my imagination and come<br/>\n&gt; up with a resentful <br/>\n&gt; character that somehow gets over it and becomes good<br/>\n&gt; again.
