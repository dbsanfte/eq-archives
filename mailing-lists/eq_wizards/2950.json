Cast force is very nice in that it&#39;s<br/>\ncaster centered.  I.e. you don&#39;t have to worry about falling within the<br/>\nradius of your own spell.  The column spells have better damage/mana/mob<br/>\nratios but they are *I think* of tighter radius than some of the other AE<br/>\nspells (e.g. the spirals and rains)--column of lightning is, for instance,<br/>\nexcellent for stacked mobs.  Lightning storm has a reasonably good damage<br/>\nmana ratio and it has a lesser tendency (IMO) to pull mobs to you.   In fact<br/>\ntarget based AE are often better because your distance decreases the<br/>\ntendency to pull the mob (in contrast to Cast Force).  On the other hand,<br/>\nwhen you do pull the mob(s), you are generally further from your tanks and<br/>\nit takes longer to get help.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short, I&#39;d recommend you play with the spells and figure out what are the<br/>\nbest circumstances for each.  One &quot;good&quot; place to do this is Highkeep, where<br/>\nif you pull a nasty, you can generally make it to the guards  (who may or<br/>\nmay not save you).  Definitely don&#39;t try these in a group you don&#39;t trust.<br/>\nAlso, note that some AEs (e.g. rains, and cast force) are great at slowing<br/>\ndown PCs.  If you have a slow machine or are in a group where your tanks<br/>\nhave slow machines, you may want to avoid those spells.  (Try turning off<br/>\nparticle effects to help.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck.  AEs, when used right, are great spells.  I&#39;ve hit as many as<br/>\n6 mobs at a time and that makes for incredible mana efficiency.  One last<br/>\nthought:  If you get into a group with another wiz or magician, tell them<br/>\nyou&#39;d like to practice and ask them to switch to AE also.  Much safer and a<br/>\nlot of fun.  Nothing like a good game of ping pong with multiple mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Glyphin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
