It not only does damage but it also stuns the<br/>\n&gt; opponent.  Any spell with a dual effect is resisted a LOT more (ask<br/>\n&gt; enchanters because almost all their spells have dual or triple effects).  At<br/>\n&gt; level 24 we get a DD spell that does about the same amount of damage as<br/>\n&gt; shock of force, but does not have a dual effect and is thus not resisted as<br/>\n&gt; much.  It also costs less mana to cast.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Solric<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Keith Wiseman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:keithw@...\">keithw@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, May 26, 1999 10:58 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eq_wizards] Spell Resistance<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Keith Wiseman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:keithw@...\">keithw@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Same problem here with abnormal amounts of resists with Lvl 20 spells...<br/>\n&gt; This is quite different from any other new level spells in the past.<br/>\n&gt; Enough of a difference to conclude that Lvl 20 spells were programmed<br/>\n&gt; differently or there was a change in a patch that affects all spells that<br/>\n&gt; just coincided with my reaching lvl 20...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: James Dwyer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdwar@...\">jdwar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just reached lvl 20, got all my spells, and I guess am a little<br/>\n&gt; dissapointed. I do enjoy blasting for 170 points of damage, but it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; almost as if Verant has made these new spells EASIER to resist. For<br/>\n&gt; instance, I fight Orcs in oasis. Low blue orcs and they are resisting my<br/>\n&gt; new shock spell. They NEVER resist my 16th level lightning bolt. You<br/>\n&gt; would think that a higher level spell would be as or harder to resist.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Another example is enstill. This ONLY works on greens. There is no blue,<br/>\n&gt; white, yellow, red that I have found that is successfully enstilled. In<br/>\n&gt; fact, when I fight the 20th level orcs that con black to me, they always<br/>\n&gt; resist. Yet root works on them about 25% of the time. I was hoping that<br/>\n&gt; when I got enstill it would be easier to solo because it is more<br/>\n&gt; powerful, alas it isn&#39;t so.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am heading to Lake Rathe now and hopefully my spells work better<br/>\n&gt; there. If not, mayhaps we should petition to get this change. I mean<br/>\n&gt; come on, I am about as useful as a 16th level wizard against red if<br/>\n&gt; BLUES resist my new 20th level spells. While monsters are getting<br/>\n&gt; progressively better I seem to be getting progressively incapable to<br/>\n&gt; handle them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Croesus Illuminatus (Xegony)<br/>\n&gt; *Tanks stab em, Wizards slab em*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where the world talks!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Congratulations to &quot;M-K-ROSES,&quot; our latest ONElist of the Week.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Visit our homepage and share with us how ONElist is changing YOUR life! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
