I have heard of many people who<br/>\ncompleted this quest (From brewers list, we learned long before others)  The only<br/>\nsuccesses so far have been from 20+ Enchanters (Illusion Ogre, Benevolence) and<br/>\nvery well factioned Ogres (Who purchased the ingridents from others).  You need<br/>\nto have Clurg above indifferent to get the item.  The Euridin ingredient also<br/>\nrequires good Eurdite faction to complete that subquest.   I also know<br/>\nnon-enchanter Dark elves and Druids in Wolf form who /conned indifferent to<br/>\nClurg, but were still refused the reward.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
