Keep &#39;em coming...way better suggestions than that whole &quot;ban <br/>\nthe twinky&quot; idea.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s something that I found disconcerting last night.  I was with a bunch <br/>\nof warriors, druids and others inside Dvinn&#39;s palace last night. It was my <br/>\nfirst time back there in a long time and so I was pleasantly surprised <br/>\neverything was green to me there.  Most of the others in the room were <br/>\nalmost uniform in level 14-19...maybe about 10 of us in the room.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway...it has been a dream in my young Wizard life to give some payback to <br/>\nDvinn for the hassle he had given me when I was younger.  I was one of the <br/>\nhigher level guys there being 16lvl...and being the only caster in the <br/>\nroom...everyone was depending on me to get the damage in while everybody <br/>\nelse tanked.<br/>\n<br/>\nLo and behold...the fighting started and ALL my spells were resisted. We <br/>\nmanaged to take him down anyway...and everybody praised me for my help...but <br/>\nI was so embarrassed I brushed off all the praise and just sulked in the <br/>\ncorner.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know we&#39;ve addressed the subject of our spells vrs tombstones before, but <br/>\nwe are an embarrassingly useless class against red level characters.  <br/>\nEverything just bounces off.  Wonder if Verant should see it fit to adjust <br/>\nthat a little...maybe even if we just knick the tombstones a *little* it <br/>\nwould be nice.  Even the lower level tanks were contributing at least.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
