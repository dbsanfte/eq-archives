Not","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-482205437\">According to Vince Seese:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; One can increase the difficulty to get an item by:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         - raising the level needed to get it (which puts all rare items at the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;                 level 50, everything before is chaff)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         - raising the difficulty of the location (which, once a group gets down<br/>\n&gt; &gt;                 the unvarying routine down pat, stops being true)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         - raising the difficulty of finding the item (which is the case with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;                 mega-rare spawns. How many players do you know with a Scarab Ring?)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There is one other solution that to me is a lot more in keeping with the<br/>\n&gt; AD&D style that I think people are used to - randomization.  You are<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That counts as raising the difficulty in finding the item. Once the item<br/>\ncan no longer be depended upon to be in the hands of named mob X...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Everyone knows who to talk to to start the glowing stein.  Instead of<br/>\n&gt; his fixed dialog though, imagine if he says I need a rare and exotic<br/>\n&gt; drink. You say &quot;I would like to help you&quot;.  He says &quot;Here is a recipe<br/>\n&gt; book.  Find the ingredients listed here and return them in the book to<br/>\n&gt; me.&quot;  Each item would have one more set of fields that should be<br/>\n&gt; randomly generated every time you get the quest given to you.  Maybe<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not possible. At least within the framework of the game engine. After<br/>\na while, you know what is supported and what is not. The only things<br/>\nthat the quest engine can do now is:<br/>\n\t- check your level (too low, rejected, too high, rejected)<br/>\n\t- check your faction (too low, rejected)<br/>\n\t- supplying one combination of items in the quest list array<br/>\n\t\tof the quest giver<br/>\n<br/>\nYou cannot &quot;attach&quot; a quest list to a character. I doubt there&#39;s storage<br/>\nfor this in the PC databases.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould be nice, yes, but that&#39;s not possible. For EQ2 maybe. For EQ, never.<br/>\nAlas.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; quest!)  THEN - continue this.  You return the book.  You get the item<br/>\n&gt; &quot;The Glowing Stein&quot;.  Except that its is +5 to +10 int, and +5 to +10<br/>\n&gt; dex - maybe you get lucky and get the ultra rare +10 +10 stein.  Voila -<br/>\n&gt; you have a dynamic quest that no web page is going to spoil, and<br/>\n&gt; everyone is NOT alike!  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, not possible. Your &quot;item slot&quot; yields a structure similar to:<br/>\n\t# item pointer in table<br/>\n\t# number of charges remaining<br/>\n<br/>\nnote that you never have simultaneously a charged item and a stackable<br/>\nitem; the structure is reused, and &quot;number of charges&quot; has meaning that<br/>\ndepends on what the item would be.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the &quot;random Stein&quot; would need 36 entries in the table of existing<br/>\nitems (one for each variation of int and dex).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Lastly, to address the twinking problem:  Maybe the stein instead of<br/>\n&gt; giving +10 int would give (+2 times level/10).  Therefore, your level 50<br/>\n&gt; wizard has a +10 int stein, but his twinked level 2 wizard has the same<br/>\n&gt; stein at +0 int!  Easily explained that with wisdom of levels you gain<br/>\n&gt; the ability to use a sword better (damage =level, or something similar),<br/>\n&gt; gain more power from the gem, or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, too complex. My idea would be that any item require a minimum<br/>\nskill level to use.<br/>\n<br/>\nRubicite armor? You need defense 90 to wear. Flowing Black Robes?<br/>\nForget wearing it unless you have chanelling at 100. Barbed leather<br/>\nwhip? If you do not have 80 in 1-hand slashing, you do 1 damage with it<br/>\ntops :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
