We are doing the best/hardest damage at<br/>\nlevel 20 and beyond.  I&#39;m glad I had to work my ass off in order to get to<br/>\nlevel 20 as it was certainly an accomplishment.. I&#39;m also glad that it was<br/>\ndifficult so that there isn&#39;t a zillion Wizard&#39;s in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m very happy with the way the Wizard class has been made.  Sitting on your<br/>\nass is part of being a Wizard...  All the other points you made about a<br/>\nWizard IS part of being a Wizard...  Specialization will make certain spell<br/>\ntypes more mana effecient (depending on what you put practice into).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy two (maybe one) cent(s) !<br/>\n<br/>\nValacian - 22nd Level Erudite Wizard, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
