I&#39;d love to see someone get whipped and go flying.

Last time I was in Najena I was lvl 12 or so, and having fun but it was hard, we managed to kill the oger guard that held the key tho, which I snagged and now hold onto. One thing to look out for on TT&#39;s is getting whiped backwards, they can actually lift you off the ground and toss you backwards, was rather wied watching a lvl 14 sk that was training them fly around =)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
