And also, I would like to state what I<br/>\nam dissapointed with in the game.<br/>\n1) The fact that the /ooc chat lets everyone discuss the solutions of quests<br/>\nor the fact you can buy quest items.  I think anyone should be banned if<br/>\nthey give the solution of a quest out in game, I know we cannot stop the ICQ<br/>\ncontacts or web sites that do but most of the solutions are givin out in<br/>\ngame anyways.<br/>\n2) The camping issue, I think verant should change spawning points of<br/>\nmonsters to a random location in the zone, or something similar and not let<br/>\ntracking find NPCs.  I know that will hinder ranger&#39;s importance but I don&#39;t<br/>\nsee the logic behind tracking an NPC that&#39;s not an animal.<br/>\n3) The role playing aspects of the game are very weak, I know that&#39;s what I<br/>\nlong for.  When AC comes out I am buying it instantly, it&#39;s the type of game<br/>\nI am looking forward to.  Although I wish they would put a class system or<br/>\nrace system in.<br/>\n4) Classes in everquest should have more uniqueness, I don&#39;t like the fact<br/>\nthat wizards are just the masters of DD spells.  I think we should get<br/>\nsomething special, anything really.  Like special wizard hats or something<br/>\nof the sort.<br/>\n5) Everyone complaining, Verant seems to be shifting toward listening to<br/>\npeople whine about &quot;I cannot camp this critter because mister X big and<br/>\npowerfull is&quot;  I think that camping should be something frowned upon in<br/>\ngeneral and I definitly think they should randomize spawn points and make<br/>\nmobs have the urge to walk around more and stir up trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, just my 2 cents.<br/>\n ~ Skudd of The Tribunal</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
