The problem was that I really couldn&#39;t verify how well<br/>\nit works, because I&#39;m not certain if monsters take damage from falling or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what I would do is hit a monster from long distance with a spell, then<br/>\nrun up a VERY VERY steep cliff.  Once at the top of the cliff I wait till<br/>\nthe monster hits me, then I hit the fade button.  9 times out of 10, fade<br/>\ntakes me to the bottom of the cliff.  The monster then jumps off the cliff<br/>\nto get me, and I&#39;m assuming it takes some damage from the fall.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI did this a couple times... the biggest problem is finding suitable cliffs<br/>\nto fade from, and the second worst problem is being careful not to fall in<br/>\nmyself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFlik<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGet involved.
