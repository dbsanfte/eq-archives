As a level 18 wizard I shouldn&#39;t have to group with 14&#39;s - 16&#39;s,<br/>\njust so I can contribute in the fight.  One of the points of groups is to be<br/>\nable to take on mobs that are higher than your group.  The least they should<br/>\ndo is to make our spells hit proportionally the same as a same level melee,<br/>\ntaking into consideration the amount of mana that we must expend for a<br/>\n&quot;hit&quot;.<br/>\n    One way would be to give us a lower mana/low damage (proportional to our<br/>\nlevel) that either cannot be resisted or has an extremely low chance of<br/>\nbeing resisted.  They could even balance it so that it would take a slightly<br/>\nhigher mana/damage ratio.  For example, you could have a spell that used the<br/>\nsame mana as say, shock of lightning, but instead of doing ~80 points of<br/>\ndamage it does ~60 but can&#39;t be resisted or will rarely be resisted.  But<br/>\nthen again if they just wanted a quick fix they could give us the enchanter<br/>\nspell that lowers resistance. We shouldn&#39;t have to base our existence in a<br/>\ngroup on whether or not they have an enchanter, or limit our grouping to<br/>\nlevels lower than our own.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrystesa, High Elf Wizard of Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
