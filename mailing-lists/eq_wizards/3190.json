It may take a little while (Root newbie mobs) but it will be well worth it.  Second,  Root is really only used in 2 situations.  # 1 Soloing.  Root,  Shoot, Loot.<br/>\nIt&#39;s the only way to solo.  #2 Group Dungeon hunting.  If a mob retreats, you must root it.  At your level, root should almost be a trivial spell to cast, and while it never becomes very reliable,  it is one of your<br/>\nbread and butter spells.  Get that Alt skill maxed!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;PHAEDRA WHITLOCK&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PWHITLOCK@...\">PWHITLOCK@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How do you get Root to work? It sucks up half my mana, and so far, never holds even blues (pumas, lions, gt spiders, orc centurions). I wouldnt think of trying it on anything higher. Dont even memorize it any more.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Groups, my groups tend to have the critter dead in 5 seconds or less (orc camps) so the 15 rule wont help me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And I always have Gate handy. So much better than Fade and Shadowstep! Saved my life yesterday in the dervish camp.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shannyn, 12 Tunare server </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
