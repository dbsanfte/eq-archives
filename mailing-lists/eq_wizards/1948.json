We should concentrate<br/>\non 1 or 2 changes we really need!  I think that the implementation of<br/>\nspecialization and the ability to affect MOBs of 6+ levels are the two<br/>\nmost important changes that could be immediately implemented.  I know<br/>\nthat there&#39;ll be some disagreement about the most important changes, but<br/>\nwe need to focus or we will be ignored by spreading ourselves too thin.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 2 cents worth,<br/>\nGennin, E&#39;ci <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Ken Morrison wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ok guys and girls, I took the liberty of doing some editing to<br/>\n&gt; Silverion&#39;s text as well as adding some of the other&#39;s comments, and<br/>\n&gt; my own =)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think that there are some really excellent suggestions here and I<br/>\n&gt; also feel that by sending them this we are finally showing some true<br/>\n&gt; support for the class we all love.  We are also on the way to making a<br/>\n&gt; unique class, instead of just &quot;magical artillery&quot;.  Lets keep<br/>\n&gt; bombarding them with ideas and let them sort &#39;em out and deal with<br/>\n&gt; game balance issues.  After all, isnt that what we are paying them<br/>\n&gt; for?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ok, what follows is the revised text (feel free to make comments,<br/>\n&gt; edit, whatever, just send those emails!!!):<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We, the Wizards of the Onelist.com Wizards mailing list, feel the<br/>\n&gt; Wizard class requires revision and have compiled the following list:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; New Spells<br/>\n&gt; Summon -     Teleports group member inside the zone to your location<br/>\n&gt; Phase -         Teleports yourself to location of other group member<br/>\n&gt; inside zone<br/>\n&gt; Tap Afinity -  Teleport group member to their own bind spot<br/>\n&gt; Haste -           Increases movement rate for self only.<br/>\n&gt; Group Gate - Slow casting spell which teleports group to your bind<br/>\n&gt; spot, doesn&#39;t leave anyone behind<br/>\n&gt; Retreat -        Evacuate version of group gate<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Changes to existing spells:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Root -             Minimum time duration, with random maxium time<br/>\n&gt; duration.<br/>\n&gt; Fade              Useless, remove completely<br/>\n&gt; Shadowstep   Change to line of sight, with minimum travelled distance<br/>\n&gt; and random max. distance.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Skill Changes<br/>\n&gt; Meditation skill max for level for wizard (Level +1) * 7.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We also request the implementation of the Specialization skill.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Game Mechanics<br/>\n&gt; -Investigate the increase of spell failures (fizzles) of lower level<br/>\n&gt; spells as Wizard class advances in levels.  Should &quot;simpler&quot; spells<br/>\n&gt; fail more often as the Wizard increase in levels, regardless of<br/>\n&gt; appropriate skill?  (ie. Root, Shielding etc.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - Resolving the problem of high resistence of Level 20+ DD spells by<br/>\n&gt; greens, blues and higher (if this is the result of a stun effect we<br/>\n&gt; wish one spell without this efect at same level)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - Resolving the balance problem of other magic-using classes still<br/>\n&gt; able to affect MoBs (in a group situation) that are 6+ above their own<br/>\n&gt; levels (Necromancer - Lifetap & pets, Enchanters and Magicians - pets,<br/>\n&gt; buffs, etc) while Wizard DD spells are 100% resisted by 6+ level<br/>\n&gt; MoBs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - Better use of time when meditating (acces to main chat server in<br/>\n&gt; separate window)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - We wish real official feedback on planned changes or problems which<br/>\n&gt; you have with balance in game on an official page which exists but<br/>\n&gt; never seems to be updated (eg. id&#39;s Quake .plan files)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We feel the Wizard class has been overlooked far too long and that<br/>\n&gt; there is nothing that is truly unique about our characters anymore.<br/>\n&gt; We feel the above changes would go a long way towards rectifying some<br/>\n&gt; of the classes shortcomings.
