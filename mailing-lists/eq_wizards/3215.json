This will be your first &quot;lesson&quot; in camping probably, but<br/>\nis a good one. Again, Graffe&#39;s page is the best, but the gist is you<br/>\nkill a mob in Qeynos (Cubert, named baby gelationous cube - about 80<br/>\nhp&#39;s), get an item, and trade it in for a +3 int earring.  I did that a<br/>\nBUNCH of times, finally got my two, and thats no small int bonus for<br/>\nsuch a low level quest!  And the best part is, they are like backup cash<br/>\n- if you are hitting a spell level, and need 30 plat fast...<br/>\n<br/>\nMicon Bittermage<br/>\nKarana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
