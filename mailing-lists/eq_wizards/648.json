It happens to me all the time, while gating..  All I have to do is get the first two bubbles of my gate spell off without being interrupted.. and the last 4 bubbles always completes, whether or not I&#39;ve been hit.  I&#39;ve even actually been hit for over 100 damage and still regained concentration enough to finish the spell and gate.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has been this way for about a week or two now..  so it couldnt&#39;ve been that last patch.

During the game last<br/>\n&gt; night I received a message while in combat taht stated &quot;You regained<br/>\n&gt; concentration&quot; and it cast my spells after it told me I lost concentration.<br/>\n&gt; Could be the first steps...?
