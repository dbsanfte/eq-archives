Being<br/>\nable to Invis would make this much safer but you can&#39;t do that yet. (    But<br/>\nif you decide to do it, you might be ok if you learn the safest way through<br/>\nthe Karanas zones (along edges of zones, etc.) and hope that the HpH is very<br/>\nbusy which means that the main spawning points are camped and you can walk<br/>\non by unscathed.
