The &gt;materials<br/>\n&gt;for them are a quest in themselves, and I have found it easier to &gt;simply<br/>\n&gt;keep research maxed at your guildhouse with one of the trainers for &gt;your<br/>\n&gt;class.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been doing that same thing to...I started researching before they made <br/>\nthose little practice runes to work.  I believe we can dump in about 5 <br/>\ntraining points per level...I might have dumped maybe 20-30 pts in when I <br/>\nfirst started.  It&#39;s the lazy approach. :)  I&#39;ve been about 60% successful <br/>\nso far...maybe once I was able to create a spell that was one circle above <br/>\nmine; all others included spells that were below my level.  Most of the <br/>\nresearch spells include throw-away spells though...I liked maybe one or two <br/>\nof the AE spells.  I guess the main thing to prepare for is the Ice Comet <br/>\ndown the road.<br/>\n<br/>\nI liked that person&#39;s tip about the specialization...I had no idea you had <br/>\nto chunk a pt into *all* the rest of the specializations.  And all this time <br/>\nI thought I did it right...that sucks.  I assume it will catch up pretty <br/>\nquickly though since all I do is root and cast all day long. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLim&#39;Dul 33 HE Wiz Veeshan<br/>\nJukka 17 Ogre Shm Quellious</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
