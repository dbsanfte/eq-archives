Yesterday a druid friend and I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2092449790\">I also am not too sure what the function of Cancel Magic is... I believe it<br/>\ncan undo roots but that seems to be about it....<br/>\nYesterday a druid friend and I were grouped fighting evil eyes.  He was<br/>\ncharmed and I finished the eye.  Even after the eye died, my friend was<br/>\nstill charmed and continued to attack me.  I then rooted him(we play on<br/>\nRallos Zek), he clicked all of his buffs off(which can still be done when<br/>\nyou are charmed), then cast cancel magic on him.  It said that he felt a bit<br/>\ndispelled yet it did not cancel the charm.  Does cancel magic only give you<br/>\na chance to cancel the charm?  I thought that canceling charm would have<br/>\nbeen one of the main purposes of this spell.  Also we tested cancel magic by<br/>\nhim casting stinging swarm(DOT) on me and me canceling.  It seems to work<br/>\nsometimes, but not always... it may have something to do with being grouped<br/>\nor not...  Does anyone have any data on how this spell works and when it<br/>\nwill work?  Also should cancel magic work against Necro DOT&#39;s?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nEuros<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Karl Hatteland&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:karlh@...\">karlh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDo cancel magic take away Debuffs before buffs? or does it take away the<br/>\nbuff upper.<br/>\nIf I have these shields:<br/>\nLesser shielding<br/>\nResistant skin<br/>\nSee invisible<br/>\nDrowsy<br/>\n<br/>\nWhould it take away Lesser shielding couse it is the first or does it take<br/>\naway drowsy first becouse drowsy is a debuff?<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you understand my question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nWhere do some of the Internet&#39;s largest email lists reside?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nAt ONElist - the most scalable and reliable service on the Internet.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
