I got whacked last might (again =).  My<br/>\ncompanion and I were jumped by three cents, and we pretty much just took<br/>\nwhichever happened to be closest to us.  If mana had held out, we would<br/>\nhave made quick work of them, but such is life.  Thinking back on it now,<br/>\nmaybe it would have been better if we&#39;d both focused on the same one until<br/>\nit dropped, then regroup on the next one.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHypothetical situation:<br/>\nWhat happens if you&#39;re in a train situation, a party of 6 players being<br/>\nchased by 15+ critters and the party decides to scatter?  If everyone stays<br/>\ntogether you end up with one group of players leading one group of<br/>\ncritters, but if they scatter...  <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes the train follow one poor bastard?  Does the train split up to follow<br/>\neach individual?  Does creature intelligence play a part in this?  I&#39;m very<br/>\ncurious about this, as it may change the survival rate of the group<br/>\ndrastically.  If no one has tried it, I&#39;ll try to test it out with a group<br/>\nand a truckload of greens outside Felwithe or something.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Pennaggolan, 3rd Circle Wizard (and amateur Tactician) of Felwithe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
