Follow that to the next Y and take a right.  Keep going until you hit<br/>\nanother Y and take a left.  That will lead you to the BB zone entrance.<br/>\nOnce in BB, I would suggest going over by the docks.  Just follow the path<br/>\nto what is referred to as the Crossroads.  It is actually a Y, take the<br/>\nright path, follow it past the city and to the Docks.  Hope that helps ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nTalarin, High Elven Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:IF255@...\">IF255@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, April 19, 1999 6:26 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Re: Places to Hunt (Some spoilers and rather long txt)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:IF255@...\">IF255@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt; I was wondering if anyone would quickly mind telling me where<br/>\n&gt; ButcherBlock is, for i have never really traveled far from Felwithe and i<br/>\n&gt; will soon be powerful enough to go hunting there.
