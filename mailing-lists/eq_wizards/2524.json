Just cast ur lvl ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1954617755\">I don&#39;t know about you, but i have NEVER been kicked out of a group for being<br/>\nresisted.  mainly because i don&#39;t tell them i&#39;m resisted :).    Just cast ur lvl<br/>\n1 shock and since its only 6 dmg. the mob will NEVER (at least never for me)<br/>\ncome after you.  and your group can&#39;t tell the difference in the color of the<br/>\nspells since all of them look the same. they think ur casing some high lvl shock<br/>\nheehhe.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorks fine for me so far, i sit there, no danger, no mana loss, and i get XP and<br/>\nfollow their loot order just fine.  I made 50 plat and gained 2 lvl in 3 days<br/>\nand died only once.  From the skeleton monk i mention in previous post.    When<br/>\ngroup leader ask for mana status, just say what others say.  (ie. if cleric says<br/>\n20% mana, u say 15%)  that way  they don&#39;t think ur doing nothing hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nits good trick and works well to keep our mind off how they block up at 6 lvl.<br/>\nSince verant make us team up, i don&#39;t see much else we can do about it except to<br/>\nabuse the fact that others cannot see what we cast and what our mana is at :)  [<br/>\nmaybe this is why they don&#39;t let others see?]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nre:<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:yur@...\">yur@...</a>:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve been in Unrest since lvl 15 and most of my spells are resisted by Dark<br/>\n&gt; Bones and Dry Bones.  But its not so bad as long as your groups are doing<br/>\n </span></blockquote>fine.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Just join up and sit there to gain Xp and Loot. no danger since u don&#39;t hit<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; mob, so it won&#39;t come after u.  Just cast it once at start of fight to see if<br/>\n&gt; its resisted. and then start on the Radiation.  I gained a lot Xp and only<br/>\n </span></blockquote>died<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Once from a skeleton monk that killed someone else and then came after me from<br/>\n&gt; behind.   if they ask you why you aren&#39;t helping, just say ur resisted.  or<br/>\n </span></blockquote>just<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; cast a few frost shocks to pretend ur helping out :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Then, in the middle of Unrest, you suddendly are ejected from the group.
