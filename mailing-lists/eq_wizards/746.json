After  a kill<br/>\n(especially if it is white or strong blue), the wizard must rest to regain<br/>\nalmost all their mana.  During this time the others can take kills.  I am a<br/>\nwizard and will not KS anything.  I have been accused of it when I was<br/>\nhelping (so I thought) someone from being killed.  The creature had 3/4 of<br/>\nits hp and the paladin fighting it had almost none.  He said he was going to<br/>\nlay hands and continue fighting it.  I knew better because the creature was<br/>\nat least 4 levels above him (he couldnt have killed it any way).  Most of<br/>\nthe time I ask if someone needs help, and people thank me as I have thanked<br/>\nthem for helping me at times.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am a little sick of the KS argument.  Reason being is that people are<br/>\nstagnant in one spot.  You folks need to travel a bit.  Look at the newbie<br/>\nareas...my god, 150-175 people in gtr faydark?  DAMN!  Thats a lot.  Dont<br/>\nplan on getting many kills when there are that many people on...sometimes<br/>\nyou just do not see the other players attacking your  target (game lag or<br/>\nvisual bug).<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Garath Belle [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:frogg33@...\">frogg33@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, April 28, 1999 11:33 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Re: Hideous rumor...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Garath Belle&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:frogg33@...\">frogg33@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think the cutting the damage a wizards spell does will reduce <br/>\nthe amount of KS&#39;ing. I am greatful that my wizard does the damage he <br/>\ndoes with his spells. I have had several other players try to steal my <br/>\nkill. I had rooted a monster before I attacked. I got off one spell <br/>\nbefore some fighters(unsure at to exact class) ran up and started <br/>\nhacking the monster. I was able to keep my kill and ward off this <br/>\ngroups attacks on several other of my rooted monsters. This is by no <br/>\nway isolated. It happens every time at worste, every other time at <br/>\nbest. Changing the wizards spell damage would hamper their ability to <br/>\ngain levels why doing nothing about KS&#39;ing. I think that the game is <br/>\nfair as it is now and would hope that this group does not go out and <br/>\npetition for a change.<br/>\n      <br/>\n     Schalle<br/>\n       ec&#39;i<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
