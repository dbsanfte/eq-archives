There have been no banners or anything,  I<br/>\n&gt; use Cazic Thule server and so far it&#39;s been pretty reliable.and crowded.  I<br/>\n&gt; am begining to think the problem may be either my modem or my ISP  I have a<br/>\n&gt; winmodem and i understand from some recent articals that they aren&#39;t really<br/>\n&gt; very good and use some of the cpu to process the data comming in ans<br/>\n&gt; therefor slow my system down.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The winmodem shouldn&#39;t be the cause. Unless you have a P70 or something,<br/>\nyou should have plenty of CPU available for processing. The symptoms<br/>\nare those of a server-specific route problem: you can patch (different<br/>\nnetwork), log-in (different network), select world (again a different<br/>\nnetwork), but cannot enter a specific world.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen this occurs, check other worlds. If you can log on some, you have<br/>\na route problem. Now, it might be an ISP-related problem, or a UUNET<br/>\nproblem (if I remember right Cazic is a UUNET hosted farm. Try Quellious.<br/>\nIf you go to the character screen, there you have. UUNET blocked, CERFnet<br/>\nok). But in any case, there&#39;s nothing you can do on your own. Except<br/>\nchanging ISP, which will only change the frequency and the time where<br/>\nthe next IP problem will occur.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
