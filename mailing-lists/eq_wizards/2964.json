The<br/>\nsuggestion to have another mage invis you while you teleport is friggin<br/>\nclever though.

What I do know is that at<br/>\nlvl 31 I don&#39;t keep them memorized all the time, and when I do, I use them<br/>\ninfrequently.  Say, 5 or 6 times an evening.  You have to let the situation<br/>\ncreate itself and not try to force it.  Last night, for instance, I was down<br/>\nin the king room in runnyeye (Borxx hunting) where most of the stuff is<br/>\ngreen.  The room usually isn&#39;t that big of a deal, but sometimes 5 or 6 mobs<br/>\npop at once (or wander through).  I only cast the AE spell about . . . oh .<br/>\n. . a dozen times.  But each time I hit for over 300hps total.  Once or<br/>\ntwice in the 400 range.  Which is pretty good mana efficiency for a spell<br/>\nthat only costs about 135 to cast.  Oh, and I never once pulled a mob to me<br/>\n(not that it would have mattered much in this case).<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, the AE spells are a good suplement, but they will never be as<br/>\ngenerally useful as your primary DD lines.  I only advocate AE spells<br/>\nbecause most wizards fall into the trap of assuming they are useless.  They<br/>\nare not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -- Leatherskin.

I personally find that<br/>\nretrieving my corpse even once is more frustrating than the 10pp it costs<br/>\nfor my daily habit.  Be careful casting it though in the middle of a fight.<br/>\nMobs hate it.    :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Glyphin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
