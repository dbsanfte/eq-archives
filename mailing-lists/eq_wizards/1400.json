I think a combined Magic-User of those three classes would have been a much more interesting character to play as then we would have been a great buffer, we would have had a pet for soloing if we wished and pure nuking power for groups.  In exchange for a powerhouse like that with that many good solid options for play, I would have been willing to take a negative percentage hit to my xp like they do with paladins, rangers etc other multi-class character.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never played a Necro (not in my roleplaying style), but from what people say, they are fairly well rounded and in game terms they provide a nice roleplaying oppurtunity and fill a void for &quot;evil misunderstood&quot; type class, like the shadowknight.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course the Magic-User Class would have to have some spells removed, but a lot of the spells are also common.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some wishful thinking guys and girls, dont take it to seriously or to heart...it will never happen anyways! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlhassim, 7th (8th after today, yay!)
