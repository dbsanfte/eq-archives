I have writen many articles about wizards<br/>\nare nice class also and how to play and diferent tactics wich i use, this<br/>\nmaybe are not best or errorfree but are at last something wich people wich<br/>\nstart to get in problems can use. I cant talk about problems wich other<br/>\nclasses have as there are many worst classes then wizard but i try to get<br/>\nattention to some problems wich  i know best and wizard i play realy muchso<br/>\ni know its problem more. I have been playing wizard from a beta and i know<br/>\na bit about mechanic under a game also. Im sorry that my poor english many<br/>\ntimes require that my articles you have to read with attention as first<br/>\nlook it is not exactly what i wished to say.<br/>\n<br/>\nWizard dont suck as you say but they need some attention as they was very<br/>\ngod balanced class at start but as others get powered up and fine tuned<br/>\nalso wizard class need to get some changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst i will like for all clases to have less meditation  time and healing<br/>\ntime as it is something wrong that i have to stay looking in same book 50%<br/>\nof the game for me it is not funny and i dont think it is my time spent well !<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond every class have its strong and low levels ... wizards are low at<br/>\nstart (what is expected) and at end (what is not expected) but are strong<br/>\nat middle lv. I wish to get lo high lv and be able to participate at dragon<br/>\nhunt if you read some posts of 50 lv guys WIZARD cant do it now and this is<br/>\na BIG problem for me. Wich can be maybe resolved with items wich lower<br/>\nresistence so we return to my first post.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter i played 5 classes until lv 10 - 27 i have some experience to say and<br/>\npoint to problems wich i have seen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 17.04 10/09/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Sergey Bukhman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sergeyb@...\">sergeyb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Wizard wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: Wizard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wizard@...\">wizard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Dear Vincent,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; I realy only can see that you are in bad mode maybe you can think a bit<br/>\n&gt;&gt; before replying, and if you dont have to say anything useful take a break.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Only useful was that you say about your warrior at 3 lv but other things<br/>\n&gt;&gt; are realy dont help any discusion and your tone is realy arogant.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Actually, I found Vincent&#39;s article to be interesting. He sure had a lot<br/>\n&gt;more insight and understanding of the game than you. All you ever post<br/>\n&gt;is how Wizards suck compared to other classes, and use out of whack<br/>\n&gt;examples (like the warrior hitting for 70). Sure, some complaints are<br/>\n&gt;justified, but you make it a regularity to reiterate the same things<br/>\n&gt;over and over at set intervals.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I wouldn&#39;t be going this hard on you would you have not attacked Vincent<br/>\n&gt;for no apparent reason. But I do mean what I say. To use your own words,<br/>\n&gt;Vincent&#39;s post was a lot more &quot;useful&quot; than yours.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-- <br/>\n&gt;Sergey<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;KPS, PUNK (Paramilitary Undercover Nuclear Kamikaze)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Celebrate the NEW ONElist!<br/>\n&gt;Enter to win a trip to Hawaii!
