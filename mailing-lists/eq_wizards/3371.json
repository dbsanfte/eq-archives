Finding a group should be<br/>\neasy, and the hunting, plentiful.  The ooc attitude is a bit immature there<br/>\nthough.   Single orcs in N. Ro are also possible.  You can also do the entance<br/>\nto many dungeons.  ie Guk,  Blackburrow, and old Paw (Don&#39;t know if its<br/>\nupgraded yet).  Level 8 is when your horizons really expand.  Most zones offer<br/>\nsomething to hunt at this level..</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
