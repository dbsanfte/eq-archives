I told this idea to a friend of mine<br/>\nand he said that would make Wizards have infinate mana.  So I said what<br/>\nif there was something like a &quot;Wizards Pouch&quot; and It could hold like 10<br/>\nof these mana restoring items and the items can only be placed in this<br/>\nbag.  And a wizard can only have one bag.  That would limit the amount<br/>\nof these items to 10.  Therefore making us better at soloing but wouldnt<br/>\nlet us have infinate mana.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
