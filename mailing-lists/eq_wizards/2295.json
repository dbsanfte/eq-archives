People *remember* you...it&#39;s a <br/>\nself-fulfilling prophecy.  You get yourself a reputation that you are a <br/>\nKSer...you&#39;ll NEVER get a group.  I&#39;ve seen it happen where certain KSers <br/>\nwhere literally shunned from certain zones as soon as they were spotted.  <br/>\nNobody grouped with them and nobody helped them when they were in trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike many others here, I have had NO problems finding a group.  It&#39;s been <br/>\nkinda easy since 16 or so...a couple /tells or one /ooc or so can usually <br/>\ngrant me an invite.  It&#39;s gotten so easy to find at least ONE person I&#39;ve <br/>\nhelped before in the past...either I binded them in the past or simply said <br/>\nhello to in another zone.  C&#39;mon people...is it so hard to make friends even <br/>\nonline?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will need to group eventually...I have some 30+ level friends who are <br/>\neverything from mages to warriors.  They tell me it&#39;s near impossible to <br/>\nsolo even a blue creature anymore....groups will become essential.  If you <br/>\nhave a bad rep later on...tough luck for you.  I&#39;ve said this before: <br/>\nWizards are ALWAYS welcome high level groups.  These same buddies of mine <br/>\ntell me they sometimes look for at least 2 Wizards for their groups.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\nAlmost 20 (whoohoo!)
