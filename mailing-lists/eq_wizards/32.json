The main NPC&#39;s you need to talk to<br/>\nare the Dwarven Smith and the Elven Priest in the Slaver<br/>\nShack (West Side of CB)<br/>\nItems you&#39;ll need are the Magic Ringmail Tunic (From Emperor Crush) and the<br/>\nBracers of Battle (From Orc Warlord)<br/>\nStart by talking to the Dwarven Smith and use some key words like Emperor,<br/>\nTaskmaster, Warlord etc.. <br/>\n<br/>\n2) Screaming Mace (don&#39;t think Wiz&#39;s can use this but i&#39;ve seen it sell for<br/>\nover 100P)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a continuation of Quest 1 above. Once you get the Prayer Cloth make<br/>\nnote of what the Elven Priest says to you. You will have to<br/>\ngive up the Prayer Cloth to get the Screaming Mace though :)<br/>\n<br/>\ngood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 01:34 PM 4/16/99 -0400, you wrote: <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello all.
