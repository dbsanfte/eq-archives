Then this morning my co-op was closed for school so I got to play for an extra 2 hours, and boom! I hit lvl 20. I cheered and yelped and ran off to buy my new spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Force Shock<br/>\n- Tashans Clash<br/>\n- Elemental Skin<br/>\n- Enstill<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd later tonight I am going to go back to Fewlthiwe and buy my gate spells *cheers*<br/>\nWell, after I got my spells I had 30 mins before I had to logoff for the night. So I am all pumped up not a single kill in my belt under lvl 20, so I run off<br/>\n<br/>\n- Cast Tashans Clash - does a 2 - 3 second stun.<br/>\n- Cast Enstill (65 mana) RESISTS!<br/>\n- Cast Force Shock (120 mana if I recall) RESISTS!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere goes a VAST majortiy of  mana,. I yell oh shit, dish out a few shock of ice since it was the only spell I had mana for basicly and run around yelling help.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a dissapointment *grin* going to do some playing around tonight and see if I have better luck. I think that either<br/>\n<br/>\na) Croc&#39;s have a high resistance against force spells and enstill<br/>\nb) I need to kill a few things with those spells first (easier things) before they start working.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure which is what, but all I know is that after the whole deal was done I was 80 or so hp within loseing lvl 20</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
