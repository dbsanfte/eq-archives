If money is a concern, you can make pretty good <br/>\nloot money over in Cazic.  You can get up to about 1-3pp off of the lizzies <br/>\nthere and they even drop fine steel weapons.  If you&#39;re too lazy to stand <br/>\naround auctioning FS weapons, they can usually be redeemed to NPC merchants <br/>\nfor around 2-3pp as well.  It&#39;s not uncommon before for me to get upwards of <br/>\n100pp a night there.  Of course, the best situation is to group yourself <br/>\nwith a couple of folks playing their tweaked secondaries...they usually <br/>\ndon&#39;t care about loot and you can wrack up the dough. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not too rich myself, but I can usually do enough each night to cover the <br/>\ncosts of all the reagents and spells I use. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n*IF* rumours are true about the Oracle Robe becoming *no rent*, it would be <br/>\na good idea to buy a pre-patched Robe now before the market picks it up in <br/>\nprice.  Otherwise, don&#39;t worry about it...there are better robes than the <br/>\nOracle Robe now to look forward to.  I know a 50 Wizzie who volunteered to <br/>\nwear only the FBR through level 50 only because he liked the color <br/>\nbetter....he kicked arse anyway. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n--Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n38 HE Wiz Veeshan<br/>\n&lt;The Magistry&gt;<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
