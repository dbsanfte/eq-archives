Personaly I hope that the later spells are going to be very hard to get..I dont know what all spells can be bought etc, but I hate seeing every wizard just like another..thus it will come a point where every x level Wiz wont have the same spells because some just either dont know where (doubtful due to spoiler information) or just for one reason or another cant get the spell..im all for eliteism in games like these. Know ill probably get flamed to hell for this one..just my opinion..I like to make things very hard in multi player games.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Calyn Dawnwatcher&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wizcalyn@...\">wizcalyn@...</a>&gt; 14/May/1999 02:46pm &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: &quot;Calyn Dawnwatcher&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wizcalyn@...\">wizcalyn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to say I am a little confused.  Verant has specifically designed the <br/>\ngame with a group in mind, yet we are arguing the value of a wizard <br/>\naccording to his solo ability.  I find that odd.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I can say is, give me a tank, then a target, then the location you want <br/>\nme to dispose of the remains.  If you worry about a creature beating on you, <br/>\nbring a wizard along.  It won&#39;t hit you for long.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a wizard.  I kill things.
