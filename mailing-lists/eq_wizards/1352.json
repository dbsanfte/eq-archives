I answer the question of wizards being a weak class as I play<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; game...in character.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is a lot of sniveling going on in the apprentice ranks of our mighty<br/>\n&gt; class.  No pets, no buffs, too much meditating.  Ours is not a class for<br/>\n&gt; those looking for the easy road.  Find a sword or a mace and go punch a<br/>\n&gt; critter if that&#39;s your cause.  Ours is a class of discipline.  The road is<br/>\n&gt; hard, but so are the rewards.  The magics we wield allow us to do one<br/>\nthing<br/>\n&gt; that few classes can.  Solo the entire realm.  I&#39;m currently of the tenth<br/>\n&gt; level, and while I have adventured with a few for fun, 97 per cent of all<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; my time has been alone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Occasionally I even bail out the weak swordslingers, shaking at their<br/>\n&gt; fifteen point hits, while I send ice or fire raining down upon my enemies<br/>\n&gt; (and sometimes theirs) for double or even triple their damage.  So there<br/>\nare<br/>\n&gt; few things I fear in this world of Norrath.  There are few things you<br/>\nshould<br/>\n&gt; as well.  Use your head.  Attack with caution and strategy.  And use your<br/>\n&gt; spells in combinations that will win you the day.  Yes we spend much time<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; meditation, but we are the scholars, the students, and the finders of lost<br/>\n&gt; power.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Adopt the right attitude and use your head in stead of your staff and<br/>\nyou&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; agree.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Djorin<br/>\n&gt; Level 10<br/>\n&gt; E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
