So basicly everyone is usefull in &quot;deep red fights&quot; in one way or another<br/>\nexcept wizards. At low lvls you can jump in there and whack it with your<br/>\nstaff for a bit, but when a mob starts hitting for 60-70+ damage you DO NOT<br/>\nwant to be in melee range.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here is my idea. It could apply to all magic casters, but would be nice<br/>\nif it was a wizard-only type thing. Seeing how lvl 20 - 23 is a pretty much<br/>\ncrap lvl. Due to unreliable spells etc, for every 3 lvls you gain, you gain<br/>\n1 lvl that you can cast on. For example<br/>\n<br/>\n- at lvl 19, you can cast on mobs upto 6 lvls above you (normal)<br/>\n- at lvl 20, you can cast on mobs upto 7 lvls above you<br/>\n- at lvl 23, you can cast on mobs upto 8 lvls above you<br/>\n- at lvl 26, you can cast on mobs upto 9 lvls above you<br/>\n- at lvl 29, you can cast on mobs upto 10 lvls above you<br/>\n<br/>\n.. and so on and so on.. Sure, this will not help much pre-lvl 20. While<br/>\nsitting in unrest you will still be saying &quot;Sorry guys, I cant cast on that<br/>\ncarrion ghoul&quot;, but at lvl 20 it could start to be the rise of &quot; the masters<br/>\nof damage &quot;, and make you much more usefull in groups doing deep reds. I<br/>\nknow during my EQ life ( 1 buble from lvl 29 ) I still find my self in the<br/>\n&quot;Sorry I cant cast on that guys&quot; situation, and it gets worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example one day I was fighting in Cazic, I was lvl 25 or 26, and my<br/>\nfriend was lvl 30ish, and we were pulling from the maze, which was still<br/>\ngood exp for me at the time,. but he was getting very little exp. And he is<br/>\nlike &quot;Hey, do you want to go do gators?&quot;, since that is what gave him good<br/>\nexp. But from my previous exp with gators in Cazic (casting on the odd one<br/>\nin trains, etc) they still resisted me alot. So I said &quot;sorry, cant&quot;... so<br/>\nhe basicly left the group and ditched me, since he could no longer get good<br/>\nexp fighting with me, and I could not damage the things that he would of<br/>\nbeen fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, comments on the idea?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
