Fighting a steady<br/>\nstream of blues, a group that includes a cleric will almost have no use for<br/>\nus until the puller yells,  &quot;Oh Shit, I pulled something big guys, get<br/>\nready&quot;  That is when we shine.

If you are<br/>\ngoing to burn the mob into oblivion make sure they know to use it.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
