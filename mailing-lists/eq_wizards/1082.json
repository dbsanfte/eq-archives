I&#39;m a lvl 8 wizard (almost 9) and I just lost my SR. apprentice robe to 3rd lvl befallen, since I followed my friend down the well entrance and I got killed. I asked a friendly high level shaman if he could get my stuff and he did, except he couldn&#39;t get the robe since it&#39;s a sr apprentice robe. I don&#39;t really mind being without a robe, but was wondering if I should buy another sr. apprentice robe (that&#39;d mean leaving antonica and heading back to ak&#39;anon to get one that fits me) or just wait till I&#39;m strong enough to get the other robe that you speak of?<br/>\n        -----Original Message-----<br/>\n        From: Mata &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mata_eq@...\">mata_eq@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n        To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n        Date: Thursday, May 06, 1999 9:16 AM<br/>\n        Subject: Re: [eq_wizards] More robe questions.<br/>\n        <br/>\n        <br/>\n        Do you have to be the one to LOOT the robe from him in befallen or can a TANK loot the body then give you the robe???  Cus it would stink to have to try to kill him again if a TANK accidentaly looted his body . . .  (I you do kill him for his robe right?)<br/>\n        <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">             ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n            From: Chris Trubiani <br/>\n            To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n            Sent: Thursday, May 06, 1999 9:15 AM<br/>\n            Subject: Re: [eq_wizards] More robe questions.<br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            There is no better robe than the Sr. Aprentice robes that you can buy.  From now on you&#39;ll have to quest to get a better one.  I&#39;d suggest starting with the thermateugist (sp?) robe you get from the necro thermateugist (sp?) on the third floor of befallen.
