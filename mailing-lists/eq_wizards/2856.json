You can pick it up at any druid guild.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A note on Research.  Whenever you make something with runes, no matter what<br/>\n&gt;the spell is, it will be a wizard only scroll that you produce.  I<br/>\n&gt;researched Enstill as well as Identify, which are both used by other<br/>\n&gt;classes.  But, the scroll I created was only memorizable by wizards. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
