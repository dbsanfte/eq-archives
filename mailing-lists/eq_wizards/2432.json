I am on Tunare server and i&#39;m gona stay here and KS as<br/>\n&gt; long as i think its giving me more XP than doing  something else.  Anyways, ppl<br/>\n&gt; on every server are just humans, some are stupid, some are smart.  Some ppl<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t do dick all about me KS their kills and some will take action.  So it<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t depend on which server you play on, you can always KS.  On Tunare, not a<br/>\n&gt; lot of KSer out there, i&#39;ve only met 2 others who also KS on a regular basis, so<br/>\n&gt; its pretty rare too.  The more rare it is, the better actually, cuz most ppl<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know how to deal with it instead of just crying how i&#39;m taking all the xp<br/>\n&gt; and challenge me to duals hahaha.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re one fucking idiot, aren&#39;t you?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe server that guy talked about is the PvP server, moron.
