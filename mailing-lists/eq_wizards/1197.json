I am a<br/>\n&gt;level 9 right now and am at the point where I am thinking about seeking a<br/>\n&gt;magical weapon.  I am sure at higher levels I won&#39;t even want to get NEAR<br/>\n&gt;the monster I am fighting to melee, but at this point I can still get some<br/>\n&gt;decent damage and save mana finishing off creatures with melee.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So as far as magic weapons go, what should I be setting my sights on and<br/>\n&gt;what choices do i have available in the next couple levels?  Also, should I<br/>\n&gt;in general try to use daggers (for speed but low damage), 2h blunt (for good<br/>\n&gt;damage but low speed), or 1h blunt (holding a nice magic item in offhand --<br/>\n&gt;like what?).  As much or as little info as ye have I would be grateful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Solric<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Got an opinion?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Make it count!
