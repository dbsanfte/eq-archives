I think that<br/>\n&gt; we (or everybody) should get spells every lvl or every other lvl.<br/>\n&gt; Especially for wizards.  My friend who is a lvl 5 enchanter almost has<br/>\n&gt; more spells then I do.  They gave us so many useless spells.  Like the<br/>\n&gt; low lvl Sphere of light.  I havent had the need for any other damage<br/>\n&gt; spell besides shocks or bolts.  Then again I am also at a low lvl.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kodros-16th lvl Wizard of Prexus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
