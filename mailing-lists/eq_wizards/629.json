I can&#39;t tell you how many<br/>\ntimes I&#39;ve been able to keep one of them alive because I didn&#39;t gate<br/>\nout. They might have made it. But when you are a walker and you are 4<br/>\nor 5 zones away, why risk it? If the tanks lag behind in exp(cause<br/>\nthey died), seems to happen anyway, they can&#39;t continue to do their<br/>\njob with mobs of your level.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe EC and WC grifs and giants are a perfect example. At our current<br/>\nlevel, the fighter types can survive a few hits but that&#39;s it. If I am<br/>\nwatching, I can throw a piss em off but doesn&#39;t hurt em spell(seems<br/>\nlike AE spells never cease to upset a mob) and pull them off the tank<br/>\nthey&#39;re about to cream. I do this from far enough away that I can zone<br/>\nor gate and everybody gets a running start where it was certain death<br/>\nbefore.<br/>\n<br/>\nDayne, Faern of House D&#39;Gorith and Guild Har&#39;oloth<br/>\nKarana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, 27 Apr 1999 00:36:21 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;From: Vince Seese &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seese@...\">seese@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Since my groups tend to have a high ratio of tanks to spellcasters, I<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt;live (or die) together.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;#2 has lead me to doing a LOT more solo fighting, cause I hate the idea<br/>\n&gt;of either possiblity actually!<br/>\n<br/>\nJerod K Weimer, MCP<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bakersfield.kern.com/diableri/\">http://bakersfield.kern.com/diableri/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:diableri@...\">diableri@...</a><br/>\nICQ#739428<br/>\nMCP ID 1136478 </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
