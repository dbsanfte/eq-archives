Now I see from someone with a lot more experience than I that it<br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t get better. I think we need to seriously petition Verant about the<br/>\n&gt;shortcomings of the wizard class. We need more buff spells to help<br/>\n&gt;ourselves and our parties, and spells of protection, like you mentioned. It<br/>\n&gt;seems to me that this is the sort of things wizards should be able to do<br/>\n&gt;anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I like our highly-mobile artillery battery image as it currently stands.<br/>\nBuffs and protections would cause our image to stray away from that... but<br/>\ndamage shields, now there is a different story.

I can do better than<br/>\nthat closing with the mob in melee - an idea which my character finds<br/>\npositively abhorrant.  Our melee skills are the worst in the game (or so<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard), yet we get more damage out of them than O&#39;Keil&#39;s Radiation?<br/>\nWhat does this say about the spell? Assuming a non-magical weapon, we<br/>\nshould never have to use a melee skill to do more damage than a spell<br/>\nagainst any critter.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is room for improvements with out upsetting the game balance, make<br/>\nthem.
