I tried seeding the skill with a few<br/>\n&gt; training points, and it still has NEVER gone up.  Does the game<br/>\n&gt; have an idea of a primary weapon or something?  Or have I<br/>\n&gt; just been unlucky on raising the skill?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                                                             Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
