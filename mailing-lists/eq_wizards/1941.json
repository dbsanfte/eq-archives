Some are gating to &#39;safe&#39;<br/>\nplaces and close to cities. Other&#39;s are gating to not so safe places near<br/>\ndungeons and adventure zones. Just last night I travelled all the continents<br/>\nwithin the a span of 30 minutes (getting various stuff) and found it well<br/>\nworth it. Gates to our guilds within the city itself would have been a good<br/>\nidea I think. But other than that I&#39;m not too worried about the gate stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nDruids btw, are supposed to be the masters of travel.<br/>\n<br/>\nZalbar The Mad<br/>\n20th Wizard<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
