Through much discussion and debate, we have agreed to send you<br/>\n&gt; this feedback concerning improvements to the wizard. We would like to<br/>\n&gt; thank you in advance for your careful consideration of these<br/>\n&gt; modifications.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>   1) Spells are 100% resisted by mobs 6+ levels above the caster. In large<br/>\n   groups hunting big prey this level cap turns a wizard from the main<br/>\n   dealer of damage to a useless member in the group. Being forced to group<br/>\n   with an enchanter in order to reduce magical resistance, and therfore<br/>\nmaking<br/>\n   the wizard class almost entirely dependant on enchanters, is a very<br/>\nunbalanced<br/>\n   solution. Our suggestion is that either the cap be raised to 6+ levels of<br/>\nthe<br/>\n   highest member in the group, or the cap be raised to 9+ levels higher<br/>\nthan the caster.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2) Spells that both stun and damage targets are often resisted by mobs<br/>\n&gt; that /con green and blue. If this is the result of the stun effect, we<br/>\n&gt; would like one spell without this effect at the same level.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3) Many spell suggestions have crossed this list. Here is one that we<br/>\n&gt; all feel would be a great addition.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tap Affinity - Teleport targeted group member to their own bind spot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 4) O&#39;Kiels Radiation seems that it would be the beginning of a great<br/>\n&gt; line of spells. Why should it end there? Cold and Magic based<br/>\n&gt; buffs/shields would be a very welcome addition.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    5) Wizards are very neglected when it comes to carrying or<br/>\n    wearing items that enhance our appearance. Skulls look like bags.<br/>\n    Fine Steel Staffs are still wooden.  Most wooden staffs are identical.<br/>\n    In addition many completely different spells have the same visual<br/>\neffects<br/>\n    or very inappropriate ones. Example: Fire Bolt is the same as Lightning<br/>\nBolt.<br/>\n    Shock of Lightning is red, not bluish-white.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    6) The chance of a spell fizzling or resisting has noticably increased<br/>\n    over the last few weeks. As an example spells that many have had<br/>\n    for 12+ levels are now fizzling and resisting almost as much as when<br/>\n    they were new.<br/>\n<br/>\n    7) Wizard is the only class that is entirely mana dependent.  All other<br/>\n    casters are able, through pets and/or buffs, to effect a battle without<br/>\n    an ongoing expenditure of mana. Being so entirely mana dependent<br/>\n    we feel that wizards should have a *7 modifier for Meditation rather<br/>\nthan<br/>\n    the current *5 modifier.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; We would like to thank you again for your time. Any type of feedback<br/>\n&gt; would be greatly appriciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sincerely,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Wizards of Norrath<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
