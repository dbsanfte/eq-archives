As a<br/>\nmatter of fact I target the tanks when launching them.  I know if I&#39;m close<br/>\nenough I will take damage, but I have never seen -PvP person taking damage.  I<br/>\nthink if we could damage -PvP players this would definitely be considered a<br/>\nbug, as we could kill PC&#39;s without fear of retribution.  So if it is happening<br/>\nwith a spell be sure to /bug it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalkin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
