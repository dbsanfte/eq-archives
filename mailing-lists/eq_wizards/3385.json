Is there another Wizard list more active than <br/>\nthis one?  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, taking my time trying to solve quests lately so my power-leveling <br/>\nbrethren are passing me by (again...on their second characters hehe) .  Got <br/>\nthe Staff of Observers yesterday which is pretty cool.  How do we get the <br/>\nSentinel spell to work on the staff...we just right-click on the staff <br/>\nbefore medding?  To bad I really don&#39;t have a need for this staff right <br/>\nnow...Staff of Writhing and Stein of Mogguk is better for me.  But I wanna <br/>\nplay around with it before I use it for trade or something. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--Lim&#39;Dul</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
