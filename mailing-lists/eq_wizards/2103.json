South karanas is not a too<br/>\ndangerus place and here you can find also a centour village to sell goods,<br/>\nIn paw there are some nice places where snakes spawn they dont group and<br/>\nyou can sit in their nest killing it one after another as they spawn, also<br/>\ndungeon is not too crowded and many times a party will accept a wizard as<br/>\nroot machine to help against trains. It is excelent dungeon to solo ans to<br/>\ngroup play. <br/>\n<br/>\np.s. im now lv 15 and im in highold pass hunting orcs, very interesting and<br/>\nspecific place requiring all diferent tactics and here realy wizards have<br/>\nsome worth ehehehe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 20.52 30/05/99 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Alex Cordero&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gemini5719@...\">gemini5719@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ok, i have a question. I played a wizard in the beta of this game, i got the <br/>\n&gt;game same day as it came out. I&#39;ve been playing in the qeynos area for these <br/>\n&gt;past months and now i moved to freeport. I&#39;ve noticed so many people that <br/>\n&gt;are in their 20&#39;s in levels even 30&#39;s. I&#39;m only at level 12 and struggling <br/>\n&gt;to go up from here. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s that most of the players are <br/>\n&gt;teenagers who play all the time since it&#39;s summer vacation or people just <br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t have lives but i play as much as my life let&#39;s me, as long as it <br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t interfere with work or hanging out on the weekends and i seem to go <br/>\n&gt;up so slow. I&#39;m hunting now in the commonlands, I like to play solo and play <br/>\n&gt;in groups when i get a chance if I&#39;m in the mood. Can someone tell me a good <br/>\n&gt;hunting spot or what&#39;s going on cause this is really starting to stress me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thx,<br/>\n&gt;  Atrus (Level 12, Karana server)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
