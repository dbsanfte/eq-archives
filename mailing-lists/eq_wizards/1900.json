I have a chance to buy the Savants cap for about 30 plat and am wondering why it could be worth that much since I could just a + mana ring for a whole lot less. Also in wearing the cap I would have to give up on my Halo of light.<br/>\n    Thanks <br/>\n    Kueken, Mith Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
