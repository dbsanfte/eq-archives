If casted &gt;in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;right moment it will not make them agresive and i will do much more &gt;damage<br/>\n&gt; &gt;then using only DD spels.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for the tips.  Question....I would assume you&#39;d need to have your<br/>\n&gt; group attack each of the Mobs to get their attention eh?  I would assume any<br/>\n&gt; Mobs that have not been attacked would suddenly turn aggro on you if you<br/>\n&gt; suddenly dropped balls of flame on their heads?  :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, no. I use the research spell Column of Fire that does 130 AE.<br/>\nI can get two hits in before they turn to me (only the ones that are not<br/>\ndamaged by others yet) and it is usually easy fort the group to take<br/>\nthem off me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;Pulling with eye... Eye is nice thing to pull a mobs first they don  &gt;get<br/>\n&gt; &gt;agresive to it until it is realy near. and when they hit you can pull &gt;only<br/>\n&gt; &gt;this room of monsters as target is already killed and they go after a<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll give this tactic a try.  Do you just let them kill the eyeball and wait<br/>\n&gt; for them to find you?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just get the eye close, they&#39;ll run to you. <br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nSergey<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\nKPS, PUNK (Paramilitary Undercover Nuclear Kamikaze)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
