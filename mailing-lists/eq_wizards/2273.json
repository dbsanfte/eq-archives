This creates<br/>\n&gt; serious problem to recast SOW, Armours or other buffs and also can be<br/>\n&gt; interesting to see what buffs have some particular mob.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One solution to this problem can be introduction of new spell &quot;Detect<br/>\n&gt; magic&quot; wich when is active gives possibility to see active spells on other<br/>\n&gt; PC and NPC. It can give on left part of screen same list of spell icons<br/>\n&gt; what you have on right side for spells active on yourself this dont look<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; too hard to program and all grafic alredy exist for it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If there are some possibilitys here can be introdced some variants like<br/>\n&gt; possibility to see only enchantments cast by ourselves or enchantments of<br/>\n&gt; our lv or lower in complexity of spells.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Icons start flashing if they are to vanish as some armours do now but also<br/>\n&gt; for debuffs or root, enstill what you casted on MOB.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also this can be made so that you can select one of detected spells and<br/>\n&gt; cast a &quot; Dispell magic&quot; only on selected spell !!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is my little 2 cents in our effort to make a EQ better (its already<br/>\n&gt; best but can alwas make better :-) )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    I wanted a lot of that in myself, but the way the background code was<br/>\ndone, it is just not something that we can implement easily.
