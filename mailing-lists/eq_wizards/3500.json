Was wondering about others experience with researching Ice Comet in terms of failing to make spell. I&#39;m not planning on trying anyway until level 50, almost level 49 now. Has anyone failed to make the scroll or know of anyone who has failed? Would hate to  have to collect all those rods again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, anyone know of any good places for experience at levels 48-50 other than sol b or lower guk? Those places are way too camped. I go to Kedge when I can, but need a group for that. Verant waited far too long to make more higher level places to hunt. I do not like guard hunting because I hate to be KOS in places I may want to visit later. Any ideas appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nKronan, level 48 wiz on Innoruuk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
