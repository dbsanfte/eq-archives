He<br/>\ncan clue you in to a quest that will yield +3 earings.  These earings are also<br/>\ndropped as loot in Paw/Lake Rathe (I think, I never obtained a pair that way<br/>\nmyself)  You can also have a jeweler whip you up some good stuff.  Just do a<br/>\n/who Enchanter 34 all, and start sending tells.  You can also camp Pyzgin in<br/>\nQeynos hills for a stone (+9) but that may take some time.  Finally, the stien<br/>\nof Mogguk sells for around 400pp, if you have the cash.  Or you can kill king<br/>\nTranix :) but thats another story<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
