I currently have a Writhing<br/>\nStaff and would only use a Tarton Staff if I needed the extra Mana.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso the groups I&#39;ve been in lately in Cazic and Mistmoore do not require<br/>\nthat I expend large amounts of mana. Most groups consisted of a Cleric,<br/>\nEnchanter, Shaman and 2 tanks. Also most if not all of my spells were<br/>\nresisted by the Red MOBs they were pulling. I spend most of my time casting<br/>\nsome low damage spells that don&#39;t get resisted, try to get a root to hold<br/>\nand take a few whacks with my staff.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t even get me started about Root/Enstill. Last night in Cazic I would<br/>\nenstill a Liz when it got to 30-50%% health so it wouldn&#39;t run and 7 out 10<br/>\ntimes it would resist or break before the liz died. After and hour I was<br/>\nsick of it so I got the ranger to snare at the beginning of the fight and he<br/>\nwas never resisted and it lasted until the Liz died. In fact the only high<br/>\ndamage spell I used was when the cleric yelled for someone to pull a<br/>\nsentinel off him, the DD spell was more reliable than trying to root it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Enchanter we had in our group saved the lives of the party more times<br/>\nthan I can remember. We&#39;d pull too many or get sideswiped by a train and<br/>\nhe&#39;d just mesmerize them and they&#39;d stand there for 30 to 60 secs and the<br/>\nfighters would finish one and go to the next. Also talking to the enchanter<br/>\nMesmerize and MemBlur has never been resisted, He even used it on a Hill<br/>\nGiant when he was 20th just to check. Makes you fell kind of useless. At<br/>\n29th I get Evac and that will give me a purpose but until then being masters<br/>\nof DD is not all its cracked up to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust down on my character,<br/>\n<br/>\nAljernon of Karana<br/>\n27th Level Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nNow I know they added the Tarton&#39;s Wheel quest for us wizards but that isn&#39;t<br/>\ngoing to help me until I get closer to 49th and can<br/>\nactually use the runes.<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Sergey Bukhman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sergeyb@...\">sergeyb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I take it a +10 INT 1HB staff is of no use to you?<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nSergey</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
