I really believe that if we continue to complain or comment on the apparent lack of spells/problems with spells that we have, we are not going to achieve what I believe this mailing list was setup for.  This list is to share information between all Wizards within Norrath !  We are going to lose potential and current subscribers (me and I&#39;m sure others), thus losing valuable shared information because of our ranting and raving about our class.  Remember, Verant is probably not reading this forum..<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion:  Let&#39;s talk about ideas and share information that will help each other play the class that we chose to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, the most useful thing I have read (besides Spoiler information) is the &#39;bug&#39; that allows our Eye of Zoom to unlock doors.  I think that&#39;s great !!<br/>\n<br/>\nValacian - 24th Level Erudite Wizard, Xegony</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
