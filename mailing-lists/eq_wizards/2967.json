Have the<br/>\n&gt;other person target you and begin casting invis. After he starts his cast,<br/>\n&gt;you start your portal.

This will put<br/>\n&gt;you far enough away from the mobs at the hallways near the teleporter that<br/>\n&gt;they will only attack you if they are wandering inside the room(which has<br/>\n&gt;never happened to me and I gate in there all the time). This can also be<br/>\n&gt;applied to groups without another invis caster, simply invis everyone and<br/>\n&gt;levitate yourself. When you arrive in Cazic invis yourself immediately.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I too was intimidated by the Cazic gate because I had heard horror stories<br/>\n&gt;about the place but after a few successful trips in I built my confidence<br/>\n </span></blockquote>up<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;and now use that as my gate if I am going to the Rathe Mountains or Guk or<br/>\n&gt;anyplace that my other gates won&#39;t get me closer too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hope this helps.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yours,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;~Aereuss Ravins of Tarew Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  home to the world&#39;s liveliest email communities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
