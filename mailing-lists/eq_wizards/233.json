There should defiantly bee<br/>\none group leader and all must workd together.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some of my bad grouping experiences (all in one group)<br/>\n<br/>\nBing a new level 5 Wizard I found that I was advancing rather slowly so I<br/>\nleft Erudin to Qeynos and on the the Plains Out side the city gate I teamed<br/>\nup with several others of my skill level. We started off good and exp jumped<br/>\nrater quicky. Then eveyone wanted to kill somthing else because there exp<br/>\nwas not raising fast enough! So the most in the group was running here and<br/>\nthere attacking monsters and running back to where the rest of the group<br/>\nwas. Needless to say when you have three people do this then the group might<br/>\nas well go solo.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it turned out most of them died. I Kept my distance knowing that this<br/>\ntype of group would ultimatly  lead me to hunting down my corpse.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI will admit that the Leader of the group did not help and he was very<br/>\nimpatient with the members. He would run back and forth never letting us<br/>\nknow where he was and he would attack Monsters on sight expecting us to back<br/>\nhim up but we were still back at the last creature or helping a fellow group<br/>\nmember who had been knocked unconscious and barely excaped death!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a member would die no one even cared about recovering his items and<br/>\nthey would walk of into the distance ignoring the fact that the player would<br/>\nbe back in less that 5 minutes which usually gave us just the right amount<br/>\nof time to organize and regain strenght for the next big fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you find youself in a grou that does not work just leave and find<br/>\nanother. There are others out there who want to adventure just as much as<br/>\nyou. Find a group who want to accomplish the same goals.<br/>\n<br/>\nZanshin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ulrich1@...\">ulrich1@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ulrich1@...\">ulrich1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Sunday, April 18, 1999 8:22 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] What should I do<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ulrich1@...\">ulrich1@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ok I have a problem....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am a level 8 Human Wizard in Freeport, Xegony server.
