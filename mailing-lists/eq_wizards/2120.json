I did<br/>\nthis with my druid only doing 36 a hit, a wizard doing 78 would be much more<br/>\neffective.  After lvl 14 go to oasis and group, simple as that, at lvl 18<br/>\nyour options expand to high hold for orc or gnoll groups, permafrost if<br/>\nyou&#39;re feeling brave, and parts of unrest.
