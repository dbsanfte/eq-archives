I decided on Guk to try to score<br/>\n&gt; some Netted, Woven and/or Mesh armor.  If there are any wizards out<br/>\n&gt; there who can give me some advice on what and where to hunt in Guk or<br/>\n&gt; the Swamp, it would be greatly appreciated.   Right now I&#39;m level 9 and<br/>\n&gt; have a couple of other mages and monks who have shown some interest in<br/>\n&gt; this endeavor.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***** Some Spoilers Below ******<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess this is a more general type type of question, but since there are so<br/>\nmany nice items Wizards can get at Guk I will go ahead answer the question.<br/>\n<br/>\nSwamp<br/>\nNetted armor can easily be acquired just outside Guk in the swamp, there is<br/>\na small island right at the entrance to Guk where you will see a lot of<br/>\nFrogloks running around.  Just start taking them out.  You should get a<br/>\npiece of Netted every 15 - 20 Frogs or so.  The only danger is the<br/>\noccasional wandering Troll NPC/Jojoguna (sp?) just keep an eye out, and if<br/>\nyou get into trouble run into Guk.  Also you can get Woven off the<br/>\noccasional Froglok Forager&#39;s.  Forager&#39;s tend to hang out near the old<br/>\nabandoned tower.<br/>\n<br/>\nUpperGuk<br/>\nUpperGuk is a 10 - 30 level dungeon.  The very first part of the dungeon<br/>\n(The area before the bridge/tunnel with the water in it) is very easy.<br/>\nAlthough this is a small portion of the dungeon.  Part of the area after the<br/>\nbridge you probably can take as well depending upon how well your group<br/>\nworks together.  One thing try not to let the Frogs run away from you.  This<br/>\ncan easily start train which could annihilate you, and all of the other<br/>\nunfortunate souls in the area.  Just Root&#39;em nukem or do whatever you do<br/>\nbest to keep them from running. Also pay attention to whats going on around<br/>\nyou. I have seen some nasty trains at Guk.  As far as Frog you get Woven<br/>\narmor off Sentries, Sentinels, Guards, Tuk Warriors, Apprentices, Neophytes,<br/>\nNovices, Witchdoctors, and Tuk Shamans.  Might have missed one or two but<br/>\nthat is the majority of the Frogs that give out Woven.  Mesh is dropped by<br/>\nGaz&#39;s and higher.  There are also a few special Frogs in the area that carry<br/>\ntheir own unique items.  You need to gain at least another 5 levels before<br/>\nyou can even start to thing of tackling them though.  Guk can be a really<br/>\nnice to place to go if you have group that works very well together.  Solo<br/>\nit is almost sucidial especially on the 2nd level of uppper Guk.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun in Guk</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
