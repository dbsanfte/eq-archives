I just got finished &quot;discussing&quot; root and<br/>\nensnare with a couple of high level druids on a message board.  Basically they<br/>\nwanted a reliable root spell like wizards instead of their ensnare line.  I<br/>\nguess its true,  The grass is always greener on the other side.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bonds of force is NOT as good as the Druid form of Ensnare at my current<br/>\n&gt; level 29...<br/>\n&gt; It is resisted about the same amount as Enstill and the length of effect is<br/>\n&gt; much like our root... random.<br/>\n&gt; The druid version of ensnare is not resisted as much, and when it sticks it<br/>\n&gt; always lasts for a minute or two.  I see a few uses for this spell but I am<br/>\n&gt; dissapointed.  I would rather have the druid version of ensnare for a single<br/>\n&gt; mob.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
