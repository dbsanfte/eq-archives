I don&#39;t buy them from dealers,<br/>\nand I suggest not doings so because they put anything from rat poison to<br/>\nembalming fluid on their products to enhance it (killing your brain in the<br/>\nmean time).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, about trying something new.  How is whoever you got your information<br/>\nabout drugs so righteous? It seems you have a strong fear against them, I<br/>\nwould also if they are dealer sold, rat poison LSD is not very good for<br/>\nyou.Although opium and morning glory LSD have no known long term effects<br/>\n(unliketobacco and alcohol).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I noticed that my original spelling of disappointments was wrong.<br/>\nAnyways what am I rambling at (another fun feature of substances) I need to<br/>\nget to school.I give up on whatever we wear arguing about, lets never<br/>\nmention it again.&gt;&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
