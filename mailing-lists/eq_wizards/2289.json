Well<br/>\nheads up buddy when I group I usually direct the group from the rear-vantage<br/>\npoint and I go out of my way to kill whiners like you. Oh, what you say? On<br/>\na non-pvp server? You bet and anyone can do it(the train idea is only 1<br/>\nway....).<br/>\n<br/>\nApparently you&#39;ve already wrecked your reputation enuff that you may never<br/>\nfind a group. I can&#39;t count the times I&#39;ve started a group or been asked to<br/>\ngroup EVERY time I&#39;m in the game. As it has been said on this list more<br/>\ntimes than I can count: Shouting is not the best way to find a group or form<br/>\na group. You apparently aren&#39;t trying hard enuff, don&#39;t care, lack social<br/>\ngraces, or are just a loser(pick one).<br/>\n<br/>\nI can solo thru lvl 25 with rarely a problem if I had trouble finding a<br/>\ngroup. I suggest you find one of these spots and get to whatever level you<br/>\ncan cause you won&#39;t be able to get the full enjoyment out of the game being<br/>\nan ass. Good luck with your 25th lvl solo character. After the ignorance<br/>\nyou&#39;ve shown in your letters I&#39;m not even gonna tell you how to turn your<br/>\nreputation around. Start a new character....this ones going nowhere...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCinius Shade Master of the 6th Circle(Mith Marr)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your free, private email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.excite.com/\">http://mail.excite.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
