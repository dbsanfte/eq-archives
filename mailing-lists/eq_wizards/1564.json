Haven&#39;t made 20th just yet, but this happened with 12th shock of<br/>\nlightning, and 16th flame shock and lightning bolt. I think it&#39;s more of a<br/>\n&#39;I just got a new spell, not how does it work&#39; thing. I was in Permafrost<br/>\nwith Azymodin a 21st high elf wizard, and he was casting force shocks left<br/>\nright and centre with no resisted and lots of dead goblins.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich brings up another point. Has anyone ever noticed that once you hit<br/>\nthat last bubble before next experience your spells fizzle, don&#39;t do as much<br/>\ndamage, things break root all the time, annoying, but I&#39;d like to know if<br/>\nit&#39;s just me or a general thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething else more in keeping with this mailing list.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Where do I find runes? I haven&#39;t found any at all. I think I asked this<br/>\nbefore but no one answered it. I&#39;m dying to start researching, but my old<br/>\nerudin is below average only.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. How the heck do I make money ?<br/>\n<br/>\nZalbar<br/>\n18th Wizard<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
