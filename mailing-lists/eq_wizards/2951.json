How do I get to the courtyard?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Go West young man! Hehe - basically thats it.  When you show up, you are<br/>\nfacing west already.  Just keep heading that way as close as possible. <br/>\nYes, it will fork slightly north and slightly south, just keep the trend<br/>\nwest (IE - if you veered a little north on the last fork, veer a little<br/>\nsouth on the next).   Note - I have my inviso spell hotkeyed, and as<br/>\nSOON as I&#39;m there, I press F1 (target self) and then my inviso key.  I<br/>\nusually get invisoed about 75% of the time, but that other 25%, you get<br/>\nhit by one mob, that RAPIDLY turns into more.  Either gate out (if you<br/>\nare lower level, or unsure of the maze) or I just run like MAD thru, and<br/>\nkeep going out, and south thru the double doors out the zone.  Of<br/>\ncourse, I never show up there not full heath, with my (X)skin and<br/>\n(X)shield spells up, and sow if I can (jboots now).  Even at level 35,<br/>\nit is still a risk, as you can get stunned, and blocked in between mobs<br/>\non both sides (usually only if its a returning train to the temple in<br/>\nthere though).<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck, and it really isn&#39;t as scary as I make it sound, but if I do<br/>\nthat, you are less likely to die and have your corpse somewhere lost in<br/>\nthat maze.  That REALLY sucks...  <br/>\n<br/>\nMicon Bittermage<br/>\nKarana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
