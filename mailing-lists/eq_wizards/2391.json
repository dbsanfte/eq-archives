Hopefully some of you may know the stories<br/>\nbehind these places.<br/>\n<br/>\n- There&#39;s a giant chessboard where undead chess pieces spawn.   Anyone know<br/>\nthe story/history behind this?  <br/>\n<br/>\n- This zone has a golden tower out in the middle of nowhere.  You can go<br/>\ninto it, but there&#39;s nothing there (at least nothing when I went into it).<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if anything spawns here or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n- There&#39;s a place there called the Orc Totem, a large totem pole in a<br/>\nfairly small valley.  Orc Oracles and Ceturions spawn there regularly.<br/>\nI&#39;ve been told that this is where D&#39;Vinn trained the orcs in the arcane<br/>\narts.  The hole in this story is D&#39;Vinn.  He&#39;s a rogue, not a mage - what<br/>\nwould he know about trainning people in the arcane arts?  <br/>\n<br/>\n- There is the ruins of a temple or something (a whole bunch of columns,<br/>\nstanding and fallen) where skeletons spawn.  There&#39;s a merchant there that<br/>\nsells Druid spells.  What&#39;s the story behind the temple; when did it fall<br/>\nand who did it fall to?<br/>\n<br/>\n- There are two Orge NPC wandering around Butchers Block, Corflunk and<br/>\nZachume(sp?).  The Ogre lands are in the southern part of Antione.  What<br/>\nare these two doing here in Butchersblock?  Zachume(sp?) seems to be a<br/>\ndruid or something - a possible connection with the temple ruins mentioned<br/>\nabove?<br/>\n<br/>\n- A friend of mine found a huge stone face carved into the wall of a<br/>\nshallow cave way out in the middle of nowhere.  She was alone and because<br/>\nit was so isolated and such a long walk, she didn&#39;t stick around to see if<br/>\nanything spawned there.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is either a great story here or evidence of programmers dropping<br/>\nacid. =)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Pennaggolan, 3rd Circle Wizard of Felwithe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
