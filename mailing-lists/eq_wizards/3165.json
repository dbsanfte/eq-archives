At this point all weapons are<br/>\n&gt; strictly for stat bonuses.  I&#39;m thinking to myself that Tarton&#39;s staff and<br/>\n&gt; the Glowing stein would make an awesome combo.  Plus 20 Int.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     Root/Enstill  - Out of all the classes that get this spell line, ALL of<br/>\n&gt; the classes have the same problems as your version.  Snare rules in every<br/>\n&gt; way over root/enstill.  It&#39;s one of the best spells in the game for dungeon<br/>\n&gt; diving.  Try going to Lower Gukk without someone who can snare.  I guarantee<br/>\n&gt; you won&#39;t last long.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     Crowd control - Yes, Enchanter&#39;s absolutely rule at this.  It&#39;s what we<br/>\n&gt; do.  Everything else is just cream.  The problem is, this is how we add to<br/>\n&gt; the group.  Yes we can do DD, but it absolutely sucks.  Extremely long cast<br/>\n&gt; time AND refresh rate.  Much better off De-buffing and crowd controling.<br/>\n&gt; There are long periods of time when I&#39;m with my group that I never do a<br/>\n&gt; SINGLE point of damage to any MOB&#39;s.  And that&#39;s the way I want it, because<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve slowed it, weakened it, sped up my party members, and then cast clarity<br/>\n&gt; and other buffs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     And My absolute biggest BEEF with your post - Mez&#39;ing and mem blurring<br/>\n&gt; not being resistable.  Your friend mez&#39;d and blurred a HG at level 20?<br/>\n&gt; Absolutely utter CRAP.  No way.  Never happened.  The only way I&#39;ll ever<br/>\n&gt; believe that is if I see him do it.  Mez and mem blur IS resistable.  I get<br/>\n&gt; resisted ALL of the time, especially if I don&#39;t Tashani first.  Pure<br/>\n&gt; misinformation of your &quot;friends&quot; part<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     And how do I know all of this you ask?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Laszarus - Level 44 Enchanter - Povar<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maureen - Level 31 Wizard - Povar<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
