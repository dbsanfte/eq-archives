Now before you rant and<br/>\n&gt;flame me...hear me out.  I am a 19th wizard.  From our early lives we<br/>\n&gt;study magic, alone in arcane colleges.  We concentrate on being our<br/>\n&gt;best, to better our mind and intelligence.  This means little time for<br/>\n&gt;socialization (at most arcane arts schools).  So yes, we do not<br/>\n&gt;concentrate on buffering other players, we concentrate on causing as<br/>\n&gt;much damage in as little time as possible.  This leaves only us to<br/>\n&gt;think about in the way of shielding.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(roleplay the thoughts folks...its easy...)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My school was a serious school and one which I enjoyed my time at,<br/>\n&gt;however I enjoyed flirting with the other students and frequently dated<br/>\n&gt;the young lady clerics in the guild across the street and partaking in<br/>\n&gt;good elven wines and ale.  I am much older now (145 years old) and<br/>\n&gt;still am looking at by the high elven wizards as somewhat of an outcast<br/>\n&gt;by their standards...but they never question my power and skill.  Maybe<br/>\n&gt;they are just jealous.  Good looks (yeah a little gray hair, but for<br/>\n&gt;145, close to middle age for me, that nnot bad), powerful magic...i do<br/>\n&gt;ok.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I guess I am sort of a Rogue Wizard.  I never liked their rules and<br/>\n&gt;strict policy.  I decided to make my own policy and rules which led to<br/>\n&gt;my dismissal from the school early in my education of arcane arts.  A<br/>\n&gt;wizard hermit in the area of felwithe approached me and offered to<br/>\n&gt;train me.  He said I reminded him of himself when he was young.  This<br/>\n&gt;old mage turned out to be my father whom I thought killed by Emperor<br/>\n&gt;Crush, long ago.  He trained me well and polished my skills and told me<br/>\n&gt;of my true lineage in the &quot;MageStorm&quot; family.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;* that brings us up to now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Ziffnab Magestorm, Xegony<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--- Simon Hinshelwood &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:iktome@...\">iktome@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: Simon Hinshelwood &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:iktome@...\">iktome@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Dear Ken,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Firstly, I agree with the root duration indicator,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that relly would save<br/>\n&gt;&gt; a lot of our fellow wizards life.
