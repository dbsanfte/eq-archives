I want to put an item on a bat<br/>\n&gt; and then tell all the newbies, ro go find it.  Who ever brings me the item<br/>\n&gt; will get a reward.  Myabe a tentacle whip for the fighter typs or my water<br/>\n&gt; crystal staff for the casters.  Ot could be fun.  The other night I was<br/>\n&gt; bored and was going through teh Najena dungeon arming the skels with all the<br/>\n&gt; old rusty weapond I had found earler.  I even gave one a tentacle whip to<br/>\n&gt; see if hed use it.. He did and it looked cool.  I killed that one to get my<br/>\n&gt; whip back<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve done this before with my Enchanter.  It&#39;s loads of fun.  I used to put a<br/>\nstone and a gold bar on a mob, and then combine them for who ever brings them<br/>\nback.  My only suggestion would be to put an odd (but common) item on a newbie<br/>\ncritter and state the ground rules up front (ie Nobody over Level 4 can<br/>\nparticpate) that way a wandering level 20 won&#39;t nuke everything in sight, spoil<br/>\nyour fun, and sell the tenticle whip.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
