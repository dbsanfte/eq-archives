Seafury Cyclopses ... these guys are so plentiful<br/>\nthat their isle can support at least 5 groups comfortably with each<br/>\ngroup pulling nonstop one after the next, all of these one-eyes are lvl<br/>\n39-42 or so making them good exp all the way up to 50 ... they hit about<br/>\nthe same as regular cyclopses, the only difference being that they hve<br/>\nabout 5000 hp&#39;s... their isle is located at about 1900, -6600 (next to<br/>\nthe isle that spawns the aincent cyclops)...However, be warned: also on<br/>\nthis isle is a lvl 45 cyclops named Quag Maelstrom, HE hits like a<br/>\nmother and has LOTS of hp&#39;s, not to mention a nasty mana sink spell that<br/>\nwill drain you to oom very fast if he lays his mitts on you, that being<br/>\nsaid he can easily be taken down by a competent group 45+ (he can be<br/>\nkilled by a group of 40+, but they better know what they are doing) ...<br/>\nkilling him however is terribly inefficient and not worth the time spent<br/>\nper exp gained...he drops nothing of note  and will respawn quickly, so<br/>\nits not like if u kill him you puller wont have to deal with him again<br/>\nsoon.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Livid Malfeasance<br/>\nlvl 49 Wizard, E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
