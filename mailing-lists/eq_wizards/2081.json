Most people here do have problems :)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs to familiars I for one do not want anything like this to go through. I play both a magician lvl 16 and a wizard lvl 19 on rodcet nife server.I dont think the wizard should ever have any type of pet. I started playing a wiz because i hated nedding to stop and summon my pet ever load and having to worry that my pet would not follow me exactly and train me. Pets are a big hassle that it dont want to deal with as a wizard.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOf course this is just my opinion i could be wrong.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
