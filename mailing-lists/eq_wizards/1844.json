I have been listening carefully to the<br/>\npoints provided and I have to admit the people asking for change have been<br/>\nmore eloquent and have made better points than &#39;you guys whine alot&#39;.  It<br/>\ndoes seem from the preponderance of evidence that has been presented here<br/>\nthat there is some lack of balance.  No one has said that the game is<br/>\nunplayable as a wizard just that they need some improvement.  Example last<br/>\nnight I was laughed at when I asked if any one wanted a level 12 wizard. (by<br/>\n3 people over shout no less)  If that is the opinion of the majority of the<br/>\npopulace in a game that is suppose to be group only, then I say we need<br/>\nsomething to make us more valuable...<br/>\n<br/>\nRutreeii<br/>\nCazic-Thul</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
