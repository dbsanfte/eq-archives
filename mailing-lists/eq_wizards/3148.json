Believe me, I don&#39;t like soloing<br/>\nany more than you do...darn boring.  But some nights are just <br/>\nunavoidable...especially on Veeshan when there are certain hours when<br/>\nit&#39;s mostly inhabited by players from Japan. :)  Hard to get a group<br/>\ngoing when it&#39;s in another language. heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;ve been able to find a pretty good spot lately for xp in Cazic.  <br/>\nIt seems to be a good spot for a small group because it avoids the bulk of <br/>\nthe trains.  Some of you might know the area that looks like a big crater?  <br/>\nI think the crater area itself had about 4 or 5 spawn points...plus it has 2 <br/>\ncorridors on either end where and experienced tank can pull from.  With a <br/>\ngroup with 1 Wizard, 1 Cleric and a couple of tanks...you may never need to <br/>\nrun once during your whole time there.  I think this area maybe good from <br/>\nlevels 24-30.  A couple mobs are still red to me at 27.  Extra challenge <br/>\ncomes from the MoB healers who make it extra tough to kill any of the <br/>\ncreatures when they are around...best to switch targets and nuke the hell <br/>\noutta them.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBoy I can&#39;t wait till 29 when we can hit for....241 or something?  Whoohooo!<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
