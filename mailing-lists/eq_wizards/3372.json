I think<br/>\nthere are 4 spawns (if I remember correctly), two at the entrance, one at the 2nd corner,<br/>\nand one more in a little nook a ways down the hall.  The only bad part is that if you have<br/>\nto zone into BB you may run into a train. A good thing is that passersby may be able to<br/>\nhelp if you get into trouble and they drop fairly decent loot.  Good luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nSynsaxus SoulScorcher, Tunare</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
