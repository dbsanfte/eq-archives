So if you are lvl 8 and you group with someone of lvl 12 you would gain no exp.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Tandeyan, Dark Elf Wizard<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: Don Bickner &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bick@...\">bick@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Date: Monday, April 19, 1999 8:17 PM<br/>\n    Subject: [eq_wizards] Experience gap<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Since we Wizzies need to be in a group most of the time, does anyone know at what point in the exp gap it is unwise to group with a person.I am now lvl 8 and am grouping with 10 and 11 lvl tanks and am seeing very slow exp movement.Thanks </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
