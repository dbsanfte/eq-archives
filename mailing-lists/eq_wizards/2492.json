I am a lvl 34 wizard, I have purchased most of my spells from Erudin<br/>\n&gt;and Felthiwe (sp?). But my post was NOT just aimed at wizards, but magic<br/>\n&gt;users in general. If they made all the &quot;run of the mill basic spells to<br/>\n&gt;their class&quot; buyable. Such as<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- the necromancers pet<br/>\n&gt;- high lvl DD spells for magi and wizards<br/>\n&gt;- the &quot;basic&quot; enchanter spells (no clue what they are)<br/>\n&gt;- magicians pets (arnt those buyable now anyways?)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But leave the more interesting spells up for research only, and more<br/>\n&gt;powerfull varaints of spells research only.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Research SHOULD be something that is fun and adds to the game enviroment,<br/>\n&gt;not a distracting pain in the ass that makes you wish you were a wis-based<br/>\n&gt;caster since you could just buy all your spells.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also the suggestion about being able to &quot;Dig Up&quot; runes is to provide us with<br/>\n&gt;something to do BESIDES KILL THINGS . To many things in EverQuest focus<br/>\n&gt;around one thing - KILLING<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- To gain any descent amount of exp. you KILL<br/>\n&gt;- To get any sort of loot/items. you KILL<br/>\n&gt;- To make the next level. you KILL<br/>\n&gt;- To find runes. you KILL<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Being able to quest and &quot;search&quot; for runes would add a fair bit to the game<br/>\n&gt;I think.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyways, research could also add DIVERSITY to the game. To many people are<br/>\n&gt;exactly the same. Same amour same spells same this same that. The only thing<br/>\n&gt;that sperats people are their stats. And for wizards it&#39;s basicly maxed int<br/>\n&gt;and what you can put into the other stats is slow it they dont make that<br/>\n&gt;much of a diff.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But imagin this..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Sammy the wizard has reached lvl 29. He gates over to Tox forest, and<br/>\n&gt;trundles over to the libary of Erudin and buys his spells. They are the<br/>\n&gt;basic run-of-the-mill spells.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Jippy the wizard has reached lvl 29. He gates over to tox forest, and buys<br/>\n&gt;a few spells. He decideds to hold off on buying his gate spell because he<br/>\n&gt;has some runes that have been rumoued to make a &quot;better gate&quot;, he also buys<br/>\n&gt;the inferno spell, but dosnt scribe it right away.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Jippy wanders off to his lab, he mixes his runes and up comes a &quot;Toxxiula<br/>\n&gt;Portal&quot; spell, but sicne Jippy put hte time and the effort into this new<br/>\n&gt;gate spell, it may be a tad bit faster then Sammies.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Next jippy wanders off to his bank account and digs up a &quot;vial of<br/>\n&gt;healing&quot;, and &quot;Erud&#39;s slowing&quot;. He toss&#39;s his inferno spell into his<br/>\n&gt;lexcion, and mix&#39;s in the vial of healing and erud&#39;s slowing. And he<br/>\n&gt;produces a new spell, he scripes this into his book. His spell is more mana<br/>\n&gt;efficent does a bit more damage, looks like the healing spell with a pallet<br/>\n&gt;swap. But it also takes longer to cast.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So Jippy and Sammy are both lvl 29 wizards with all of their lvl 29 spells.<br/>\n&gt;But Jippy has some more &quot;exoctic&quot; ones that just arnt standard run of the<br/>\n&gt;mill. It makes the 2 wizards different.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, the area effect and root spells should be research only, and possibly<br/>\n&gt;the self-buff.. Whatever.. but point is<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Research needs to be changed so it is NOT a tedious pain in the ass. But<br/>\n&gt;something that is fun, adds diversity to magic users of the same class, and<br/>\n&gt;does not distract from game play.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As it stands now I find that research distracts more from game play then<br/>\n&gt;anyhting else.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;What do lizards and rock music have in common?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;They both have communities at ONElist.
