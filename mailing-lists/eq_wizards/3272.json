I think I maxed out my Evocation specialization<br/>\n&gt; and I still get fizzles now and again.  I figure I&#39;m not going to use the<br/>\n&gt; new DD until 30.  I find it more efficient to use the frost shock for now<br/>\n&gt; because we can cast it soo much more at this point.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yeah, it was a real nice surprise, but I was able to make my 29lvl AE spells<br/>\n&gt; when I was 24!  I think I really lucked out on that one.  So I was holding<br/>\n&gt; it in the bank all this time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not looking forward to &quot;hell-level&quot; are you?  ;P<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n&gt; 29 Wizzie Veeshan<br/>\n&gt; Fellowship of Peace<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think the stories about WIS and fizzles might be true.

I think it will be the end of Qenelin. :) I don&#39;t play that<br/>\nmuch, and when I do, I think I&#39;m a tank (got most of 29 by soloing the<br/>\nmaze in Cazic Thule). So I die a little too much. I think Hell Level<br/>\nwill become so frustrating that it just might be the log that breaks my<br/>\nback.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we&#39;ll see.
