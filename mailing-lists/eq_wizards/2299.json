When I play i take blues and black to get good xp.<br/>\nI dont go around killing green stuff to get the time going so I after youre<br/>\nfashion call a roleplaying. I lvl about 1lvl a week. And are happy with<br/>\nthat. And of course I get the best weapon i can get at my lvl.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo can anyone, if I am wrong in my understanding of powergaming, explain me<br/>\nwhat is powergaming and why that is not a way of Roleplaying as i think it<br/>\nis.  And what is wrong with it. If people has much freetime and use it to<br/>\nplay, it should not be called powergameing. As I have seen it been called in<br/>\nearlier posts.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease dont flame me about this as I dont know. And just seeks understanding<br/>\n<br/>\nKarl Hatteland</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
