Out of<br/>\n&gt;curiousity and boredom, I did some exploring and finally found my way to<br/>\n&gt;Cazic Thule.  It was a little scary...saw a lot of lizard trains where<br/>\n&gt;everything was yellow to reds.  I didn&#39;t really go far in...only up to the<br/>\n&gt;first courtyard.  Noticed everybody there at the time was between 28-35lvl.<br/>\n&gt;I was the lowest person on the totem pole..being only 21.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Any of you been there yet?  Am I way out of my league there?  Good tips for<br/>\n&gt;me there for rest spots or areas with Mobs more my league?  I heard it&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt;good promising area for xp.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I want to kill a lizard! :)<br/>\n&gt;-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n&gt;21 HE Wiz Veeshan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Find people who care about what you care about.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;At ONElist:  your connection to community.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
