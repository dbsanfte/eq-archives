With this in mind I seriously<br/>\ndoubt they would &quot;neuter&quot; the wizard class or make any changes at all<br/>\nwithout serious forethought.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I do think we might see these kind of downgrades (along with<br/>\nupgrades) pretty often.  MUDs do this all the time, and EQ is<br/>\na lot like a MUD.  Verant seems to pay much closer attention to game<br/>\nbalance than UO ever did, thats a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith all that said, my guess is that if they do lower the high-<br/>\nend wizard damage, then they&#39;ll give wizards something else to<br/>\nmake up for it.  I have to admit the kill-stealing thing is a<br/>\nvalid complaint - it IS easy for wizards to steal kills.  But<br/>\nlooking at the evidence so far, having played in beta, I&#39;d say<br/>\nVerant knows what they&#39;re doing and I trust them not to screw<br/>\nus over.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 copper,<br/>\n-Steve<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: &quot;John Cuyle&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johncuyle@...\">johncuyle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My opionion is wait and see.  I mean, if we KNEW this was going to be in an<br/>\n&gt;upcomming patch, then feedbacking ahead of time would be fine to ward it<br/>\n&gt;off.  As it stands right now, we would likely just be filling the feedback<br/>\n&gt;cues with messages asking them not to do something they weren&#39;t going to do<br/>\n&gt;anyway and wasting time that would be better spent fixing actual problems<br/>\n&gt;with the game.  Of course, that&#39;s just my opinion.<br/>\n&gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;From: McCartney, Michael R &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:michael.r.mccartney2@...\">michael.r.mccartney2@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Tuesday, April 27, 1999 10:54 AM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [eq_wizards] Re: Hideous rumor...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;McCartney, Michael R&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:michael.r.mccartney2@...\">michael.r.mccartney2@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; So.. should we all wait to see if its just a rumor?  or should we all<br/>\n&gt;petition today stating that it would ruin the game for us?

Wizards have it tough already getting to high levels.<br/>\n&gt;Until<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; lvl 12 or so you are effectively a magician with no pet (and therefore a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; pretty weak magician.)  If they hurt wizards offensively there would<br/>\n&gt;have to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; be some change defensively to offset it.  I mean, wizards only real way<br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; survive is nuke the critter into oblivion fast enough that it can&#39;t take<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; down your paltry hit point pool through your nearly nonexistant AC.  I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; seriously think this is just a rumor, though.  EQ is balanced to be PvE,<br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a Wizard is, in general, not better off than any other classes.  I mean,<br/>\n&gt;at<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; high levels you may be the only one who can solo a Hill Giant, but after<br/>\n&gt;you<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; do that a young lion could maul you because it takes all your mana to<br/>\n&gt;kill<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the giant.  I think the drill here is remain calm and then if they gimp<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; wizards flood them with polite feedbacks on why this was bad.  Heck,<br/>\n&gt;Wizards<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; were gimped right near the end of beta, too, and feedbacks seem to have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; improved that situation.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Share the wealth!<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; Tell a friend about ONElist&#39;s 130,000 free e-mail communities!<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Did you know that knowledge is power?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Join a new ONElist e-mail community and strengthen your mind! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
