As I have seen numerous post I will be covering a few topics in this<br/>\nE-mail. First, up the topic of armor.<br/>\n&gt; I personaly know of a Quest with Baobob and Chanda Miller infront of<br/>\nSurefall glade. To get the great items made by these NPCs all one has to do<br/>\nis raise you faction with them a little bit (kill bandits in Karana plains,<br/>\nor gnolls in Splitpaw). Then target them and say phrases as &quot;what belt?&quot;,<br/>\n&quot;what boots&quot;, and &quot;what cloak&quot;. They&#39;ll be sure to tell you the rest. The<br/>\narmor they made is wearable by everyone, and is the same AC as chainmail<br/>\narmor. Truely a wizards best friend. The seond topic I would like to address<br/>\nis weapons.<br/>\n&gt; Personaly I have a great lust for two-handed weapons, and just recently<br/>\nlast night I found the secret to acquiring one of the most powerfull<br/>\ntwo-handed staffs I have seen around. The name of the staff is the &quot;Runed<br/>\nTotem Staff&quot;. This staff usualy has a street price of 35 to 55 plat. To<br/>\nacquire this staff, you must  travel to Splitpaw dungeon (in South Karana).<br/>\nAfter you arrive at Splitpaw you must get together a tough group of level<br/>\n12s and higher, then travel down into the depths of the dungeon and find a<br/>\nNPC named &quot;Shaman Ren Rex&quot;. He puts up a good fight but gives out a staff<br/>\nevery 10th time he spawns or so. Also I have timed his spawning to<br/>\napproximately 17 minutes. So, run around, kill him and come back in 17<br/>\nminutes for him later....Well thats all that time I have right now. I&#39;ll be<br/>\nback with some more information soon....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Eantos<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; By the way, stats on Runed Totem Staff, +5 mana, +5 hitpoints, damage of<br/>\n9, delay of 37. (better than Great staff that sells in stores for 25 plat)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Shop.theglobe.com * One-Stop Shopping * Free Shipping in U.S.!<br/>\n&gt; Live Personal Shopper * Satisfaction Guaranteed * No Hassle Returns!<br/>\n&gt; Accessories, Apparel, Jewelry, Kids, Sporting Goods, Apparel, More!! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
