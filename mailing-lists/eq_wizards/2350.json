You know as well as I do that it will be quite some time before they iron out<br/>\nsome of the more nasty bugs.  I personally don&#39;t think its too wrong for them to ask you to<br/>\nstop doing something that they consider an exploit.  Just my opinion, nothing more.  Since<br/>\nthis is getting way off topic I&#39;ll stop responding to this thread now before it gets way<br/>\nout of hand.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Have you ever seen a TV released that only shows prime number channels, with a promise<br/>\n&gt; to come fix it some time? Ever seen a stove that only heats to 50 degrees with a promise<br/>\n&gt; to come fix it some time? Ever see a car that only turns left with a promise to come fix<br/>\n&gt; it some time? No. This happens only in computer software, especially high profile games.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well no, but I did buy Windows 98 :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
