You say enstill sucks?  I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen very successful with it so far...although I haven&#39;t used it that much <br/>\nyet, I LOVE the period of time it takes for a creature to get out of it.  :) <br/>\n  Not too many fizzles yet...no more than root I&#39;d say.  Was I just lucky?  <br/>\nGranted, Root is still more mana efficient for me right now at 20.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t used the stun spell &quot;Tishan&#39;s Clash&quot; (?) yet. More people hate it <br/>\nthan like it so far when I ask around.  I know it stuns casters... how long <br/>\ndoes this stun period last?  Does this stun spell cast at a faster rate than <br/>\nany of the shock spells?  I&#39;m just wondering if we&#39;d be better off just <br/>\nnuking the MoB as fast as we can rather than waste time stunning it?  PLEASE <br/>\nprove me wrong. ;)  (I&#39;d love to use new spells)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n20 Wiz Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I very rarely use a root in a group anymore (and enstill really is <br/>\n&gt;terrible)<br/>\n&gt;since when I group I usually have 3 tanks in the group that do some good<br/>\n&gt;damge when they are circled around a Target..I wait till I see the targets<br/>\n&gt;health go down a bit then cast...watch the health bar go down someomore <br/>\n&gt;from<br/>\n&gt;my cast and the damage the Fighters are doing then cast one last time for a<br/>\n&gt;take down.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
