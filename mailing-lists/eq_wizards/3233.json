I would try for at least this much if you can.  The High Quality Bear pelts are in high demand because many people want 10 slot backpacks (which themselves can be sold for over 100p).<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                        Soren<br/>\n                                                        Master Tailor<br/>\n<br/>\nPHAEDRA WHITLOCK wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;PHAEDRA WHITLOCK&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PWHITLOCK@...\">PWHITLOCK@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have a fang dagger from an asp.

So I gave him a HQ bear skin and after some quick negotiations with his friends, he offered to buy all the other quality pelts I had in the bank. I didnt know the &#39;market value&#39; so just said whatever he felt was right, and got 30 plat out of it for 8 pelts. More than Ive EVER had before in my life! Any future pelts I catch, Im to let him know. This is what I love about EQ.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A pity theres no Gate to Other Server spell.
