However, I read many <br/>\nreports from beta testers, guides and other people before setting out <br/>\non the path of the wizard and have a question relating to that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat confuses me, now after playing the game myself, are all the tips <br/>\nin various &quot;wizard guides&quot; about the importance of avoiding hits as a <br/>\nwizard. That it is important is obvious, but how should one manage <br/>\nit?<br/>\n<br/>\nI decided to &quot;solo&quot; the first five levels in order to learn the game. <br/>\nMy experience from that time is that it is almost impossible to avoid <br/>\nbeing hit during combat. Now at level seven I mostly team up with a <br/>\nnecromancer friend of mine and it is much easier avoiding getting <br/>\nhit.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do the guides mean? Are the advice for higher levels where one <br/>\nhave access to &quot;killed on impact&quot; spells or am I missing something <br/>\nobvious? What can one do except running away when trying to avoid <br/>\nhits? Is it the &quot;mini teleportation spells&quot; that are referred to or <br/>\nwhat? Please enlighten me so that I can continue my hitherto very <br/>\nrewarding and highly enjoying career as a wizard!<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nZachris, dark elf wizard of Bertoxxulous<br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\nHenrik Bergstr�m<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:henrik@...\">henrik@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
