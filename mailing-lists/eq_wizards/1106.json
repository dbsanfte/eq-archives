Place the skull in an open hand and Viola!!  +20 mana and +2 SV<br/>\nMagic.  I believe you can use two skulls as well but you will have no melee<br/>\nweapon.  This is going to be my practice in a group.  Or I may keep two<br/>\nskulls on me and use them in emergency for that quick Gate away or that<br/>\nfinally spell to blast the mob to hell!.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy your skulls!<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW: Identify (lore items) is not totally working yet.
