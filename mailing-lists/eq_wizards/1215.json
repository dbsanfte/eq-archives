When your Tank or a companions pet starts hacking<br/>\ninto your group you&#39;ll wish you had Cancel magic...Charm sucks... Funniest<br/>\nthing was seeing our Magician running after we killed the eye and it took us<br/>\na sec to catch on that his Pet was smacking away at him.... In between<br/>\nSpells and ROFL we had to kill his pet cause I didn&#39;t have Cancel memorized<br/>\nat that time...Came in handy tho when the Next Evil Eye charmed one of the<br/>\nRangers....<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is it everyone has problems with getting cash? Through normal<br/>\nadventuring I, at level 13, have just over 70pp more than enuff to buy my<br/>\n5th rank spells and some of the 6th rank spells....
