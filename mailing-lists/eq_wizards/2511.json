But its not so bad as long as your groups are doing fine.<br/>\nJust join up and sit there to gain Xp and Loot. no danger since u don&#39;t hit the<br/>\nmob, so it won&#39;t come after u.  Just cast it once at start of fight to see if<br/>\nits resisted. and then start on the Radiation.  I gained a lot Xp and only died<br/>\nOnce from a skeleton monk that killed someone else and then came after me from<br/>\nbehind.   if they ask you why you aren&#39;t helping, just say ur resisted.  or just<br/>\ncast a few frost shocks to pretend ur helping out :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
