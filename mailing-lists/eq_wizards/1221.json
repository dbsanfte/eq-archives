You<br/>\nmust have a rating of Excellent in any given language to train someone else<br/>\nto excellent.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the languages of Combine, Dragon and a few otheres, no one starts<br/>\nout knowing them fluently.  A couple other ppl here have already mentioned<br/>\nhow to become fluent in them, so I won&#39;t get into that now, but it does take<br/>\na lot of time to learn.

However, languages are a whole new ballgame.  It takes a lot<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time and effort to learn these languages, especially Dragon and Combine.<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; &gt; see nothing wrong with expecting some compensation for your time and<br/>\neffort<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in teaching someone a language.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s something that still eludes me. How does one learn langages? I<br/>\nknow,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been told that you just chat in a group... but that doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>\nwork.<br/>\n&gt; Does one has to invest one point at guild in it? Then how does you learn<br/>\n&gt; Dragon, Combine, or come to think of it, Elder something?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have a monk friend, and we group fairly often, yet he has still to get a<br/>\n&gt; single piece of proficiency in Elvish, Teir&#39;Dal or Elder Elvish.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Vincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Tel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n&gt;         01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Are you hogging all the fun?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Friends tell friends about ONElist!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
