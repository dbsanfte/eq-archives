I could swear that earlier, when my group was<br/>\nhunting the mino caves, I could hit a mino that was around the corner. I<br/>\nwould make my stand near that lava lamp. The Tank would venture deep into<br/>\nthe cave maze and when he had a mino on him he would gsay&quot;incoming&quot;. I then<br/>\nsimply targeted that tank with the corresponding F1- F5 keys and then hit my<br/>\n/Assist hot key. The mino that my tanks was currently fighting was<br/>\nautomatically targeted and I could cast Away. Heck , I hardly ever moved<br/>\npast the lamp and hardly ever even saw the fearsome minos till the were<br/>\ndead. I never got the messg that the I couldnt see the target. Is this all<br/>\nmy imagination?<br/>\nKueken, Mith Marr<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Star Gazer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lsgazer@...\">lsgazer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, June 02, 1999 6:33 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] lost mana when target corners<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Star Gazer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lsgazer@...\">lsgazer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Does it bug anyone besides me how you lose mana when you&#39;re chasing a<br/>\n&gt;fleeing monster down a corridor, say BlackBurrow or Mistmoore, and the<br/>\n&gt;target JUST rounds a corner before the timer has finished?  &quot;You cannot<br/>\n&gt;see your target&quot;, the mana is lost.  I can understand the spell not<br/>\n&gt;connecting, but why the mana loss?
