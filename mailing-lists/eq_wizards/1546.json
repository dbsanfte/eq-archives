Once I hit 24th Ill let everyone know where it<br/>\nis so let the anticipation build.  My Soloing tactics are as many have<br/>\nsuggested here, Shoot and root....shoot and root.  I would have to disagree<br/>\nthough from what people have said that there is no major difference in Root<br/>\nand Enstill.  I use Enstill now and Love it.  I have gotten into situations<br/>\nwhen I blast the heck out of a mob and run out of mana, I then sit down and<br/>\nmed for up to 2 bubs of mana then get back in battle and the mob is still<br/>\nrooted or has just broken free.  I love Enstill and think the  extra mana it<br/>\nuses is worth while.<br/>\n<br/>\nI expect to reach 24 by Sunday so maybe Monday Ill post where this spot is<br/>\nat.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShadair J&#39;Axx<br/>\n20th Wizard<br/>\nKarana<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Valacian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:abryson@...\">abryson@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;EQ Wizards&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, May 19, 1999 5:21 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Spells, This Forum,Etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Valacian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:abryson@...\">abryson@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can feel the wrath now...  but I am ready for the comments.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If I may comment - I don&#39;t believe that us discussing what &#39;would be nice&#39;<br/>\nfor Wizard spells really helps us be Wizards.  I really believe that if we<br/>\ncontinue to complain or comment on the apparent lack of spells/problems with<br/>\nspells that we have, we are not going to achieve what I believe this mailing<br/>\nlist was setup for.  This list is to share information between all Wizards<br/>\nwithin Norrath !  We are going to lose potential and current subscribers (me<br/>\nand I&#39;m sure others), thus losing valuable shared infortmation because of<br/>\nour ranting and raving about our class.  Remember, Verant is probably not<br/>\nreading this forum..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My suggestion:  Let&#39;s talk about ideas and share information that will<br/>\nhelp each other play the class that we chose to play.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So far, the most useful thing I have read (besides Spoiler information) is<br/>\nthe &#39;bug&#39; that allows our Eye of Zoom to unlock doors.
