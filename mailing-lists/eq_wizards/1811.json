I<br/>\nam a level 21 Erudite wiz(Euros) playing on Rallos Zek.  From what I gather,<br/>\nthe level 24 wizard DD spell Frost Shock does around 200 dmg for 110 mana.<br/>\nIf this is the case, it sounds to me like this is the level where we<br/>\nwizard&#39;s start to mature.  That damage/mana ratio is very, very good.<br/>\nNearly as good as DOT&#39;s.  Can any higher level Wizzies out there confirm<br/>\nthis?  Also the 20th level spell Force Shock does great damage yet is<br/>\nresisted too often by &quot;dangerous&quot; blues and higher mobs to be my exclusive<br/>\nhigh damage spell.  Does this trend of high resistance continue as we get to<br/>\nhigher levels?  Or is Force Shock some kind of special case?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nEuros</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
