It isn&#39;t difficult for a wizard to get all of the<br/>\ncomponents BUT you have to have a 20+ level enchanter in order to complete<br/>\nthe quest. Also you can not receive the quest(unless you are a darkie, in<br/>\nwhich case you can&#39;t get the next step in Freeport) because the ogres will<br/>\nkill you on sight. Basically the quest goes like this...<br/>\n<br/>\nYou talk to a bartender in Ogguk and he says he is missing his recipe<br/>\nbook(or some such nonsense) and that he gave it to a bartender in Freeport.<br/>\nYou go to Freeport and talk to the bartender on the docks and he says he is<br/>\ntrying to make some wonderful drink and that if you get him the items he<br/>\nwill give you the book back. He wants 4 things. A kiola nut from OOT, JumJum<br/>\nJuice from Rivervale, Fish Scales from Qeynos, and 1 thing from Erudin which<br/>\nI forget right now. Anyway after you collect all of these things you return<br/>\nthem to him and IF your faction is high enough you get the NO DROP<br/>\ncompendium(this is why you have to have an enchanter because you have to<br/>\nhave good standing with both Freeport and Ogguk). After you get the book<br/>\nreturn in to the ogre and you will get the coveted glowing stein. This is a<br/>\nrather crude over view of the quest but it really is pointless unless you<br/>\nknow a trustworthy enchanter. Even if you offer 100 platinum to a stranger<br/>\nyou could get ripped because the stein is currently going for around 750<br/>\nplatinum(I am SOOO glad I know a friendly enchanter). Now if you are friends<br/>\nwith an enchanter this a good way to make money because, as a wizard, you<br/>\ncan collect the items and the enchanter can finish the quest. All told about<br/>\n3 hours work for 750 plat, not too bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nYours,<br/>\n<br/>\n~Aereuss Ravins of Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
