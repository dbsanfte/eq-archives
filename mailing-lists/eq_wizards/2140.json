I will do my best to add to this promising<br/>\nthread.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me use the example of Unrest.  There is a long narrow passageway from<br/>\nthe zone to the area where most groups bring monsters to fight.  If a tank<br/>\nbecomes overwhelmed and starts to run for the zone, all the monsters follow<br/>\ninto the narrow tunnel and once the tank zones (or is killed) they will<br/>\nimmediately attack anyone else who is in the tunnel.  For a mage type, 3 or<br/>\n4 level 25 skeletons will make VERY quick work of you if they are between<br/>\nyou and the zone.  Because of this you will almost always have to gate out<br/>\nif you are in a bad situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also find that as a wizard you can greatly assist your group by organizing<br/>\nattacks and providing information.  Standing back from the group (as<br/>\nmentioned below) I will report on monsters around us and possible trains<br/>\nforming, as well as reminding the party which monsters to attack first (I<br/>\ncan&#39;t believe that there are still so many level 18+ players who don&#39;t know<br/>\nhow to ASSIST).  Anyway, try your best to be on top of the situation and<br/>\ngauge the ability of your group.  Should things turn bad you can pull a few<br/>\nbaddies off your tank so that they can escape, and hopefully shieldskin will<br/>\nlast long enough for you to stay alive as well. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease add your battle tactics to this thread and hopefully we will all die<br/>\nless :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Solric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Lim Dul [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sevendegrees@...\">sevendegrees@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 01, 1999 2:37 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] group tactics?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Lim Dul&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sevendegrees@...\">sevendegrees@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a good question.  It really depends.  Assuming you have a balanced <br/>\ngroup (ie a healer, a tank or two, and some nukers) more likely than not, <br/>\nyou&#39;ll have enough time in the group during battles to dictate who needs to <br/>\nrun and when.  My regular group finds it best to have the tank buffed up <br/>\nwith SOW so that he/she can run when necessary without jeapardizing (sp?) <br/>\nthe rest of the group.  If it&#39;s a controlled & organized party, the <br/>\ncreature(s) will most likely all be attacking your &quot;pulling&quot; tank.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I find myself in an unfamiliar group I kinda play it by ear.  It&#39;s a lot <br/>\ndifferent playing against orcs in Oasis & CB versus training Dry Bone Skels <br/>\nin Unrest.  Main thing I found helpful is to call out who you&#39;re assisting <br/>\nin a fight so that everybody can zero in on one creature at a time.  /ASSIST<br/>\n<br/>\nis our friend. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI try not to cast too early as to call attention from a tank.  And I try not<br/>\n<br/>\nto cast too little as to have left my tank high and dry.  I think it&#39;s our <br/>\nobligation to make sure we are not engaged in melee during battle so as to <br/>\nnot be interrupted during attacks and so the tanks need not chase the <br/>\ncreature about.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sometimes make judgement calls if I feel that my tank is not going to make<br/>\n<br/>\nit to zone.  I have sometimes let loose on spells to draw some creatures to <br/>\nme....with Shieldskin up, I can afford to absorb some blows where I can then<br/>\n<br/>\nchoose to run them away from the tank or to keep their attention while my <br/>\ntank hits them from behind.  This works OK, but it sometimes results in a <br/>\ngory death. :)  But this is no problem if you trust your party...tanks die <br/>\nfor you...be willing to die for your tanks sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhoa, I&#39;ve talked too much.  Hope these tips help somebody.  I am by no <br/>\nmeans an expert so don&#39;t expect these to work for everybody.  I&#39;d like to <br/>\nencourage everybody to express some of their battle tactics here rather than<br/>\n<br/>\nargue all the time! hehe<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n18 Wiz Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Strategy check:  Which has the better survival rate?
