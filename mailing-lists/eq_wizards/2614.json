I just got finished &quot;discussing&quot; root and<br/>\nensnare with a couple of high level druids on a message board.  Basically<br/>\nthey<br/>\nwanted a reliable root spell like wizards instead of their ensnare line.  I<br/>\nguess its true,  The grass is always greener on the other side.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
