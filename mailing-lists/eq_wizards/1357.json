That","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2104693493\">Good point.  Personally, I usually spend twice as much mana as they lose <br/>\nhealth, up until 60% mana.  Then I save for root or nuke if there is <br/>\ntrouble.  That way I med up before they heal up.  I like them to see me <br/>\nhelp, but not have to wait on me.  Of course, if there is a cleric, you have <br/>\nto modify things.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, I always have to modify things.  Communication is the most <br/>\nimportant attribute of the wizard.  When you group, play things your way a <br/>\nlittle, then ask opinions about your mana burn.  You may be suprised at the <br/>\nanswer.<br/>\n<br/>\nCalyn of Bristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;When you are finished Meditating and stand up the warriors are just <br/>\n&gt;finished<br/>\n&gt;resting back there HP&#39;s. This means that if they must wait for you then you<br/>\n&gt;are casting too much. I only start nuking if I see a targeted warrior drop<br/>\n&gt;below 1/2 his health, and we do not have a healer. Then when the party is<br/>\n&gt;healing themselves I am Meditating and we tend to finish at same time. This<br/>\n&gt;way they do not feel I am a burden but rather a savior when I really let<br/>\n&gt;lose my power to save them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Elkantar<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
