I train languages and bind<br/>\nfor free all the time, even turning down &#39;gifts&#39; that are offered to me for<br/>\nperforming the service for free.   ...but that is just me and my character.<br/>\nI just hope the good will is returned by others in the future when I may<br/>\nneed it.

I<br/>\nam only hoping<br/>\n\t\tto elicit some other opinions on this subject as well.<br/>\n\t\t <br/>\n\t\tI don&#39;t know why but it has never made sense to me to charge<br/>\nfor services<br/>\n\t\tsuch as binding, invis, and language training.  Perhaps it<br/>\nis just the<br/>\n\t\tpersonality of my character that he enjoys helping others<br/>\nand gets full<br/>\n\t\tsatisfaction out of the good deed itself, not needing any<br/>\nsort of physical<br/>\n\t\tcompensation.<br/>\n\t\t <br/>\n\t\tI realize that I will be able to make make up to a plat or<br/>\nmore each per<br/>\n\t\tbind and a plat or more for invis (depending on how bad they<br/>\nwant it) but<br/>\n\t\tthat just seems unkind.  I remember when I was level 8 just<br/>\ntravelling over<br/>\n\t\tto freeport.  I only had a couple of my new 3rd circle<br/>\nspells because they<br/>\n\t\twere so expensive and I was flat broke.  I saw people<br/>\nauctioning: &quot;Binding<br/>\n\t\tat S. Gate, 15gp&quot;, and there was no way i could afford that<br/>\nwithout selling<br/>\n\t\tthe few pieces of cloth armor i had left.  I was lucky to<br/>\nfind a kind druid<br/>\n\t\tthat bound me and asked for nothing in return, but I just<br/>\nwonder why so many<br/>\n\t\tseek to earn a profit from their abilities rather than just<br/>\nuse them to help<br/>\n\t\tothers and take joy in that.<br/>\n\t\t <br/>\n\t\tI guess it is just based on your roleplaying style, but even<br/>\nif I have no<br/>\n\t\tmoney and still have spells to buy, I would not ask for or<br/>\naccept any sort<br/>\n\t\tof payment for using my talents.  Does anyone else agree<br/>\nwith me or do you<br/>\n\t\tall think that you SHOULD rightfully earn a profit from<br/>\nusing your skills?<br/>\n\t\t <br/>\n\t\t-Solric</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
