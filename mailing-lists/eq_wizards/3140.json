I&#39;v found<br/>\n&gt;stuff that still gives me exp at level 35 in Sol A, but it sure isn&#39;t much<br/>\n&gt;&gt;when it happens.  If your going to solo there, best be level, oh say, 50.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I don;t believe there to be a way to safely solo in Sol and still get exp<br/>\n&gt;&gt;at any level.  Most of the place was green to me even at 33 (when I first<br/>\n&gt;&gt;went there).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Eeeeesh!  :(  Thanks for the tips...I guess I&#39;ll avoid the area for a bit.  <br/>\n&gt;Yeah, I usually don&#39;t like going solo either...but there are sometimes those <br/>\n&gt;nights when nobody wants to group and I go off on exploration journeys. :)  <br/>\n&gt;Perma is another place I wanted to venture...but it sounds like the goblins <br/>\n&gt;there are no fun too. ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  New!!
