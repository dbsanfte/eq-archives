The mutating equipment bug has been there under one form or another for ages. Usually, it happens when you get charmed or get linkdead in bad situations. ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-651127045\">According to Gregory Egan:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Ok, has this happened to anyone else? I died and when I went to loot my corpse my Stein of Moggok had mutated into Chitin Shell Armor. Not quite an equitible trade. I petitioned a GM, who at least answered quickly, but his advice was to sell the armor for a new stein, as if they were of equal value. No other help or advice offered (surprise, surprise). Bought a new stein and sold armor for a loss of almost 200 pp. Anyway, is this a known bug? I will petition <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQbugs@...\">EQbugs@...</a>, but don&#39;t expect help there either.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The mutating equipment bug has been there under one form or another for<br/>\nages.
