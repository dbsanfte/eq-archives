You always get at least 2.5 gold off of them for their bow and<br/>\narrows.  In just an hour of adventuring, you can have 4 or 5 plat saved up<br/>\nand get good xp too.  That&#39;s what I did from 10th to 12th lvl.

Through normal<br/>\n&gt; adventuring I, at level 13, have just over 70pp more than enuff to buy my<br/>\n&gt; 5th rank spells and some of the 6th rank spells.... What&#39;s everyone doing<br/>\n&gt; for cash?&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know about others, but I haven&#39;t found a ready source for cash<br/>\nthat I can<br/>\n&gt; survive hunting.  I generally hunt with a similar level warrior.  By<br/>\nscrimping and saving<br/>\n&gt; tho I have gotten a full set of cloth armor and most of my level 8 spells.<br/>\nCurrently am<br/>\n&gt; level 10.  Now begins the scrimping and saving to get level 12 spells.  I<br/>\nknow that<br/>\n&gt; some others have taken up smithing, etc to make money.. but I chose to<br/>\nsave my<br/>\n&gt; money for the spells themselves rather than spend the little I made on<br/>\nsupplies for a<br/>\n&gt; skill like smithing.  I&#39;d love to find a money tree but since I think<br/>\nthat&#39;s unlikely will just<br/>\n&gt; play patiently and save up slowly.  As others have pointed out here, I<br/>\nsuspect that<br/>\n&gt; getting cash will be easier at higher levels.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Iggie<br/>\n&gt; Level 10 Gnome Wizard<br/>\n&gt; Cazic-Thule<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -you have now made level 570 in beer spilling while fishing- &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
