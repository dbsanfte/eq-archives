Sounds like fun, I wouldn&#39;t mind trying that out<br/>\nat some point.  Only problem I see in your strategy, is I think you are<br/>\nhaving some illusions about the toughness of monsters you can beat.  When<br/>\ncreatures are much higher lvl than you, your spells will not hurt it in the<br/>\nleast.  I&#39;d say this starts happening at about 8 lvls higher than you. (this<br/>\nis just a rough estimate based on my personal experience)  So if you went<br/>\nout and tried to fight a griffin (a lvl 30 creature), it would take about 30<br/>\nseconds for everyone in you party of 6 wizards to die, and the griffin would<br/>\nleave grateful for the nice massage you gave it with all your shock of<br/>\nlightning spells.  Other than that I think it would be tons of fun to go and<br/>\nthere and just nuke nuke nuke.<br/>\n<br/>\nTandayen, Dark Elf Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ken Lee &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kenlee@...\">kenlee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, April 19, 1999 2:21 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] 836pts of damage in under 10 secs from a 14th wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Ken Lee&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kenlee@...\">kenlee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    PCs can&#39;t interrupt monster spells.
