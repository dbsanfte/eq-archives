I told this idea to a friend of mine<br/>\n&gt; and he said that would make Wizards have infinate mana.  So I said what<br/>\n&gt; if there was something like a &quot;Wizards Pouch&quot; and It could hold like 10<br/>\n&gt; of these mana restoring items and the items can only be placed in this<br/>\n&gt; bag.  And a wizard can only have one bag.  That would limit the amount<br/>\n&gt; of these items to 10.  Therefore making us better at soloing but wouldnt<br/>\n&gt; let us have infinate mana.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
