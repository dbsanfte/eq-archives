Some ppl don&#39;t agree. Very well, as Valacian suggested,<br/>\nlets get by this and focus on what we CAN do.  Lets unlock the mysteries of<br/>\nthe wizard class as it stands now, not what it could be or what it should<br/>\nbe.  That&#39;s what the /feedback feature is for in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we wish to continue to argue the different aspects of the wizard class,<br/>\nthen maybe we should make a new email list for that specific focus.  Don&#39;t<br/>\nget me wrong, I like a good debate as much as the next person, but I think<br/>\nValacian is right, we have the potential of scaring ppl away, of doing the<br/>\nopposite of what this list was created for.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks Valacian for the reality check.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalarin Kal&#39;Amon, High Elven Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Valacian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:abryson@...\">abryson@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;EQ Wizards&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, May 19, 1999 6:21 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Spells, This Forum,Etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Valacian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:abryson@...\">abryson@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can feel the wrath now...  but I am ready for the comments.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If I may comment - I don&#39;t believe that us discussing what &#39;would be nice&#39;<br/>\nfor Wizard spells really helps us be Wizards.  I really believe that if we<br/>\ncontinue to complain or comment on the apparent lack of spells/problems with<br/>\nspells that we have, we are not going to achieve what I believe this mailing<br/>\nlist was setup for.  This list is to share information between all Wizards<br/>\nwithin Norrath !  We are going to lose potential and current subscribers (me<br/>\nand I&#39;m sure others), thus losing valuable shared information because of our<br/>\nranting and raving about our class.  Remember, Verant is probably not<br/>\nreading this forum..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My suggestion:  Let&#39;s talk about ideas and share information that will<br/>\nhelp each other play the class that we chose to play.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So far, the most useful thing I have read (besides Spoiler information) is<br/>\nthe &#39;bug&#39; that allows our Eye of Zoom to unlock doors.
