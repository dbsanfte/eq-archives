The <br/>\nthreads are also persistant, so you get less repeats.  This is my favorite <br/>\nsite for indepth discussions, and has separate forums for just about every <br/>\ntopic, from solo strategies to in game dating.  I definately recommend it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn all fairness, the discussions are not usually as specific as a single <br/>\nspell, but I would like to see how the group responds to some of your <br/>\nthoughts.  Just don&#39;t yell about &quot;broken classes&quot;, as you will likely get <br/>\nnowhere.  Start from a solutions point of view, and I think you would be an <br/>\nasset to the site.<br/>\n<br/>\nCalyn Dawnwatcher<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Thanks Cristie and others for the nice words, but I think I know the <br/>\n&gt;problem.  This is my first (and probably last) mailing list and I didn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;realize that they are only for one-shot answers to questions.  Does anyone <br/>\n&gt;know of a good forum (or whatever they are online) where I could go to for <br/>\n&gt;Everquest spell complaints/suggestions?  Besides having beta tested for UO, <br/>\n&gt;playing Everquest and various info searches, I dont really spend any <br/>\n&gt;&quot;social&quot; time online and didnt realize that I was breaking Netiquette rules <br/>\n&gt;here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
