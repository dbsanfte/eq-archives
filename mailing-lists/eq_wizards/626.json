You all ran 20 min to your fav kill spot.  Played for<br/>\n&gt;hours of fun.  Night is over.  Do you gate home, leaving your tanks to<br/>\n&gt;run thru what might end up being hostile areas (but usually aren&#39;t), or<br/>\n&gt;do you run with them?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As for point number one. I usually run home with them, unless something<br/>\ncomes up that requires me to log off faster.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2nd is harder.  Basically, do you die with your party, or abandon them<br/>\n&gt;when there is trouble?  All of this talk of shadowstep gate has made me<br/>\n&gt;think Im in the minority here.  My tanks actually tell me they expect to<br/>\n&gt;die so I can live, if it comes to that.  BUT - I don&#39;t think its right<br/>\n&gt;to leave them. Am I doing them a disservice ?  I would rather try one<br/>\n&gt;more time to get that root off on the MOB killing them so we can all<br/>\n&gt;live (or die) together.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>#2 My Philosophy is this. If all the rest of the groupo has fallen, and<br/>\nthere is one tank and you. Fight with the tank till the enemy is dead or<br/>\ntill the tank looks like he/she is not going to make it. If they arent<br/>\ngonna make it Gate the heck outta there. You have to remember, we have<br/>\nbuilt in weaponry and armor, they do not. If we live then we can do<br/>\neverything in our power to hold off what ever killed them in the first<br/>\nplace while they gear up to exact revenge.<br/>\nAlmost every group I have been with tells me to run for the hills when the<br/>\ntanks and clerics are almost destroyed. They find it much easier to return<br/>\nto a hostile place where bodies lie when they have artillary as backup.<br/>\n<br/>\nhope this helps with your decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGarret E.
