However, today I was parusing<br/>\nsome of the web sites and noticed the following about the spell Gravity Flux<br/>\n<br/>\nEQ Lizer: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gameznet.com/eq/spells/wizard.html\">http://gameznet.com/eq/spells/wizard.html</a><br/>\nDoesen&#39;t even list the spell for wizards at any level<br/>\n<br/>\nCasters Realm: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/wizard/\">http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/wizard/</a><br/>\nLists Gravity Flux as a level 49 wizard spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nGraffe&#39;s Wizard Compalation: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.graffe.com/\">http://www.graffe.com/</a><br/>\nLists Gravity Flux as a 44th level wizard spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nI assume that EQ lizer just isn&#39;t up to date and that we do actually get<br/>\nthe spell.  However I am not unsure weather or not its a level 44 wizard<br/>\nspell or a level 49 wizard spell....<br/>\nCan someone confirm?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack, Knight Defender of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
