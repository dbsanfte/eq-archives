I try it again at a 12 lv and i tryed to max it<br/>\n&gt; again. IT DONT MOVE i lost hours fighting a blue yellow and even red when<br/>\n&gt; some group leave me to try and nothing i never get any advance anymore ?? i<br/>\n&gt; also get one cracked staff but with skill 0 i never got any advance. so now<br/>\n&gt; i have 2h blunt at 36 and dagger at 20 1h blunt at 0. and i dont have any<br/>\n&gt; wish to invest a skill points in this :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t really know. I hadn&#39;t used my dagger skills since level 2, when I found<br/>\na decaying skeleton carrying a worn great staff, so when I decided at level 8<br/>\nto go back to dagger (skill was 4 when I stopped it), it took me three fights<br/>\nbefore I got a message on Piercing skill. And the skill *immediately* raised to<br/>\n8, which shows that your min skill is also equal to your level for combat<br/>\nskills.<br/>\n<br/>\n(so, if you&#39;re 12, investing 1 practice in 1h blunt gives you 12, not 1)<br/>\n<br/>\nSince then, I&#39;m switching weapons after each fight in which I gain a skill<br/>\npoint. Keeps me maxed correctly in all... I suspect I&#39;ll have a Crookstinger<br/>\nbefore I get the totem staff...<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
