I have tried very hard lately to keep order at camps and nothing<br/>\nworks. so I gave up. I count the number of people in the camp and wait for<br/>\nthat many dervs to spawn, then i take the next one... regardless of who&#39;s<br/>\n&quot;turn&quot; it is. I figure that i have to be at the end of the rotation so<br/>\neveryone there has already had a turn when i go and the person that whines<br/>\nto me was on his/her second turn. I guess you can call it killstealing, but<br/>\nnot many get  mad because i&#39;m not just stealing everything when i have the<br/>\nmana... but that&#39;s what i do now... i am moving to a new server soon and i<br/>\nam seriously thinking of just going out and stealing everything i can for<br/>\nthe hell of it. but i don&#39;t think i&#39;ll do it because i&#39;m a nice guy and that<br/>\nsucks for everyone else<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Cristie &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cristie@...\">cristie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, June 08, 1999 1:48 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_wizards] Wizards are fun - don&#39;t ruin it for everyone<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Cristie &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cristie@...\">cristie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Kill stealing is not the way to make friends for personal or the class as a<br/>\n&gt;whole.  It might serve the purpose of the person at the time, but rest<br/>\n&gt;assured, those groups/people you steal kills from WILL remember your name<br/>\n&gt;and later on down the road when you can&#39;t cast/melee your ass out of a<br/>\n&gt;tight spot, if those folks are around they will more than likely just sit<br/>\n&gt;and watch you get the crap beat out of you til you die and laugh their<br/>\n&gt;heads off.  Sad people think this is okay.  I get more exp working with a<br/>\n&gt;group of 6 than I do alone by far.  The bonus for a full group helps a lot<br/>\n&gt;and if you find the right spots (not telling mine), you will get more than<br/>\n&gt;enough cash and goodies to go around.  We normally have a pile of bodies to<br/>\n&gt;loot and everyone goes away with their pockets full and their exp bumping<br/>\n&gt;up nicely...AND a good feeling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At 04:01 PM 6/8/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:yur@...\">yur@...</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I probably will get flamed for this for sure, but who cares.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I made it all the way to lvl 12 as an erudite wizard.
