While I don&#39;t know<br/>\nif these are the best ways to increase your language skills, they do the<br/>\nhave the virtue of trying to make the most of your time<br/>\n(1) Being a high-elf,  I spend some time fishing. While fishing I get with<br/>\na partner(s) and send random messages. Doesn&#39;t have to be anything it seems<br/>\nfor the skill to go up.<br/>\n(2) Ditto but on the boat to Freeport. The wait for the boat and the wait<br/>\non the boat are excellent times to increase language skills especially<br/>\nsince you cant practice any spell casting. If you can get the entire boat<br/>\nto go along with this, your skills will really jump.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee ya.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 12:54 PM 4/18/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Chris Trubiani&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:u1607755@...\">u1607755@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just get a partner, and keep saying the same thing over and over again to<br/>\n&gt;each other.

I have been unable to figure out how to do so though :(  I know<br/>\n&gt;how<br/>\n&gt;&gt;to change my language from Erudite to Common and back.  I also see them<br/>\n&gt;&gt;listed as skills.  I do not see anyplace for other languages though when I<br/>\n&gt;&gt;talk to my guild trainer.  Is this what the specialization or research<br/>\n&gt;&gt;skills are for.  Or am I missing something.  I know that listening to the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;language is supposed to help increase skill, but I have yet to been able to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;really listen to foreign tounges for a long period of time.  Was just<br/>\n&gt;&gt;wondering if anybody could explain how to go about this, because I am<br/>\n&gt;&gt;stumped and don&#39;t see any easy or logical way to start studying a new<br/>\n&gt;&gt;language.  Thanks Everyone<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Zakrul<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Erudite on Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Start a new hobby.
