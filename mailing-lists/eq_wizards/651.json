I am lvl 16 and got mauled by 6 undead sailors<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; could not get enough time to figure out I couldn&#39;t cast on the boat, not<br/>\n&gt; even shadow step/gate to save myself.  I then ran off the boat with 1 bar<br/>\n&gt; health remaining and was killed while trying to cast my spells.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Some would say this is part of the game...I disagree.  I cannot cast my<br/>\n&gt; spells (what wizards do best) on a docked boat to defend myself, yet<br/>\nothers<br/>\n&gt; may attack me.  Not fair, I say.  Maybe Verant should allow us to cast<br/>\n&gt; spells once the boats dock for loading and unloading?  That would be fair.<br/>\n&gt; I agree with their logic on not casting while boat is in motion (you can<br/>\nget<br/>\n&gt; folks attacking NPC&#39;s from the boat and causing innocents to get killed).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Looking for inputs as I am petitioning this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Ziff<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Did you know that knowledge is power?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new ONElist e-mail community and strengthen your mind!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
