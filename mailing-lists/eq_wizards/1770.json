Competing for bat and large rats? It<br/>\nall equals out. So they&#39;ve got better gear. Big deal. I don&#39;t care what<br/>\nstuff you&#39;ve got on. You&#39;ll still get the snot pounded out of you by a red<br/>\nconning creature.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;when a 20th level character gives items high in value to a less then 10th<br/>\n&gt;level character that is simply foolish and exploitable.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, but there&#39;s nothing implicitly wrong with it. All the great items that<br/>\npeople are complaining about aren&#39;t really all that awesome. Let&#39;s take for<br/>\nexample, the robes of the oracle. What&#39;s the greatest thing this robe does?<br/>\nAdds 30 mana to a pure caster. OMG ! 30 mana, why I&#39;ll be able to<br/>\n....to...to...wait a minute, what spells cost 30 mana or less? Sphere of<br/>\nlight?<br/>\nYes, it helps, and they&#39;ll be able to burn a lot of new kills, but once<br/>\nyou&#39;re over and above 5-7 th level it really means nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now at 5th level I did find a mighty magical item that someone had<br/>\n&gt;mistakenly dropped. I belive this is fair in the game. But to have a<br/>\n&gt;character outfitted by other, in a guild or no, is simply cheating and will<br/>\n&gt;ruin the balance of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I keep wondering about this balance you&#39;re talking about. Twinking has<br/>\nnothing to do with balancing the game. Can this &#39;twinked&#39; character take on<br/>\nanything that he would not normaly be able to do? (Within reason of course)<br/>\nIf you&#39;re gonna tell me he can take on orc pawns at lvl 1 I&#39;m gonna laugh at<br/>\nyou. Because, so what? If you tell me his 10th lvl guy twinked can solo<br/>\ngnoll commanders then I&#39;ll admit that&#39;s a bit unfair. However, again, how<br/>\ndoes this affect YOUR gameplay, how are YOU affected by this? Answer is,<br/>\nyou&#39;re not. They&#39;ll go along hacking and beating up stuff that you can&#39;t<br/>\neven consider as yet, but once the day is done, who has more satisfaction?<br/>\nYou do. You&#39;ve worked for everything you got. It&#39;s like me. I refused to<br/>\nbuy magic items. I did my share of sitting in paw waiting for that @#%$<br/>\nshamen to appear and killed him myself. Ever play one of those shooter games<br/>\nand cheated? Ever cheated to get through a starcraft mission? How glorious<br/>\ndid it feel to beat it that way. It doesn&#39;t. So really, the only loser here<br/>\nis the twinked character. My 2 ï¿½<br/>\n<br/>\nZalbar<br/>\n20th Wizard<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
