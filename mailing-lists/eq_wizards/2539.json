Out of <br/>\ncuriousity and boredom, I did some exploring and finally found my way to <br/>\nCazic Thule.  It was a little scary...saw a lot of lizard trains where <br/>\neverything was yellow to reds.  I didn&#39;t really go far in...only up to the <br/>\nfirst courtyard.  Noticed everybody there at the time was between 28-35lvl.  <br/>\nI was the lowest person on the totem pole..being only 21.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny of you been there yet?  Am I way out of my league there?  Good tips for <br/>\nme there for rest spots or areas with Mobs more my league?  I heard it&#39;s a <br/>\ngood promising area for xp.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to kill a lizard! :)<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n21 HE Wiz Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
