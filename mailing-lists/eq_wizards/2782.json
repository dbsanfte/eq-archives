Whenever the PC that you are bound to changes their level in<br/>\n&gt; respect to yours it stops working. When I say level I mean physical<br/>\n&gt; orientation in the vertical aspect. The best example I could give is<br/>\n&gt; Unrest. (A great place for higher teens and low 20&#39;s players.) I cast it<br/>\n&gt; upon our puller so that he can tag and run back without worrying about<br/>\n&gt; communicating back to the group. I see what they pull and tell everyone<br/>\n&gt; to get ready or that the puller is running to zone. It is also really<br/>\n&gt; helpful if the puller gets rooted or stunned. I can go inside with the<br/>\n&gt; rest of the party and help the puller since I know where they are within<br/>\n&gt; the house. (I know the house pretty well since I pull with my wizard<br/>\n&gt; when I am paired up with just my cleric friend.) If the puller I have<br/>\n&gt; Bind Sight upon goes upstairs or downstairs the view on my screen<br/>\n&gt; freezes like the character is stuck. This does not only happen within<br/>\n&gt; Unrest. I was in Guk last night and it happened when a cleric I had Bind<br/>\n&gt; Sight upon went downstairs to resurrect  a friend of mine. I was going<br/>\n&gt; to tell him directions through the use of Bind Sight but as soon as he<br/>\n&gt; went down the first ramp the Bind Sight broke.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am wondering if anyone else has had problems with this spell?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yinin of Mithanial Marr<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Congratulations SAYNO2DRUGS.
