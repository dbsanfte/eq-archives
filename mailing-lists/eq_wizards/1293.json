But are you prepared to put it to the test as an experiment? (serious question) I think<br/>\nsomeone of your level would be appropriate to test the wizards power, or lack of it. Would you be<br/>\nable to cast any spells while he hits you on the head? It&#39;s all well and good doing 1100 damage with<br/>\nan Ice Comet but how long would it take to cast.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS Well done getting to 22nd level, your right it has to be VERY HARD for us until we reach high<br/>\nlevels.<br/>\n<br/>\nValacian wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I would be MORE than happy to enter an Arena with a duel wield barabrian at the same level as me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Valacian - 22nd Level Erudite Wizard, Xegony<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:   Simon Hinshelwood [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:iktome@...\">iktome@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:   Thursday, May 13, 1999 3:54 PM<br/>\n&gt; To:     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:        Re: [eq_wizards] Ice Comet<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: Simon Hinshelwood &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:iktome@...\">iktome@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well said Jay. Parties cant be bothered with wizards, they cant buff, cant heal<br/>\n&gt; and cant really help parties that much...&quot;we were supposed to be heavy<br/>\n&gt; artillery&quot; but that just is not correct. I think a wizard would be most parties<br/>\n&gt; last choice if they could choose from all the classes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Its very easy to demonstrate the wizard immbalance; get into an arena with a<br/>\n&gt; dual wield barbarian warrior of the same level and see how you do!<br/>\n&gt; Hmm doesn&#39;t sound too promising eh?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have always played a wizard character class in AD&D and UO but I regret<br/>\n&gt; playing one in EQ. I think EQ were nervous about the power wizards in UO and<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t want to unbalance the game. I think they swung the pendalum too far the<br/>\n&gt; other way. Root &#39;n&#39; Shoot, if that fails death, thats about it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hopefully e-mails will pour in and tell me how wrong I am.
