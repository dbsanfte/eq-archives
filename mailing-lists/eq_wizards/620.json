I assume that once I hit a certain level I&#39;ll realize what&#39;s lacking and then train alot in that, but any suggestions would be helpful. I was also saving up for spell research. Is spell research a skill that goes up quickly? Also, what does raising the spell research skill improve? All help is appreciated. Thanks, Lott.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
