I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-229095535\">Hi all,<br/>\nso i get some questions for hard gamers :)<br/>\n1. First i am a fan of quest :). But in freeport, the arcan scientist don t<br/>\nwant to give me any quest :(. I know that i must raise my faction if i want<br/>\nto make quests for them but how ???? Killing deathfist centurion and so<br/>\nraise faction with commond resident. Are the scientist residents ? If i can<br/>\nnot do any quest for them then how to raise my faction with them ? What the<br/>\nmonsters who raise faction with scientist ?<br/>\n2. Second, a wizzard is useles vs red monsters... Yesterday i was fighting<br/>\nwith 3 friend same level as me orc warrior from blue ro red. For the blue,<br/>\nnp. But for the white yellow and red don t even try with a caster group..<br/>\nWhy ? Normally shock of lightening can do 82 dommage... In three hours<br/>\nfighting with orc, 3 or 4 times i do 82 hp dommage... But usually i do 12,<br/>\n14 , 4 or whatever but not the max... I have tried fire spel, ice spel, same<br/>\nthey don t resist the whole dommage but they resist very well.. So i go<br/>\nfighting crocodile.. Deep water croco.. Considering red.... and same : i<br/>\nnearly never do max dommage (nearly never the half dommage in fact sigh :(<br/>\n). I can understand that if they are red i need a level 16 spel to hurt them<br/>\nbad (i am currently 15) but that s really stupid.. If i try to kill red with<br/>\nfriends and that i dont  dommage the monsters i am useless vs red creatures<br/>\ncause my spels are resisted !! In others words, you must kill blue creatures<br/>\nto be sure you do the max dommage... But one of my friend is necro level<br/>\n15... And you know what ? HE ALWAYS do the max dommage he can handle... ok<br/>\nit s only 42 for the attack spel but he always do 42, same for war undead<br/>\nalways the max !!!! i regret that with these fact a wizzard can nearly not<br/>\nkill more then blue creatures... By the way, i have killed some days ago a<br/>\ndervish thug alone cons. yellow for me.. And all my spel were working at<br/>\nmax... Any idea ? it s just a question of magic resist ? Why the necro spel<br/>\ndoes always max dommage ? (and are never never resisted at all ! Heat blood,<br/>\nwar undead life tap and so ! )<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all the help !<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nyakos<br/>\n<br/>\nlevel 15 <br/>\n<br/>\np.s. thanks for all the guys who tell me where the spel in freeport was :)<br/>\nin fact i just don t see the stairs to upper level :) thanks again :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
