If<br/>\nsomeone can refute this, then let me know. So I&#39;m not sure if your ROOT<br/>\nexample is really a good one.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, while on the subject of killing things, I thought of something that I&#39;d<br/>\nlike to try.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to form a 6 player all wizard party. I&#39;m on the Solusek Ro server,<br/>\n14th Wizard, would like to have about the same level.<br/>\n<br/>\nVerant, and everyone is always saying that you need to mix classes to level<br/>\nand go up the fastest. Here&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nForm group.<br/>\nEveryone target same large honking creature.<br/>\nOne person shouts &quot; NUKE! &quot;<br/>\nEveryone clicks on shock of lightning<br/>\nBLAM<br/>\n456 pts of dmg.<br/>\n1 Shot.<br/>\n1 Kill<br/>\nThank you for shopping at Wizzie mart.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if it&#39;s still alive and not running away, next volley should be for an<br/>\nadditional 380pts<br/>\n<br/>\n(assuming that 1 person is attacked and spell is interrupted).<br/>\n<br/>\nEnd result after 2 rnds: 836 pts of damage in I figure about less than 10<br/>\nseconds. A Hill giant takes longer than that to kill me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;l stand in front of ANYTHING for 10 seconds. With bind abilities, the<br/>\nentire group is pretty safe for escaping, you don&#39;t have to go far if you DO<br/>\ndie, which is highly unlikely.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow fast do you think this kind of group is gonna level taking out things<br/>\nlike griffawns, griffons, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly problem I can see is some things have a big magic resistance. I was<br/>\nwith a 15th barbarian in North Karanas, and we were feeling brawny. He<br/>\nwailed on a Scythe beetle and brought it back to me and another 13th wizard.<br/>\nMy shock of lightning was only doing 30-35 pts of dmg. The 13th wizard did<br/>\n0, nil, zip, zero pts. of dmg.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone wanna try out my idea, and you&#39;re on Solusek Ro let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\nZalbar<br/>\n14th Wizard<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Crowder, David &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DCrowder@...\">DCrowder@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&#39; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: 19 avril, 1999 13:41<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Lets solve the root debate<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Crowder, David&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DCrowder@...\">DCrowder@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Here  lets solve the root debate:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Goto the cauldron (a zone off of BB mtns),  and poke an aqua goblin shaman,<br/>\n&gt;if you are under lvl 13  he will root you and bash you like crazy.
