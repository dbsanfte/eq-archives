Level 12 was difficult in that manner, but I could at least<br/>\nhurt blue creatures! So I actually wouldn&#39;t mind if it fizzled a lot or<br/>\nnot hit for full damage. But in fact it rarely fizzles and always hits<br/>\nfor full damage, WHEN it isn&#39;t resisted. I guess I&#39;m worried that as I<br/>\nadvance in level, that most blue creatures will STILL be able to resists<br/>\nForce Shock. Nevermind the Orcs, at 21 they will all be green, but<br/>\nwhatever creature cons blue at 21. <br/>\n<br/>\nI find that, when soloing, I need to unload 3/5 of my mana to kill most<br/>\nblue creatures. I just don&#39;t want to be hitting at the same level I did<br/>\nat level 16 against all non-green enemies because I can&#39;t use my new<br/>\nspells. See what I&#39;m gettting at? I can accept the fact that reds will<br/>\nresist most of the time, yellows some of the time, whites half the time,<br/>\nand blues rarely but such is not the case. It ends up<br/>\nreds=90%,yellows=90%,whites=80%,blues=70%. I don&#39;t know exact numbers<br/>\nbut it is up there...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, on the other hand, what you&#39;re saying is that when I am lvl 21, that<br/>\nblues will resist less than they do now. That may be workable, not<br/>\nliked, but workable. For example if the creature 2 levels below me<br/>\nresistance goes down to 60% at 21, 50% at 22, 40% at 23 or some such. So<br/>\nwhen I am level 23, creatures of level 21 or below resist at 40%.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile that may be a bit better than my first scenario (where blues will<br/>\nresist a lot for the rest of my days) I still don&#39;t like it. Especially<br/>\nwhen the blues I am testing it on are probably about 4-5 levels below<br/>\nme. Or should I go group with people of levels 14-15 :P<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s hoping it gets better! *gulp* What&#39;s the bar at now? Level 30<br/>\nwhen we will truly shine? One guy on the list is up there I think, is 20<br/>\nmore difficult than the other levels? Do I want to know?<br/>\n<br/>\nCroesus Illuminatus (Xegony)<br/>\n*Bane of green cons everywhere :P*<br/>\n<br/>\nZiffnab MageStorm wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Ziffnab MageStorm &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_ziffnab@...\">eq_ziffnab@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Think of it this way..remember when you got your spells at level 12.<br/>\n&gt; YOu tried out SOL but it liked to fizzle a lot or not hit for full<br/>\n&gt; damage?

That&#39;s what rooting is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for. If it is stun<br/>\n&gt; &gt; meant to cancel spells, well I don&#39;t need that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; either because that is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what enchanters are for (anti-magical-artillery). It<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cancel the orc priests from casting on me so I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; know...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I guess I&#39;m going to be a 16th level wizard until<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 24. I Sincerely hope<br/>\n&gt; &gt; none of our later spells have stun because it gets<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hardeer and harder as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it is than to have blue stuff kick our asses even<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more :P If we do get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; these more often, then we should get tashan/tashani<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in order to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; effective.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also, how does one explain enstill resisting all the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time? Even more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; than my Force Shock...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Marziani, Michael D.&quot; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;Marziani, Michael D.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Marziani@...\">Michael.Marziani@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The reason why your level 20 spell shock of force<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is resisted so often is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because it has a dual effect.  It not only does<br/>\n&gt; &gt; damage but it also stuns the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; opponent.  Any spell with a dual effect is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; resisted a LOT more (ask<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enchanters because almost all their spells have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dual or triple effects).  At<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; level 24 we get a DD spell that does about the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; same amount of damage as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shock of force, but does not have a dual effect<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and is thus not resisted as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; much.  It also costs less mana to cast.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Solric<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Keith Wiseman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:keithw@...\">keithw@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, May 26, 1999 10:58 AM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [eq_wizards] Spell Resistance<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Keith Wiseman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:keithw@...\">keithw@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same problem here with abnormal amounts of resists<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with Lvl 20 spells...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is quite different from any other new level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spells in the past.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Enough of a difference to conclude that Lvl 20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spells were programmed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; differently or there was a change in a patch that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; affects all spells that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; just coincided with my reaching lvl 20...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: James Dwyer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdwar@...\">jdwar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I just reached lvl 20, got all my spells, and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; guess am a little<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dissapointed. I do enjoy blasting for 170 points<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of damage, but it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; almost as if Verant has made these new spells<br/>\n&gt; &gt; EASIER to resist. For<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; instance, I fight Orcs in oasis. Low blue orcs and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they are resisting my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; new shock spell. They NEVER resist my 16th level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lightning bolt. You<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would think that a higher level spell would be as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or harder to resist.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Another example is enstill. This ONLY works on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; greens. There is no blue,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; white, yellow, red that I have found that is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; successfully enstilled. In<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fact, when I fight the 20th level orcs that con<br/>\n&gt; &gt; black to me, they always<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; resist. Yet root works on them about 25% of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time. I was hoping that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; when I got enstill it would be easier to solo<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because it is more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; powerful, alas it isn&#39;t so.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am heading to Lake Rathe now and hopefully my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spells work better<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there. If not, mayhaps we should petition to get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this change. I mean<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; come on, I am about as useful as a 16th level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wizard against red if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BLUES resist my new 20th level spells. While<br/>\n&gt; &gt; monsters are getting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; progressively better I seem to be getting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; progressively incapable to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; handle them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Croesus Illuminatus (Xegony)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *Tanks stab em, Wizards slab em*<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ONElist:  where the world talks!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Join a new list today.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Congratulations to &quot;M-K-ROSES,&quot; our latest ONElist<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of the Week.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Visit our homepage and share with us how ONElist<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is changing YOUR life!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ONElist:  where the world talks!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Join a new list today.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; What do lizards and rock music have in common?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; They both have communities at ONElist.
