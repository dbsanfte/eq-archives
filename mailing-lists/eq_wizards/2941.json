This place ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-184677263\">Dear wizards,<br/>\n<br/>\nAs i pased into new easier life as i get lv 24 and new DD spell (wich<br/>\nfinaly dont fizzle :-) ) i started to visit a castle mistmore. This place<br/>\nis very interesting for solo and gruping wizard as there are many dark<br/>\nelves at entrance wich are lv 20 - 24 and in god group is easy to get great<br/>\nexperience and a place is much less confusing then a Soulsek A or Unrest.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn group of 3 max 4 similar lv you can make a great experience if a puller<br/>\nis ok and know when to pull and what to pull. Here i started to use my<br/>\nfirst Area damage spells and im very happy with them. <br/>\n<br/>\nTactic:  if a group pull 2 or 3 darkies i wait until they build some hate<br/>\nagainst fighters and then i cast a Ligting storm on them. If casted in<br/>\nright moment it will not make them agresive and i will do much more damage<br/>\nthen using only DD spels. <br/>\n<br/>\nExample: Storm do Rain damage in 2 waves and i think  sometimes 3 ..(when<br/>\nraining ?) it hits for 75 damage and it is 2 waves * 2 targets * 75 a<br/>\nwhooping 300 damage for a 135 mana ! If it is 3 targets it is 450 damage<br/>\nand i once get it on 4 targets for a 600 damage !! .. realy it is all time<br/>\na little bit less,  becouse of partial od rarely full resists, but in any<br/>\ncase it is more damage then with any DD spell. (shock of this lv do 172 +3<br/>\nfor lv damage). <br/>\n<br/>\nTrick is in right timing and god work with group. This tactic is very<br/>\nuseful if you are fighting many blues wich your fighters and healers can<br/>\nhandle without serious problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen i start to use this tactic i finaly start to understand what roule we<br/>\nhave in group and why wwe have so much AE spells. We are support<br/>\nresponsable for a mass damage and this is our PRIMARY role, (i think it<br/>\nbecouse we get 2 - 3 diferent AE spells for lv  and only 1 maybe 2 DD for<br/>\nlv) i know it is not what many of us thinked that role of wizard is but<br/>\nVerant have many strange ideas :). ( i read much from high lv wizards that<br/>\nthey are useles in combat against capital monsters wich are resistent to<br/>\nnearly all.. and if they get 3 full resists and 2 partial on Ice comet<br/>\nthings get bad... ( 2000 mana by by for cc.. 500 - 900 damage )<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen im soloing i have start to use a tactic wich i found on boards...<br/>\n<br/>\nPulling with eye... Eye is nice thing to pull a mobs first they don  get<br/>\nagresive to it until it is realy near. and when they hit you can pull only<br/>\nthis room of monsters as target is already killed and they go after a<br/>\ncaster and passing near other monsters they DONT pull a train. so i can<br/>\npull with right use from Graveyard and still not get trained by all other<br/>\nmobs in my way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that this helps my follow wizards and that i will se here some other<br/>\nconstructive tactics to use. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd lets hope that Verant finaly admit that there is something wrong with<br/>\nwizards :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSilverion Dragonirder<br/>\n<br/>\nHigh elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\nFenin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\nmoderator mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
