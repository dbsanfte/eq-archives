I made the choice, long ago, to use a dagger as my<br/>\nmelee weapon as opposed to a staff of some sort. Now I am finding that<br/>\neveryone is speaking of magical staves, and never see talk of magical<br/>\ndaggers. Would any of you happen to know where I might be able to find<br/>\nmyself a runed dagger of some sort?<br/>\nThanks much for the answers!<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW I think a news group version of this list would be a great idea. I like<br/>\nthe list alot, but trying to read 100+ messages every morning before I<br/>\nleave for classes kind of sucks.<br/>\nGarret E.
