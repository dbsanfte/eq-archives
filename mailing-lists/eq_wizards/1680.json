I also<br/>\nfound that a elephants dont have magic resistance and you can take a white<br/>\ncalf in south caranas easy! <br/>\n<br/>\nin group play as fight start i join with a staff until fighters dont build<br/>\na hate against them and then i move to distance and start rooting or nuking<br/>\nif necesary.

I haven&#39;t used or used very little melee since level <br/>\n&gt;12.  Although admittedly, melee was VERY useful during the 8-12lvl stages <br/>\n&gt;where you needed the extra dmg to finish the creatures off.  Since 12, if <br/>\n&gt;you are lucky enough to find a regular group, you can begin your role as a <br/>\n&gt;pure nuker...cast/med/cast/med.  I have met many a high level Wizard who <br/>\n&gt;have gotten rid of staffs/daggers altogether in favor of mana or <br/>\n&gt;intelligence enhancing items (idols, tomes, wands, etc)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In a group, and believe me, you WILL probably have to group at higher <br/>\n&gt;levels, I find that your value to the group is more in your ability to <br/>\n&gt;strike from a distance rather than risking your neck near a <br/>\n&gt;creature..especially since it&#39;s pissed off at the 117 damage spell you just <br/>\n&gt;casted 2 seconds ago.  :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Can anyone confirm this and/or give suggestions on how at this point<br/>\n&gt;&gt;(9th) I can improve my 1H fighting skills?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
