But as noted by","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-933010820\">Yes the Magician (as stated by Verant) is supposed to be the second most<br/>\npowerful DD caster in the game (second only to the wizard of course).  But<br/>\nas noted by the fellow below, they only get DD spells every other circle<br/>\nwhereas we get them each circle.  So at level 8 both me and my magician<br/>\nfriend did almost the same damage (I think his shock spell did 31 while mine<br/>\ndid 36 and his bolt spell did 40 where mine did 45 for the same mana cost).<br/>\nBUT...  At level 12 he is still using his old DD spells for 35 and 44<br/>\ndamage, where I have a new spell that does 78.  By level 15 he will STILL be<br/>\nusing his level 8 DD spells for 35 and 44 damage, while my lightning will do<br/>\n81.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt level 16 he will get a new DD shock spell (the same one which we wizards<br/>\nget) which will bring him again close to the damage that we do (lower by 13<br/>\npoints though).  Something to keep in mind is that at level 16 we also get a<br/>\nDD bolt spell that the magicians do not get, lightning bolt, which starts at<br/>\n118 damage or so (not sure exact figure), so compared to his 91 damage shock<br/>\nspell we can still do almost 30 more damage.  And again keep in mind that at<br/>\nlevel 23 he will still be using this level 16 spell while we will have<br/>\ngotten a new and more powerful one at level 20.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo all in all magicians at times come near (but not close) to the damage<br/>\nthat we can inflict, but most of the time they are quite far behind.  And it<br/>\nof course makes sense seeing that they have a pet to protect them and do<br/>\ndamage.  We have only ourselves to rely on and I must say that I like it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Solric of the 4th circle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Ken Morris&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kmorris2@...\">kmorris2@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Mage&#39;s 16th lvl spell is not as powerful as ours, but it is close.  They<br/>\nstart off at 91 dmg we start off with 104 dmg.  Also, they don&#39;t get another<br/>\nDD spell until 24th, where as we get one at 20th and 24th.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalarin Kal&#39;Amon, High Elven Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Ziffnab MageStorm &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_ziffnab@...\">eq_ziffnab@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, May 17, 1999 9:15 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Magicians and Wizards (irritation)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Ziffnab MageStorm &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_ziffnab@...\">eq_ziffnab@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; During my adventures over the past weekend I happened to group with a<br/>\n&gt; very nice magician and his pet &quot;Gonaker.&quot;  We did very well together<br/>\n&gt; and had fun.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The problem was that he made claims that he can strike a target for DD<br/>\n&gt; equal to mine.  We were both level 19 and sad thing is, I think he is<br/>\n&gt; right!  Can anyone tell me how much mana is used and damage delivered<br/>\n&gt; for the magician DD spell (16th level) equivelant to Fire Shock?  I<br/>\n&gt; have a feeling it will be the same which is sad really.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Before I rant on my class I will need to know the truth on this matter.<br/>\n&gt;  I love being a wizard and believe the long road to true power is a<br/>\n&gt; long one.  But we should be doing more damage than a damn magician and<br/>\n&gt; plus he gets a pet.  Let me know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Ziffnab of Xegony<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _____________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Free instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nLooking for a new hobby?
