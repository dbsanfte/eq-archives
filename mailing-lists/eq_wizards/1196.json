I am a<br/>\nlevel 9 right now and am at the point where I am thinking about seeking a<br/>\nmagical weapon.  I am sure at higher levels I won&#39;t even want to get NEAR<br/>\nthe monster I am fighting to melee, but at this point I can still get some<br/>\ndecent damage and save mana finishing off creatures with melee.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo as far as magic weapons go, what should I be setting my sights on and<br/>\nwhat choices do i have available in the next couple levels?  Also, should I<br/>\nin general try to use daggers (for speed but low damage), 2h blunt (for good<br/>\ndamage but low speed), or 1h blunt (holding a nice magic item in offhand --<br/>\nlike what?).  As much or as little info as ye have I would be grateful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n-Solric</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
