Did you solo?  What was your tatics?  I started &gt;rooting <br/>\nand<br/>\nnuking at 4 and I haven&#39;t stopped since.  Even if it kept the mob off &gt;of me <br/>\n1/4<br/>\nof the fight, it was still meant the difference of life or death to &gt;me.  By<br/>\nlevel 10ish (I think, its been a while since then) I was rooting &gt;Grizzleys <br/>\nin<br/>\nthe Karanas, and often finishing them off before root would break.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been using Root since day one.  Don&#39;t leave home without it memorized.  <br/>\nAs yet, it&#39;s the only way I can think of to get a MoB off your back solo OR <br/>\ngrouped.  I think you&#39;re at a disadvantage with any spells if you start off <br/>\nwith low INT.  Human Wizards would not be my first pick for a Wiz although <br/>\nit leads to great role-playability.  RP is the reason I picked a High-Elf <br/>\nagainst an Erudite/Gnome.  If you&#39;re a power-leveler, go straight for an <br/>\nErudite and pump that bad boy up with all the INT you can. :)  My buddy who <br/>\nstarted his second char as a Wiz did just that and has had little problems <br/>\ngetting spells off.<br/>\n(little punk has more INT than me already...BAH! =)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
