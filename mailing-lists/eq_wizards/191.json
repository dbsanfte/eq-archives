Then if the tank is losing, or its time to start dishing damage, I cast root FIRST.  This doesn&#39;t damage, and wont attract the monsters attention more than the dmg that the tank has already caused.

While you let him stand there and take all<br/>\n&gt; the punishment you can relax, sit back, and nuke some monsters.  If you are<br/>\n&gt; alone, never forget to memorize root.  It is a wizards best friend, at least<br/>\n&gt; until higher lvls when you get better spells which essentially do the same<br/>\n&gt; thing.  When fighting alone here is my suggestion for a strategy.. root<br/>\n&gt; something, move back and then cast all your offensive spells at it.  If you<br/>\n&gt; kill it before running out mana you win and never get hit.. if you run out<br/>\n&gt; of mana and it&#39;s still alive, you may win, but probably not.  For a wizard<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s all about being able to get your spells off to do the fantastic dmg<br/>\n&gt; that we do, this becomes impossible if the creature is standing right in<br/>\n&gt; front interrupting your spells each time you try and cast them.  Well, I<br/>\n&gt; hope helps you somewhat.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tandayen, Dark Elf Wizard<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Henrik Bergstr&gt; �m &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:henrik@...\">henrik@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Sunday, April 18, 1999 2:15 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eq_wizards] Confusing strategy tips in many &quot;wizard guides&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Henrik_Bergstr=F6m?=&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:henrik@...\">henrik@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Greetings!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I were not fortunate enough to take part of the Everquest beta, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt;now, at last, I am a regular player of EQ. However, I read many<br/>\n&gt; &gt;reports from beta testers, guides and other people before setting out<br/>\n&gt; &gt;on the path of the wizard and have a question relating to that.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;What confuses me, now after playing the game myself, are all the tips<br/>\n&gt; &gt;in various &quot;wizard guides&quot; about the importance of avoiding hits as a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;wizard. That it is important is obvious, but how should one manage<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I decided to &quot;solo&quot; the first five levels in order to learn the game.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;My experience from that time is that it is almost impossible to avoid<br/>\n&gt; &gt;being hit during combat. Now at level seven I mostly team up with a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;necromancer friend of mine and it is much easier avoiding getting<br/>\n&gt; &gt;hit.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;What do the guides mean? Are the advice for higher levels where one<br/>\n&gt; &gt;have access to &quot;killed on impact&quot; spells or am I missing something<br/>\n&gt; &gt;obvious? What can one do except running away when trying to avoid<br/>\n&gt; &gt;hits? Is it the &quot;mini teleportation spells&quot; that are referred to or<br/>\n&gt; &gt;what? Please enlighten me so that I can continue my hitherto very<br/>\n&gt; &gt;rewarding and highly enjoying career as a wizard!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Regards,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Zachris, dark elf wizard of Bertoxxulous<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;----<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Henrik Bergstr�m<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:henrik@...\">henrik@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Have you visited the new ONElist home page lately?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;ONElist: The Leading e-mail list and community service on the Internet!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Shop.theglobe.com * One-Stop Shopping * Free Shipping in U.S.!&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Live Personal Shopper * Satisfaction Guaranteed * No Hassle Returns!<br/>\n&gt; Accessories, Apparel, Jewelry, Kids, Sporting Goods, Apparel, More!!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
