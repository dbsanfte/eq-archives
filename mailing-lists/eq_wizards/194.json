That&#39;s why if root doesn&#39;t work for me i&#39;m pretty much<br/>\neither going to be able to run successfully, or I&#39;m going to die.  But, it<br/>\nis true that wizards cast faster than any other spell casters, so can you<br/>\nimagine what it must be like for them?  As for mana regeneration I don&#39;t<br/>\nhave a clue, hopefully we will get spells or something that will speed up<br/>\nthis process because it is terribly long.  Do other classes regenerate mana<br/>\nquicker than us?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTandayen, Dark Elf Wizard<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Shane &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:xscion@...\">xscion@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, April 19, 1999 11:55 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Everyone says we cast fast....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Shane&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:xscion@...\">xscion@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    I&#39;m confused.  I am a level 17 Wizard on Fennin Ro.  I find that the<br/>\n&gt;only way I can nuke an opponent is to Root him first because it is utterly<br/>\n&gt;impossible to Nuke, say, Ambassador DVinn while he&#39;s piercing you.  I am<br/>\n&gt;excellent at timing casts, and they just attack to fast for us to get the<br/>\n&gt;cast before their next hit, and most likely, they will.  I don&#39;t see at all<br/>\n&gt;how Wizards cast fast, that&#39;s one of our fallbacks, the other is the long<br/>\n&gt;waiting times for mana regeneration.  But no worries.  There are things you<br/>\n&gt;may get that help restoration of mana.  Back to casting... It&#39;s terribly<br/>\n&gt;slow, Flame Shock takes a LONG time to cast, and it is impossible to cast<br/>\n </span></blockquote>it<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;on enemies that can Duel Wield and Bash.  Thankfully Root is there to save<br/>\n&gt;you, because Root casts relativlely fast, but Root hardly holds.  And my<br/>\n&gt;Alteration is maxed.  I have 142 INT, soon to be 148.  I get 5 casts out of<br/>\n&gt;Flame Shock for 102 Dmg each on enemies with lower magic resistance.  Ok,<br/>\n&gt;well, that was a fun chat.  I still love my Wizard and would never give him<br/>\n&gt;up for any other class.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Did you know that we add over 1,000 new e-mail communities every day?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Explore a new hobby, discover a new friend, laugh at a new joke! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
