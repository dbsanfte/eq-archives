Pets are the single ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-158671132\">I pretty much agree with the whole thing,  I&#39;ve got a few levels on you, and its<br/>\nvery accurate.  The Wizards biggest drawback is no pets.  Pets are the single<br/>\nthing that make Nec&#39;s, Mages, and Enchanters rock at early levels.  You can also<br/>\nnote that all 3 of these classes will whine incesantly about the weakness of<br/>\nthese pets at higher levels.   Personally, I think they are over powered at the<br/>\nearly levels.  All 3 of these classes can mow through whites and yellows for the<br/>\n1st 16 levels, while my wizard and warrior would be hunting for easy blues.<br/>\nEnchanter&#39;s DDs suck, no doubt about it.  At level 19, I believe my Evo is<br/>\naround 10-15.  They just aren&#39;t worth memorizing.  If any of you wizzies want to<br/>\ndraw comparisons, the cast/recover time is roughly the same as lesser shielding.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more minor correction.  I previously stated that all Enchanters spells were<br/>\nmagic based.  That is not entirely accurate as I remember hearing that DOT&#39;s are<br/>\npoison based<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Jay Hollums&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johnh@...\">johnh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All I can say is yep yep... I&#39;m also a level 10 enchanter and if that mob is<br/>\n&gt; yellow or red there is about a 1 in 7 chance that it is fully resisted on<br/>\n&gt; both my enfeeble spell and my mez(until I Tashan the creature, after which<br/>\n&gt; it is about 1 in 10).  I do have a incredible ability to control the flow of<br/>\n&gt; battle as long as I have a group that is willing to take a few hits from a<br/>\n&gt; monster until I can target the monster and unleash a mez.  If they don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; wait and attack any way my mez has no effect because after the creature<br/>\n&gt; takes damage it reactivates...(DOT&#39;s break the mez too... figured that out<br/>\n&gt; last night with a shaman that poisoned one before I started trying to mez<br/>\n&gt; it)  so far I can say this... It comes down to whether I want to draw out<br/>\n&gt; the combat or cut it off quickly.  The wizard can end a combat in 7 seconds<br/>\n&gt; of spell casting... the enchanter can draw out the battle but make it much<br/>\n&gt; safer.  Both have advantages and minuses, but here is my sticking point:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wizards are penalized at early levels (1-28) because they are suppose to be<br/>\n&gt; so good above that.  However, I feel, enchanters AND ALL classes balance out<br/>\n&gt; at the upper levels.  (Is this due to incredible amounts of whining about<br/>\n&gt; how much more powerful x is than y?  YES)  Therefore, Wizards are just a<br/>\n&gt; valuable as any other class above 28, but we pay a penalty of being not so<br/>\n&gt; valuable at a lower level.  Is this fair?  NO.  Is this life?  yes...<br/>\n&gt; sadly...  Will GZ ever see the error of his way&#39;s?  I doubt it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Rutreeii Wizard level 20<br/>\n&gt; Mylin Enchanter level 10 </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
