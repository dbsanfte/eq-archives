I had been collecting runes for a while, so I had a sizable<br/>\ncollection in the bank.  Just thought I would share the results.<br/>\n<br/>\nProject Lightning - I had enough runes to attempt this spell twice.  The<br/>\nfirst attempt failed, the second one succeeded!  My first spell!  Ok, 1<br/>\nout of 2 is not bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nPillar of Fire - Well, I only had one rune of nagafen, so I could only<br/>\nattempt this one once.  It failed.  Now at 1 of 3 attempts.<br/>\n<br/>\nIdentify - Now I had heard this spell was useless, but I figured I still<br/>\nwanted to play with research.  I had enough runes to attempt this spell<br/>\n4 times.  I had 3 failures and a success on the fourth try.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTotal success rate:  2 out of 7 tries.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if the research skill ever goes up, mine did not.  Does the<br/>\nskill raise?<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                See you all onlinge,<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                        Soren<br/>\n                                                        16th Level<br/>\nWizard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
