How long have you been saving money?  And you are a wizard?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Course I&#39;m a Wizard...just made level 14 today I hope I keep it for<br/>\nawhile.... I haven&#39;t really been saving money. I got all my cloth armor off<br/>\nof Orcs so I didn&#39;t have to spend any there. I helped outfit a Druid friend<br/>\n3 weeks ago(patch and some snakeskin) And just today I bought some Netted<br/>\nand Woven(cost me 6pp total) and I have just over 80pp as of today. My<br/>\nsuggestions: loot everything up to about level 8. Then know what crits carry<br/>\nwhat... In a period of an hour I got 5 greater lightstones from wisps. I<br/>\nknow to look for them at night and you can tell which ones they have...this<br/>\nis important since at levels 9 and 10 you will be almost dead and OOM pretty<br/>\nmuch when you kill a wisp. So you have to make every potential kill worth<br/>\nyour downtime. I also suggest that you do not stay in one place...Camping<br/>\ndoes not make cash for anyone except in dungeons and I rarely go into the<br/>\ndungeons yet.....All the Crits that move around are good to hunt. Wisps have<br/>\nup to 4 gold..Evil Eyes have up to 4pp. With a party taking turns on looting<br/>\nEvil Eyes each person should get about 3 loots an hour, that&#39;s a huge<br/>\nprofit. Explore...I&#39;ve been almost everywhere and I don&#39;t get to play all<br/>\nthat much... It&#39;s out there....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCinius Shade(Mith Mar)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your free, private email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.excite.com/\">http://mail.excite.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
