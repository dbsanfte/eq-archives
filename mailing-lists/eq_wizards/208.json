Trust me, I will \r<br/>\n/tell every ranger in a zone until I find one to join me, sometimes I won&#92;&#39;t \r<br/>\ngroup with a party of 5, unless one is a ranger (or druid, that can track).  \r<br/>\nOnce you realize what an important skill tracking is, you sall never want to be \r<br/>\nwithout a trusty guide to help you avoid ambush, and take you right to the \r<br/>\ndesired enemy.  They are especially usefull for the low level wizard in the \r<br/>\nToxullia forest, for it is hard to see there and the spawn rate is about 1 \r<br/>\nmonster per day.  The Ranger will keep you fighting until your arms can barely \r<br/>\ncarry that staff.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nZakrul The Traveler\r<br/>\nCompanion\r<br/>\nErudite Wizard\r<br/>\nBristlebane Server<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------<br/>\nThis mail sent through IMP: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://web.horde.org/imp/\">http://web.horde.org/imp/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
