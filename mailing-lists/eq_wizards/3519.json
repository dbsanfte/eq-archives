I did the mail quests a lot, Bound at Freeport by the bard in<br/>\nquestion, Hotkey the phrase, and have a FayGate/Gate combo memmed. At the<br/>\nWiz spires in GFay, go straight north, not the long way following the path,<br/>\nand you get to Kelethin in about 2 minutes. Round trip, 7 minutes, 1 and a<br/>\nhalf plat. If you only have a half hour or so, its a nice little trip.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Go to Highpass tho. On Tunare you can ALWAYS get in a group for orcs, and<br/>\nthe zone is right there. The guards are useless as protectors, but theres a<br/>\nbank, merchants, and orc spawns plentiful. You should be able to level<br/>\nthere, then go to SKarana for SplitPaw outer. I power levelled from 22 to 30<br/>\nthere in no time, and loot isnt bad either.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you dont care about your faction, you can start joining treant groups<br/>\nin a bit, or instead of Highpass you can go do Unrest or Everfrost.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Treants are excellent money, and a lot of treant campers have SO much<br/>\nsilver and copper and gold they literally cannot move. Gate over to SK and<br/>\ndo money exchanges (rounding in your favor).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I always made money off Binding, and tailoring Shadow Silk for necros, and<br/>\nnow off of group teleporting. The server overcrowding and necro population<br/>\nmake the bone chip market lucrative as well, 3pp/20 is regular, but you can<br/>\nget away with 5-10pp/20 as well if you look for the high lvl necros in your<br/>\nzone. I am also a Master Smith. This takes 250 plat to master, but you can<br/>\nmake 50 pp profit off a full suit, or at the standard price, 1 pp+1 per AC,<br/>\nyou make a plat-4 plat each piece, depending. With your High base INT,<br/>\nSmithing would be a breeze to learn, ditto Tailoring.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good luck and may the /randoms be with you...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shannyn<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Iggie/Alyssandra/Jane Houdeshel&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ldyiggie@...\">ldyiggie@...</a>&gt; 03/09/00<br/>\n11:23AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Iggie/Alyssandra/Jane Houdeshel&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ldyiggie@...\">ldyiggie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;PHAEDRA WHITLOCK&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PWHITLOCK@...\">PWHITLOCK@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I once watched a lvl 50 Wizard Gate in, pull the Oracle around the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hill and burn him dead with one Ice comet. Guardian never budged.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Heh.. so all I have to do is find a level 50 wizard or a high level druid<br/>\n&gt; who&#39;s willing to take the faction hit.. or pay 1000 plat.. LOL I have<br/>\n&gt; about 100 plat in the bank which is probably as high as my bank<br/>\n&gt; account ever is.  Bottom line for me is that unless they fix the<br/>\n&gt; quest for the robe it&#39;s unlikely that I&#39;ll ever get one.  Tho truthfully<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m having so little luck getting groups at 22 that I&#39;m not playin my<br/>\n&gt; wiz very much these days.  I actually got tossed out of a group I<br/>\n&gt; was invited to when the warrior discovered (uhhh how could anyone<br/>\n&gt; NOT know this) that I couldn&#39;t buff or heal him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Iggie<br/>\n&gt; The Protectorate<br/>\n&gt; Cazic Thule<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; DON&#39;T HATE YOUR RATE!<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
