Things are good right now. I do 74-78 generally with my new spell, for 3 shots (with innumerable fizzles) before I have to med again.... Meanwhile the fighters swing away far outdoing me over course of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nFighting red legionnaires, Im useful because I can shoot &#39;em down fast, but against the more normal stream of blues and (gak) greens my groups like to pull in... I am always medding, they are almost never hit enough to show on their health bar, and swinging constantly.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this get any better?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy groups are people Ive been with for the past few levels, 10-11 generally, as I put in a lot of time this past week to get over this fizzle business and so levelled faster than they did.<br/>\n<br/>\nShannyn, lvl 12 on Tunare server, Freeport born<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Gregory Egan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gemd@...\">gemd@...</a>&gt; 09/25/99 08:56AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: &quot;Gregory Egan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gemd@...\">gemd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi all,<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought wizards were supposed to be masters of DD spells. I was with a<br/>\nlevel 29 cleric recently, and he has a spell (wrath) which was doing 198<br/>\ndamage to my 178. Granted, I am level 27, but was still kind of shocked. It<br/>\nwas only a two level difference, and he had a better DD spell, and could<br/>\nmelee too. And buff. And heal. I know at 29 I will get Inferno Shock, but<br/>\nthis just makes my think that we should be doing more damage, or have faster<br/>\nmana regen, or SOMETHING. Just another example of how Verant has made the<br/>\nwizard class suck.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreg (Kronan on Innoruuk)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
