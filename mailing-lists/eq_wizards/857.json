I don&#39;t know about you but part of any battle involves<br/>\nhaving the best position and if we can trp a bunch of dumb monsters in a<br/>\nbuilding and light it up... Well seems like that is using our heads. The<br/>\nmonster can do this to us and we have to scramble to find an exit.

It is<br/>\n&gt;very easy to turn on clipping for monsters, but it would allow an obsene<br/>\n&gt;amount of exploitable bugs.  For instance,  if you stand in a certin spot<br/>\n&gt;and open a door, your character will get stuck in the door.(I have done<br/>\n&gt;this) If you gain the ability to do this to a monster, it would allow us<br/>\n&gt;weak mage types to solo mobs that con red.  It would also allow players to<br/>\n&gt;attack linked monsters one at a time by getting one to charge while the<br/>\n&gt;rest a stuck in a tent or behind a dungeon wall.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Have a good weekend, and Happy Hunting<br/>\n&gt;Malkin (Fennin Ro)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mprez20@...\">mprez20@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mprez20@...\">mprez20@...</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; On the contrary I was told that it was VERY hard to make buildings off<br/>\n&gt;&gt; limits.  To implement that code for every creatures AI would have been a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; large task and due to time constraints was not implemented<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just to inform everyone.  This behavior where monsters can attack through<br/>\n&gt;solid object is not a glitch.  It is a choice they have made, the code to<br/>\n&gt;turn clipping on for<br/>\n&gt;monsters is there.  It would be very easy for them to make it so that<br/>\n&gt;monsters cannot attack through things, but they have chosen to allow this.<br/>\n&gt;I personally can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;think of any reasons why they would allow this to happen, but I&#39;m sure they<br/>\n&gt;have their reasons.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tandayen, Dark Elf Wizard<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Have you visited the new ONElist home page lately?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;ONElist: The Leading e-mail list and community service on the Internet! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
