This is<br/>\n &gt; a hand held item (yes it works now) which adds 20 mana and 2 Magic<br/>\n &gt; resistance. Thats it. You must revert to using piercing or 1h blunt<br/>\n &gt; or no weapon at all. There is another skull out there which can be<br/>\n &gt; affixed to a staff but the quest is broken.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; (or not implemented)<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt; - Ziffnab of Xegony </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
