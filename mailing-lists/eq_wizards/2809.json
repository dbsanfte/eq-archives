Everything I kill don&#39;t give me enough money.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m hunting around Queynos Hill,  BB,  West Karana and I barely reach 60<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gold in bank,  I really don&#39;t see how to make more money and lvl 3 spells<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are something like 4 or 5 platinum.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kill Gnolls (cash and items), kill any Skeleton with a weapon in hands.<br/>\n&gt; I can make about a PP in an hour.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can you give me any advice on how to make more money disgarding XP for now.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was told the Kerra Islan is a good place so I made the trip back to erudin<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but I couldn&#39;t find anybody in the Island and nobody at Erudin to organize a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; group to the Island. It seems like nobody knows Kerra ...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kerra might be hard for you at your level. The Wisps are a gold mine (they<br/>\n&gt; have a random amount of cash on them, up to 3g once, and carry<br/>\n&gt; lightstones ~1pp and greater lightstones ~4pp at times). But the Kerran<br/>\n&gt; wisps range from level 10 to 12, and can only be hit by magic weapons.<br/>\n&gt; Get a mage to summon you a dagger before hunting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Otherwise, it IS a perfect spot. I spent 6 hours of playtime at level 13<br/>\n&gt; there, and made it to level 14, with 45pp in bank. I know a friend who stayed<br/>\n&gt; there for level 14, when about 1/3 of the wisps became green, and he left<br/>\n&gt; at level 15 with over 100pp in bank.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Up to three players, you can set a good rotation on the main wisp spawn<br/>\n&gt; point (cycle of 4 wisps). Don&#39;t camp the 2nd point, if you can find it<br/>\n&gt; (spawns 1 wisp during the same cycle). But it&#39;s a boring activity.<br/>\n&gt; Once, I had the entire zone for me. I couldn&#39;t even kill wisps fast enough<br/>\n&gt; and I died once when I got three of them (deep blue &quot;risky&quot;) on me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bring a cleric and a good party with you and you can hunt the zombie sailors<br/>\n&gt; (weapons).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Note that I doubt the Kerran will regard you amiably, however :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Vincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Tel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n&gt;         01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; GET WHAT YOU DESERVE!
