Do not be so pesamistic (spelling wrong im<br/>\nsure).  Enstill works well enough because when it holds....it hold for<br/>\na DAMN long time.  Do you remember way back when you first got root. <br/>\nIt did not work for a damn.  Now it works nicely on most white and blue<br/>\ncritters....some yellow and red as well.  Give Estill another level to<br/>\nwork better.  It does get better.  I agree the DD spell at level 24 was<br/>\nrotten...although a bit better in way of mana consumption.  I am going<br/>\nto make the Cast Force spell and Column of Lightning to try them out.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Ziffnab<br/>\n<br/>\n--- RIVIERE STEPHANE &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Stephane.Riviere@...\">Stephane.Riviere@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: RIVIERE STEPHANE &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Stephane.Riviere@...\">Stephane.Riviere@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi all guys,<br/>\n&gt; it seems that OR we are all on hollidays OR we know<br/>\n&gt; all about wizzard :). I<br/>\n&gt; don t receive more then 1 list all 2 days now :(<br/>\n&gt; Come an guys, we need to wake up ! :)<br/>\n&gt; On another point, i just read the new patch<br/>\n&gt; message.. Damn.... From the<br/>\n&gt; begining, nothing as been change for the wizzards...<br/>\n&gt; They just change during<br/>\n&gt; the patch , the casting time . I have tested BEFORE<br/>\n&gt; and after : no change<br/>\n&gt; (that a clock can see, so it s surely a change of<br/>\n&gt; let s say 0,001 second or<br/>\n&gt; something like that.In other words : nothing.<br/>\n&gt; All patch just power up the race... Now the druid<br/>\n&gt; dot spel are fast like<br/>\n&gt; hell, necro same. And us ?? From the beginning, we<br/>\n&gt; have major bug who are<br/>\n&gt; not resolved and they do nothing for us...<br/>\n&gt; Force shock is bugged cause he is resisted too much<br/>\n&gt; (and i am ok that he get<br/>\n&gt; resisted so much IF he stun like he must do). The<br/>\n&gt; enstill spel doesn&#39;t work<br/>\n&gt; (i have tested with root : root is 10 times more<br/>\n&gt; effective). I am a playing<br/>\n&gt; a shaman and i think i will stop my wizzard... We<br/>\n&gt; have nothing funny : we<br/>\n&gt; just level and wait for what ? Our dd spel nothing<br/>\n&gt; more, no buf, no pet, no<br/>\n&gt; life tap, no shield,no dot, no sow, nothing cool<br/>\n&gt; except some gate spel...<br/>\n&gt; That s so boring.. For solo from level 8 to 50 you<br/>\n&gt; root nuke nuke root nuke<br/>\n&gt; nuke dead... Wow that s pretty funny :( :( :(.<br/>\n&gt; What about our ae spel ? and pe spel ?? Did someone<br/>\n&gt; here use them ????<br/>\n&gt; NOBODY...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So guys, we were talking some weeks ago to<br/>\n&gt; petition.. Nothing has be done or<br/>\n&gt; you just don t send the letter ???<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; See you on karana<br/>\n&gt; yakos level 25 wizzard AND dabou level 13 shaman<br/>\n&gt; (playtime for wizzard : 20 days, for shaman , 2<br/>\n&gt; days....)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist members are using Shared Files in great<br/>\n&gt; ways!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Are you?
