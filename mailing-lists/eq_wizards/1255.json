Maybe the <br/>\nvideo card companies should just send everyone a great  400 meg 3d <br/>\ncard...heh.. don&#39;t we wish...wonder if they will ever make something like <br/>\nthat in our lifetime... I suppose 3d would be a thing of the past at that <br/>\npoint...probably just have little bitty people in our box to do the stuff <br/>\nfor us.

Verant made<br/>\n&gt;the decision long ago that they wanted to make the game accessible to the<br/>\n&gt;greatest number of 3d cards possible which includes, unfortunately(1),<br/>\n&gt;4meg cards. Thus, they had to severely limit the number of textures used<br/>\n&gt;in the game, and I _think_ that spells may fall under that category.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Isand<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(1) Unfortunately for those of us with greater that 4 meg cards, very<br/>\n&gt;fortunately for those of us that might still have voodoo1 cards.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
