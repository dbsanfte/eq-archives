I did the mail quests a lot, Bound at Freeport by the bard in question, Hotkey the phrase, and have a FayGate/Gate combo memmed. At the Wiz spires in GFay, go straight north, not the long way following the path, and you get to Kelethin in about 2 minutes. Round trip, 7 minutes, 1 and a half plat. If you only have a half hour or so, its a nice little trip.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo to Highpass tho. On Tunare you can ALWAYS get in a group for orcs, and the zone is right there. The guards are useless as protectors, but theres a bank, merchants, and orc spawns plentiful. You should be able to level there, then go to SKarana for SplitPaw outer. I power levelled from 22 to 30 there in no time, and loot isnt bad either.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you dont care about your faction, you can start joining treant groups in a bit, or instead of Highpass you can go do Unrest or Everfrost.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreants are excellent money, and a lot of treant campers have SO much silver and copper and gold they literally cannot move. Gate over to SK and do money exchanges (rounding in your favor).<br/>\n<br/>\nI always made money off Binding, and tailoring Shadow Silk for necros, and now off of group teleporting. The server overcrowding and necro population make the bone chip market lucrative as well, 3pp/20 is regular, but you can get away with 5-10pp/20 as well if you look for the high lvl necros in your zone. I am also a Master Smith. This takes 250 plat to master, but you can make 50 pp profit off a full suit, or at the standard price, 1 pp+1 per AC, you make a plat-4 plat each piece, depending. With your High base INT, Smithing would be a breeze to learn, ditto Tailoring.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck and may the /randoms be with you...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShannyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Iggie/Alyssandra/Jane Houdeshel&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ldyiggie@...\">ldyiggie@...</a>&gt; 03/09/00 11:23AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: &quot;Iggie/Alyssandra/Jane Houdeshel&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ldyiggie@...\">ldyiggie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;PHAEDRA WHITLOCK&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PWHITLOCK@...\">PWHITLOCK@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I once watched a lvl 50 Wizard Gate in, pull the Oracle around the<br/>\n&gt; hill and burn him dead with one Ice comet.

LOL I have <br/>\nabout 100 plat in the bank which is probably as high as my bank <br/>\naccount ever is.  Bottom line for me is that unless they fix the <br/>\nquest for the robe it&#39;s unlikely that I&#39;ll ever get one.  Tho truthfully <br/>\nI&#39;m having so little luck getting groups at 22 that I&#39;m not playin my <br/>\nwiz very much these days.  I actually got tossed out of a group I <br/>\nwas invited to when the warrior discovered (uhhh how could anyone <br/>\nNOT know this) that I couldn&#39;t buff or heal him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIggie<br/>\nThe Protectorate<br/>\nCazic Thule <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nDON&#39;T HATE YOUR RATE!<br/>\nGet a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
