I am greatful that my wizard does the damage he <br/>\ndoes with his spells. I have had several other players try to steal my <br/>\nkill. I had rooted a monster before I attacked. I got off one spell <br/>\nbefore some fighters(unsure at to exact class) ran up and started <br/>\nhacking the monster. I was able to keep my kill and ward off this <br/>\ngroups attacks on several other of my rooted monsters. This is by no <br/>\nway isolated. It happens every time at worste, every other time at <br/>\nbest. Changing the wizards spell damage would hamper their ability to <br/>\ngain levels why doing nothing about KS&#39;ing. I think that the game is <br/>\nfair as it is now and would hope that this group does not go out and <br/>\npetition for a change.<br/>\n      <br/>\n     Schalle<br/>\n       ec&#39;i<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
