Is there a trick to getting the guards to take the<br/>\n&gt;heat, or are they supposed to do it automatically?  I was under the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>impression that they were supposed to help automatically.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan&#39;t really say since I&#39;ve never fought in Toxx.  However, some guards in <br/>\ncertain newbie zones are better than others.  Other&#39;s might have different <br/>\nsuggestions but here&#39;s what I think of the zones I&#39;ve been in:<br/>\n<br/>\nFelwithe guards -- fairly reliable.  Good reaction time.  They&#39;ll pretty <br/>\nmuch take care of anything that gets in the vicinity<br/>\n<br/>\nKelethin guards -- slow pokes.  They can usually be caught sleeping near the <br/>\nlifts and you can sometimes die unwittingly if you don&#39;t leave yourself <br/>\nenough HP to wait for the guards to wake up. :)  Sometimes, they sleepwalk <br/>\naway from their spots and end up clear across other parts of the zone on <br/>\ntheir own agendas.<br/>\n<br/>\nSteamfont guards -- good reaction time, but they&#39;re relatively weaker than <br/>\nsome of the MoBs you might encounter in the area.  If you hear &quot;Hero&quot; you <br/>\nshould basically zone out. :)  Weak little stinky gnomes...OOPS!  Did I just <br/>\nsay that out loud?  heh<br/>\n<br/>\nButcherBlock guards -- strong and fast.  Fairly reliable.  Don&#39;t mistake <br/>\nthat lady smith near the first house for a guard like I did when I was a <br/>\nnewbie.  Corflunk the Ogre nailed me right at her feet. :P<br/>\n<br/>\nFreeport guards -- slow reaction times, but not as bad as Kelethin.  Faction <br/>\nmight affect the way they help you here since some of them are corrupt.  <br/>\nThey do not help you against those irritating...err...I forget what they&#39;re <br/>\ncalled...beggers or something.  I don&#39;t think they help you against Dorn the <br/>\nDark Elf NPC either.  Somebody else here might know...<br/>\n<br/>\nQueynos guards -- pretty reliable.  I haven&#39;t had any problems with their <br/>\nhelp there.  You might want to head here since there is more stuff to kill <br/>\nthan Toxx.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s as much as I know.  Good luck in your travels!<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n31 Wizzie Veeshan<br/>\n&quot;The Fellowship of Peace&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
