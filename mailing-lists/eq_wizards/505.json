When I&#39;m in a group, I usually hang back and move into a position where none of my friends are in my line of sight between the enemy and I.  I wait, and maybe will cast a shock or two.  Then when he gets down to about where I&#39;d kill him in one shot, I&#39;ll bolt him.  That one shot kill keeps him from running away.  But other than that, I totally agree with you that the shock line of spells is much more effecient overall.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrev<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tCrowder, David[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DCrowder@...\">DCrowder@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tFriday, April 23, 1999 8:13 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[eq_wizards] Re: Looting Robes, and other rants :P<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Crowder, David&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DCrowder@...\">DCrowder@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That is a GREAT  point as well as the fact that using a Line of sight spell<br/>\n&gt; while solo&#39;ing can be bad and the shock casts a ton faster.  Also,  it is my<br/>\n&gt; experience that you get more reliable results from the shock spells  where I<br/>\n&gt; have spent 85 mana to do 6dmg with the Bolt of lightning  ;p<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ______________<br/>\n&gt; Message: 14<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 22 Apr 1999 17:34:46 -0400<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Chris Trubiani&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:u1607755@...\">u1607755@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Looting Robes, and other rants :P<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shock of Ice.  Firebolt does more dmg per cast, but shock of Ice has a<br/>\n&gt; better mana to dmg ratio.  So if you ever have to use all your mana trying<br/>\n&gt; to kill something, you will do more dmg with Shock of Cast than with<br/>\n&gt; Firebolt.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tandayen, Dark Elf Wizard<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking for a new hobby?
