Sure, it&#39;s fine for level 1-4 where that&#39;s all anyone has, but as I get up past level 10 I&#39;m finding it really lacking.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI don&#39;t expect to be a tank like the other classes, but it would be nice if monsters missed enough that when they turn on me in our party, I have a chance of getting a root spell off because they miss, y&#39;know?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo my question is simple: has anyone found any armor anywhere for wizards that is better than normal Cloth? I&#39;m looking for stuff that can be worn by a High Elf, but I&#39;m sure there are other classes around that are interested as well... \r<br/>\nIf you know of anything, what kind of armor is it, where do you get it, what do you have to do, and what kind of protection does it provide?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAnyone know any other good tricks to improving armor class for wizards? (magic items, special earrings or rings, whatever?)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
