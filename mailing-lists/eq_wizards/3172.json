I was with a<br/>\n&gt; level 29 cleric recently, and he has a spell (wrath) which was doing 198<br/>\n&gt; damage to my 178. Granted, I am level 27, but was still kind of shocked.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As always, people forget to ask how much mana it takes and how long it<br/>\ntakes.

If you&#39;d compare a 19 wiz to a 20 wiz you&#39;d see a big<br/>\ndifference too. Wow, it&#39;s only one level, right? Well, when it is a<br/>\nspell level it&#39;s not the same.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nSergey</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
