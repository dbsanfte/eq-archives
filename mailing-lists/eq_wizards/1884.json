I do enjoy blasting for 170 points of damage, but it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;almost as if Verant has made these new spells EASIER to resist. For<br/>\n&gt;instance, I fight Orcs in oasis. Low blue orcs and they are resisting my<br/>\n&gt;new shock spell. They NEVER resist my 16th level lightning bolt. You<br/>\n&gt;would think that a higher level spell would be as or harder to resist.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Another example is enstill. This ONLY works on greens. There is no blue,<br/>\n&gt;white, yellow, red that I have found that is successfully enstilled. In<br/>\n&gt;fact, when I fight the 20th level orcs that con black to me, they always<br/>\n&gt;resist. Yet root works on them about 25% of the time. I was hoping that<br/>\n&gt;when I got enstill it would be easier to solo because it is more<br/>\n&gt;powerful, alas it isn&#39;t so.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am heading to Lake Rathe now and hopefully my spells work better<br/>\n&gt;there. If not, mayhaps we should petition to get this change. I mean<br/>\n&gt;come on, I am about as useful as a 16th level wizard against red if<br/>\n&gt;BLUES resist my new 20th level spells. While monsters are getting<br/>\n&gt;progressively better I seem to be getting progressively incapable to<br/>\n&gt;handle them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Croesus Illuminatus (Xegony)<br/>\n&gt;*Tanks stab em, Wizards slab em*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  where the world talks!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Join a new list today.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
