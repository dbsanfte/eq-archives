My point was DoT&#39;s take a long time compared to burn, burn,<br/>\nburn.  This is definitely more important in a  multi-mob  situation where time is a critical factor, or the tanks will take a lot more of hits.  I can med 1/2 my mana<br/>\nfaster than they can med 1/2 of their HP&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFraser G Heath wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Fraser G Heath&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fheath@...\">fheath@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; mstokes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mstokes@...\">mstokes@...</a>&gt; 14/May/1999 03:29pm &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: mstokes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mstokes@...\">mstokes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;  Don&#39;t look at mana to damage<br/>\n&gt; ratios, look at damage to time ratios.
