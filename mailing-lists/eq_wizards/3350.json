All guards have a lookabout cycle, of varying durations (I think it s linked to the computer they run on).

However, some guards in <br/>\n&gt; certain newbie zones are better than others.  Other&#39;s might have different <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>All guards have a &quot;lookabout&quot; cycle, of varying durations (I think it&#39;s<br/>\nlinked to the computer they run on). In my experience, the Kelethin and<br/>\nToxxulian ones are the slowest ; I think they have a lookabout of 2s or<br/>\nso. Plenty of time for the mob to hit you once or twice.  The Kelethin<br/>\nguards have also a voluntarily very small agggro range, otherwise, they&#39;d<br/>\ndevastate the countryside, or clear the orc camps before the players.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that all guards, regardless of their origin, will not help you against<br/>\n&quot;humanoid&quot; opponents ever. Freeport guards never help you against Dorn,<br/>\nor madmen. Qeynos guards never help you against bandits.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only exception, I think, are the Highhold Pass guards, which will<br/>\neradicate any smuggler they find.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Steamfont guards -- good reaction time, but they&#39;re relatively weaker than <br/>\n&gt; some of the MoBs you might encounter in the area.  If you hear &quot;Hero&quot; you <br/>\n&gt; should basically zone out. :)  Weak little stinky gnomes...OOPS!  Did I just <br/>\n&gt; say that out loud?  heh<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The Hero is the Hill Giant of the area. Qeynos guards also fall quickly<br/>\nagainst hill giants, or the griffons (for those on duty in the Karanas).<br/>\nDon&#39;t expect the Commonland guards to survive attack by griffons either.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Freeport guards -- slow reaction times, but not as bad as Kelethin.  Faction <br/>\n&gt; might affect the way they help you here since some of them are corrupt.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nope. They spot an &quot;ennemy&quot;, they attack. They have a slow lookabout,<br/>\nand only medium aggro range.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; called...beggers or something.  I don&#39;t think they help you against Dorn the <br/>\n&gt; Dark Elf NPC either.  Somebody else here might know...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Queynos guards -- pretty reliable.  I haven&#39;t had any problems with their <br/>\n&gt; help there.  You might want to head here since there is more stuff to kill <br/>\n&gt; than Toxx.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I strongly suggest that. Except for necros, who pretty much have to wait<br/>\ntill they can get their invis spell, head immediately to Qeynos, and hunt<br/>\nthere. You&#39;ll find it a paradise for newbies.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
