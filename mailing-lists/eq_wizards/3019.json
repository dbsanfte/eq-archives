Hehe :) ... That s human nature. Once, I started a paper on Everquest: a look at the first telepathic culture (if you really look at it, Norrathians are ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-241600392\">According to Richard Slater:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; First of all I would like to tell the people that complain about druids and<br/>\n&gt; necros being so much better at soloing (or anything) to just forget your<br/>\n&gt; wizard and go play a druid or necro.  And also, I would like to state what I<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hehe :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 1) The fact that the /ooc chat lets everyone discuss the solutions of quests<br/>\n&gt; or the fact you can buy quest items.  I think anyone should be banned if<br/>\n&gt; they give the solution of a quest out in game, I know we cannot stop the ICQ<br/>\n&gt; contacts or web sites that do but most of the solutions are givin out in<br/>\n&gt; game anyways.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s human nature. Once, I started a paper on &quot;Everquest: a look at the<br/>\nfirst telepathic culture&quot; (if you really look at it, Norrathians are<br/>\ntelepaths. We can talk to friends we know across the world, tell and tune<br/>\nout across wide areas, maintain groups of like minded people we are<br/>\ninstantly in contact with... all this while running, fighting, or reading<br/>\nbooks)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3) The role playing aspects of the game are very weak, I know that&#39;s what I<br/>\n&gt; long for.  When AC comes out I am buying it instantly, it&#39;s the type of game<br/>\n&gt; I am looking forward to.  Although I wish they would put a class system or<br/>\n&gt; race system in.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you believe that AC will improve on role play, I can already foresee<br/>\nyou&#39;ll be hugely disappointed. AC is a direct opposition to EQ, and<br/>\nis in the same ecological niche in the gaming world - multiplayers hack<br/>\nand slashs. The same niche will attract the same people. You&#39;re going to<br/>\nget the same powerlevelers, the same campers, the same K00l d00dZ we<br/>\nhave. From what I can see (no beta access), there will be differing<br/>\ndetails, but not the huge qualitative difference that exists between<br/>\nUO and EQ, for example.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4) Classes in everquest should have more uniqueness, I don&#39;t like the fact<br/>\n&gt; that wizards are just the masters of DD spells.  I think we should get<br/>\n&gt; something special, anything really.  Like special wizard hats or something<br/>\n&gt; of the sort.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Now that&#39;s a complain I can support. We do not have enough &quot;tools&quot; to<br/>\nroleplay. There&#39;s not much difference between characters of different<br/>\nbut similar class. I do hope that increasing power of 3D cards will<br/>\nlead to an EQ2 that can do this (EQ will never have wide customisation)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
