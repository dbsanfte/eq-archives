There are several websites dedicated to<br/>\nmany of the other classes from warriors to rogues and druids to<br/>\nnecromancers. We need a place for wizards. Hehe, not that I have the<br/>\ntime or energy to do this, but I have enough to recognize the need!<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas on what to do? Rather than having all the same questions asked<br/>\nhere over and over again we can have a central repository of information<br/>\n(faq?). Like for instance, strategies at certain levels, where to hunt,<br/>\nspell combinations, class combinations, etc. Let me know if anyone is<br/>\ninterested maybe we can make something work :)<br/>\n<br/>\nCroesus Illuminatus (Xegony)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
