Now the lowered our damage when we fight other PC&#39;s.  Hey they<br/>\nchose to be that race/class, i chose to be a wizard.  I have to put up with<br/>\njust as much pain if not more than they do.  So why are we being punished<br/>\nfor them choosing to be a warrior type on the pvp servers.  I tend to think<br/>\nthat this will lead to the other servers even more heavily in the fact that<br/>\nall the warrior types say we do to much damage or are ksing everything cause<br/>\nof our power.  Yea you with 400 hp at lvl 13 me with barely over 200.  Guess<br/>\nhe who whines the most in EQ gets the most.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDawgg TZ</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
