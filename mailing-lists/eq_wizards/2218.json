I like the collapse thing...its a nice addition (imaginitive <br/>\nwise.. but not when I want to get the hey out fast and lose my last bit of <br/>\nmana trying to gate and failing), but I would also like the reason to be <br/>\nstated if someone is blocking where you will gate to...on that note though, <br/>\nI do remember ending up right on top of people when I gated/ended up at my <br/>\nhome point so I don&#39;t know if that holds true or not in this game.  It did <br/>\nin UO but I don&#39;t think EQ runs the gating the same way.
