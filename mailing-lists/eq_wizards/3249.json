Hold on there.  Snare is not random duration and never has been.  I<br/>\nhave a lv 35 ranger in addition to my Wiz and snare ALWAYS lasts right about<br/>\n1 min 45 seconds.  I can time snare with a stopwatch and never have to worry<br/>\nabout snare failing.  Root on the other hand seems to be nearly completely<br/>\nuseless in all its froms.  High resist rate and has a random hold duration<br/>\nfrom 0 to 5 seconds.  In beta it wasn&#39;t like that.  You could root and nuke<br/>\na mob at lvl 6 without concern for root failing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; you can BoF a creature and it will last the entire fight or sometimes you<br/>\n&gt; can use it and it lasts for 5 seconds.

For some reason BoF has the root duration<br/>\ncalculation instead of snare.
