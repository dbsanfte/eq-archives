I think it&#39;s very suited for us wizzies..most of the <br/>\ncasters there will fall pretty quickly for a one-on-one.  But I somehow <br/>\ngravitated to Cazic more because it had better loot and a better chance to <br/>\ngroup.  I started there at around 24 and the xp skyrocketed well into the <br/>\nlower 30&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaw is an interesting suggestion to.  Last night was my first experience <br/>\nback there since the upgrade...most of the Mob&#39;s in there were blue to me at <br/>\n34, but I was surprised how well they fought...felt like we were fighting <br/>\nyellows.  I think it&#39;s probably easier in Cazic.<br/>\n<br/>\nAviaks in Karanas are good between 20-22 I&#39;d say, but you&#39;ll find it <br/>\nfrustrating not to be able to participate with groups hitting the big-birdy <br/>\nAvocates. =)  It got achingly slow with xp at level 23-24.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul 34 HE Wiz Veeshan<br/>\n   Jukka 18 Ogre SMN Quellious<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
