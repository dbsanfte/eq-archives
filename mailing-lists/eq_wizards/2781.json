Whenever the PC that you are bound to changes their level in<br/>\nrespect to yours it stops working. When I say level I mean physical<br/>\norientation in the vertical aspect. The best example I could give is<br/>\nUnrest. (A great place for higher teens and low 20&#39;s players.) I cast it<br/>\nupon our puller so that he can tag and run back without worrying about<br/>\ncommunicating back to the group. I see what they pull and tell everyone<br/>\nto get ready or that the puller is running to zone. It is also really<br/>\nhelpful if the puller gets rooted or stunned. I can go inside with the<br/>\nrest of the party and help the puller since I know where they are within<br/>\nthe house. (I know the house pretty well since I pull with my wizard<br/>\nwhen I am paired up with just my cleric friend.) If the puller I have<br/>\nBind Sight upon goes upstairs or downstairs the view on my screen<br/>\nfreezes like the character is stuck. This does not only happen within<br/>\nUnrest. I was in Guk last night and it happened when a cleric I had Bind<br/>\nSight upon went downstairs to resurrect  a friend of mine. I was going<br/>\nto tell him directions through the use of Bind Sight but as soon as he<br/>\nwent down the first ramp the Bind Sight broke.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am wondering if anyone else has had problems with this spell?<br/>\n<br/>\nYinin of Mithanial Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
