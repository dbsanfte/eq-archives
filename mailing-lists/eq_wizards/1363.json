I guess I&#39;m just nostalgic<br/>\nfor the old AD&D days when I got my 9th level spells at 18th level and<br/>\nbullied all around me, even the Dungeon Master got scared of my 9th<br/>\nlevel spells. <br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously, Its important for the game that ridiculously high level<br/>\nWizards wield the most power. This is a fundemental aspect of our<br/>\nunderstanding for the Wizard of popular myth. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a character class We suffer enough for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
