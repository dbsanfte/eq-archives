I then switched to 2-Handed<br/>\nstaff to raise that skill, but it has NEVER gone up (while raising<br/>\nfrom 6th level to 10th).  I tried seeding the skill with a few<br/>\ntraining points, and it still has NEVER gone up.  Does the game<br/>\nhave an idea of a primary weapon or something?  Or have I<br/>\njust been unlucky on raising the skill?<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                            Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSoren</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
