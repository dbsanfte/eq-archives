As welcomes seem to be the order of the day, I will add mine =<br/>\nto the list.  I am Shadowwalker, High Elf Wizard on the Karana server, =<br/>\ncurrently at level 11.  I have been spending time around the Steamfont =<br/>\nMino cave with my guild, though we recently went exploring a bit in =<br/>\nDagnot&#39;s Cauldron, which is intimidating to say the least.  Really neat =<br/>\nlooking though.  We also spend time in Butcherblock and Lesser Faydark =<br/>\noccationally as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have a question in case someone here knows.  Does anyone know of =<br/>\nquests in Faydwer that can be taken on, besides the wolf pelt one?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Shadowwalker of Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
