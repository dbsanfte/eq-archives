I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; don t receive more then 1 list all 2 days now :(<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Come an guys, we need to wake up ! :)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; On another point, i just read the new patch message.. Damn.... From the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; begining, nothing as been change for the wizzards... They just change during<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the patch , the casting time . I have tested BEFORE and after : no change<br/>\n&gt;&gt; (that a clock can see, so it s surely a change of let s say 0,001 second or<br/>\n&gt;&gt; something like that.In other words : nothing.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; All patch just power up the race... Now the druid dot spel are fast like<br/>\n&gt;&gt; hell, necro same. And us ?? From the beginning, we have major bug who are<br/>\n&gt;&gt; not resolved and they do nothing for us...<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Force shock is bugged cause he is resisted too much (and i am ok that he get<br/>\n&gt;&gt; resisted so much IF he stun like he must do). The enstill spel doesn&#39;t work<br/>\n&gt;&gt; (i have tested with root : root is 10 times more effective). I am a playing<br/>\n&gt;&gt; a shaman and i think i will stop my wizzard... We have nothing funny : we<br/>\n&gt;&gt; just level and wait for what ? Our dd spel nothing more, no buf, no pet, no<br/>\n&gt;&gt; life tap, no shield,no dot, no sow, nothing cool except some gate spel...<br/>\n&gt;&gt; That s so boring..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s boring, reading the same damn whining post over and over<br/>\n&gt;and *over* again!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Even if I agreed with you I would have the good taste to STOP THE WHINING,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s obvious by now that posting it here does nothing for you. Just spawns <br/>\n&gt;these<br/>\n&gt;useless debates. You don&#39;t like wizards? Fine, don&#39;t play them, but do you<br/>\n&gt;really think everyone needs to hear the same complaints for the 20th time?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>********<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe if you think, you will see that if so many people wining there is<br/>\nsomething wrong?
