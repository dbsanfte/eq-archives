I cant seem to figure<br/>\nout the third circle spell Column of Frost.  every<br/>\ntime I have targetted a monster or party member, only<br/>\none monster seems to be affected.  Am I supposed to<br/>\nline up the monsters so they make up a column in front<br/>\nof me?  What exactly is the area?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, this spell seems to have a very short range,<br/>\nrelative to the (albeit unuseful) 2nd circle<br/>\nIcestrike.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also heard that for AE spells, targetting party<br/>\nmembers is better than targetting the monster.  Is<br/>\nthis b/c (1) its maximizes the range and number of<br/>\nmonsters affected or (2) b/c it gets the monsters less<br/>\nmad at you?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nVhea<br/>\n9th lvl high elf wizard<br/>\nMithaniel Marr<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
