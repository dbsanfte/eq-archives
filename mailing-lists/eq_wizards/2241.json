I stubbornly keep my Force Shock memorized *just in case* even<br/>\nthough it is resisted most of the time. I have hunted in unrest ( which<br/>\noften has 80 people and feels crowded at 40 people ) with people around<br/>\nor below my level and it is very slow. I have yet to go to Lake Rathe<br/>\nalthough I hear it is getting crowded now too.<br/>\n<br/>\nEither way, if I were to start over, I would have created a Druid or<br/>\nShaman. Of course hindsight is 20/20 but I&#39;ve invested over 6 realtime<br/>\ndays into my wizard and am too stubborn to give up on him. The spells of<br/>\nthe wizard are very limited. Sure we can do the most damage in the<br/>\nshortest amount of time, but it&#39;s not THAT much more. But other than<br/>\nthat, we can teleport like the druid, and that&#39;s all!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess, if you like to BLAST, MED, BLAST, MED, BLAST, MED then<br/>\nwizard is for you. If you like to enchant stuff, summon pets, mess with<br/>\nmonsters minds, mess with NPC&#39;s minds, buff your party members,<br/>\ntransform into cool creatures, speed up mana regen, AND blast with a<br/>\nlittle less damage than wizard then be an ENCHANTER!<br/>\n<br/>\nHeres hoping that the patch adds some unique/interesting stuff to our<br/>\nclass :P Did anyone play a wizard in the beta? Did they always have<br/>\nteleport stuff? just curious...<br/>\n<br/>\nCroesus Illuminatus (Xegony)<br/>\n<br/>\nSergey Bukhman wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Sergey Bukhman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sergeyb@...\">sergeyb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Robert Spelman wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Robert Spelman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:madoc_ab_owain@...\">madoc_ab_owain@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Let me explain - Verant hasn&#39;t implemented specialization skills or the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; alternate planes,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yet.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; we have almost nothing for armor or hitpoints,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Are you saying there is something wrong with this, or that Enchanters<br/>\n&gt; have more?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; our melee<br/>\n&gt; &gt; skills are pathetic<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ditto.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and our powers don&#39;t become greater than other classes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; until 40-somethingth level.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Incorrect. Wizard&#39;s DD spells are the best at any given level.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Plus, the single greatest way of leveling up -<br/>\n&gt; &gt; killing har red mobs - is unavailable to us, because our spells are often<br/>\n&gt; &gt; resisted completely by these creatures. So, instead of grouping with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; powerful warriors to beat up on mobs that will actually give EVERYONE in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; group decent experience, we&#39;re relegated to trying to solo weak blues or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fight white and yellow creatures in a group for pitiful experience because<br/>\n&gt; &gt; WE CAN&#39;T TOUCH HARD MOBS LIKE EVERY OTHER CLASS CAN!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Totally FALSE! All spells are resisted when they are cast on creatures<br/>\n&gt; that are more than 5 levels higher than you. Enchanter&#39;s and Magician&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; too. And cleric&#39;s and shaman&#39;s too.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You can cause damage to mobs that are not more than 5 levels higher than<br/>\n&gt; you, it&#39;s very simple. As far as colors - 4 levels above your should be<br/>\n&gt; red. So you CAN fight Reds. And don&#39;t forget that the melee classes will<br/>\n&gt; miss so much and be hit so hard that it is not very profitable for them<br/>\n&gt; to go against high reds as well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve watched every group I&#39;ve run with pass me up in level. I&#39;ve watched<br/>\n&gt; &gt; characters started while I was at level 12 PASS ME at level 13. It&#39;s not as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; though I never play, it&#39;s just that I CANNOT GAIN MORE THAN HALF A BUBBLE<br/>\n&gt; &gt; EXP PER HOUR, on average. That&#39;s powergaming, soloing in the Karanas vs.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; blue beetles and the occasional white/yellow.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No offense, but maybe you&#39;re just not that good. Yes, there is the<br/>\n&gt; chance that you make wrong choices or get stuck in bad groups. As I<br/>\n&gt; said, a bubble an hour is possible. And the Karanas are a really bad<br/>\n&gt; place for a level 12-16 alone. Especially wizard.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your anecdotal case is not viable as an argument as to the Wizard&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; capabilities.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Needless to say, I&#39;m very frustrated in playing this class right now. The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; only reason I remain a Wizard is stubbornness. Everyone says it gets better<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at higher levels, but the fact of the matter is that we&#39;ll always be a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; second-rate class unless Verant fixes specialization, plane travel and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spell-resistances of higher-level mobs.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You have doubts that specialization and the planes will be fixed?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Qenelin<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Give back to your community through &quot;Grow to Give.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Deadline is June 19.
