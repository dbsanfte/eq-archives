The spells of<br/>\n&gt;the wizard are very limited. Sure we can do the most damage in the<br/>\n&gt;shortest amount of time, but it&#39;s not THAT much more. But other than<br/>\n&gt;that, we can teleport like the druid, and that&#39;s all!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is incredible to me.....
