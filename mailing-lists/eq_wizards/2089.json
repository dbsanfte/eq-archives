If you don&#39;t have a problem, then go play some more<br/>\nand stop clogging the list with useless posts like that. It&#39;s obvious<br/>\nthat most people here DO have problems and we have decided to do<br/>\nsomething about them. Your little stories about UO are fascinating, I&#39;m<br/>\nsure, but off topic for the list, and the topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore specifically, no one cares about what your opinion is. The problems<br/>\nwe are talking about have been noticed by many many people (all whiners,<br/>\nby your logic) and do not stem out of selfish ambition and power<br/>\nhungriness. They are not personal problems (or the lack of thereof) but<br/>\nuniversal wizard problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nGet it?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere, I&#39;ll make it simple - it&#39;s like if your town was being bombed and<br/>\nyour house didn&#39;t get hit and you&#39;d go and talk about how all these<br/>\nhomeless people are just whiners and tell them stories about your life<br/>\nin another town.<br/>\n<br/>\nHTH, HAND.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
