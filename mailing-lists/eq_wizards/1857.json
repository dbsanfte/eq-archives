I do enjoy blasting for 170 points of damage, but it&#39;s<br/>\nalmost as if Verant has made these new spells EASIER to resist. For<br/>\ninstance, I fight Orcs in oasis. Low blue orcs and they are resisting my<br/>\nnew shock spell. They NEVER resist my 16th level lightning bolt. You<br/>\nwould think that a higher level spell would be as or harder to resist.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example is enstill. This ONLY works on greens. There is no blue,<br/>\nwhite, yellow, red that I have found that is successfully enstilled. In<br/>\nfact, when I fight the 20th level orcs that con black to me, they always<br/>\nresist. Yet root works on them about 25% of the time. I was hoping that<br/>\nwhen I got enstill it would be easier to solo because it is more<br/>\npowerful, alas it isn&#39;t so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am heading to Lake Rathe now and hopefully my spells work better<br/>\nthere. If not, mayhaps we should petition to get this change. I mean<br/>\ncome on, I am about as useful as a 16th level wizard against red if<br/>\nBLUES resist my new 20th level spells. While monsters are getting<br/>\nprogressively better I seem to be getting progressively incapable to<br/>\nhandle them.<br/>\n<br/>\nCroesus Illuminatus (Xegony)<br/>\n*Tanks stab em, Wizards slab em*</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
