AC 3 in all.<br/>\nbut no magical prorties this only leads me to belive that armro for a<br/>\nwizard does not get strong enough entill a Enchanter helps out a little<br/>\ni guess..

I would like to know<br/>\n&gt; which of the two types would be best to get next.<br/>\n&gt; Also, what are the stats compared to the cloth<br/>\n&gt; armor?
