IMHO _ALL_ spells beyond level 12 should be <br/>\nresearch only. Of course they should make it a bit more easy to get the <br/>\nrunes then. They are loaded WAY to seldom, but I hear that they are going to <br/>\nfix that :).<br/>\n<br/>\n*SPOILER starts here*<br/>\n<br/>\nAll wizard spells up to and including level 20 can be found somewhere in <br/>\nerudin. If you cant find it in the wizard guild or the palace or the library <br/>\ntry looking in the temples around the palace and other places inside the <br/>\nerudin city.<br/>\nI have also seen ALL our DD spells up to and including level 44 in Erudin <br/>\nand most of our AE spells up to and including level 49 (some in between <br/>\nwhere missing i think ... i just briefly looked at them since i couldnt <br/>\nafford them anyway ... but the level 49 AE spell was there).<br/>\n<br/>\n*SPOILER end*<br/>\n<br/>\nWell i hope this helps people who want to be helped and that Verant soon <br/>\nwill remove these spells and make them research only (if they load more <br/>\nrunes).<br/>\n<br/>\nRotas Koth, Innoruuk.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
