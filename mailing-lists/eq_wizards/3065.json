But that i cant play for a week or 2 and when i<br/>\ncome back all those i grouped with are to high again. So i need to find some<br/>\nnew friends and convince them of that not all wizards are killstealers and<br/>\nbad ppl.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It gets frustrating over time and now i�m at the point where i rather play<br/>\n </span></blockquote>something else then EQ, AC or Homeworld mostley.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hmm i bit of a rant there but as you can see, if wizards where more sought<br/>\n </span></blockquote>after for groups then it would be much easier for all us wizards in Norrath.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh yes, definately.  Grouping is probably the number one problem.  I<br/>\ndisagree though about the &quot;Enchanter Territory&quot; bit.  First off, if you look<br/>\nat my original post, you&#39;ll note that the formulation I posted *required* an<br/>\nenchanter to be carried out.  So it enhances both classes.  (Another<br/>\nsuggestion I received from a friend was to allow summoned weapons to be<br/>\nsimilarly &quot;charged,&quot; thus allowing magicians, enchanters, and wizards to all<br/>\nparticipate in the weapon charging procedure.  And I could give you a half<br/>\ndozen alternate formulations.)  At any rate, I&#39;m not personally attached to<br/>\nthe idea, but I&#39;d like to see if others like this one or have alternate<br/>\nstrategies in mind.  Wizards need *something* to make them more valuable for<br/>\ngrouping as I see it.  The DD and AE spells just don&#39;t cut it.  The desired<br/>\nspell casters are the healers and the buffers.  Healing seems to remote.<br/>\nBuffing in some fashion???  &lt;shrug&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSuggestions anyone?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Glyphin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
