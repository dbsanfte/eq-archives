I have been unable to figure out how to do so though :(  I know how<br/>\nto change my language from Erudite to Common and back.  I also see them<br/>\nlisted as skills.  I do not see anyplace for other languages though when I<br/>\ntalk to my guild trainer.  Is this what the specialization or research<br/>\nskills are for.  Or am I missing something.  I know that listening to the<br/>\nlanguage is supposed to help increase skill, but I have yet to been able to<br/>\nreally listen to foreign tounges for a long period of time.  Was just<br/>\nwondering if anybody could explain how to go about this, because I am<br/>\nstumped and don&#39;t see any easy or logical way to start studying a new<br/>\nlanguage.  Thanks Everyone<br/>\n<br/>\nZakrul<br/>\nErudite on Bristlebane</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
