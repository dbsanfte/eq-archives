How <br/>\ndoes the bind wound skill work?  I think I tried it once some levels back <br/>\nbut it didn&#39;t work so I gave up. ;)  A assume I should pump in a couple <br/>\npoints into the skill to get it started?  About how much healing does it <br/>\naccomplish per try?  Time for me to buy a handful of bandages and try again <br/>\nI guess...<br/>\n<br/>\nHey, another question I have for everybody out of curiosity:  now that <br/>\nspecialization has kicked in...what does everybody have in mind for that?  I <br/>\nwould think it the most popular approach to specialize in nuking <br/>\nabilities...but would any of you have the need to specialize in something <br/>\nelse and why? ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I also try to carry lots of badages o<br/>\n </span></blockquote>me so I can heal them up a bit.  I find the bind wound skill very handy &gt;and <br/>\nit<br/>\nhas saved me and others countless times.  It also saves your healers a &gt;lot <br/>\nof<br/>\nmana if everyone is at 50% health before the healer finsihes the job.  &gt;Well<br/>\nthese are my thoughts, i may bot be the most pwerful wizard in Norrath, &gt;but <br/>\nI am<br/>\nwel thought of and I can live withthat.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Dupont Human Wizard of Freeport<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Espiriit de Corps Order of the Head<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Cazic Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
