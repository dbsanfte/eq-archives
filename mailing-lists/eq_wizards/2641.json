The Magician was of the 13th level and the Wizard was <br/>\nof the 9th level.  The wizard won because of his quick spell casting.  The <br/>\nMagician had his pet out but the pet wouldn&#39;t attack.  I am just wondering if <br/>\nthe Magician&#39;s pet can attack or kill a regular player in a dueling match?  <br/>\nSo far the Magician guy told me that it wouldn&#39;t respond to him when he told <br/>\nit to attack the 9th level Wizard.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Curious Dueler!)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
