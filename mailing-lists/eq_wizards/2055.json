The spells are <br/>\nincreasingly more expensive as you go.  We don&#39;t get much great armor as <br/>\nwizards and I just think keeping it around would be more prudent right now, <br/>\nmaybe someone will be selling a fine steel staff or a runed totem staff <br/>\nthat you hear.. those would be good buys if reasonable.  I have 50pp in the <br/>\nbank and am saving up til I hit my next level to purchase spells personally.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 03:38 PM 5/28/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Phil Showalter&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:phil@...\">phil@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If this question isn&#39;t appropriate for this list, let me apologize in<br/>\n&gt;advance....

Would very much appreciate any advice anyone can give<br/>\n&gt;me that wish&#39;s they&#39;d bought or didn&#39;t buy at my level.
