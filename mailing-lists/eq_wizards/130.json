It wasnt untill lvl 16 ( I was still feeling weak at lvl<br/>\n12, even tho I did more damage then the others ) that I started to feel &quot;ooh<br/>\nyeah I am powefull&quot; type thing.  At lvl 16 I can dish out 102dmg in 1 spell,<br/>\nat lvl 17 it is 104. The lvl 16 DD spell goes up 2 points of damage per<br/>\nlevel, which is nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I definatly know how you feel, for the longest time I felt like a &quot;magi<br/>\nwithout a pet&quot; but now that feeling is starting to change. In the end we get<br/>\nthe best direct-damage and are the most mana-efficent when it comes to<br/>\ndealing direct damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also get a wide range of teleport and group teleport spells. Wizards and<br/>\nDruids are the only two class&#39;s that can get those, and we get more then the<br/>\ndruids (inter-plane travel spells). So things do look better for us in the<br/>\nlong run.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Gregory Egan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gemd@...\">gemd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Just wondering how other people feel about our Wizard class. It seems to me<br/>\n&gt;that we are short-changed compared to magicians and necromancers, whose<br/>\n&gt;spells seem a lot better, and can have &quot;pets&quot; fight for them. It&#39;s also<br/>\n&gt;hard to make signifant amounts of money to buy spells. I still like the<br/>\n&gt;game, just wondered if anyone else felt the same way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Greg (Kronan)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Visit our homepage and share with us your experiences at ONElist of the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Week!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
