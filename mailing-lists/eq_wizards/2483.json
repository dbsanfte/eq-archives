So for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; - Wizards : Direct damage, Gates<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All (almost) can be purchased in Felwithe. Including all evacuate, gates<br/>\n&gt; and so on, right up to level 49. I suspect Erudin has also a large<br/>\nselection,<br/>\n&gt; if you can find the right merchant. The only one I haven&#39;t found are the<br/>\n&gt; extra planar spells.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I do have to disagree with you. So far, research is mostly a way of<br/>\navoiding<br/>\n&gt; the necessity to buy your spells. In other words, a way of role-playing a<br/>\n&gt; tiny smidgeon more (&quot;The wizard Ultannis had to spend long time to find<br/>\nout<br/>\n&gt; how to cast force&quot;). Not good, of course, since only you knows that you<br/>\n&gt; really did find the spell on your own, when you could simply buy it at the<br/>\n&gt; store next door.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are very very few spells that cannot be found somewhere.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Wizard (A) May have a fast casting inferno shock that is less manna<br/>\n&gt; &gt; efficent, but he can pop them off faster then wizard (B), whos inferno<br/>\nshock<br/>\n&gt; &gt; does more damage but takes alot longer to cast.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now *THAT* would be nice. But I suspect it would require a very very large<br/>\n&gt; reworking of the core system (read &quot;too much code change&quot;) to make it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But I can see it being a part of the EQ expansion. So far, the only thing<br/>\n&gt; you really need to get the expansion for is a few more areas to explore,<br/>\n&gt; which is nice, but may not tempt everyone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, with this, you suddendly have things to strive for *and* incentive to<br/>\n&gt; purcahse the expansion. What more could Verant dream of? :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Vincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Tel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n&gt;         01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
