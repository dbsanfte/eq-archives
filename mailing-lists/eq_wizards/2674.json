Since the implementation of faction hits for PvP I am now<br/>\n&gt;regarded dubiously by most of the guards and have some Drow brethren who<br/>\n&gt;cannot enter the forest safely anymore.  Yes, it is my own fault for the<br/>\n&gt;most part, but how can I fix it?  GMs and Guides can&#39;t help, other players<br/>\n&gt;that I have talked with so far haven&#39;t been of much help, either.  I was<br/>\n&gt;told to try the Halflings that roam Nek Forest, but that was misleading.<br/>\n&gt;Even the Leatherfoot Deputy doesn&#39;t help you gain faction in Neriak.
