Most things on the spell list still need to be<br/>\n&gt; verified.  There are also several columns for casting time, please only<br/>\n&gt; fill in the first column with your channeling skill, and the casting<br/>\n&gt; times for the spells you own.  Also, don&#39;t worry about the damage/mana<br/>\n&gt; ratio.
