Fighting a steady<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stream of blues, a group that includes a cleric will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; almost have no use for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; us until the puller yells,  &quot;Oh Shit, I pulled<br/>\n&gt; &gt; something big guys, get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ready&quot;  That is when we shine.  With our burns,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; nobody can save the situation<br/>\n&gt; &gt; faster than a wizard.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I disagree.  That&#39;s the situation where an Enchanter<br/>\n&gt; really shines.  Wizards can help, but not as well.<br/>\n&gt; Our best bet in that situation is Evac.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Enchanters are great for debuffing the mob (When they aren&#39;t resisted) But<br/>\nthey really lack in doing damage to a mob.  Keeping in mind that both<br/>\nwizards and enchanters are limited by the 6 Level cap rule, so we are<br/>\ntalking low red, high yellows here, I would rather place my bets with a<br/>\nwizard than an enchanter.  Wizards, can burn a mob to down to 1/3 - 1/2 of<br/>\nits life chaining DD&#39;s (Even if they are 1 circle down due to matching<br/>\ncold/fire resists) much faster than an Enchanter can Debuff the same mob to<br/>\na manageable state (Taking resists into account).  Tashen, Slow, Weaken 1,<br/>\nWeaken 2, Dot, etc.  Will about halve the damage dealt by the mob.  Stuns<br/>\nwork, but 2 enchanters in a group are needed to be completely effective,<br/>\nand again resists are an issue.   Charm is out of the question, because the<br/>\nlast thing you want to do in a battle against a tough opponant, is to drag<br/>\nanother possible hostile into the fray.   Of course Everyone should have<br/>\nsome form of root/ensnare handy to keep the mob from jumping us.   Oh well<br/>\nboss is here gotta go :)<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
