HOWEVER,<br/>\nthe NPCs have the _same_ chance of breaking thru enstill as they do<br/>\nbreaking thru root. So even though enstill has the _potential_ to last<br/>\nlonger, it rarely does. So many higher lvl wizzes prefer to keep using<br/>\nroot rather than enstill since it works more or less the same, and costs<br/>\nsignificantly less to cast. YMMV.<br/>\n<br/>\nIsand</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
