Well, then again....we&#39;re 2 different types of players. You <br/>\nmay enjoy spending day after day soloing creatures over and over again, but <br/>\nmy fun comes from interacting with other people in groups.  Using <br/>\ncooperation and planning, we go after quests and big NPCs.  Nothing more <br/>\nsatisfying than accomplishing a goal.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I LOVE being a <br/>\nWizard... but this is just my observation.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you&#39;re in a good team, you can then lead to aspire for tougher <br/>\ncreatures.  Sometimes it may be foolhardy where the entire party may die, <br/>\nbut in most cases, creatures within maybe 4 or 5 levels of the strongest <br/>\nmember in the party is not out of the question.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven a case where everybody in the party was the same level, I have <br/>\nobserved many instances where every other member in the group was able to <br/>\ncontribute to the goal (bards, warriors, druids, rogues, clerics, etc) yet <br/>\nmy Wizard spells were pathetically harmless.  No buffs, no damage, nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, some goals should be unattainable to us.  For example, some reds should <br/>\nhave better saving throws than others....but there IS room for some <br/>\nbalancing in our abilities whereby we can live up to our reputation as the <br/>\n&quot;artillery&quot; class on EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 2<br/>\n   Date: Wed, 26 May 1999 09:05:32 -0400 (EDT)<br/>\n   From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ulrich@...\">ulrich@...</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Subject: Re: PLEASE!!<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Well said I agree 100%<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>---- you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;John Penman&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jpenman@...\">jpenman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;All I have been hearing from a lot of people are whines about the wizard<br/>\n&gt;class.
