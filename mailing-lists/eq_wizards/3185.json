Here is the accepted","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-457273453\">ROOT is the most important spell you can use in a dungeon or in solo... it<br/>\nis the only thing that makes you a true force to be faced!  Here is the<br/>\naccepted method for group / solo for me:<br/>\n<br/>\nGroup:<br/>\n<br/>\nlet some one pull it... let the tank beat on it for about a count of 15<br/>\n(slow 15... if you get excited count to 30) and unleash with 2 of your best<br/>\nDD spells... If one is resisted then you can try a third... but beware...<br/>\nCount another 10 and let loose with another spell...<br/>\nWhen the creature gets to about 25-40 percent of its life, ROOT it... then<br/>\nnuke as hard as you can.<br/>\n<br/>\nSolo:<br/>\n<br/>\nBOLT SPELL BOLT SPELL BOLT SPELL!<br/>\nokay here is the sequence...:<br/>\ncast your most powerful bolt spell at long range.  As the bolt flies out you<br/>\nare already in spell reset stage... when the bolt hits you are ready to<br/>\nROOT... heck half the time I have to keep hitting the ROOT hot key just till<br/>\nthe monster gets in range!  You will start casting as soon as it gets in<br/>\nrange and get the spell off well before it gets to you.  Now to the<br/>\nimportant part... BACK OFF!  backup  till the monster looks about the same<br/>\nsize on the screen as it did when you first cast the first bolt... then<br/>\nrecast the bolt..  if the monster breaks after a hit just start recasting<br/>\nthe root (it is still out of range like the first time right?) fast till it<br/>\ngoes off... back up and repeat...  If the creature ever gets into melee<br/>\nrange just take a deep breath wait till you see his attack attempt and hit<br/>\nthat ROOT!  You should get it off before he can attack you.  (this does not<br/>\nmean that he wont get another attack on you)  Then back up till just in bolt<br/>\nrange and repeat!<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the off chance your group is pulling too red a creature for you... mem<br/>\nyour fire shield and hold off attacking that thing till it has less than 25%<br/>\nhps... you have a little better chance at hitting it... plus cast a spell<br/>\nthat is one circle back from what your capable of at the time any way ( most<br/>\nlikely a deep red will resist at least partially if not all the time even at<br/>\n25% hps so you might as well do less (max damage) so it doesn&#39;t pull on<br/>\nyou...  Oh yea ... bind in the zone near the zone point... and make sure<br/>\ngate is a mem&#39;d spell... if your going to be useless make sure you atleast<br/>\nwont die with the rest of the silly&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nRutreeii&#39;s condensed guide to wizardry!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: PHAEDRA WHITLOCK &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PWHITLOCK@...\">PWHITLOCK@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, September 27, 1999 9:08 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_wizards] Spells<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;PHAEDRA WHITLOCK&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PWHITLOCK@...\">PWHITLOCK@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have few spells, maybe 4/level, and cant wait till we can rearrange our<br/>\nspellbooks.

I think that<br/>\n&gt; we (or everybody) should get spells every lvl or every other lvl.<br/>\n&gt; Especially for wizards.  My friend who is a lvl 5 enchanter almost has<br/>\n&gt; more spells then I do.  They gave us so many useless spells.  Like the<br/>\n&gt; low lvl Sphere of light.  I havent had the need for any other damage<br/>\n&gt; spell besides shocks or bolts.  Then again I am also at a low lvl.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kodros-16th lvl Wizard of Prexus<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
