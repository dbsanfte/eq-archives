It&#39;s a fact and to be honest the<br/>\nonly people that have problem&#39;s with it are people that are jelous.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to ask if you have taken the time to get to level 50 and that person<br/>\nstart&#39;s a new char. If he, or she desides to twink his new char for the fun<br/>\nof it what&#39;s wrong with that. I think to be honest I beleave it&#39;s that<br/>\nplayer&#39;s right and verrant wont do nothing about it!!!<br/>\n Why not. Because there is nothing truly being done wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nHell If the char you love playing now could get a robe that was from the<br/>\nplain of fear I am sure for a fact that you who are complaning would for a<br/>\nfact take that robe and waer it with pride for the fact that other&#39;s in your<br/>\nteam couldnt get it for a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are going to gripe about any thing them pick something that is going<br/>\nto improve the game. Like time for new spells... or new dungon&#39;s.... or<br/>\nvamping zone&#39;s that are empty so that there is more hunting grounds. Thing&#39;s<br/>\nlike that are valid.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis game is made for people to have fun. If a person way of fun is playing<br/>\na level 3 char with ruby armor... I say all the power to him.... emjoy<br/>\nfighting your fire bettel is what I say.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
