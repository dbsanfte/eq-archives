I got a<br/>\n&gt; message that I feel bound to the area (or something like<br/>\n&gt; that).  My friend<br/>\n&gt; did not.  I cast it on him 4 times and he did not get that<br/>\n&gt; message.  I tried<br/>\n&gt; to cast it by the gnome city if that matters.  The only<br/>\n&gt; message that I got<br/>\n&gt; was that I had started to cast a spell.  When we died, I<br/>\n&gt; appeared near the<br/>\n&gt; gnome city and he had a much longer walk.  It appears that<br/>\n&gt; the bind did not<br/>\n&gt; work for him.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, two things to check on:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Did you group with your friend?  If he&#39;s not in your group, you<br/>\ncan&#39;t bind him.<br/>\n2. Were you BY the city or IN the city?  You can only bind other<br/>\npeople to areas IN a city.<br/>\n<br/>\nAznyin<br/>\nLevel 12 Erudite Wizard<br/>\nCurrent Residence: Rivervale [Solusek Ro]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
