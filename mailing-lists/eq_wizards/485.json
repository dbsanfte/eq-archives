Two groups of 6 formed last night to try to take down a Wolly Mammoth (not a calf but a full blown lvl 20+ 1000 HP 50 damage a hit and 2 hits a round mammoth).  Which surprisingly we accomplished this feat with noone over lvl 12 in either of the two groups on the Bertoxxulous server.  When the great beast fell noone earned any EXP or could loot the body.  20 or so peitions were sent and 2 GM&#39;s showed up, one to help and one to show off his awesome equipment and levitate there like a pimp.  Basically if a creature is more than 2 times you lvl you get no EXP even if you kill it fairly, to prevent exploits and trapping monsters behind rocks.  We later demonstrated for the GM&#39;s by killing another Mammoth, this time we only lost 1 warrior (the first time it was 5).  Now they claim it is partly a design flaw and partly a bug within the game...now my question to you is, do you like being told what is too strong for you to possibly kill and therefore you get no EXP?  I know I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s god and 100 lvl 1&#39;s killed the god of hate...i want the exp.  I suggest everyone petition and use the feedback option to complain to verant about this.  This is a total contradiction of what they claim the game is about (you know how hard it is to convince ppl we can kill a mammoth?) and what was our reward? nothing...this is a tragedy...i&#39;m about to go Colorado on some fools...!<br/>\n<br/>\nTeferi level 12 wizard Bertoxxulous server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
