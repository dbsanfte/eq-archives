Wizards<br/>\ncan make all the difference on whether your group survives or not.  I can do<br/>\n175 dmg with one cast.  I can cast this spell 6 times.  Believe me, fights<br/>\ngo a lot faster and safer with a wizard that can deal out that much dmg.<br/>\nAnd, when you get 2 wizards in a group, well you can imagine the devastation<br/>\nthat can happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nLets not forget our group teleportation spells either.  Not to mention, we<br/>\nare the ONLY class that can teleport a group to an alternate plane.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, your statement that &quot;parties can&#39;t be bothered with wizards&quot; is totally<br/>\ninaccurate.  I have never had a problem finding a group to adventure with.<br/>\nAnd, like Valacian stated, I would be more than happy to duel a barbarian<br/>\nwarrior with dual wield.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalarin Kal&#39;Amon, High Elven Wizard<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Simon Hinshelwood &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:iktome@...\">iktome@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 13, 1999 5:53 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_wizards] Ice Comet<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Simon Hinshelwood &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:iktome@...\">iktome@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well said Jay. Parties cant be bothered with wizards, they cant buff, cant<br/>\nheal<br/>\n&gt; and cant really help parties that much...&quot;we were supposed to be heavy<br/>\n&gt; artillery&quot; but that just is not correct. I think a wizard would be most<br/>\nparties<br/>\n&gt; last choice if they could choose from all the classes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Its very easy to demonstrate the wizard immbalance; get into an arena with<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; dual wield barbarian warrior of the same level and see how you do!<br/>\n&gt; Hmm doesn&#39;t sound too promising eh?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have always played a wizard character class in AD&D and UO but I regret<br/>\n&gt; playing one in EQ. I think EQ were nervous about the power wizards in UO<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t want to unbalance the game. I think they swung the pendalum too far<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; other way. Root &#39;n&#39; Shoot, if that fails death, thats about it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hopefully e-mails will pour in and tell me how wrong I am. Great, show me<br/>\nits<br/>\n&gt; not the case so I feel I have a character with a future!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Simon<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  bringing the world together.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
