Oh poor you, you can&#39;t find a<br/>\ngroup, therefore I&#39;ll just steal.  Sounds kind of familiar to stuff like,<br/>\nPoor me, I had no parental guidance as a child, so I mug people.  You have<br/>\nsome very faulty reasoning going on.  If you want to get groups, you don&#39;t<br/>\nkill steal--EVER.  You do it once, and you&#39;re already risking getting a bad<br/>\nname for yourself.  Do it more than that and you can guarantee you&#39;ll never<br/>\nget groups again.  Not only that, but kill stealing has a very short life<br/>\nspan.  You can kill steal up to a certain level, and then parties begin to<br/>\ndecend into dungeons where you can&#39;t crawl by yourself to steal.  Also,<br/>\ntotal party damage at these higher levels will begin to outstrip yours if<br/>\nthey have a balanced group.  Your leveling will begin to peter out, and<br/>\nyou&#39;ll be left roaming around looking for something worth exp that a group<br/>\nis killing so that you can get your smidgeon of exp by stealing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing too, have you not considered that all the other classes have<br/>\nthe same grouping problems you do?  I also play a cleric, and there have<br/>\nbeen many a time I was planted on my duff waiting for a group.  None of<br/>\nthese other classes are able to effectively kill steal, so what about them?<br/>\nTo hell with them, is probably what you&#39;d say.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why you don&#39;t get groups.  You don&#39;t know how to interact with other<br/>\npeople.  You&#39;ll be a fringe parasite for a long time unless you shape up.<br/>\n&quot;I can&#39;t get groups, so that&#39;s why I kill steal,&quot; is a two year old&#39;s<br/>\ndefence after pushing his brother down in the sand and taking his candy<br/>\nbecause he didn&#39;t do anything to deserve one from momma too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWaah.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:yur@...\">yur@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:yur@...\">yur@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, June 09, 1999 10:34 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eq_wizards] Kill Stealing<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:yur@...\">yur@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      You guys don&#39;t seem to understand why some of us (such as<br/>\n&gt; myself) kill<br/>\n&gt; steal all the time.  IT IS BECAUSE WE CANNOT FIND GROUPS !!!<br/>\n&gt; simple as that.<br/>\n&gt; no groups, KS !  thats it.  I don&#39;t feel like sitting on my ass<br/>\n&gt; for 30 - 40 min<br/>\n&gt; waiting for ppl to group, while shouting all the time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1) people hate us for shouting so much<br/>\n&gt; 2) people don&#39;t message us even if they need group member (weird)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      You ppl who are against kill stealers by shouting their<br/>\n&gt; names out so no one<br/>\n&gt; will group them are so god damn stupid, all you have to do is<br/>\n&gt; group with them<br/>\n&gt; and BINGO !! no more kill stealing.   If i am getting good xp ,<br/>\n&gt; why kill steal<br/>\n&gt; ??  there is no point for me to risk my life trying to get xp<br/>\n&gt; from some monster<br/>\n&gt; 6 others are beating up on.  I rarely die in a group since I<br/>\n&gt; stand so far back,<br/>\n&gt; but while kill stealing if i beat them up too much, the mob might<br/>\n&gt; run to me with<br/>\n&gt; no one else helping.   If you really want to stop kill stealing,<br/>\n&gt; then just group<br/>\n&gt; with those people so you guys can take on higher mobs together.   I would<br/>\n&gt; happily stop KS anytime during the day to Group with ppl passing<br/>\n&gt; by.  I only KS<br/>\n&gt; while waiting for groups and i do shout for groups while i KS as well.<br/>\n&gt; People are stupid and don&#39;t know how to stop a problem,  oh<br/>\n&gt; well... what can you<br/>\n&gt; do ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
