I am a high elf wizard who worships Tunare.  The merchant hates<br/>\n&gt; me, will not sell to me, but will not attack me either.

You can try running away into the city, but I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;have never witnessed anyone successful at that.  Also, I have once<br/>\nobserved<br/>\n&gt; &gt;this merchant running into a wall farther into the city, but that was<br/>\nonly<br/>\n&gt; &gt;one time.  Every other time I have been into Ak&#39;Anon, it has been right<br/>\n&gt; &gt;there at the entrance.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
