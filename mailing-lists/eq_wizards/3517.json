LOL I have <br/>\nabout 100 plat in the bank which is probably as high as my bank <br/>\naccount ever is.  Bottom line for me is that unless they fix the <br/>\nquest for the robe it&#39;s unlikely that I&#39;ll ever get one.  Tho truthfully <br/>\nI&#39;m having so little luck getting groups at 22 that I&#39;m not playin my <br/>\nwiz very much these days.  I actually got tossed out of a group I <br/>\nwas invited to when the warrior discovered (uhhh how could anyone <br/>\nNOT know this) that I couldn&#39;t buff or heal him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIggie<br/>\nThe Protectorate<br/>\nCazic Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
