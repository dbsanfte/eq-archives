Seeing as that is one the wizards specialties, we<br/>\nshould feedback verant to expand us in that direction. Rather than<br/>\ntrying to make our class what it isn&#39;t (with pets and SoW and such). I<br/>\nsee 4 spell ideas in your post:<br/>\n<br/>\nbind affinity 2: Bind yourself ONLY to a second bind point<br/>\ngate 2: Gate to yours second bind point<br/>\nportal home: Group teleport back to our bind location<br/>\ngate other: teleport group member back to their bind location<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we work together and figure out a *fair* level to get these spells at<br/>\nwe could give feedback to verant about it. After all, we as seekers of<br/>\nknowledge should be thinking of ways ( in game ) to increase our power.<br/>\nThese could be researched spells for instance where we have to discover<br/>\nthe runes that make it! Or a Norrath-wide contest to see who can figure<br/>\nout the correct combination first.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh btw, what are you fighting and where at 19th level? That&#39;s how far I<br/>\nam and just got there!

So why can&#39;t we<br/>\n&gt; have little perks like two bind points, or the ability to group teleport<br/>\n&gt; back to our bind location, or a spell to teleport someone else, in group, to<br/>\n&gt; their bind spot?
