Wizards are KING there, BY FAR.  But that&#39;s<br/>\nbecause it is one of the rare places that is busy and FFA is the norm, which<br/>\nmeans fastest dmg is gonna win kills while all the tanks are beating on<br/>\nwhatever shows up.  If I unloaded my burn on creatures in other places the<br/>\nway I do in the Hold, I&#39;d die a lot )))   If any wizard (lvl 16 and up)<br/>\ncan&#39;t find a group in the Hold, then the groups either are full or idiots<br/>\nfor not taking you.   This is the Hold, not the norm, IMHO.   Example - half<br/>\nthe time I enter the Hold zone, I get Tells before I even get to the spawn<br/>\npoints asking for groups, this doesn&#39;t ever happen anywhere else....<br/>\nFor those of you that haven&#39;t experienced this place, gotta check it out.<br/>\nMajority of the time in there, FFA is expected but sometimes people will<br/>\nbitch at you and your group for winning all the kills  )) <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just a side note ))<br/>\n<br/>\n -----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: \tRivi�re St�phane [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Stephane.Riviere@...\">Stephane.Riviere@...</a>] <br/>\nSent:\tWednesday, May 26, 1999 1:08 PM<br/>\nTo:\t&#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject:\t[eq_wizards] WE ARE NOT USELESS.. comments please...<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Rivi=E8re_St=E9phane?= &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Stephane.Riviere@...\">Stephane.Riviere@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, so i am on this mailing list from digest 3 :). And it s really amusing<br/>\nto see how people change their mind.. At the beginning everyone was happy<br/>\nwith the wizzard class. Now many of ours come to level 20 and more and find<br/>\nthey are useless vs RED con creatures... Here is my 2 cents :<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, never, never say a wizzard is useless : i am hunting at HHP...<br/>\nAnd everytime i go there and i say EVERYTIME i get a toons of tell from<br/>\npeople to group with . Why ? simple. I am not a god but when there are, let<br/>\ns say 15 people, at a spawn point with blue to yellow con creatures and that<br/>\neveryone engage any creatures coming.. they need me :). Cause if i want, i<br/>\nget the kill.. No way others will have it if i start casting as hell. NO<br/>\nWAY. I never never stealth kill, but if no group want with me np, as soon as<br/>\ni see a monster i cast (if i am full and that the monster i not already<br/>\nengaged of course).. all warrior type run on it, all casters cast.. And i<br/>\nget the kill.... What i never do : some wizzard  (many sigh :( ) see a<br/>\nmonster, many people run to fight it... They just cast two spel or so... and<br/>\nthen meditate again... The people fighting the monster kill him after 40<br/>\nsecondes and the wizzard get the kills... that s what i call &quot;kill stealer&quot;.<br/>\nWhen i begin to cast, i cast, using all my mana if needed but i kill it<br/>\nmyself or do a REAL more dommage then others . But as i previously said, as<br/>\nsoon as i come and ask for a group all people ask for me cause they know i<br/>\ncan help them to kill monsters AND to get the kill... One good (and bad in<br/>\nfact:) ) example : yesterday was a wizzard level 23 at hpp, i don t<br/>\nappreciate this guys (only cause he is a dark elf:) ) : we were something<br/>\nlike 10 players my group 5 people, one other group 3 people, and this guy<br/>\nwith a tank...I was level 19... AS soon a someone see him casting on a mob,<br/>\nnobody and i say nobody try to get the kill :)))) they all know he can do<br/>\n175 dommage per cast and he can cast 2 or 3 time without having the mob on<br/>\nhim :) So he is absolutely sure to get the kill :). That was funny to see<br/>\nplayers say : STOP. The wizzard already get it, don t try :).<br/>\nAbout the resisting fact, i get the same problem as you guys : sometimes<br/>\nmonsters resist my spells... Sometimes blue do (not often hopefully), white<br/>\ntoo but yellow and red resist a lot... You say : but all others class hit<br/>\nhim, we can not ! Ha come on, i have seen many times a full group of level<br/>\n14 -15 warrior type being killed one per one by a red orc mercenary level<br/>\n23-24.... They were missing ALL the time, and the mob hit them for 45+ . So<br/>\ni am sorry to say if we are useles vs red creatures others are too :).<br/>\nSometimes a spell hit a red mob with full dommage.. Who can hit a monster in<br/>\n2 sec for 175 dommage ??? With a good weapon 2h slashing (i mean a REAL GOOD<br/>\nWEAPON) a warrior level 20 hit for one attack at 35... ok he can double<br/>\nattack sometimes. But if he don t miss it takes 8 seconde between each<br/>\ntry... So if he never miss  and that he sucessfully double attack (at level<br/>\n20 they don&#39;t :) ), he deals 70 dommage for 8 secondes.. IF the monster get<br/>\nhit for the max dommage..... So take 20 seconde to do 170 hp dommage IF he<br/>\ndouble attack all the time and hits all the time and is not stunned or<br/>\nbashed :). Come an, if our spel were never or less resisted we are going to<br/>\nbe god :). <br/>\nFinally ( sorry for this long post:) ), i think that wizzard are really not<br/>\nuseless vs creatures and if you think they are, just go and take a monk or<br/>\nwhatever :). But i want to see your face when at level 20 you do 18 hp max<br/>\nfor each attack :). Oh and yes, i solo let&#39;s say 5 or 10 minutes per day no<br/>\nmore : after that people ask me to join them :). I also never (or nearly<br/>\nnever) try to kill red con creatures with 5 other friends.. yellow yep<br/>\nsometimes but no red cause it take a biggg time to rest after the fight and<br/>\nthe xp is really not very better then a white (kill 2 dark blue, you get<br/>\nmore xp then one red..).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ncomments ? <br/>\n<br/>\nyakos<br/>\n<br/>\nlevel 20 wizzard on karana THE french server :) sorry for my awful english<br/>\nhehe :)<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nLooking for a new hobby?
