It<br/>\ncontains all the spells I have heard about up to level 49, components<br/>\nneeded to research the spell, and I&#39;ve recently began adding which city<br/>\nthe spell can be bought.  Most things on the spell list still need to be<br/>\nverified.  There are also several columns for casting time, please only<br/>\nfill in the first column with your channeling skill, and the casting<br/>\ntimes for the spells you own.  Also, don&#39;t worry about the damage/mana<br/>\nratio.  I&#39;ll finish that after all the cahnges are compiled.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy<br/>\n<br/>\nMalkin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
