Group up<br/>\nand fight things that con yellow to me only using my staff but then use<br/>\nmana when it starts getting tough?:<br/>\n1) Where do I find the Runed Totem Staff<br/>\n2) Where do I find any Staff mountings for this staff(I hear they have<br/>\nGREAT bonuses!)<br/>\n3) Are there any other magic rings than the Cutthroat Insignia rings or<br/>\nOnynx Earrings, and if so, what do they do and where the heck do I get<br/>\nthem?<br/>\n4) Is Cooking a hard skill? seeing I am a fisherman, is it easier(money<br/>\nwise) to sell the fish(or whatever I catch) to the merchant  and buy my<br/>\nown food, or is it less expensive to just learn the cooking skill and<br/>\ncook it up myself(oh, yeah, do I even usually get fish? eheheh, if my<br/>\nskill goes up do I catch better fish or some rare items or what?)<br/>\nThx for all your help!<br/>\n-Malvos the Wizard of all Seasons on The Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
