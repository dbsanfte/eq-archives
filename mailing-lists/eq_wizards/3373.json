","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-649763084\">According to Paul Kundrat:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;     For levels 6 to about 9 try the gnoll guards and scrawny gnoll guards, not in<br/>\n&gt; Blackburrow, but on the Everfrost side in the tunnel leading to Blackburrow.  I think<br/>\n&gt; there are 4 spawns (if I remember correctly), two at the entrance, one at the 2nd corner,<br/>\n&gt; and one more in a little nook a ways down the hall.  The only bad part is that if you have<br/>\n&gt; to zone into BB you may run into a train. A good thing is that passersby may be able to<br/>\n&gt; help if you get into trouble and they drop fairly decent loot.  Good luck.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>At level 8, only two out of 4 guards still give you experience, and at level 9,<br/>\nall are green, but one at times still give you a microscopic sliver of XP.<br/>\nYou may solo them at level 6, at a reasonable rate, but you then start killing them<br/>\nfaster than they respawn after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou also quickly learn the layout of Blackburrow, and where it is safe to hunt<br/>\ntopside.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do not care about loot, hunting at the border of the everfrost plain is good,<br/>\nas there are plenty of large spiderlings, skeletons for level 6-7, then polar bears<br/>\nat level 8 and 9, then you may start hunting lower level orcs and snow leopards. If<br/>\nyou run in trouble, you have guards nearby :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
