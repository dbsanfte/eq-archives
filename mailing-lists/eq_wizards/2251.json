I think it&#39;s unfair to examine<br/>\n&gt;the wizard as a whole class before it&#39;s not completely done.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What level do you get specialization anyway? 20?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; It&#39;s a stated fact.

But<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m sure that the mana to damage ratio and casting times are better for<br/>\n&gt;the wizard anyway.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Enchanters and magicians can cast beneficial buffs on party members,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>debuff<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; mobs, and have summoned creatures to fight for them.

This means more<br/>\n&gt;&gt; downtime for the wiz and embarassment because your spells suddenly suck.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Worse-case, the mobs get irritated that you&#39;re even TRYING to shoot them,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and you die very, very quickly.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So the situation you&#39;re describing is when a party with, oh say, a level<br/>\n&gt;14 wizard and a level 16 warrior wants to attack a level 20 monster? How<br/>\n&gt;often do you see that happen?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And if this does happen, it shouldn&#39;t. A level 14 warrior would not help<br/>\n&gt;any anyway. You think he would hit? Or do you think a level 14<br/>\n&gt;Enchanter&#39;s buffs would make any difference against a level 20 enemy?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Actually, I would have said &quot;I suck&quot; instead. Appreciate your diplomacy.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve followed the teachings of Zaeq, North Karana beetle-kiter<br/>\n&gt;&gt; extraordinare. What ends up happening is I run to the beetle, hit it, get<br/>\n </span></blockquote>it<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; down, then some damned animal jumps me and I have to zone.  There&#39;s no<br/>\n </span></blockquote>place<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&gt; else I can solo in the queynos/karana area that&#39;s not overly camped. Even<br/>\n&gt;&gt; wisps give me little exp anymore, many con green at 15th.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The location, as a said, sucks. travel to Freeport and hunt in North Ro,<br/>\n&gt;you&#39;ll find it *perfect*. It has as much prey as the Karanas, but<br/>\n&gt;significantly less aggressive animals. It also has dervish camps where<br/>\n&gt;in a party you&#39;ll get good exp and great loot. You can also take turns<br/>\n&gt;and solo them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Some zones are just bad for some levels. The trick is to find a good<br/>\n&gt;zone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Did I state that? No. Now that you mention it, they&#39;ve promised it since<br/>\n&gt;&gt; retail release, nothing has come of it so far.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The plains are operational.
