Since we were there, we thought &quot;what the <br/>\nheck&quot; and decided to duel.  We were both virgin duelers and thought it would <br/>\nbe interesting, him being a level 20 Bard.  I&#39;m the same level.<br/>\n<br/>\nHehehe.  I just laugh when I think about it now.  He couldn&#39;t touch me.  <br/>\nShadow step....zap....shadow step....zap.  :)  He was down with 3 hits of <br/>\nforce shock.  :)   (flashes of my old Quake fests come to mind)  We both had <br/>\nfun anyway...he vowed to get me back another day.  I&#39;ll have to keep looking <br/>\nbehind my back. *snicker*  Now I know why some of you chose the PVP server.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis just came to mind on this thread because I remember my elf faction went <br/>\ndown a notch.  Sure hope I&#39;m not KOS when I get home.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nProud of our class,<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n20lvl High-elf Wiz Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
