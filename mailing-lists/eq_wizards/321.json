If it were me that was <br/>\n&gt; designing it,<br/>\n&gt; then we&#39;d need spell components and such.

I&#39;d hate to think that<br/>\nVerant just included a few hidden spells you have to research to access.<br/>\nVerant could play a hand in this, perhaps setting a threshold for<br/>\n&#39;discovery&#39; (you have to do X research to discover a spell) and then<br/>\nwrite it into the game via the patch server. <br/>\n<br/>\nProblems:<br/>\na) The newly discovered spell would have to be made available on all<br/>\nservers, unless Verant can find a way to only make it available on the<br/>\ndiscoverer&#39;s.<br/>\nb) Every time a new spell is discovered, everyone has to get patched. =&#92;<br/>\nThis wouldn&#39;t be that much of a problem if discovery is limited to<br/>\nhigh-ranking mages.<br/>\nc) Verant would actually have to consult with the discoverer about the<br/>\ndetails, like visuals, spell effects, mana cost, etc. Do they really want<br/>\nto put this much effort into it? I&#39;d love it if they would, but I have my<br/>\ndoubts...<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nskeizer (the gnome)<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;shut up! just because i live in the bowels of the earth <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean i&#39;m not allowed to be a frost mage!&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n___________________________________________________________________<br/>\nYou don&#39;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>\nGet completely free e-mail from Juno at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html\">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>\nor call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
