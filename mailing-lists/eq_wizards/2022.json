Calling it a buff is bringing the Wizards closer to the other<br/>\nclasses. Matter of fact I don&#39;t think this line of spells should confer ANY<br/>\nbuff properties. It should merely cause damage to an attacking MOB and not<br/>\nprovide any protection etc....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCinius Shade of the 6th circle(Mith Marr)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4) O&#39;Kiels Radiation seems that it would be the beginning of a great<br/>\n&gt; line of spells. Why should it end there? Cold and Magic based<br/>\n&gt; buffs/shields would be a very welcome addition.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your free, private email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.excite.com/\">http://mail.excite.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
