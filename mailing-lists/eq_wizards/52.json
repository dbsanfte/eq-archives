Now if it<br/>\ncould cross zone boundies....<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Well I have first hand experience with Minotaur slavers doing the same<br/>\n&gt; thing.  I used to Eye to check out the mines to see if they <br/>\n&gt; were safe and<br/>\n&gt; the same thing happened.  2 seconds after they spotted the <br/>\n&gt; eye they came<br/>\n&gt; right after me.  Now I can justify this with &quot;the eye alerted them to<br/>\n&gt; intruders so they started patrolling&quot;  but they ran right by <br/>\n&gt; 3 or 4 other<br/>\n&gt; people who were in the mines to get at me so this was no <br/>\n&gt; ordinary patrol<br/>\n&gt; pattern.  Seems fishy to me.  Same type of thing has been <br/>\n&gt; happening with<br/>\n&gt; invisibility, as long as I&#39;m invisible *before* the fight <br/>\n&gt; starts I&#39;m Ok, but<br/>\n&gt; if the fight starts and I run away to a safe spot, go <br/>\n&gt; invisible, then go<br/>\n&gt; back to check on the battle they zero in on me as if I was <br/>\n&gt; standing there in<br/>\n&gt; plain sight.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Joseph Brooks [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Joseph.Brooks@...\">Joseph.Brooks@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Friday, April 16, 1999 4:30 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [eq_wizards] Re: Hail fellow Norrathians<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Joseph Brooks &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Joseph.Brooks@...\">Joseph.Brooks@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I know that using Eye of Zomm to spy on ghouls in W.
