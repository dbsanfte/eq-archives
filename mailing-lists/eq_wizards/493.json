Most UO PKers didn&#39;t even kill you in<br/>\n&gt;character, it was like<br/>\n&gt;&quot;HE<br/>\n&gt;*&*$^&$  YOU ARE DEAD F*&%ER YOU SUCK blah blah blah&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree with you like the other guy said there may be<br/>\na large portion who are good but I can see all kinds<br/>\nof problems if +PVP spells can effect -PVP. As far as<br/>\nthe bind goes you have to be in the Binders party to<br/>\nbe bound to that city so we have that in our favor.<br/>\nMaybe they could implement something to where +PVP<br/>\nspells can effect -PVP if they are in the same party?<br/>\nBut random casting I think is a bad idea. I quit UO<br/>\nbecause of the Pkers I don&#39;t want the same thing to<br/>\nhappen to EQ. EQ is not Quake if you want random<br/>\nkilling for no other reason than to rack up a body<br/>\ncount and to talk trash while you do it get out of EQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nAzzameen High Elf Wizard<br/>\nLost Order of Akalabeth<br/>\nVeeshan Server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n+-----------------------------------+<br/>\n| Shane Bennett                     |<br/>\n| Consultant - Microsoft Team       |<br/>\n| Global Professional Services      |<br/>\n| Computer Associates International |<br/>\n| <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cai.com\">http://www.cai.com</a>                |<br/>\n+-----------------------------------+<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
