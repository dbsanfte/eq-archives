Bind Affinity means for me that I&#39;ll travel more safely, as I can<br/>\nbind me at a relatively safe location (be sure to check it very carefully<br/>\nbeforehand. Many a wizard lost a full experience level when he discovered a<br/>\nhostile guarding near his bind point - die... reincarnate... mob jumps you...<br/>\ndie... and so on, til he leaves)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So that&#39;s about it. i&#39;m sure once you realize how good the exp is in Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The Sand scrarabs are hunted to extinction. Tarantulas are left alone (people<br/>\nhate being poisoned), and mummies must be checked carefully: if you haven&#39;t a<br/>\ncleric at hand, stay away, or suffer the rabies - for 30mn real time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure about the occasional madman; the guards leave those guys alone,<br/>\nso if you hunt them, you might get KOS (but then, *you* might be KOS already).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; you&#39;ll stay for a while then start exploring, maybe going to Felwithe (if<br/>\n&gt; you can stay invis long enough to get to the docks in freeport.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Anyone got luck into finding the hidden passageways? There is supposedly a<br/>\nsecret passage from the docks to the side of the wall after East Gate, but<br/>\nall I&#39;ve found is a red-conning dark elf that forced me to dive to recover<br/>\nmy body :( .<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
