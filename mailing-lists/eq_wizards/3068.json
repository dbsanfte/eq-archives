I<br/>\nnever have problems getting a group in Mistmoore, if there is a group<br/>\nwit ha free spot. People do want wizards because they know that if the<br/>\nsituation gets bad, but not hopeless, a wizard can quickly turn the<br/>\ntides, thus saving someone&#39;s life. And I&#39;m not talking about stopping a<br/>\nhigher level train here. I&#39;m talking bout a too big pull that the group<br/>\nis evenly matched with (pull does not necessarily refer to just one mob.<br/>\nI just mean an even fight all around), a wizard can very quickly take<br/>\nout one of the evens (with some minimal tanking to help) or take out one<br/>\nblue and seriously damage another. why is that important? Well, clearly,<br/>\nwhen you kill someone quickly, you no longer take damage from them for<br/>\nthe rest of the fight. Then the wizard can med and maybe get enough for<br/>\nanother blast or two while the rest of the party will end up beat up,<br/>\nbut definitely not dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, evacs are a must at higher level. Yeah, druids have them too, but<br/>\nthat&#39;s just one other class with the skill. Shamans have SOW too, but<br/>\nyou don&#39;t see that diminishing from Druid power.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nSergey<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\nKPS, PUNK (Paramilitary Undercover Nuclear Kamikaze)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
