Can&#39;t say for sure since<br/>\nI am 2 bubbles from 28th :)<br/>\nIf I get a chance in game today I will try to remember to check the spells<br/>\nof lower level.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    29           Thunder Strike<br/>\n&gt;    29           Shock Spiral of Al&#39;Kabor<br/>\n&gt;    34           Thunder Clap<br/>\n&gt;    34           Circle of Force<br/>\n&gt;    34           Lava Storm<br/>\n&gt;    39           Force spiral of Al&#39;Kabor<br/>\n&gt;    44           Frost Storm<br/>\n&gt;    49           Wrath of Al&#39;Kabor<br/>\n&gt;    49           Super Nova<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;#2 Is there a place in Eurdin to buy spells other than the Library?

At the time I was<br/>\nlow on runes and took the safe way out.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso so you can add to the locations of spells.  I have bought all 8 of my<br/>\ncurrent personal gate spells at Felwithe, as well as the following:<br/>\nGlimpse, Eye of Zomm, Halo of Light, Site.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeatherskin, Shieldskin, Force Shock and Frost Shock were all purchased at<br/>\nFreeport<br/>\n<br/>\nLevitate in Rivervale at the druid guild<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps, If I find myself with some spair time I&#39;ll see if I can<br/>\nmake a list of everything they sell.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack, Knight Defender of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
