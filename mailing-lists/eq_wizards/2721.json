Rhees&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Brian_Rhees@...\">Brian_Rhees@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; been playing around with the level 24 teleports and thought I&#39;d post and<br/>\n&gt; request some info, since I haven&#39;t seen it out myself on any of the web<br/>\n&gt; pages.  As most of you know, the lvl 20 teleports are all designed to be<br/>\n&gt; fairly safe and highly visible (those huge sets of four arched pillars<br/>\n&gt; located in Faydark, North Karanas, and Tox Forest).  Mobs usually won&#39;t go<br/>\n&gt; into the teleport area unless pulled.  An exception to this would be the N<br/>\n&gt; Karanas teleport, where a guard occasionally marches through (which could<br/>\n&gt; cause problems depending on your Qeynos Gard faction).  The lvl 24 teles<br/>\nare<br/>\n&gt; different.  So you know what to look for if you stumble across one . . .<br/>\n&gt; They are stubby, cropped off pyramids, a little taller than a tall player,<br/>\n&gt; with four knee high arched pillars at the corners.  They give off hums<br/>\nwhen<br/>\n&gt; you are near/on them.  Their rough locations are as follows:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1.  The Commonlands teleport:  Drops you in West Commonlands, North West<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; Befallen a bit.  Fairly useful teleport if you want to visit that dungeon,<br/>\n&gt; etc. (which will be low for your level when you get the teleport; but,<br/>\nhey,<br/>\n&gt; some of us get our gossamer robes late).  Doesn&#39;t appear to be too<br/>\n&gt; dangerous.  There are some rough wandering mobs in W Commons though, so<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; may want to invis after you get there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2.  The Ro Teleport:  Ah, having a teleport near Freeport (in W Commons)<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t enough you say?  Well, you have a choice apparently.  In North Ro<br/>\n&gt; there is another teleport pillar a fair distance south from Freeport.<br/>\nThis<br/>\n&gt; teleport isn&#39;t exactly safe as low level players seem to love to pull<br/>\n&gt; mummies and such to the teleport to fight there.  Why?  I dunno.<br/>\nShouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; be a problem unless you teleport there on low mana.  One wonders why they<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t put this one in South Ro to space the teleports better.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3.  The West teleport.  Carrying on the pattern of high redundancy, Verant<br/>\n&gt; put another one of these wonderful teleports in W Karanas (which, of<br/>\ncourse,<br/>\n&gt; borders N Karanas which has a &quot;safe&quot; teleport).  Now since W Karanas is<br/>\n&gt; probably the longest East to West land zone in the game, it would make<br/>\nsense<br/>\n&gt; to put a tele here, right?  Say on the West border, near Qeynos hills,<br/>\n&gt; right?  We&#39;ve all gotten tired of the long runs from N Karanas to, say,<br/>\n&gt; Qeynos by now.  Naturally, therefore, Verant put the teleport on the<br/>\n*East*<br/>\n&gt; and not the *West* side of the zone where it might have actually been<br/>\n&gt; useful.  Depending on your zone times, the N Karans and W Karanas<br/>\nteleports<br/>\n&gt; are only about a minute apart.  You may want to save a bit of money here<br/>\n&gt; when buying your lvl 24 spells if you need the cash.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 4. Cazic Thule.  Last night I had a chance to use this spell, for reasons<br/>\n&gt; too contorted to go into here.  I&#39;d been warned it was dangerous, but what<br/>\n&gt; the heck?  We only live about a thousand times.  The gate drops you inside<br/>\n&gt; Cazic Thule, into a set of caverns.  When you teleport in, I highly<br/>\nsuggest<br/>\n&gt; you go invis immediately, and don&#39;t move until you are sure it will hold.<br/>\n&gt; At level 26, there are a few lizardmen around that con blue.  I<br/>\nimmediately<br/>\n&gt; set off in search of my party (loc written down ahead of time) and<br/>\nproceeded<br/>\n&gt; to get thoroughly lost.  My invis failed 4 times before I finally gave up<br/>\n&gt; and gated out.  Is there anyone out there who knows how to navigate from<br/>\n&gt; this gate to the Feerrott zone, or some other location of general<br/>\nrelevance?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, haven&#39;t tried the Nek gate yet, but will give it a go tonight.  I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; heard that it is generally safe for good races, but we shall see.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I do want to put in a gripe though.  Why not move the West teleport over<br/>\n&gt; closer to Qeynos, or put one in near Halas or Everfrost?  And how about<br/>\n&gt; moving the Ro gate to South Ro?  It is almost insulting to buy redundant<br/>\n&gt; teleport spells.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Glyphin E&#39;mondredon<br/>\n&gt; The Rathe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Campaign 2000 is here!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Discuss your thoughts; get informed at ONElist.
