So they are still in the game, and you can still get banned for using ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-324236180\">There are still many exploits in the game that they just don&#39;t have time to<br/>\nfix.  So they are still in the game, and you can still get banned for using<br/>\nthem....  Believe me, i reported the one in Lavastorm the third day it was<br/>\nreleased (along with tons of other ppl), yet they still have not fixed it<br/>\n(all that happens is a GM comes around once a day or so and warns everybody<br/>\nnot to use it).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, i may be incorrect about &quot;the hill&quot; in South Ro.  the area in South Ro<br/>\nthat was originally mentioned may NOT be an exploit.  I spent some time this<br/>\nmorning killing Ortallius using &quot;the hill&quot; and it didn&#39;t seem like the<br/>\n&quot;real&quot; exploits i&#39;ve seen in places like Lavastorm.  Ortallius could still<br/>\nhit me, but if i ran up far enough on the hill, he could no longer hit me.<br/>\nBut he didn&#39;t just stand there and let me pound on him from a distance<br/>\neither. As soon as I got to the area where he could no longer follow, he<br/>\nwould turn and run, not giving me enough time to cast on him from the safe<br/>\narea.  So I would have to run back down the hill until he came after me<br/>\nagain, giving me just enough time to cast on him (but he would still tag me<br/>\nas i finished my casting).  I guess it works just like a zone, without<br/>\nactually having to zone.  I used it this morning, and was able to kill<br/>\nOrtallius about 6 or 7 times this morning with a partner, but we probably<br/>\nwould NOT have been able to kill him without the help of the hill (at least<br/>\nnot without dieing once or twice, as he conned red a few times).  So, to<br/>\neach his own, but I think I&#39;ll stay away from it just to be on the safe<br/>\nside.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I did see some bright spots, as he didn&#39;t resist a single flame shock<br/>\n(he was 2 or 3 lvls higher then me).  He did resist enstill every time, and<br/>\nforce shock about 75% of the time except when my enchanter friend cast<br/>\ntashan...  And then my force shock went through for full dmg every time (has<br/>\nanyone ever noticed that when force shock is not resisted, it goes for full<br/>\ndmg every time???).  I wish they would give us tashan or something similiar.<br/>\nWhat a great spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nSinlaru Ce`alen<br/>\nRallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Neil Lambert &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smartass@...\">smartass@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, May 31, 1999 9:49 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_wizards] UNSUB-FUCKING-SCRIBE<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Neil Lambert&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smartass@...\">smartass@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s already been reported by me and many others and until they fix it i<br/>\n&gt;assume it&#39;s supposed to be in there ?<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: Tom Bratina &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gbratina@...\">gbratina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Date: Monday, May 31, 1999 5:52 PM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [eq_wizards] UNSUB-FUCKING-SCRIBE<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From: &quot;Tom Bratina&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gbratina@...\">gbratina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;friendly fyi: watch the stuff in south ro by the oasis zone border. it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;not<br/>\n&gt;&gt;only &quot;cheesy&quot;, but it&#39;s an exploit and you could get banned for it.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;&gt;From: Gooey Smalls &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smullins@...\">smullins@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Date: Monday, May 31, 1999 7:16 PM<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Subject: [eq_wizards] UNSUB-FUCKING-SCRIBE<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;From: &quot;Gooey Smalls&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smullins@...\">smullins@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Everything up to lvl 12 is super easy, for lvl 12 to 13 i stayed in misty<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;thicket killing sand scarabs, strong giant spiders, strong giant wasp and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;young kodiaks, lvl 13 to 14 i did in south ro, this zone is awesome,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>there<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;is a dune towards the oasis zone point where you can stand and the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>monster<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;just run away, so you step out, bait them back, step back cast and repeat<br/>\n&gt;&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;take on yellow mummies and dune terantulas, cheesy but effective.
