Alot of people that I know who<br/>\nare in their<br/>\nmid-late 20s and 30s, and a few in their late 30s&#39; are actually adults with<br/>\njobs. Many of<br/>\nthem have a job that allows them to play EQ during work. This one girl I<br/>\nknow has a job<br/>\nas tech support at an ISP. She has 2 computers setup there and she can<br/>\nanswer most<br/>\nof the questions w/o needing to stop playing. She logs in something like 15<br/>\nhours of EQ<br/>\nper day. Then there is me =). Lvl 29 wizard, 16 yrs old, goes to school has<br/>\na social life<br/>\nand trying to get a job .. ahwell.. Not all of the high lvls are teens with<br/>\nto much time on<br/>\ntheir hands..<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, now to your question of where to hunt at lvl 12. At lvl 12 I left the<br/>\nisland of Faydwer,<br/>\nwell a bit before lvl 12. I got sick of the area, overcroweded and over<br/>\ncamped. So I moved<br/>\nover to Atonica, if my mem serves me correctly, you should be able to solo<br/>\nkodiaks, the<br/>\nodd wisp and giant scarabs, also darkweed (or is it drake?) snakes. But you<br/>\nneed to be<br/>\nreally carefull with those guys, if your root resists you should start to<br/>\nrun to a zone line<br/>\nor they will posion you which can kill you rather quickly. Also, you should<br/>\nbe able to solo<br/>\nthe odd trantula, but I find that root dosnt like to hold on these guys that<br/>\nwell. Also, you<br/>\nshould be able to solo scarabs. Or, you can try grouping up and go for the<br/>\ndervish camps,<br/>\nor head down into befallen.<br/>\n<br/>\n....hope that can help</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
