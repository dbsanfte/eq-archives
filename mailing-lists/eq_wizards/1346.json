Here is the Quote<br/>\nfrom the website (same as updated manua)...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe various Specialization skills will be implemented such that if a spell<br/>\nis<br/>\ncast in, for example, the abjuration family, the Specialization -<br/>\nAbjuration<br/>\nskill will be checked (if present) and if successful, will decrease the<br/>\namount<br/>\nof mana used to cast the spell. The Specialization skills are as follows:<br/>\nSpecialization - Abjuration, Specialization - Alteration, Specialization -<br/>\nConjuration, Specialization - Divination, and Specialization - Evocation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe part that scares me is the future tense of &quot;will be implemented&quot;.<br/>\nWhen?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMalkin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nZiffnab MageStorm wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Ziffnab MageStorm &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_ziffnab@...\">eq_ziffnab@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Goto the official EQ website and read in the Developer section.
