We&#39;ve got basically 2 rules.\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; 1. Be helpful to other EQ players (rpging, and evil vs good issues aside I really can&#39;t think of any reason to be a prick to anyone lvls 1-7, we were all newbies once, and there&#39;s more coming. Unless they&#39;re complete losers, ummmm Hamblen a 3rd dwarf comes to mind.)\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; 2. No whining. This means no bitching and griping about graphic glitches, unfair monster tactics etc... /petition it, and move on.\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s about it.

This behavior where monsters can attack through solid object is not a glitch.  It is a choice they have made, the code to turn clipping on for monsters is there.  It would be very easy for them to make it so that monsters cannot attack through things, but they have chosen to allow this.  I personally can&#39;t think of any reasons why they would allow this to happen, but I&#39;m sure they have their reasons.\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; Tandayen, Dark Elf Wizard\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt;     -----Original Message-----\r<br/>\n&gt;     From: Ken Lee &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kenlee@...\">kenlee@...</a>&gt;\r<br/>\n&gt;     To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;\r<br/>\n&gt;     Date: Tuesday, April 27, 1999 12:26 PM\r<br/>\n&gt;     Subject: [eq_wizards] Re: BUG/FEEDBACK\r<br/>\n&gt;     \r<br/>\n&gt;     \r<br/>\n&gt;     Err.... not to be a party pooper, but ever seen Jaws?
