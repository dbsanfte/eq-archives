I went <br/>\nto the Goblin Warrior camp in butcherblock with my level 9 hunting partner (I <br/>\nwas level 10 at the time) who, luckily for me, is a cleric.  I was able to bring 1h <br/>\nblunt form 0 to max of 33 in 2 days of playing, then I did the same for my <br/>\npiercing skill.. tho that was at 17 when I started so didn&#39;t take as long.
