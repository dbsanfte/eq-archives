I started an Dwarf Paladin couse i want to be able to have magic, i playd him almost 20 hours and got him up to lv 10.<br/>\nI think that Paladin�s are a great class but when i came back to my Wizard again and evrything was fun again, i got him leveld u from 16 to 19 and now that feeling comes over me again.<br/>\nI  have so hard finding any XP by myself or find a group to get XP in, i have been to unrest but i dont like that place. Either your in a strong group there and you don get much in XP or you are in a group around the same level so you have to zone sometimes with the result it takes ages to regroup and get back to the killing of undeads.<br/>\nI have been Lv 19 so long now i cant take much more of this so i will play my Paladin for a while i think and wait for the feeling for my litle gnome wizard to get back, it always does so i�m not worried about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmmmm that was not what i intended to write in the first place :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWizards are fun to play!!!! <br/>\n<br/>\nAskur Lv 19,5 Wizard of Veeshan<br/>\nAskan Lv 10 Paladin of Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Ursprungligt meddelande-----<br/>\nFr�n: Robert Spelman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:madoc_ab_owain@...\">madoc_ab_owain@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTill: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDatum: den 5 juni 1999 00:38<br/>\n�mne: Re: [eq_wizards] Prenatal Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Robert Spelman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:madoc_ab_owain@...\">madoc_ab_owain@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Re: Message: 3<br/>\n&gt;                  Date: Thu, 3 Jun 1999 14:40:00 +0100<br/>\n&gt;                  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:David.Lynam@...\">David.Lynam@...</a><br/>\n&gt;               Subject: PreNatal Wizard<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well, I&#39;m finally going to break down and seriously play a spellcasting <br/>\n&gt;class.  Of course due to the raw power of the class, as well as the <br/>\n&gt;versatility of teleportation, Wizards are my first choice.  I realize that <br/>\n&gt;people have most likely time and again requested spell lists, but here I am, <br/>\n&gt;brand spanking new to the list.  I was wondering if perhaps some nice soul <br/>\n&gt;out there might be able to send me a complete list.  I&#39;ve checked EQLizer, <br/>\n&gt;EQVault, and EQstratics and none of them have every spell, thanks in advance <br/>\n&gt;everyone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m a 14th level wizard on E&#39;Ci. David, if I may be honest here, I would <br/>\n&gt;like to suggest that if you want to have fun playing a spellcaster, pick <br/>\n&gt;about anything other than Wizard. Enchanters get pets and can make magical <br/>\n&gt;items. If I were to start over and pick a pure mage class, that would be the <br/>\n&gt;one I&#39;d go with.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;*ducks flameage*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;rant mode&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Let me explain - Verant hasn&#39;t implemented specialization skills or the <br/>\n&gt;alternate planes, we have almost nothing for armor or hitpoints, our melee <br/>\n&gt;skills are pathetic and our powers don&#39;t become greater than other classes <br/>\n&gt;until 40-somethingth level. Plus, the single greatest way of leveling up - <br/>\n&gt;killing har red mobs - is unavailable to us, because our spells are often <br/>\n&gt;resisted completely by these creatures. So, instead of grouping with <br/>\n&gt;powerful warriors to beat up on mobs that will actually give EVERYONE in the <br/>\n&gt;group decent experience, we&#39;re relegated to trying to solo weak blues or <br/>\n&gt;fight white and yellow creatures in a group for pitiful experience because <br/>\n&gt;WE CAN&#39;T TOUCH HARD MOBS LIKE EVERY OTHER CLASS CAN!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve watched every group I&#39;ve run with pass me up in level. I&#39;ve watched <br/>\n&gt;characters started while I was at level 12 PASS ME at level 13. It&#39;s not as <br/>\n&gt;though I never play, it&#39;s just that I CANNOT GAIN MORE THAN HALF A BUBBLE <br/>\n&gt;EXP PER HOUR, on average. That&#39;s powergaming, soloing in the Karanas vs. <br/>\n&gt;blue beetles and the occasional white/yellow.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Needless to say, I&#39;m very frustrated in playing this class right now. The <br/>\n&gt;only reason I remain a Wizard is stubbornness. Everyone says it gets better <br/>\n&gt;at higher levels, but the fact of the matter is that we&#39;ll always be a <br/>\n&gt;second-rate class unless Verant fixes specialization, plane travel and <br/>\n&gt;spell-resistances of higher-level mobs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;/rant mode&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Vash, 14th Level Wizardess, Felwithe/North Karana, E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
