I will be happy to teach Dragon and Combine for 6 runes each.  The rest, I will teach for 3 runes or 5 plat each.  I am located on the Tarew Marr server.  I am firm on the Dragon and Combine btw.  I won&#39;t accept money but only runes for those languages.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Talarin Kal&#39;Amon, High Elven Wizard </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
