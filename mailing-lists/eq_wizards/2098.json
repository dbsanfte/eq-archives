I&#39;m not 12, I&#39;m 11th, and I can solo and take:<br/>\n&gt;         Orc Centurions, Lions, Lioness (East Commonlands)<br/>\n&gt;         Sand Scarabs (North Ro)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>At level 12 I soloed Orc Legionnaires. From 12 to 15 I soloed everything<br/>\nin N Ro, including Dervishes, Sand Scarabs, Madmen, Mummies, Zombies.<br/>\nSome of that time was spent in groups, but that was more for the fun of<br/>\nit and not for leveling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have a single piece of woven, and no other fancy equipment.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have 4 pieces of Woven, the skull of Jhen&#39;Tra, 2 +5 mana rings, one<br/>\n+10 mana bracelet, a +3 INT earring (I sold it for 35pp and a +2 AGI<br/>\nearring to a high level guy. It cost me 10pp :) ). I have an RTS but<br/>\nI&#39;ve stopped using it since I got the skull.<br/>\n<br/>\nI now have ~65pp as well. I have never twinked (only GAVE some money to<br/>\none guy once). All this I made on my own, soloing most of the way. I<br/>\nwould say that I soloed about 65~75% of my life, if not more. All the<br/>\nequipment I got, I got by traveling around, haggling, trading and<br/>\nbuying. No high level characters helped me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, YES, it can be done. I consider myself to be a quite successful<br/>\nwizard, though I&#39;ve invested nothing (!!!) in my INT at character<br/>\ncreation. I was a clueless newbie and I distributed the points around,<br/>\nputting a big part in WIS. My INT is still 102.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think most wizards underestimate wisdom, but I think it is the stat<br/>\nthat gets checked for regaining concentration. At level 15 I regain<br/>\nconcentration almost every battle when the mob gets melee with me. I<br/>\nactually Gated when 2 gnolls were hitting on me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is, I think, is experience. Just knowing what to take and what<br/>\nnot to take. Some mobs are very resistant to magic. Some are helpless.<br/>\nSome are very tough in melee (though they con blue) and some are not.<br/>\nIt&#39;s just traveling around, seeing the sights and knowing what you&#39;re<br/>\ndoing.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I found is that groups full of wizards kick unbelievable ass.<br/>\nIt&#39;s amazing what 3 wizards in a group can do. Not even talking about 6.<br/>\nTry it. Have a designated rooter, a back up rooter, and all the rest<br/>\nblast. It&#39;s very fun, very quick and safe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, always get SOW when you can. If you see a shaman in zone, get him<br/>\nto cast SOW on you. It&#39;s amazing how useful this spell is. For instance,<br/>\nif the mob resists the root, you just run away, stop and root again.<br/>\nYou&#39;re OOM? Just run to zone/guards/group.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do agree with the improvements we are asking in the petition, but we<br/>\nare still very good for soloing. Maybe the best. We just have to know<br/>\nwhat we&#39;re doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and about familiars - it doesn&#39;t have to be Conjuration. How about<br/>\ncasting a spell on some low level mob and MAKING him your familiar?<br/>\nThat&#39;s pretty cool, and allows diversity. Someone in Butcherblock will<br/>\nget a skunk. Someone in Freeport will get a rat. we could get<br/>\nspiderlings or stuff like that. They would be used as mana batteries.<br/>\nThe spell to make them familiars could take all our mana, no matter how<br/>\nmuch we have, and store about half or a third of that in the familiar. <br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nQenelin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
