Mine is somewhere like<br/>\n&gt; 45-49 with my own buffs.  With a cleric or bard, I&#39;ve seen it somewhere in<br/>\n&gt; the high 80s.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anybody know a more consistent way to keep this higher?  I wish we had a<br/>\n&gt; personal buff to boost this up more...you&#39;d figure a master of magic would<br/>\n&gt; have more resistance in this area?  :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I got that Thex dagger thingie that boosts SV disease up +50.  That&#39;s nice<br/>\n&gt; but I wish there was something like that for magic resist.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Best thing you can do is whack the king in Sol B (Crown is +20 magic resist)<br/>\nadd that to a glowing black stone (+10) a  Platinum Wolf&#39;s Eye Agate Neckless<br/>\n(+9) a pair of Gold WEA bracers (+7ea) and a pair of Platinum Jacinth Rings<br/>\n(+10ea)  That will give you a total of +73 sv vs Magic, before buffs, but<br/>\nthat will probably sacrifice most of your Intellegence items.  I hope this<br/>\nhelps.  By the way, did you do the Thex dagger quest alone, or with a<br/>\nfriend?  What level do you recommend?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nMalkin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
