She will tell you she is the keeper of the<br/>\nConcordance of Research (which is equivilent to the lexicon, but for<br/>\nresearch).  Give her 2 lightstones (seperate).  One for the Research Runes<br/>\nvol 1 and one for Research Runes vol 2.  These tell you how to research.<br/>\nThen give her a greater lightstone to receive the Concordance of Research.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote, as of this moment (unless they just fixed it) research practice does<br/>\nnot work.
