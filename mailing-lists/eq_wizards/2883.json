Make sure you keep all three skills maxed at each level (P, 1hb,<br/>\n2hb).  Its not hard to do, if you start from the beginning, and you will<br/>\nbe glad you did in the long run.  As for your question, the next logical<br/>\nweapon would be a Giant Snake Fang.  You should be able to obtain one<br/>\nfor 4-5gp.  After that you will be working for a Runed totem staff.<br/>\nThey sell for 10pp on a mature server, but will probably go for much<br/>\nmore on TZ.  Hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHand of the Willow wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; What is the next logical step beyond a cracked staff?
