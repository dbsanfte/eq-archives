It was a flop.  Pretty depressing after spending all that time <br/>\nlearning new languages and getting all the elements to have it fail without <br/>\nevent.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnybody know how to increase skill at Research?  I know training on it at <br/>\nthe guildmaster is capped so is the only way to improve it only by trying <br/>\nover and over again?  Too bad I can&#39;t just throw all my 70+ training points <br/>\ninto it...wonder why I&#39;ve been saving it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Well, I made level 16 last night so I decided to try research for the<br/>\n&gt;first time.  I had been collecting runes for a while, so I had a &gt;sizable<br/>\n&gt;collection in the bank.  Just thought I would share the results.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Project Lightning - I had enough runes to attempt this spell twice.  &gt;The<br/>\n&gt;first attempt failed, the second one succeeded!  My first spell!  Ok, &gt;1<br/>\n&gt;out of 2 is not bad.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
