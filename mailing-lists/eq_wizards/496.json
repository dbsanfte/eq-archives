What is weird is that I met a NPC on the third floor of the Erudin Library, who for 20 gold pieces will sell you a piece of parchment that offers some script about animating a scarecrow.  This is supposed to be from an original copy of some of Morbius&#39;s collection(I think thats him, the ultimate necromancer we read about in Norraths history books).  I am not sure where this parchment was trying to lead me, since I am still a lower leveled Wizard, and do not have much knowledge of Norrath yet.  Has anyone else gotten this piece of parchment?  Does anyone know about this quest?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI just thought anout it when someone was talking about killing scarecrows at some garden place.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAppreciate any info.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDason Falth\r<br/>\nErudite Wizard Lvl 6</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
