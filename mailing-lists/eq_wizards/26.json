So to respect the rights of those<br/>\npeople, if you should send in anything that is or may be considered a Spoiler<br/>\nplease add **Spoiler** to the subject so that anyone<br/>\nwho doesn&#39;t want to read information on Spoilers can just delete the mail. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s pretty much it. Have fun and let me know if there is anything i can do<br/>\nto help you enjoy your stay more in this community.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 01:34 PM 4/16/99 -0400, you wrote: <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello all.

I have been spending time around the Steamfont =<br/>\n&gt; Mino cave with my guild, though we recently went exploring a bit in =<br/>\n&gt; Dagnot&#39;s Cauldron, which is intimidating to say the least.  Really neat =<br/>\n&gt; looking though.  We also spend time in Butcherblock and Lesser Faydark =<br/>\n&gt; occationally as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I do have a question in case someone here knows.
