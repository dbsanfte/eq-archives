You had to play and do what was<br/>\nnecessary to protect yourself.  In that respect, there would be an unfair<br/>\nadvantage if someone had high level equipment and were the same level as<br/>\nyou, you would not be able to defend yourself the same as if you were on<br/>\neven ground item-wise.  Here it doesn&#39;t matter who wears what, unless you<br/>\nare +pvp really.  Those people are aware they will have a rough road ahead<br/>\nand they choose to be +pvp because they like that challenge.  Personally, I<br/>\nwas terribly tired of losing all my money and regeants, armor in UO that I<br/>\nhad on me to go to a dungeon, only to have some pack of brats hiding and<br/>\nnuke me to kingdom come and laugh while they take all my possessions that I<br/>\nworked very hard for.  I also counseled in UO for about 6 months and I<br/>\nhonestly did not ever hear anyone complain one time about someone having<br/>\nspecial items there.  I see it all the time here.<br/>\nWhat would happen if I saw a flowing black robe for sale, or it was being<br/>\nauctioned and I actually had enough money to purchase it.. is this wrong if<br/>\nmy level doesn&#39;t allow for me to have ventured into the dungeon to get it<br/>\nmyself...what if I get the majority of damage in, while killing Najena and I<br/>\nam lower level than is thought to be necessary to get this item...OR, what<br/>\nif it is simply my turn to loot in a group atmosphere even if I am lower<br/>\nthan the rest of my group by 5 or 6 levels?  Is this wrong?  There are a<br/>\nmultitude of ways to have acquired many different items in the game.  It<br/>\nseems to me, that 99% of the uproar on this topic is due directly to<br/>\njealousy on the part of the people who are complaining.  Sure I would like<br/>\ncertain items, but I don&#39;t think there is anything in the game other than<br/>\nlevel 49 spells that will give me a huge advantage over anyone else, and I<br/>\nwon&#39;t be to that point for a very long time and I can&#39;t use those no matter<br/>\nwhat right now.<br/>\nThe use of 3rd party programs should not be allowed, but sharing is not a<br/>\nbad thing...everyone&#39;s parents taught them sharing was good ( at least I<br/>\nhope they all did).  I still think it is in the majority of cases, just not<br/>\nnecessarily on the +pvp server.  I think that is the one place this issue<br/>\nshould be monitored if it is at all.  That is where the disparity will be<br/>\nnoted if anywhere.<br/>\nTopic is pretty well closed for me, having said that.  &#39;Nuff said and thanks<br/>\nfor allowing my voice to be heard as well.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
