Those who are can just ignore the &quot;improvement&quot; threads. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to discuss quests, grouping, or events...then start a thread<br/>\nhere on that! Rather than complaining about the complainers (hehe). I<br/>\nwould be more than willing to discuss anything that is brought up here.<br/>\nI just don&#39;t think we should limit the mailing list because several<br/>\npeople aren&#39;t interested in a certain thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nCroesus Illuminatus (Xegony)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; George Holt wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hello... I have subscribed to this list for about 2 months now... and<br/>\n&gt; I think it&#39;s about time someone said something.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am tired of wizards using this list for griping about class<br/>\n&gt; problems. I know that it is not uncommon. The eq_bards list does it as<br/>\n&gt; well... But isn&#39;t it time that we said... ok enough... I&#39;m tired of<br/>\n&gt; emails that just flame verant. It&#39;s getting to the point where even<br/>\n&gt; the emails that try to be constructive still irritate me...<br/>\n&gt; This list should be used for constructive purposes... such as helping<br/>\n&gt; newbies... verification of quests... or maybe even for grouping<br/>\n&gt; together to play online.. or for online roleplaying events... This was<br/>\n&gt; not meant as a &quot;lets flame verant&quot; forum. Once this may have been<br/>\n&gt; appropriate to talk about here... but it is becoming a constant bother<br/>\n&gt; to those who subscribed to this list for game information.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If it comes down to it ... I think it would be apropriate to start a<br/>\n&gt; new onelist. Maybe you could call it EQ_petitions but this list is<br/>\n&gt; getting to bogged down.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Feel free to reply and voice your opinion.... extra points for<br/>\n&gt; agreeing with me.... =)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; George Holt<br/>\n&gt; A Wizard of Tal`Kor<br/>\n&gt; Fennin Ro </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
