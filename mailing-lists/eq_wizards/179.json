He is an half elf, so i agree they have more agility then us. But i<br/>\nalready make some test and it seems that +8 in agility only give 1 in ac (i<br/>\ntried with two rings +4 agility). Our dex are the same and for the armor he<br/>\nonly get 5 ac more then me. My current armor class (without any spel) is<br/>\n177. Not bad, not good i agree :). So i come to the fact : what is the<br/>\nmaximum defense skill for a wizzard ??? Can you gain offense (and defense)<br/>\nskill vs green creatures ? I know of a rules telling that a wizzard can have<br/>\n3+ (level *3) in his attack skill (piercing for example) but i know that i<br/>\nam at 48 at defense so this rule dones&#39;t seem to apply for offense and<br/>\ndefense (only for piercing blunt ect). So someone can tell me more about<br/>\nthis rule or about ac in general (for wizzard?). And last question any good<br/>\nidea where i can find good armor for a wizzard ? (actually the best armor i<br/>\nget is bear boot 5ac).<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nyakos<br/>\nlevel 12 wizzad<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nRiviere St�phane - Siemens Business Services <br/>\nB-5020 Namur (Belgium) - Rue de N�verl�e, 11<br/>\nTel.: +32-81-554-334 Fax: +32 (0)81 568 193\t<br/>\nMicrosoft System Engineer<br/>\nEmail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stephane.riviere@...\">stephane.riviere@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
