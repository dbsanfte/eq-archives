It can be<br/>\nfound in Freeport, Qeynos, and Ak&#39;Anon.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 20th lvl, you get Force Shock, which does 171 dmg.  The only thing about<br/>\nthis spell, is that is gets resisted alot.  I&#39;m 22nd lvl now and have found<br/>\nit easier to use this spell, but at 20th, I hardly ever used it because it<br/>\nwas so unpredictable on whether it would be resisted or not.  I used Flame<br/>\nShock instead which did 110 dmg by this time.  Plus its very mana efficent.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, you&#39;ve probably seen some of my posts where I defend the wizard class,<br/>\nbut here is where I have to disagree with 989.  At lvl 24 you get another DD<br/>\nspell.  It only does 168 dmg.  Granted, it is hardly ever resisted, like<br/>\nForce Shock was, but come on, at least they could have upped the dmg to over<br/>\n200.  This has been my only true gripe with the wizard class.  At lvl 29,<br/>\nyou get a DD spell which does 270, at least that&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard,<br/>\nobviously at 22nd, I can&#39;t confirm that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, although I was a little upset at the lack of power spells at 24th, 168<br/>\ndmg is still nothing to sneeze at, especially when you don&#39;t have to worry<br/>\nabout it being resisted.  Plus, it is also very mana efficient.<br/>\nHope that helps ya out ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nTalarin Kal&#39;Amon, High Elven Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Mata &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mata_eq@...\">mata_eq@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, May 14, 1999 8:18 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_wizards] Ice Comet<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Mata&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mata_eq@...\">mata_eq@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well I have a question . . . what kind of dmg do we do at 20th?

Where can I find Shock of Flame?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; Mata -High Elf Wizard 14th circle  (Eci) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
