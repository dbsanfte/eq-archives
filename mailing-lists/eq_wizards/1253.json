I still frequently flip to another camera angle to see myself cast the spells.<br/>\nWhat is also very cool-looking is casting Firebolts from a high place.  You can actually see the bolt fly and curve down and slam into the victim.  I always do this, also because the high position is safer (avoid melee combat).<br/>\nAnyway, I second the motion for more spell animations.<br/>\n<br/>\nAznyin<br/>\nLevel 15 Wizard<br/>\nChivalric Order of Norrath<br/>\nCurrent Location: Rivervale [Solusek Ro]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
