I hate to read in a necro list that they kill SAND GIANTS<br/>\nwich is 35+ monster with a group of 5 and 6 necros 18 and 19 lv !!<br/>\nMagicians say that they do same with griffon in EC and are planing on it.<br/>\nWhy we cant do it? becouse all ours spells are resisted hmmm ! I think that<br/>\nverant must put similar hard block on other magic users. Necro is never<br/>\nresisted on his life tap spell!<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 14.04 26/05/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: mstokes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mstokes@...\">mstokes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; This works very well.

I believe the level of <br/>\n&gt;this<br/>\n&gt;cap is 6 levels above the caster.  I think its great to stick together on a<br/>\n&gt;petition, and I feel that this is one issue that needs to be addressed.  <br/>\n&gt;Here are<br/>\n&gt;my two prposed solutions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1) Raise the cap to 9+ levels of the caster<br/>\n&gt;2) make the cap 6+ levels of the highest player in the group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Cheers<br/>\n&gt;Malkin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;With more than 17 million e-mails exchanged daily...<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;...ONElist is THE place where the world talks! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
