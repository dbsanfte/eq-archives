As most of you know, the lvl 20 teleports are all designed to be<br/>\nfairly safe and highly visible (those huge sets of four arched pillars<br/>\nlocated in Faydark, North Karanas, and Tox Forest).  Mobs usually won&#39;t go<br/>\ninto the teleport area unless pulled.  An exception to this would be the N<br/>\nKaranas teleport, where a guard occasionally marches through (which could<br/>\ncause problems depending on your Qeynos Gard faction).  The lvl 24 teles are<br/>\ndifferent.  So you know what to look for if you stumble across one . . .<br/>\nThey are stubby, cropped off pyramids, a little taller than a tall player,<br/>\nwith four knee high arched pillars at the corners.  They give off hums when<br/>\nyou are near/on them.  Their rough locations are as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  The Commonlands teleport:  Drops you in West Commonlands, North West of<br/>\nBefallen a bit.  Fairly useful teleport if you want to visit that dungeon,<br/>\netc. (which will be low for your level when you get the teleport; but, hey,<br/>\nsome of us get our gossamer robes late).  Doesn&#39;t appear to be too<br/>\ndangerous.  There are some rough wandering mobs in W Commons though, so you<br/>\nmay want to invis after you get there.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  The Ro Teleport:  Ah, having a teleport near Freeport (in W Commons)<br/>\nisn&#39;t enough you say?  Well, you have a choice apparently.  In North Ro<br/>\nthere is another teleport pillar a fair distance south from Freeport.  This<br/>\nteleport isn&#39;t exactly safe as low level players seem to love to pull<br/>\nmummies and such to the teleport to fight there.  Why?  I dunno.  Shouldn&#39;t<br/>\nbe a problem unless you teleport there on low mana.  One wonders why they<br/>\ndidn&#39;t put this one in South Ro to space the teleports better.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  The West teleport.  Carrying on the pattern of high redundancy, Verant<br/>\nput another one of these wonderful teleports in W Karanas (which, of course,<br/>\nborders N Karanas which has a &quot;safe&quot; teleport).  Now since W Karanas is<br/>\nprobably the longest East to West land zone in the game, it would make sense<br/>\nto put a tele here, right?  Say on the West border, near Qeynos hills,<br/>\nright?  We&#39;ve all gotten tired of the long runs from N Karanas to, say,<br/>\nQeynos by now.  Naturally, therefore, Verant put the teleport on the *East*<br/>\nand not the *West* side of the zone where it might have actually been<br/>\nuseful.  Depending on your zone times, the N Karans and W Karanas teleports<br/>\nare only about a minute apart.  You may want to save a bit of money here<br/>\nwhen buying your lvl 24 spells if you need the cash.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Cazic Thule.  Last night I had a chance to use this spell, for reasons<br/>\ntoo contorted to go into here.  I&#39;d been warned it was dangerous, but what<br/>\nthe heck?  We only live about a thousand times.  The gate drops you inside<br/>\nCazic Thule, into a set of caverns.  When you teleport in, I highly suggest<br/>\nyou go invis immediately, and don&#39;t move until you are sure it will hold.<br/>\nAt level 26, there are a few lizardmen around that con blue.  I immediately<br/>\nset off in search of my party (loc written down ahead of time) and proceeded<br/>\nto get thoroughly lost.  My invis failed 4 times before I finally gave up<br/>\nand gated out.  Is there anyone out there who knows how to navigate from<br/>\nthis gate to the Feerrott zone, or some other location of general relevance?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, haven&#39;t tried the Nek gate yet, but will give it a go tonight.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nheard that it is generally safe for good races, but we shall see.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do want to put in a gripe though.  Why not move the West teleport over<br/>\ncloser to Qeynos, or put one in near Halas or Everfrost?  And how about<br/>\nmoving the Ro gate to South Ro?  It is almost insulting to buy redundant<br/>\nteleport spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlyphin E&#39;mondredon<br/>\nThe Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
