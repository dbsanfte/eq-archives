I&#39;d say 16 and above it<br/>\nbecomes increasingly difficult whereas you can only solo 1 blue<br/>\ncreature. Theres just not enough mana to do more. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy can&#39;t we get more mana? I&#39;m insane for thinking that? :P Maybe,<br/>\nmaybe. I do know that wizard class is entirely dependent on mana to<br/>\nsurvive, where all the other classes have some non-mana way of dealing<br/>\nwith things. You&#39;d think, then, that we as a class would discover a way<br/>\nto get more mana while our colleagues are focusing on how to get<br/>\notherworldy beings to follow their orders.<br/>\n<br/>\nCroesus Illuminatus (Xegony)<br/>\n<br/>\nSuperFreak wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: SuperFreak &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:supermario@...\">supermario@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Heyas, I got no beef with you, and yes, I think that if you keep up thinking<br/>\n&gt; that a wizard is a crappy class, and want to change it to your needs, thats<br/>\n&gt; never gonna happen, so why dont u stay on topic first off. The topic for this<br/>\n&gt; list wasnt &quot;Discuss how a wizard can be made better&quot; so over all, you flamed<br/>\n&gt; me with a dumb response that made jack for sense.<br/>\n&gt; I also don&#39;t see why your freakin out so bad, I mean, gosh, I personally<br/>\n&gt; understand how the wizards work in all games, they ARE NOT supposed to be the<br/>\n&gt; masters of melee, or other magic kinds, they are supposed to be able to Damage<br/>\n&gt; the target very fast, thats EXACTLY what they do! If you think a wizard needs<br/>\n&gt; to be able to get more mana or crap, your insane, I can kill 4-6 blues in a<br/>\n&gt; row without medding(at lvl 9), and I can take on 3 blues at a time, and I can<br/>\n&gt; do 1 even! If you dont got what it takes to be a wizard, then just go play a<br/>\n&gt; Magician so you can summon, go play your trix, wannabee.<br/>\n&gt; -Malvos<br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip of Crap someone with problems said&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
