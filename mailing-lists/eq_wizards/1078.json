I wanna give you full credit, put you under our Afilliates section for your e-mail and all that stuff, but I really think you did a sweet job and other people should know about your hard work, who knows, we&#39;re gonna be asking for people to tell us if they can<br/>\nteach others in languages, we&#39;re gonna have a section on that, so you may get to learn Old Erudin :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sdunn@...\">sdunn@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sdunn@...\">sdunn@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Watch out, I&#39;m not kidding that a big spoiler is coming up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok, to make a new spell, you just need the book, and the proper runes.  No quills, no paper, just the lexicon and runes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The two spells I have made so far are Project Lightning and Pillar of Fire.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To make Project lightning you use the runes of Periphery and Fulgeration.  For Pillar of Fire you need Proximity and Nagafen.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can make another of both of these.  Tell me if you are interested in buying one of these two spells, or the unbuyable Project Lightning.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You also need books for other spells, the spells these books contain are:<br/>\n&gt; Wizards Cannon:<br/>\n&gt; Identify, Project Lightning, Pillar of fire<br/>\n&gt; Doctrine of Wizardry:<br/>\n&gt; Enstill, Fire Spiral of Al&#39;Kabor, Cast Force, Column of Lightning, Tox Portal, Shock spiral of Al&#39;Kabor, Energy Storm<br/>\n&gt; Ipsors Enlightenment III:<br/>\n&gt; Nullify Magic, Circle of Force, Lava Storm, Thunderclab, Immobilize, Common Portal, Frost Spiral fo Al&#39;Kabor<br/>\n&gt; Ipsors Enlightenment IV:<br/>\n&gt; Gravity Flux, Wrath of Al&#39;kabor, Ice Commet, Super Nova, Paralizing Earth<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As you can see the spells you can research vary from level 16 all the way to the ungodly 1100 damage ice commet at level 49.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sure there are other books, but I havn&#39;t found them.  If you come across them, let me know!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; These spells were read off with below average in old Erudian.  I&#39;d really love it if someone on the Rathe who has excellent would train me in it.  I&#39;ll pay 20pp for the honor.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know what paralizing earth is, my guess is that its along the root line of spells.  I guess you *have* to research Ice Commet, Super Nova, etc or buy them from a wizard who made them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You didn&#39;t believe me when I said this was a massive spoiler did you?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One last note, I am almost certain that there are more spells you can research.  I have a rune that starts with a &quot;V&quot;, forget the name of it at this instant.  I already translated all the components required to make these spells from these book, and none of them had this rune as a component.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Fastus<br/>\n&gt; 21st level Wizard<br/>\n&gt; The Rathe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; What&#39;s &quot;Grow to Give&quot;?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s a new incentive program at ONElist.
