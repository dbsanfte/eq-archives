This really bugs me. i see no purpose whatsoever in<br/>\n&gt; myself doing a mob 1000 damage in 4 shots vs a magiciant doing it in<br/>\n&gt; 5.With both of us having used the same mana spent. That is suppose to be<br/>\n&gt; a big asset??<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think the point is that wizards can do a 1000 HP&#39;s in damage about 3 times<br/>\nas fast as a magician.  Go to stratistics and read the casting times on some<br/>\nof their Higher level spells.  Some cast 20% slower than Gate, and we all<br/>\nknow how well gate works in combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I have compiled all of the spell lists from the various sites into a<br/>\nMS-Excel Spreadsheet.  It is large so I don&#39;t want to post it on a mailing<br/>\nlist, but I will if there is enough positive feedback.  Perhaps if I post it<br/>\nonce everyone can fill in the gaps, Email it directly back to me, and I&#39;ll<br/>\npost it a second time after all the feedback is entered.  We can then add it<br/>\nto the tome/faq that is being worked on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nONElist members are using Shared Files in great ways!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nAre you?
