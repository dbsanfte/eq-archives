Verant has decided to allow other classes to deal","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2086560409\">I read a lot about the problems with wizards which made me look into the<br/>\nproblems that other classes have.<br/>\n<br/>\nVerant has decided to allow other classes to deal almost the same amount of<br/>\ndamage as we do, this is obvious. (But that Magician 950 damage spell does<br/>\nnot exist, everyone does in the 500 mark at level 50 with ours doing 625,<br/>\nIce Comet is an enormous feat to obtain; its difficulty to get is equal to<br/>\nits damage of 1100. So be prepared to not have it for quite awhile after 50)<br/>\nThough they stated that wizards are the biggest damage dealers they actually<br/>\ntook a different angle.<br/>\nOur damage spells have THE BEST mana efficiency in the game PERIOD. So we<br/>\naren&#39;t the biggest damage dealers, just the most productive damage dealers<br/>\nand now those spells are quicker... enjoy that. This does result in bigger<br/>\ndamage because we would have an extra spell or two when compared to other<br/>\nclasses.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve talked to many high levels and they are worried about the resistance<br/>\nthat our spells have, I just read a complaint about Lady Vox, but know that<br/>\nVerant is still working on Lady Vox (apparently she is bugged somewhat).<br/>\nAs far as resistance go, I am undecided on my standpoint. Part of me wants<br/>\nthe resistance system changed to a system that allows more 25%,50%, etc.<br/>\ndamage than full resistances. (This comes from the fact that we are resisted<br/>\nlike everyone else, but unlike everyone else, when our damage spells are<br/>\nresisted, we have nothing else to do to help the group.) I group with<br/>\nfriends a lot but when I don&#39;t group with friends and get resisted enough I<br/>\nget kicked out of the group, very disappointing. The other side of me says,<br/>\n&quot;Deal with it.&quot; Play it out and just have fun. If this mailing list is going<br/>\nto attempt to get something changed, this is where it is. Look at it from<br/>\nthe balance and programming angle.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll other classes have their ups and downs too.<br/>\nI read many class &lt;x&gt; can do more damage than we can in situation &lt;y&gt;. But<br/>\nif you looked into these raves like I have you will find that the statement<br/>\nis true, but class &lt;x&gt; cannot maintain the punishment that we can over a<br/>\nperiod of time measured by multiple battles, not one. And five levels later<br/>\nthis situation is no longer valid either.<br/>\nI was actually believing all these raves that Druids rule and stuff like<br/>\nthat until I looked into it. How long do you think Verant will allow kiting<br/>\nto continue? Oh, and, If you can get yourself a pair of JBoots you can kite<br/>\nmultiple reds at one time! Using those &quot;worthless&quot; AE spells. (By the way:<br/>\nalthough dungeons only make up 10% of the total zones, they make up over 50%<br/>\nof the high level goodies that are throughout Norrath, can you guess whose<br/>\nhas a bunch of spells that don&#39;t work in dungeons?) *Little Tip* Only duel<br/>\nDruids in dungeons, hehe. I hope this shows you that every class had pros<br/>\nand cons, and every class has a level area that is very strong/weak.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to assure you mid-teen level guys that it does get better later on.<br/>\nNow I am not saying that resistance are less and other classes are left in<br/>\nthe dust. I am just saying that spells do much more damage for much less<br/>\nmana. After the whole level 20-23 episode where you use you level 16-19<br/>\nspells you will use your new spells just like you did before.<br/>\nVerant made wizards HARD at lower levels to make up for a much easier time<br/>\nat level 50+. Notice the &#39;+&#39;. Major recommendation for wizards, buy that<br/>\nexpansion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never had a problem with my playing style and my class, except for<br/>\nthe multiple resistances. I am leveling with everyone else that I am<br/>\nconstant contact with so there is not much of a problem. Start looking into<br/>\nstrategy instead of boom, boom, boom. From all that I seen Wizards are the<br/>\nmost strategic class to play, if you don&#39;t like strategy and really aren&#39;t<br/>\ninto role-playing a wizard, you will have a good amount of frustration.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has been my 2 cents in the matter I will not continue &quot;Wizards suck<br/>\n&lt;insert class here&gt;s rule!&quot; threads.<br/>\n<br/>\nTelor Strifesage of Karana<br/>\nPS. IF you guys want to see some nice Wizards strategies, just say so. I<br/>\nwill place another long post with strategies.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
