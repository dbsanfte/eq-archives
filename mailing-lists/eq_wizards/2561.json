We deal<br/>\ndamage fast so fast that no other class can competete with us in how much<br/>\ndamage we can do in same amount of time.<br/>\nThis is useful when two groups contest a same monster a group with a wizard<br/>\nwill get it ehehe easy to see around besouse of so called kill stealing.<br/>\nBut as masters of mana eficents are Necros they with new patch do damage<br/>\ntwice as fast as before !! And they do much more damage then wizard for<br/>\nsame amount of mana.<br/>\nI think that this is primary reason of fastering our spells in upkoming<br/>\npatch to compensate a faster damage dealing by necros.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis comes from reply thet i got from a Verant about similar question.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMagicians get their damage spells every other level when a wizard get them<br/>\nevery level and they are slower in casting them then wizards are. Wizards<br/>\nget many more diferent Direct damage spells class on every turn. Like a<br/>\nArea efect AE, personal PAE, Bolts ect<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 03.20 27/06/99 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: MAD Iguana &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wargod@...\">wargod@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I know that the purpose of the wizard class is to do heavy damage quickly.<br/>\n&gt;A friend of mine was telling me that mages do almost the same damage plus<br/>\n&gt;they have a pet to fight for them.  He does close dmg to me now at lvl 20.<br/>\n&gt;He says at lvl 49 mages do lava bolt which does 950 whereas ice comet does<br/>\n&gt;1100.  That is almost the same damage as the wizard.  So it seems to me<br/>\n&gt;that there isn&#39;t much of a use to be a wizard if you can be a mage and do<br/>\n&gt;almost the same amount of direct damage plus you have a pet.  So anyone<br/>\n&gt;tell me something good about the wiz class to make it worth playing them to<br/>\n&gt;high levels?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Silverion Dragonirder<br/>\n<br/>\nHigh elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\nFenin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\nmoderator mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
