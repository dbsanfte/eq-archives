Through much discussion and debate, we have agreed to send you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;this feedback concerning improvements to the wizard. We would like to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;thank you in advance for your careful consideration of these<br/>\n&gt; &gt;modifications.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;1) Spells are 100% resisted by mobs 6+ levels above the caster. In large<br/>\n&gt; &gt;groups hunting big prey this level cap turns a wizard from the main<br/>\n&gt; &gt;dealer of damage to a useless member in the group. Our suggestion is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that either the cap be raised to 6+ levels of the highest member in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;group, or the cap be raised to 8+ levels higher than the caster.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;2) Spells that both stun and damage targets are often resisted by mobs<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that /con green and blue. If this is the result of the stun effect, we<br/>\n&gt; &gt;would like one spell without this effect at the same level.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;3) Many spell suggestions have crossed this list. Here is one that we<br/>\n&gt; &gt;all feel would be a great addition.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Tap Affinity - Teleport targeted group member to their own bind spot<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;4) O&#39;Kiels Radiation seems that it would be the beginning of a great<br/>\n&gt; &gt;line of spells. Why should it end there? Cold and Magic based<br/>\n&gt; &gt;buffs/shields would be a very welcome addition.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;5) Wizards seem to be very neglected when it comes to carrying or<br/>\n&gt; &gt;wearing items that enhance our appearance. Also, many completely<br/>\n&gt; &gt;different spells have the same visual effects.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;We would like to thank you again for your time. Any type of feedback<br/>\n&gt; &gt;would be greatly appriciated.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sincerely,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The Wizards of Norrath<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;With more than 17 million e-mails exchanged daily...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;...ONElist is THE place where the world talks!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Silverion<br/>\n&gt; High elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\n&gt; Fenin Ro<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; moderator mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; How many communities do you think join ONElist each day?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; More than 1,000!
