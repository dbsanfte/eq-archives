If you get in a group that is unfamiliar <br/>\nwith Wizards, they sometimes panic when you hold back on spells.  But this <br/>\nis what you HAVE to do... better to stay alive to help out then to die and <br/>\nrisk the possibility of having the whole group die.  Just let them know in <br/>\nadvance about your strategy.<br/>\nIt&#39;s gotten to the point now in my group that they all know exactly when I <br/>\nneed to cast...the tanks have no problem taking some hits for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nHey, I spent some time in Beholders for the first time yesterday killing <br/>\nevil eyes!  If you haven&#39;t tried it (level 16-19) you&#39;ll love it.  Basically <br/>\nno melee combat for the eyeballs...just a lot of spellslinging.  Nice change <br/>\nof pace!  Only thing to watch out for is when they charm your tank..so have <br/>\nroot ready.  If you blast away fast enough, you can interrupt their spells.  <br/>\nXp came real fast there!  (I finally made 20! whoohooo!  Now I need a last <br/>\nname like LimDul the Loudmouth or something ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, about a previous post about how 30+ creatures con: yeah, it&#39;s not a <br/>\nscience.  Blue creatures will become increasingly hard to solo, for tanks or <br/>\ncasters alike...based primarily in their relation to your level rather then <br/>\ntheir ability to kick your @$$. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI partnered up with a Druid in Beholders.  At 22, his most efficient spell <br/>\nonly did 96.  At 19, my most efficient shock spell did 108.  He was a nice <br/>\ncomplement to my spells because of his SOWs.  Druids are cool...but I&#39;d <br/>\npersonally hate to not be able to kill animals. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n20 Wiz Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Message: 9<br/>\n </span></blockquote>   Date: Fri, 11 Jun 1999 14:03:02 -0400<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   From: &quot;Brent Phillips&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Brent-Phillips@...\">Brent-Phillips@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Subject: Re: General new observations from a level 13 wiz<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Well as for the creatures coming after you, you have to learn to cast the<br/>\n&gt;spells in moderation.

Or is that spell an outdoor spell only?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
