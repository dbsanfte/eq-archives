The first was a Blue looking robe with fancy trim like the black robe has. Anyone know where to get that and the stats on it? Second I saw a char with a robe that looked like it was chain mail. I am not sure if this char was a Wizard(was playing anon and would not talk to me when I asked about the robe). Anyone know what that was and where it is found?<br/>\nThanks</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
