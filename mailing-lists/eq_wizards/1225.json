Your text box will then switch to your<br/>\nlanguage box and allow you to switch what language you are speaking in.  You<br/>\nmust have a rating of Excellent in any given language to train someone else<br/>\nto excellent.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the languages of Combine, Dragon and a few otheres, no one starts<br/>\nout knowing them fluently.  A couple other ppl here have already mentioned<br/>\nhow to become fluent in them, so I won&#39;t get into that now, but it does take<br/>\na lot of time to learn.
