The first zone entrance you pass is where you want to be, it will take<br/>\nyou into Steamfont Mountains. From there follow the road until it branches<br/>\nleft and right(there will be a gnomish watchman at the crossroads). Follow<br/>\nthe right branch straight into the city and from there you can probably ask<br/>\ndirections to the library.<br/>\n�<br/>\nYours,<br/>\n�<br/>\n~Aereuss Ravins of Tarew Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
