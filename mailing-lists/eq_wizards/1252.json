It makes the game for me.  If <br/>\nyou recall ( or maybe not if you didn&#39;t play ) but UO didn&#39;t have anything <br/>\nexciting except some dorky noise and when you failed at your spell casting <br/>\nit sounded like your guts were backfiring on you.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 02:44 PM 5/12/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Marziani, Michael D.&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Michael.Marziani@...\">Michael.Marziani@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well everyone knows that ice comet does 1100 damage or so its been said.<br/>\n&gt;But what is the most powerful DD spell before ice comet?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And is it only me are there certain spells (3rd circle column of frost comes<br/>\n&gt;to mind) that when you cast them there is NO animation for?  When I was a<br/>\n&gt;ranger I noticed this with invoke lightning as well.  You would cast and see<br/>\n&gt;the monsters get hit for damage yet no animation.  Pretty sucky if you ask<br/>\n&gt;me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So far the coolest animation I think we have on any spell throught the 3rd<br/>\n&gt;circle is the measly little 1st circle spell, numbing cold.  The ring of<br/>\n&gt;frost around the opponents slowly rising up into the air is way cool.  Our<br/>\n&gt;rain spells look incredibly gay.  Shock of Lightning looks like a million<br/>\n&gt;other spells including shock of blades (magician) and all the cleric spells<br/>\n&gt;(strike, furor, smite).  I am big time in favor of seeing more unique<br/>\n&gt;animations for spells.  Some might just call it eye candy and who cares, but<br/>\n&gt;I think it add a lot to the RP aspects.  Unique looks for spells is what<br/>\n&gt;makes them what they are, and what gives the caster that mysterious and<br/>\n&gt;powerful air.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Comments?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Solric<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
