What lvl did<br/>\nyou guys duel at and was it in an open area?  Let me give an example of what<br/>\na druid can do to whip a wiz...  At level 29, a druid has a DD for 170<br/>\ndamage and a heal for 270hps.  A wiz reliable DD does 237dmg.  A typical<br/>\nstrategy druids would use would go something like this:  DOT which casts<br/>\nvery fast, then one DD for 170dmg.  Spirit of Cheetah which casts faster<br/>\nthan even our shadow step series and allows them to run at 6x the speed of<br/>\nnormal run.  In this time the wiz has gotten off 2 big DD for 474 total dmg,<br/>\nor the wiz has used his stun and one DD for only 237dmg.  The stun takes a<br/>\nwhile to recycle so you cant chain cast it.  The druid is now out of casting<br/>\nrange because Spirit of Cheetah is so fast.  He heals twice and is at full<br/>\nhealth again.  The wiz is down 350hps out of a total of just over 500.  Even<br/>\nwhen the stun recycles the druid need only 1 maybe 2 casts to take you out.<br/>\nHe DOT again and DD once for another 170 while you got another 2 casts off<br/>\nhurting him bad, but all he needs to do now is run away till the DOT kills<br/>\nyou and you lose exp because of it...<br/>\n<br/>\nNow there are a couple places within the sequence where a wiz can make<br/>\nreally mess up a druid&#39;s strategy, but most wizzies ive seen use an<br/>\nincorrect sequence of casts and get whipped.  Also there are a few tricks<br/>\nthat can be done =) but I don&#39;t want to give those away just yet...<br/>\n<br/>\nEuros Arcane<br/>\nRallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Tom Bratina [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gbratina@...\">gbratina@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, July 02, 1999 12:07 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_wizards] Dueling Tip<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Tom Bratina&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gbratina@...\">gbratina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\ngot my butt kicked by a necro at 24.  his pet was on me, and by the time i<br/>\nrooted it, i was at less than half health and dropping fast (because of the<br/>\ndots).  got off one frost shock that looked like it went for full dmg, but<br/>\ndied shortly after.  if u can catch a necro without a pet, or with a pet<br/>\nthat is 2+ lvls below u, then a necro would probably be pretty easy to mop<br/>\nup....  although with verant increasing the necro&#39;s dot dmg and making them<br/>\nlast shorter in duration, it makes them a more viable PvP class, even<br/>\nwithout their pet.<br/>\n<br/>\non the other hand, i havent had any problems with druids.  killed one just<br/>\nthe other day when i was at three quarters health and he was full.  stun<br/>\nworked like a charm :)<br/>\n<br/>\nthe only problem i have with the &quot;skill&quot; factor in EQ is the simple fact<br/>\nthat most of the fights i get into are &quot;impromptu&quot; and start with me having<br/>\nless than full health and less than full mana, no resistances cast, no<br/>\nleatherskin.  i dont ever complain or bitch and moan about that kind of<br/>\nstuff, as that is the nature of the PvP server, but if i were able to fully<br/>\nprepare for a fight (like a duel or just pure PK/hunting), then i would have<br/>\nmy leatherskin on, along with my resistance stuff on, and of course, my good<br/>\nstuff bagged...  and it actually might start to get fun :)<br/>\n<br/>\njust got attacked yesterday morning by a druid after i finished killing the<br/>\ndrow in paw.  he conned red and i only had about 30% mana when he attacked.<br/>\nnot much of a fight, as i immediatly had to gate (was close, but gated<br/>\nsuccessfully).  that&#39;s what i&#39;m seeing lately on the PvP server and it sure<br/>\nis disappointing :(<br/>\n<br/>\nSinlaru Ce`alen<br/>\nRallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: James Guintu &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:james@...\">james@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Friday, July 02, 1999 1:36 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_wizards] Dueling Tip<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;James Guintu&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:james@...\">james@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The other big damage spells(Force Shock etc...) that disrupt are resisted<br/>\n&gt;too often in PvP to be reliable.

I have seen a few duels where a well played melee<br/>\n&gt;class destroys the caster.  A monk with JBoots is a hard fight for a caster<br/>\n&gt;in an enclosed area...
