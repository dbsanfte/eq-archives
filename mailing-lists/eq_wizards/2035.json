From what I<br/>\n&gt; have seen poison comes in<br/>\n&gt; three levels, and if a cleric uses his lowest level<br/>\n&gt; curing spell, he may have<br/>\n&gt; to cast it several times before the poison is<br/>\n&gt; removed.  Here is my suggestion.<br/>\n&gt; Go to the Steamfont Mts and have Meldreth charm your<br/>\n&gt; buddy again.  Then cast<br/>\n&gt; cancel magic 4 or 5 times and see if it removes the<br/>\n&gt; effect.  Well okay your<br/>\n&gt; buddy probably won&#39;t go for it, but give it a shot<br/>\n&gt; the next time its necessary<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Till Tomorrow<br/>\n&gt; Malkin<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; James Guintu wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;James Guintu&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:james@...\">james@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I also am not too sure what the function of Cancel<br/>\n&gt; Magic is... I believe it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can undo roots but that seems to be about it....<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yesterday a druid friend and I were grouped<br/>\n&gt; fighting evil eyes.  He was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; charmed and I finished the eye.  Even after the<br/>\n&gt; eye died, my friend was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; still charmed and continued to attack me.  I then<br/>\n&gt; rooted him(we play on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Rallos Zek), he clicked all of his buffs off(which<br/>\n&gt; can still be done when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you are charmed), then cast cancel magic on him. <br/>\n&gt; It said that he felt a bit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dispelled yet it did not cancel the charm.  Does<br/>\n&gt; cancel magic only give you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a chance to cancel the charm?  I thought that<br/>\n&gt; canceling charm would have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; been one of the main purposes of this spell.  Also<br/>\n&gt; we tested cancel magic by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; him casting stinging swarm(DOT) on me and me<br/>\n&gt; canceling.  It seems to work<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sometimes, but not always... it may have something<br/>\n&gt; to do with being grouped<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or not...  Does anyone have any data on how this<br/>\n&gt; spell works and when it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; will work?  Also should cancel magic work against<br/>\n&gt; Necro DOT&#39;s?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
