If someone chooses to<br/>\nstay behind and get chewed on, I&#39;m grateful for their sacrifice, but I<br/>\nunder no circumstances expect it from them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I&#39;m perfectly willing to run away from a fight with them (hell, I&#39;ve<br/>\ncalled retreats for them), I don&#39;t gate on them.  I&#39;m no melee fighter by<br/>\nany stretch of the imagination, but by gating out on my tanks, I&#39;m removing<br/>\none more potential random target from the mob - thus decreacing my tanks<br/>\nodds of survival.  Whatsmore, I don&#39;t want them to be in a situation where<br/>\nthey think they are being backed up by artillery that doesn&#39;t exist -<br/>\nwhether the Wiz is OOM or has just plain split.  <br/>\n<br/>\nStrategy check:  Which has the better survival rate?  A group running away,<br/>\nor a group that scatters?  (I&#39;m not questioning your qualifications as a<br/>\nleader, just wanting to know which has worked better from your point of<br/>\nview)  I can see pluses and minuses on both sides of the argument.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If my wizards did not take the time to gate out I would be pissed.  I am <br/>\n&gt;willing to die so that you might escape to have everyone die is a waste.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;rule of thumb should be based on your group.  If you are all friends and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>work <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;well together then you should know when to gate and when not to.  If you<br/>\n </span></blockquote>gate <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and your leader hasn&#39;t given the run command then your are a coward.

As long as magic users keep<br/>\n </span></blockquote>everyone <br/>\n<br/>\nI usually lead my parties (if one can call it &quot;leading&quot; since I&#39;m in the<br/>\nback).  Wizards can do this effectivly as long as they aren&#39;t so caught up<br/>\nin blasting they forget to keep an eye on their tanks health or the groups<br/>\nsurroundings.  And from the back, I&#39;m removed enough to keep an eye on the<br/>\nflow of the battle (like if we seem to be getting too near a critter that<br/>\nwill decide to assist the one we are attacking, or said critter decides to<br/>\ncharge us)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;informed on mana with &quot;LOM or OOM OOM&quot; then the group should work out fine.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Complete agreement there; I call for a mana check before we engage anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;So basically I think you should Gate only when you get the command in<br/>\n </span></blockquote>battle, <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;or your leader is dead and the rest are running.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We&#39;ll have to agree to disagree there. =)  <br/>\n<br/>\n-Pennaggolan, 3rd Circle Wizard of Felwithe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
