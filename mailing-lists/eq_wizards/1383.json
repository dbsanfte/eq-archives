I don&#39;t know if it could be appropriate for wizards but maybe enchanters and magicians (unless they already have this?)<br/>\n<br/>\nyou cast a spell that creates a double of yourself. Now, when you cast, your double casts in stead of you. for balance reasons it could only last so long, and when it suddenly disappears the monster(s) catch on and attack you. the duration should only be about 30 seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\nany thoughts... i&#39;m going to send it in as feedback right now so any suggestions would be appreciated</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
