The<br/>\nessential spells are lesser shielding, shadow step (if you ever plan on<br/>\nrunning) and either Fire bolt or ice shock, or both.  Bolts, in case you<br/>\ndon&#39;t know, must be fired in a straight line with no obstructions, shocks<br/>\nhit something within a certain range no matter where it is, even behind you.<br/>\nOn lvl 8 shock of ice should do 34 damage compared to fire bolt at 44.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeferi High Wizard of the Hammers of Norrath</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
