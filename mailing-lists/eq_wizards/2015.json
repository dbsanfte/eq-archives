All the other spellcasting classes have pets (including<br/>\n&gt;hybrids with their charms). Instead of getting a pet, since we are so<br/>\n&gt;mana dependent ( and the other classes have pets which do WAY more for<br/>\n&gt;the mana then we can do with DD over time) we get a familiar.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A familiar is similar to a pet ( a MOB that would follow us ) but it<br/>\n&gt;wouldn&#39;t be for battle. It would act as a mana battery increasing our<br/>\n&gt;total mana. It would cast a lot more mana to cast than it gives us. If<br/>\n&gt;it dies, we lose the amount of mana that it gives us and maybe damage us<br/>\n&gt;a bit. It will not attack or defend. It will attract the frenzy of<br/>\n&gt;intelligent MOBs but it will also turn invisible with us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It could be a small cat, dog, skunk, whatever (random?) and we would get<br/>\n&gt;maybe 3 or 4 throughout our ranks that have increasing amount of mana.<br/>\n&gt;This would offset a lot of our complaints on being a unique class, being<br/>\n&gt;able to compete, etc. Plus it would be fun! Wizards throughout lore have<br/>\n&gt;used familiars to aid them in their studies. Since we rely ENTIRELY on<br/>\n&gt;our mana to survive (unlike others who have permanent pet to aid) this<br/>\n&gt;would help us get that extra root off and run, or that last blast to get<br/>\n&gt;the 2nd blue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What do you think? I know it&#39;s unlikely it will happen, but it sure<br/>\n&gt;sounds like a good idea :) And it would make us unique and it would<br/>\n&gt;enhance our artillerly challenged butts :P<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Croesus Illuminatus (Xegony)<br/>\n&gt;*Go for the eyes Boo!

Well we are the PURE<br/>\n&gt;&gt; magic class. We&#39;re the only ones that basically have no melee skills or no<br/>\n&gt;&gt; pet to melee for us.
