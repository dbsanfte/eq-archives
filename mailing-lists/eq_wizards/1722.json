I do not believe it is,<br/>\n&gt; unless you have some guild<br/>\n&gt; give you a lot of money to go get one.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; but if i give my lower level char some hugely valued<br/>\n&gt; item for the fun of it,<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s twinking. i&#39;d appreciate it if you would all<br/>\n&gt; back off. i already<br/>\n&gt; reported it and IT IS AGAINST the rules. stop<br/>\n&gt; whining<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Wizard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wizard@...\">wizard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Monday, May 24, 1999 2:01 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eq_wizards]<br/>\n&gt; Horrifying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Wizard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wizard@...\">wizard@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I just started a new caracter in freeport, as i go<br/>\n&gt; to newbee area i see all<br/>\n&gt; &gt;around me killing snakes and bats was people with<br/>\n&gt; full banded mail all lv 1<br/>\n&gt; &gt;or 2 i have seen in 6 hours more then 10 full<br/>\n&gt; armored people. And i dont<br/>\n&gt; &gt;have any problem about it!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;If they transfered items from their high lv<br/>\n&gt; caracters or if guild give it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to them its ok for me i go around killing my bats<br/>\n&gt; and snakes and they do it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;in same way without skills they must work much<br/>\n&gt; things a same way as you do<br/>\n&gt; &gt;a little bit easier but they alredy worked for it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I played a long time a everquest creating some<br/>\n&gt; middle lv caracter and i<br/>\n&gt; &gt;know  how dificult it is to start it all over if<br/>\n&gt; you have find that your<br/>\n&gt; &gt;caracter is not what you wish and you decite to<br/>\n&gt; start new class.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Im shure that a people wich complain are ones wich<br/>\n&gt; have enugh money and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;free time to play as long as they wish, ohers wich<br/>\n&gt; cannot support to pay a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;10 $ a month and 1 $ a hour (as connection rates to<br/>\n&gt; internet go in europe)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;i aprove fully to transfer their items to new<br/>\n&gt; started caracter. If this is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;possible to do in game then its ok to do if you<br/>\n&gt; wish to pay 100 $ a month<br/>\n&gt; &gt;so that you can have a payed gm controling every<br/>\n&gt; transaction in game then<br/>\n&gt; &gt;its ok for you send email to Sony saying that you<br/>\n&gt; are ready to pay 100 $ a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;month to play a game where every move will be GM<br/>\n&gt; controled so wou can be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;shure that every caracter is not twinked ;-), They<br/>\n&gt; willl accept this idea<br/>\n&gt; &gt;gladly as soon they start reciving your bucks.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;About guild camping im strongly against it i<br/>\n&gt; support idea that if person<br/>\n&gt; &gt;wich killes a monster is more then 5 lv higher then<br/>\n&gt; loot will be only<br/>\n&gt; &gt;normal one and for special items only a 1/3 of<br/>\n&gt; normal chance or not at all<br/>\n&gt; &gt;so higer lv players wishing one item must buy it<br/>\n&gt; from a low lv players. it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;will be a nice push to player interaction.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Silverion<br/>\n&gt; &gt;High elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Fenin Ro<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;ONElist members are using Shared Files in great<br/>\n&gt; ways!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Are you?
