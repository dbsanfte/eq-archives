I do know that we will be highly useful to a group once we get our<br/>\nescape and portal spells.  I am pretty sure that any high level group will<br/>\nhave a cleric (to cast group divine aura) along with a wizard (to cast group<br/>\nteleport) in sticky situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther things I have seen is that wizards (at least at level 12 with<br/>\nlightning shock) can be superb kill stealers.  In crushbone there is<br/>\ncommonly a level 12 wizard camping the trainer for his coveted shiny brass<br/>\nshield.  In 3 or 4 lightning shocks the trainer is dead and no group can<br/>\nhope to get the kill that quickly unless they have a level 12 wizard as<br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sad that wizards dont get any additional damage shields after o&#39;kiels<br/>\nradiation at level 4, and other than that dont really have any group buff<br/>\nspells at all.  I don&#39;t really know about the higher levels very much, but<br/>\nwizards dont seem to have a whole lot to offer the group than teleport<br/>\nspells and a bit of direct damage.  Other classes might very well be more<br/>\nuseful in a group.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore feedback would be appreciated fellow Wizards.  Please post.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Solric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Simon Hinshelwood [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:iktome@...\">iktome@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 13, 1999 4:54 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_wizards] Ice Comet<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Simon Hinshelwood &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:iktome@...\">iktome@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell said Jay. Parties cant be bothered with wizards, they cant buff, cant<br/>\nheal<br/>\nand cant really help parties that much...&quot;we were supposed to be heavy<br/>\nartillery&quot; but that just is not correct. I think a wizard would be most<br/>\nparties<br/>\nlast choice if they could choose from all the classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts very easy to demonstrate the wizard immbalance; get into an arena with a<br/>\ndual wield barbarian warrior of the same level and see how you do!<br/>\nHmm doesn&#39;t sound too promising eh?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always played a wizard character class in AD&D and UO but I regret<br/>\nplaying one in EQ. I think EQ were nervous about the power wizards in UO and<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to unbalance the game. I think they swung the pendalum too far<br/>\nthe<br/>\nother way. Root &#39;n&#39; Shoot, if that fails death, thats about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully e-mails will pour in and tell me how wrong I am.
