Ive been piercing for so long (95) my 1hblunt is 31, and so the staff isnt much use to me, while the runes definitely are!

Impressive!  I&#39;ve only mastered all the research <br/>\n&gt;languages including such things as elder dragon and erudian.

It was in the hopes that verant would put in quest that<br/>\nrequired you to speak to the NPC is a specific language to be able to<br/>\nconverse with them.  Wishful thinking on my part. But it would give those<br/>\nlanguages a use. :)<br/>\nLomack, Knight Defender of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org <br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\nFennin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nWant to send money instantly to anyone, anywhere, anytime?<br/>\nYou can today at X.com - and we&#39;ll give you $20 to try it.
