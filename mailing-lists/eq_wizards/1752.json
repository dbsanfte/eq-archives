If you want to compete, fire up Half Life and<br/>\ncompete for frags. There&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; competition.

EQ doesn&#39;t stand for equal,<br/>\nbuddy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  But with her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; twinking I am at the disadvantage.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No! You are where you would be anyway. She has some advantage, but it&#39;s<br/>\nnot an advantage OVER YOU.<br/>\n&gt; Unless you are playing on Rallos Zek or +pvp you are very misguided as to<br/>\nthe true nature of EQ.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  While she coasts yet another character to the upper levels<br/>\n&gt; &gt; AT MY EXPENSE!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How exactly is it at your expense?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Yes I am upset and yes she should be told to play fair like the rest of<br/>\nus are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; forced too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yeah, it&#39;s time for a new order! A revolution! Kind of like 1917, right?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Red Norrath&quot; does have a sound to it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, life is tough like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that. Whether she gets an advantage or not, is none of your business<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because it doesn&#39;t really affect you.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It does affect me.  It makes that many fewer creatures at my level<br/>\navailable for me to kill in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; an HONORABLE way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh, come on! Are you saying you&#39;re having difficulty to find kills because<br/>\nof twinkers? The % of<br/>\n&gt; twinkers in the game is probably 5-10 MAX. Norrath is crowded, no doubt,<br/>\nbut don&#39;t blame twinkers<br/>\n&gt; for hunting hardships.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  This makes my job (an already difficult one) even more difficult and<br/>\nthat is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; why twinking is the WORST POSSIBLE OFFENSE.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Uh, no. Don&#39;t you find kill stealing or Guild camping worse? Man, it looks<br/>\nlike you&#39;re really fired<br/>\n&gt; up about this, eh?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Listen, if you&#39;re on Solusek Ro, I might help you out, you know? Would<br/>\n10-20pp help the revolution?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And remember, she had to work her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; way to level 22 before that as well, so she is only giving her other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Char something she rightfully earned.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And just WHAT is your point?  Because she has one character at a high<br/>\nlevel and can play in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; areas that I cannot she has somehow earned the right to retard my low<br/>\nlevel characters<br/>\n&gt; &gt; development (see above) making it even more difficult for me to get to<br/>\nmy &quot;rightfully earned&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 22nd level.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As I said, the twinker&#39;s affect on hunting is negligible, at best. Can you<br/>\nprove the contrary?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You are obviously a fool<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Obviously. I bow before your superior intellect, mighty one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and most likely a twinker. I can only hope you are not on my server.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hah. I&#39;m level 13, and I have 60pp in the bank. All rightfully earned. I<br/>\ncan hardly play enough with<br/>\n&gt; one character, let alone two or more.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ever hear the phrase &quot;I might disagree with your opinion, but I&#39;ll fight<br/>\nto the death to let you<br/>\n&gt; voice it&quot;? Well this is the same. I might frown upon twinkers, but I&#39;ll do<br/>\nanything to preserve<br/>\n&gt; their freedom to do as they wish.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do you disagree, comrade?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Qenelin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
