They might sometime get a critical hit that high. Or, maybe, if<br/>\nthey are twinked with the best of items, I might believe it. Otherwise,<br/>\nI think you probably saw something rare and consider it a regularity.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, sometimes root holds all the battle and let&#39;s you med and fire<br/>\nsome more. Rarely, but sometimes. A warrior seeing this would go and<br/>\ncomplain about the overpowered wizards.
