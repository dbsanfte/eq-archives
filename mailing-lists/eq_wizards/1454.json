I don&#39;t normally work that way. However, once the<br/>\ngauntlets thrown down, I&#39;m not going to let my tanks die over principles.<br/>\n: )<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re all casters in the group. Granted, the cleric can tank and fight, as<br/>\ndoes the Shaman. However at the end of the fight, the cleric is healing.<br/>\nWhether himself or others won&#39;t matter. Solo or duo, he&#39;s going to have to<br/>\nheal himself more in any case.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter taking down various devishes, the ghouls at the ruins etc, I&#39;d be<br/>\nmedding more than most, but not by much. However my health meter wouldn&#39;t be<br/>\ntouched. It&#39;s a balancing game, and the thing is to find a group that works<br/>\nfor you. For me, it&#39;s having a bunch of people that don&#39;t squabble over<br/>\nloot, willing to chat in downtimes, and we&#39;re all more than willing to<br/>\nsacrifice oursleves for the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom my experience no one class can solo effectively. Note that I said<br/>\neffectively. Anyone can solo, but it&#39;ll be slow going. What you really have<br/>\nto do to effectively solo is find a group, and stick together. I&#39;ve been<br/>\nlucky in that I have a good group that has gone to great lengths to stick<br/>\ntogether. When our monk died in Western Karanas and was bound to Freeport,<br/>\nwe all turned around and ran back to get him. It&#39;s a group and team effort<br/>\nthat will lead the way in this game. Some quests are hard, and a group is<br/>\nmuch easier to accomplish. We recently helped a friend do the screaming mace<br/>\nquest and you&#39;ve GOT to group to do these effectively.<br/>\n<br/>\nZalbar<br/>\n18th Wizard<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
