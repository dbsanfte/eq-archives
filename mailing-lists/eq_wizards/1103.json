Wizard spells work a different way then other casters.  The other<br/>\n&gt; casters (I&#39;m not sure if magicians are included in this) either do full dmg<br/>\n&gt; or no dmg.  Wizards have there dmg vary over a range.  This may seem  bad to<br/>\n&gt; you now, but it&#39;s not.  Wizard spells get completely resisted less than<br/>\n&gt; other caster spells.  So when you&#39;re doing 40 dmg (on a 83 dmg spell), but<br/>\n&gt; everyone else is getting completely resisted you won&#39;t feel so useless.<br/>\n&gt; BTW, Necro life draining spells are impossible to resist, it will do the<br/>\n&gt; same amount of dmg every single time he casts it no matter what.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; details. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
