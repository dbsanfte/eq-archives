Then when the cops arrest me, their just<br/>\nwhining. The cops should just give all ROBBERS a JOB! Uh, not that I do<br/>\nthat, just as an example :P<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I found renewed life at 20! I am half way to level 21 and my Force<br/>\nShock doesn&#39;t seem to be resisted as much. Ironically, blues resist more<br/>\nthan yellows!<br/>\n<br/>\nCroesus Illuminatus (Xegony)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:yur@...\">yur@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:yur@...\">yur@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      You guys don&#39;t seem to understand why some of us (such as myself) kill<br/>\n&gt; steal all the time.  IT IS BECAUSE WE CANNOT FIND GROUPS !!!  simple as that.<br/>\n&gt; no groups, KS !  thats it.  I don&#39;t feel like sitting on my ass for 30 - 40 min<br/>\n&gt; waiting for ppl to group, while shouting all the time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) people hate us for shouting so much<br/>\n&gt; 2) people don&#39;t message us even if they need group member (weird)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;      You ppl who are against kill stealers by shouting their names out so no one<br/>\n&gt; will group them are so god damn stupid, all you have to do is group with them<br/>\n&gt; and BINGO !! no more kill stealing.   If i am getting good xp , why kill steal<br/>\n&gt; ??  there is no point for me to risk my life trying to get xp from some monster<br/>\n&gt; 6 others are beating up on.  I rarely die in a group since I stand so far back,<br/>\n&gt; but while kill stealing if i beat them up too much, the mob might run to me with<br/>\n&gt; no one else helping.   If you really want to stop kill stealing, then just group<br/>\n&gt; with those people so you guys can take on higher mobs together.   I would<br/>\n&gt; happily stop KS anytime during the day to Group with ppl passing by.  I only KS<br/>\n&gt; while waiting for groups and i do shout for groups while i KS as well.<br/>\n&gt; People are stupid and don&#39;t know how to stop a problem,  oh well... what can you<br/>\n&gt; do ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
