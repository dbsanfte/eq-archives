Theoretically, there may<br/>\nbe good situations to purposefully use this as a fetching tool when you know<br/>\nthe area.     ...but I agree it is certainly useless as a scouting tool.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tFrom: Cristie &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cristie@...\">cristie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAlso the other thing to take into consideration when<br/>\npurchasing/using this <br/>\n\t\tspell is that if you send the eye out to look around you<br/>\nhave to be <br/>\n\t\tprepared for monsters to train to you.  I have not<br/>\npersonally experienced <br/>\n\t\tthat happening (because I use it very rarely if at all), but<br/>\nI have heard <br/>\n\t\tof others who have used it in the dungeons only to pull a<br/>\nbunch of nasties <br/>\n\t\tout on themselves, and everyone else, in the process.  It is<br/>\nkind of a <br/>\n\t\tnovelty spell, if you ask me, with no real use at this<br/>\npoint.  If they made <br/>\n\t\tthe eye an entity that monsters would not train on it would<br/>\nbe worthwhile, <br/>\n\t\totherwise I would just wait.   Had I known I wouldn&#39;t have<br/>\npurchased it myself.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
