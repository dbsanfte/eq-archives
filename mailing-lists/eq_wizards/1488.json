EqVault had a group <br/>\nshot of the guild &lt;fire of the heavens&gt; who made level 50.  There&#39;s a couple <br/>\nmages there wearing those robes.  I met a wizard last night who was wearing <br/>\nthis and confirmed it with me.  Believe it or not, he was a level 1 Wiz.  <br/>\nApparently, he got it from his other character 46lvl Paladin.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe says he got the robe off of a 30ish lvl (?) guard in the Ocean of Tears.  <br/>\nMust be one of the islands there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never seen the chainmail-looking one although I&#39;ve heard rumours on <br/>\nthis list that one exists?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n16 lvl (invisibility yaaay!)

The <br/>\n&gt;first<br/>\n&gt;was a Blue looking robe with fancy trim like the black robe has. Anyone <br/>\n&gt;know<br/>\n&gt;where to get that and the stats on it? Second I saw a char with a robe that<br/>\n&gt;looked like it was chain mail. I am not sure if this char was a Wizard(was<br/>\n&gt;playing anon and would not talk to me when I asked about the robe). Anyone <br/>\n&gt;know<br/>\n&gt;what that was and where it is found?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
