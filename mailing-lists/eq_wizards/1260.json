IT DONT MOVE i lost hours fighting a blue yellow and even red when<br/>\nsome group leave me to try and nothing i never get any advance anymore ?? i<br/>\nalso get one cracked staff but with skill 0 i never got any advance. so now<br/>\ni have 2h blunt at 36 and dagger at 20 1h blunt at 0. and i dont have any<br/>\nwish to invest a skill points in this :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 11.26 12/05/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Keith Wiseman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:keithw@...\">keithw@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\t\t&gt;Playing my wizard I have really not noticed<br/>\n&gt;\t\t&gt;faster weapon skill gain than what my ranger had (his int<br/>\n&gt;was only 80 or<br/>\n&gt;\t\t&gt;something).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well INT is definitely supposed to mean faster learning.  But in the<br/>\n&gt;scenario of meleeing, in general it may not be much of a difference when you<br/>\n&gt;do it so much.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\t\t&gt;As to your skills increasing slowly, that is strange.  When<br/>\n&gt;my ranger got to<br/>\n&gt;\t\t&gt;about level 17 and he got a screaming mace, his 1h blunt<br/>\n&gt;skill was 0.  I<br/>\n&gt;\t\t&gt;went to unrest and got permission from the groups there to<br/>\n&gt;get some whacks<br/>\n&gt;\t\t&gt;in on the mobs they were fighting (many of which were<br/>\n&gt;white/black or yellow<br/>\n&gt;\t\t&gt;cons).  It took me a while, but skill steadily improved<br/>\n&gt;from 0 all the way<br/>\n&gt;\t\t&gt;to max of 100 at level 19. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That is why I suggested there is a bug or design flaw.  The only common<br/>\n&gt;thread of all the complaints on message boards is they were all Level 14 or<br/>\n&gt;higher mage classes using the 2H Blunt (Runed Totem Staff) skill for the<br/>\n&gt;first time and it was hardly improving at all, even though they were at 0!!<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve had my RTS for three levels now and the only reason I am at skill of 20<br/>\n&gt;on 2H Blunt is because I pumped 15 practice points into it after spending a<br/>\n&gt;whole level of going nowhere with that skill.  Something&#39;s not right here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Get involved.
