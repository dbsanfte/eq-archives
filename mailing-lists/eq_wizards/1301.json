Parties cant be bothered with wizards, they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cant buff, cant heal<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and cant really help parties that much...&quot;we were supposed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to be heavy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; artillery&quot; but that just is not correct. I think a wizard<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would be most parties<br/>\n&gt; &gt; last choice if they could choose from all the classes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Let me just throw in the fact that this is not my experience.  A<br/>\n&gt; wizard can be a great help to a party if it is organized well and if<br/>\n&gt; the wizard has brains.<br/>\n&gt; What do I mean by brains?  Well, some wizards immediately start<br/>\n&gt; casting on a monster when the fight starts.  They do a good chunk of<br/>\n&gt; damage so the monster runs for them.  From then on, the whole party<br/>\n&gt; has to scramble to keep the wizard alive.<br/>\n&gt; If played well, the wizard can make the difference between a tough<br/>\n&gt; fight and an easy one.  Throw in spells to take out nice chunks of<br/>\n&gt; hitpoints once in a while.  If things go wrong, blast away and do<br/>\n&gt; 300-400 damage in a few seconds, saving the party.  If the monster<br/>\n&gt; runs, root it and finish it off, saving time.<br/>\n&gt; A smart wizard can be a great asset to any party.  The key is, don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; put yourself in a position where everyone has to go out of their way<br/>\n&gt; to save you.<br/>\n&gt; Aznyin<br/>\n&gt; Level 15 Erudite Wizard<br/>\n&gt; Chivalric Order of Norrath<br/>\n&gt; Current Residence: Rivervale [Solusek Ro]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Give back to your community through &quot;Grow to Give.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; See homepage for details. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
