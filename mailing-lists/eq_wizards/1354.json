This means that if they must wait for you then you <br/>\nare casting too much. I only start nuking if I see a targeted warrior drop <br/>\nbelow 1/2 his health, and we do not have a healer. Then when the party is <br/>\nhealing themselves I am Meditating and we tend to finish at same time. This <br/>\nway they do not feel I am a burden but rather a savior when I really let <br/>\nlose my power to save them.<br/>\n<br/>\nElkantar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
