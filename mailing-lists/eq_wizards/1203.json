I am a<br/>\n&gt; level 9 right now and am at the point where I am thinking<br/>\n&gt; about seeking a<br/>\n&gt; magical weapon.  I am sure at higher levels I won&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; want to get NEAR<br/>\n&gt; the monster I am fighting to melee, but at this point I can<br/>\n&gt; still get some<br/>\n&gt; decent damage and save mana finishing off creatures with melee.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Learn from my mistake.  I concentrated on piercing upto level 14 and<br/>\nmaxed out the skill.  With a Giant Snake Fang it works very well.<br/>\nOnce you advance, however, you will start encountering people with the<br/>\nbeautiful Runed Totem Staff, which (from memory) is 8dmg, 47 delay,<br/>\n+5HP and +5 mana, AND allows you to fight magical creatures.  It&#39;s a<br/>\n2h blunt weapon.  I had neglected 2H upto then and am STILL trying to<br/>\nget it maxed.<br/>\nSo my advice is, get a nice worn Greater Staff (or another decent<br/>\nbeginner staff) and use that until you can afford a Runed Totem Staff.<br/>\nThe Runed will cost you between 20 and 30pp (usually) and is superior<br/>\nto almost anything else out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAznyin<br/>\nLevel 15 Erudite Wizard<br/>\nChivalric Order of Norrath<br/>\nCurrent Residence: Rivervale [Solusek Ro]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
