Zatkin     Arch-Magi of<br/>\nNorrath because i have mailed this first letter also to verant<br/>\n<br/>\nLets say we have possibility to petition for things which he commented Probably<br/>\ni included a full comments<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; a.) better run from combat teleport spells - shadow step with minimum range -<br/>\n </span></blockquote>faster gate - second bind point (in zone only) it can be some type of faster<br/>\ngate for run from combat spells<br/>\n<br/>\n    Probably won&#39;t happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; b.) Better exploration spells like invisible eye of zoom with longer<br/>\n </span></blockquote>duration.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Probably won&#39;t happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote: i see one post that if we get a longer duration eye of zoom we will be in<br/>\ngrade to explore dungeons without risk<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; c.) Item locator. As we are item hunters we can have a spell which can<br/>\n </span></blockquote>function as ranger tracker for items in zone so we can see all items in zone<br/>\nand we can turn in direction where item is !!<br/>\n<br/>\n    Won&#39;t happen for sure.  Come on - if there is no risk...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; d.) faster mana recovery then other classes - ( or by higher meditation limit<br/>\n </span></blockquote>lets say (level +1) * 7 or by specific items wizard only later in game) - why<br/>\nthis you can ask. because in combat other classes have a mana battery<br/>\nwhich is a pet it can defend, attack and also sacrifice and many more long<br/>\nduration buffing spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Won&#39;t happen.  Wizards are balanced against every other magic class. Giving<br/>\nthem more mana would remove 1 year worth of beta testing.<br/>\n<br/>\ne.) one thing which is not wizard specific but influence us, is to make a<br/>\nmeditation more diversifying I wish to play a game not to stay looking all time<br/>\nin same page or go in WC, kitchen when I meditate it will be nice to have <br/>\n - internal email system<br/>\n - two chat windows so that I can access general all server chat same one which<br/>\nwe can go in from server screen in one window and to hear what going on in game<br/>\nin other window<br/>\n- in game class oriented mailing lists<br/>\n<br/>\n    We probably will be adding something to Med to make it a bit more<br/>\nenjoyable.  Up until the end of  Beta, you couldn&#39;t even talk or tell in Med.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - He is a weakest class in all Norath looking at hit points,  but he is a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>major destructive power in game also.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Same hp as a Magician, Necromancer or Enchanter.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - Wizard casts Direct Damage DD spells faster than anyone else and with more<br/>\n </span></blockquote>force than anyone else. We as a class get a DD spell EVERY level and we have a<br/>\nbest mana damage ratio on them.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Yep.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - Wizards have a experience diminution I don&#39;t know how much for sure but it<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is near 10 - 15 %.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Ummm - no.  Wizards, Magicians, Necromancers and Enchanters all get exactly<br/>\nthe same xp gained from each fight, needed to level, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - Wizards are very weak at start and at lv 20 start to be traveler and only<br/>\n </span></blockquote>at lv 34 + start to be a force in all ways from solo to group play with all<br/>\nline of plane travel and group rescue spells. ( you see that a spells go from a<br/>\n5 (1 lv.)- 15 (4 lv) - 35 (8 lv)  80 (12 lv) - 105 (16 lv) all times mana gives<br/>\nyou cc. 5 shots before go out of mana OOM when you go up in lv you get a some<br/>\nadditional roots in)<br/>\n<br/>\n    All magi are weak at the start.  Nothing specific to Wizards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - Wizard combat definition is major damage in shortest time!<br/>\n&gt; - Enchanter goes with more suptile tactic with pet, weaking enemy or<br/>\n </span></blockquote>charming<br/>\n<br/>\n    An Enchanter can weaken, but has a hard time doing damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;         - necromancer rely on his strong pet and Damage Over Time spells DOT<br/>\n </span></blockquote>where he is a master this spells do in time much more damage then DD spells of<br/>\nwizards but..)<br/>\n<br/>\n    True - over time, a necro does more.  For him to do the damage that you do<br/>\nin 15 seconds, he would need 1 min.  Even if his mana to damage ratio is<br/>\nbetter, do the math.  45 seconds less means that you have 45 seconds less<br/>\ndamage taken.  That is huge.  Wizards get quick kills.  This makes them GREAT<br/>\nin a party or SOLO.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSilverion<br/>\nHigh elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\nFenin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\nmoderator mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
