They are low mana cost spells that<br/>\nlet you practice a skill without blowing a chunk of mana at each attempt.<br/>\nThey have a small amount of functionality, but their real benefit is in<br/>\npreparing you for higher lvl spells (e.g. Sphere of Light and Sense Magic<br/>\nboth train for, say, Invisibility).<br/>\n<br/>\n-Brian</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
