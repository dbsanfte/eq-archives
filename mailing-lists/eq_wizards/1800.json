I&#39;d <br/>\nbe willing to pay...although I am by no means rich. :P<br/>\nOther then that, we can trade languages if I have something you don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, what are some of the required &quot;magic&quot; languages anyway?  It&#39;s <br/>\nnot only Old Erudian is it?  I&#39;ve only got Elvish and Gnome up to Excellent. <br/>\n  Some of the others I only have average.  Funny how I picked up gnoll, <br/>\norcish, and others somewhere along the way.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nGlad the twinky thread is over ;)<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n17th Wiz Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
