You can also ROOT them down and cast on them.<br/>\nWhen at 16 level you can buy Shieldskin which will nullify 100HP damage<br/>\nmelee to you.  This is very effective.  Also you are hitting as hard as him<br/>\nand you are 2 levels lower.  Yes you are more powerful.  WHen you reach his<br/>\nlevel or 16th you will do more dmg than he.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: shypht [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:evanschu@...\">evanschu@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Sunday, May 02, 1999 4:17 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Re: What i have to put up with<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;shypht&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:evanschu@...\">evanschu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone likes to think thier class is the best class. But the lvl 12 spell<br/>\nis shock of ligthing no? That max&#39;s out at around 83 pnts fo dmg I think,<br/>\nstarts at 77. So you are doing 77 dmg at 12 where is only doing that much at<br/>\n14. When you hit lvl 16 you get a nice 102 dmg spell, and that is currently<br/>\ndoing 110 dmg for me at lvl 20. But, your lvl 20 DD spell SUCKS. It does 177<br/>\ndmg, 2% LESS mana efficent then your lvl 16 one, but it does have a 2 second<br/>\nstun, but it RESISTS WAY TO OFTEN.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut anyways, at the low lvls (yes, lvl 12 is a low lvl, hell 16 is even low<br/>\nlvl IMO), your DD is very comparable to that of which other class&#39;s can do.<br/>\nBut in the end we do dish out much more damage. Can you say &quot;1100dmg in 1<br/>\nshot&quot; .. can anyone else lay claim to that? not even druids can, their max<br/>\ndamage is 650 I think.<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kastor &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:atlass@...\">atlass@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Sunday, May 02, 1999 1:10 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] What i have to put up with<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Kastor&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:atlass@...\">atlass@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sorry this is so long.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m a level 11 wizard about to turn 12.

Well he just brought<br/>\n&gt;his new damage spell and he said it does 77 damage, to which i replied kewl<br/>\n&gt;my next spell does that amount<br/>\n&gt;too. That was a mistake he started laughing and saying things like &quot;why<br/>\n&gt;would anyone want to play the wizard<br/>\n&gt;when they can play the shaman&quot;.  &quot;the shaman can stand toe to toe like the<br/>\n&gt;warrior and do the same damage<br/>\n&gt;as the wizard, Ha HA HA HA .....&quot; . Then he went on saying crap like now he<br/>\n&gt;knows the shaman is the best<br/>\n&gt;class in the game. All he could talk about before was the sow spell, and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>now<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;it is he does the same damage<br/>\n&gt;as the wizard.  My question is this, i thought i picked the wizard so i<br/>\n&gt;would not have to hear stuff like this?<br/>\n&gt;I thought level 12 was when the wizard started to leave other mage class<br/>\n&gt;behind.  Know i have to hear alot<br/>\n&gt;aggraviating crap from this shaman, laughing at the wizard class. Dam that<br/>\n&gt;is going to suck.  Someone<br/>\n&gt;please tell me there is hope out there as far as the damage spells go.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Looking for a new hobby?
