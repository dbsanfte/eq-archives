He does close dmg to me now at lvl 20.<br/>\n&gt;He says at lvl 49 mages do lava bolt which does 950 whereas ice comet does<br/>\n&gt;1100.  That is almost the same damage as the wizard.  So it seems to me<br/>\n&gt;that there isn&#39;t much of a use to be a wizard if you can be a mage and do<br/>\n&gt;almost the same amount of direct damage plus you have a pet.  So anyone<br/>\n&gt;tell me something good about the wiz class to make it worth playing them to<br/>\n&gt;high levels?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
