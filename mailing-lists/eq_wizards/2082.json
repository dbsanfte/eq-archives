The topic for this<br/>\nlist wasnt &quot;Discuss how a wizard can be made better&quot; so over all, you flamed<br/>\nme with a dumb response that made jack for sense.<br/>\nI also don&#39;t see why your freakin out so bad, I mean, gosh, I personally<br/>\nunderstand how the wizards work in all games, they ARE NOT supposed to be the<br/>\nmasters of melee, or other magic kinds, they are supposed to be able to Damage<br/>\nthe target very fast, thats EXACTLY what they do! If you think a wizard needs<br/>\nto be able to get more mana or crap, your insane, I can kill 4-6 blues in a<br/>\nrow without medding(at lvl 9), and I can take on 3 blues at a time, and I can<br/>\ndo 1 even! If you dont got what it takes to be a wizard, then just go play a<br/>\nMagician so you can summon, go play your trix, wannabee.<br/>\n-Malvos<br/>\n&lt;snip of Crap someone with problems said&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
