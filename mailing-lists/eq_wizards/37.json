Others<br/>\nare fun and nice to have<br/>\nif you have the Extra $$ , but i wouldn&#39;t waste $$ on them at lvl 8 . Save<br/>\nall the platinum you can<br/>\nbecause come lvl 16 Spells get very very expensive. I dropped over 50 plat<br/>\nfor my level 16 spells.<br/>\nOf course i just had to have most of them :) <br/>\n<br/>\nAt 02:22 PM 4/16/99 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Crowder, David&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DCrowder@...\">DCrowder@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;By rank three I am assuming that you mean lvl 8.  That is one of the best<br/>\n&gt;lvls for spells  you will definitely need the following:<br/>\n&gt;Shock of ice (34dmg for 30 mana), Fire Bolt(45dmg for 40 mana)  be careful<br/>\n&gt;with the fire bolt as it requires a direct line of sight to hit, lesser<br/>\n&gt;shielding is a must as we are very vulnerable and this will be your shield<br/>\n&gt;until lvl 16, resistant skin is good against rat plague disease and spider<br/>\n&gt;poison.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hope this helped<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;\tFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WriterDL@...\">WriterDL@...</a> [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WriterDL@...\">WriterDL@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;\tSent:\tFriday, April 16, 1999 2:02 PM<br/>\n&gt;\tTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;\tSubject:\t[eq_wizards] Introductions<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WriterDL@...\">WriterDL@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tGreetings and Good day.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;\tI am Gaedin, a 5th level High Elf Wizard on Veeshan who spends his<br/>\n&gt;days <br/>\n&gt;\twandering around Kelethin sniping at Orc Centurions.
