My alcohol tolerance is so low though I take an INT hit when I use it, so I only do it when mana is really low, so by time I am FM my INT has recovered too. Never thought I would be using alcohol like warriors do for STR boost, so neglected to build alcohol tolerance. But now it is in upper 20&#39;s and INT hit is not as bad, and recovers faster. Anyway, it is like a poor cousin to Clarity, but helps a bit when you are soloing and want mana back ASAP.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreg (Kronan on Innoruuk)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
