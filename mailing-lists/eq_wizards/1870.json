It not only does damage but it also stuns the<br/>\nopponent.  Any spell with a dual effect is resisted a LOT more (ask<br/>\nenchanters because almost all their spells have dual or triple effects).  At<br/>\nlevel 24 we get a DD spell that does about the same amount of damage as<br/>\nshock of force, but does not have a dual effect and is thus not resisted as<br/>\nmuch.  It also costs less mana to cast.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Solric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Keith Wiseman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:keithw@...\">keithw@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, May 26, 1999 10:58 AM<br/>\nTo: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&#39;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_wizards] Spell Resistance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Keith Wiseman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:keithw@...\">keithw@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSame problem here with abnormal amounts of resists with Lvl 20 spells...<br/>\nThis is quite different from any other new level spells in the past.<br/>\nEnough of a difference to conclude that Lvl 20 spells were programmed<br/>\ndifferently or there was a change in a patch that affects all spells that<br/>\njust coincided with my reaching lvl 20...<br/>\n<br/>\n -----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: James Dwyer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdwar@...\">jdwar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI just reached lvl 20, got all my spells, and I guess am a little<br/>\ndissapointed. I do enjoy blasting for 170 points of damage, but it&#39;s<br/>\nalmost as if Verant has made these new spells EASIER to resist. For<br/>\ninstance, I fight Orcs in oasis. Low blue orcs and they are resisting my<br/>\nnew shock spell. They NEVER resist my 16th level lightning bolt. You<br/>\nwould think that a higher level spell would be as or harder to resist.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example is enstill. This ONLY works on greens. There is no blue,<br/>\nwhite, yellow, red that I have found that is successfully enstilled. In<br/>\nfact, when I fight the 20th level orcs that con black to me, they always<br/>\nresist. Yet root works on them about 25% of the time. I was hoping that<br/>\nwhen I got enstill it would be easier to solo because it is more<br/>\npowerful, alas it isn&#39;t so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am heading to Lake Rathe now and hopefully my spells work better<br/>\nthere. If not, mayhaps we should petition to get this change. I mean<br/>\ncome on, I am about as useful as a 16th level wizard against red if<br/>\nBLUES resist my new 20th level spells. While monsters are getting<br/>\nprogressively better I seem to be getting progressively incapable to<br/>\nhandle them.<br/>\n<br/>\nCroesus Illuminatus (Xegony)<br/>\n*Tanks stab em, Wizards slab em*<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nONElist:  where the world talks!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nJoin a new list today.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
