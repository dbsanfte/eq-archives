I will try to<br/>\ngive some good advice for getting to where I am and for doing well once you<br/>\nget here.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I strongly recommend is travel.  I started in Felwithe (being a<br/>\nhigh elf) and faught around there up to 5th level or so, then I moved on to<br/>\nthe orcs of crushbone for a couple levels (up to about 8th I think).  At<br/>\nthat time I went to Butcherblock where I found lots of good stuff to hunt<br/>\nincluding goblins, scarabs, drakes, and undead skeletons (at the<br/>\nchessboard).  Most or all of this time (levels 6 through 10) I was in a<br/>\nsmall group of 2 to 4 people.  At this point I felt ready to travel a bit<br/>\nand went to the continent of antonica.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere I started fighting in the North desert of Ro (again in a group) for<br/>\ngood money and xp.  We could fight desert scarabs, tarantulas, madmen, and<br/>\ndervishes.  I leveled up till 12th or 13th level here when I decided to head<br/>\nwest.  I went from Freeport all the way to Qeynos on the west side of<br/>\nAntonica and then across to Erudin on the western island of Odus.  While<br/>\ntravelling I stopped in as many places as I could find.  I went to the<br/>\ndungeons of Befallen (off west commons), Splitpaw (off of S. Karana), and<br/>\nBlackburrow (off Qeynos hills) and did as much adventuring as possible in<br/>\neach.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe key to travelling is 12th level I feel, because at that point you can<br/>\nbind yourself along your journey.  The point of travelling is to get a feel<br/>\nfor the lands.  I discovered lots of new zones and areas to fight (and earn<br/>\nmoney) that I would not have had a knowledge of unless I travelled (and<br/>\nreading spoiler sites barely scratches the surface of what you will find in<br/>\nareas, trust me).<br/>\n<br/>\nI leveled up to 14th in blackburrow and then went with a newly met friend<br/>\nback east to the beholder maze.  This area is really cool yet dangerous.  I<br/>\nwill go back there around 16th level when I can fight more effectively<br/>\nagainst the higher level beasts there.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow still at level 14 (close to 15th) I made my way back to freeport and am<br/>\ncurrently fighting caimans in oasis (solo for the first time in a while) and<br/>\nam doing really well.  I had tried soloing these caimans at level 12 and 13<br/>\nand I just barely couldnt do it.  But now at level 14 I can root (which is<br/>\nholding surprisingly well) and have enough mana to kill a caiman (which con<br/>\nblue by the way) and still have about 20% mana left when done.  One time I<br/>\nencountered a pretty nasty one that seemed to have high resistance against<br/>\nmy spells (did 2 damage and 4 damage instead of 80).  I had to get a little<br/>\nhelp to finish this one off, but that was the only one I really had a<br/>\nproblem with.  Soloing caimans and resting I can earn about a bubble of xp<br/>\nper hour (not much loot but good xp) which is pretty good I feel.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo If you are wondering why you cant solo very well at level 8 or 9 or 10,<br/>\nits because we just cant.  Root is way too unreliable usually, and we just<br/>\ndont have the mana to cast it 2 or 3 times that might be needed to get a<br/>\ngood hold.  We dont have enough hp to take the damage while getting root<br/>\noff, and we dont have enough mana left to kill the beast after rooting.<br/>\nTrust me by about level 14th this will all get better.  I can now solo very<br/>\neffectively I feel and will probably level up to 16th very quickly and by<br/>\nmyself.  After grouping from levels 5 to 14, I am ready for a little solo<br/>\nplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this has been really long, but the basic fact is that you have to<br/>\nplay in a group most of the time.  Travel a lot and you will find areas that<br/>\nare solo viable and new ways to make good money.  Through my travels I didnt<br/>\nearn much xp but put about 40 plat in the bank in just a few days of play<br/>\n(not bad for level 13).  Find a good group and enjoy group play, but know<br/>\nthat you will be able to solo if you take the time to explore new areas.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Solric of the 4th circle</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
