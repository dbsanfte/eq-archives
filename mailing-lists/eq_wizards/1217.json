I am an advocate of it because of the Pugius, the <br/>\nfanged skull stilleto, and the certain skull that was talked about so many <br/>\ntimes prior.  With a Pugius right now at lvl 13, and the skull, life is much <br/>\neasier.  Plus 20 mana is better than the runed staff can provide, and the <br/>\nPugius attacks much, much quicker.  I am still looking for a fanged skull <br/>\nstilleto (anyone know where to get them), but once I have found one, life <br/>\nwill be much easier.<br/>\nZaeq, Wizard of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
