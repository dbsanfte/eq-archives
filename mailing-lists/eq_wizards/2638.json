The only one that I have used with success<br/>\nis Tishan&#39;s Clash which also is resisted so I use it with caution.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Rallos Zek, yes I do see many people quitting and I think that their<br/>\nreasons for the most part are valid.  The two most powerful classes for PvP<br/>\nand dueling in my opinion are the Wizard and Druid(People say Necros too but<br/>\nI haven&#39;t seen enough of them in PvP situations to make a judgement on<br/>\nthem).  There IS skill involved in dueling but the classes weren&#39;t designed<br/>\nfor balance in PvP.  If a caster knows what they are doing, A melee type<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t stand a chance.  I have seen a few duels where a well played melee<br/>\nclass destroys the caster.  A monk with JBoots is a hard fight for a caster<br/>\nin an enclosed area...  I have also seen a level 31 Bard annihilate a 35<br/>\nWizard.  And that fight was won with skill and knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least these quittin guys are gettin some cash sellin their characters on<br/>\nEbay =)<br/>\n<br/>\nEuros Arcane<br/>\nRallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Tom Bratina [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gbratina@...\">gbratina@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, July 02, 1999 5:29 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_wizards] Dueling Tip<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Tom Bratina&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gbratina@...\">gbratina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nahhh.  i like that. and u can cast about 15-20 of those suckers too for a<br/>\nnice 83dmg.  any other spells that disrupt?  from what i can tell, force<br/>\nshock and frost shock knock u back a step or two when cast????  i think we<br/>\nneed another stun spell somewhere between tishan and markar (lvl 20 and lvl<br/>\n49).<br/>\n<br/>\nSinlaru Ce`alen<br/>\nRallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\nps. euros, ur on rz right? im noticing a LOT of ppl quitting because of the<br/>\nterrible combat engine and imbalance in PvP combat.  seems like if<br/>\neverything isn&#39;t perfectly setup (ie. a duel) then the outcome is 99%<br/>\npredictable (save for guild wars which are non-existent on the server now).<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: James Guintu &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:james@...\">james@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Friday, July 02, 1999 6:30 AM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Dueling Tip<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;James Guintu&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:james@...\">james@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I was messing around with some friends (whom are all casting classes and me<br/>\n&gt;as a wiz) tonight and discovered(from a tip) something very interesting...<br/>\n&gt;At higher levels everyone&#39;s DD spells take a while to cast...  Our secret<br/>\n&gt;weapon is our level 12 DD spell shock of lightning.  It is hardly ever<br/>\n&gt;resisted, casts extremely fast AND interrupts casting.  You can chain cast<br/>\n&gt;this sucker so much faster than other casting classes it&#39;s sick.  Unless my<br/>\n&gt;buddies went to their lower level spells, I would interrupt them every<br/>\n </span></blockquote>time.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Hoping you others out there will share your tips as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Euros Arcane<br/>\n&gt;Rallos Zek<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nWho is the most visited e-mail list community Web Service?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nONElist.com - where more than 20 million e-mails are exchanged each day!<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
