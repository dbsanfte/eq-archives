Give me a tell if you see me Askur.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, can anybody here confirm that there IS such a thing as an Ancient <br/>\nCyclops that wanders S. Ro?   Nobody I know has ever seen it.  I went there <br/>\nlast night and asked around...nobody there knew either.  Trying to find that <br/>\nring off of it for JBoots.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note, Shock Spiral of Al&#39;Kabor isn&#39;t bad.  I finally tried some AE <br/>\nagainst those deepwater goblin pets.  113 dmg for all MoBs around me and it <br/>\ndidn&#39;t seem to ever get interrupted despite getting whacked at from 3 or 4 <br/>\nMobs at once.  I like how it kicks back a little too...keeps you out of the <br/>\nfray for a while longer.  You guys who use AE might be on to something <br/>\nhere.....   ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n30 Wiz Veeshan</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
