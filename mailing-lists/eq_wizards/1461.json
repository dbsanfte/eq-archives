I agree with you 100% as I also played a Mage up through<br/>\n17th and know exactly what you&#39;re talking about.  I&#39;m very happy with my<br/>\nwizard and the wizard class in general.  Yes, there are some disadvantages<br/>\nto being a wizard, but the same is true for all classes and I rather think<br/>\nthe advantages far outweigh the disadvantages.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalarin Kal&#39;Amon, High Elven Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rival@...\">rival@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, May 17, 1999 9:53 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] wizard vrs magicians minor spoiler,long<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rival@...\">rival@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have just started playing a wizard, only 9th right now, however i have<br/>\ntwo magicians on different servers. One is 20th lvl the other 16th. So not<br/>\nto add fuel to the fire, but a mage does 91+1 dam every lvl after 16 with<br/>\nhis shock of flame spell while the wiz does 117, so i have been told. Now i<br/>\nheard it stated on this board that a mage doesn&#39;t recieve any more DD spells<br/>\nuntil 24 this however is incorrect; the mage gets a spell at 20th. Bolt of<br/>\nflame which does 141+ 1 per lvl after 20.( Note that both these spells have<br/>\ndamage caps of 99 and 150ish) i am not certain what the wiz does at 20.<br/>\n&gt;  However just remember the grass is always greener syndrome. Mage spells<br/>\nare very slow to cast compared to wiz. Mages also recieve no spells such as<br/>\nshadow step or root for escape. If the pet dies the mage is in<br/>\nrouble( losing pets happens quite a bit. Remember pet death=mages death<br/>\nalmost always).. Pets also dont always follow you closely and will attack<br/>\nmonsters you dont want them too sometimes.  Yhere are many zones that have<br/>\nterrible construction on them so that a pet can not be used at all. Any time<br/>\na mage is travelling if he does not have his pet he is screwed. If attacked<br/>\nhe will never be able to cast his spells fast enough to save himself if the<br/>\nmonster is high blue or above. Mages also require more down time just to<br/>\nstart. Load into a dungeon summon pet med back 3 bubbles of mana hope train<br/>\ndoesnt come by and make you load and start all over again. Also of course<br/>\npets randomly kill them selves and get lost in dungeons making dungeons<br/>\nharder to do as a mage. And as pets fall behind the caster in lvls they<br/>\nbring in the green monsters that would not mess with the mage normally and i<br/>\ncan assure you that enough greens will still kill you.<br/>\n&gt; Now dont take this wrong I liked my mage a lot but i think you guys only<br/>\nsee the advantages none of the disads. As a wizard i love being at full<br/>\ncombat readiness even when we just zoned, and not needing to stop and think<br/>\nthat if i zone my pet will be gone, and i&#39;m running out of components to<br/>\ncast him and on and on. Wizards have there own advantages and disads. At low<br/>\nlvls mages are much more powerful if they have thier pets but much less<br/>\nwithout. Anyway dont despair about wizz they just need a higer lvl to obtain<br/>\nthier power. If you are impatient play a necro or mage to get power now but<br/>\nyou will find that they all have thier weaknesses too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s finally here!
