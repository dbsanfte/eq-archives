I have no idea<br/>\nif that is good or not, but it is perfectly fine for me because I dont<br/>\ncome anywhere near dying.� I also realize that that may change as I<br/>\nadvance in level, but I tend to move around a lot so I think I should be<br/>\nfine.� Playing that early also means that it is very difficult to group,<br/>\nseems like everyone else is out soloing as well...I dont know, maybe its<br/>\nthe time of day?� As well, I have a full time job as Sr. Technical<br/>\nIllustrator which means that I only play 2 hours or so a day, so I am not<br/>\nexpecting to be 20th level already.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&lt;font size=3&gt;�&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=2&gt;Actually what truly baffles me is why some people<br/>\nseem so dead set against getting Verant to change Wizard spells.� Whats<br/>\nwrong with fixing something thats broken?� Everyday they keep patching<br/>\nnon-working aspects of this game and yet noone seems to care enough to<br/>\nfix Wizard spells, probably because noone complains enough.� Or instead<br/>\nof fixing spells, replace useless ones with some of those beautiful<br/>\nTeleport Other (or was it Tap Affinity?) spells that were mentioned here<br/>\na while ago.� Awesome.� Fits right in with class description and people<br/>\nwould be clamouring for Wizards to be in their group, even at the lower<br/>\nlevels.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&lt;font size=3&gt;�&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=2&gt;Well I was going to get in to which spells should be<br/>\nchanged and why, but I have yammered on too long as it is.� So I will<br/>\nsave it for another post =)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&lt;font size=3&gt;�&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=2&gt;Alhassim 9th Level Erudite Wizard of <br/>\nE&#39;ci&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n��������������� ^ (see that number...its still going up!� woo hoo!)&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n&lt;/html&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
