Wizards are 99% <br/>\ndirect damage.  It does get boring after awhile, med. nuke nuke, med. repeat <br/>\nas necessary. <br/>\nWhile a necromancer has a pet, mage gets a pet, enchanter gets a ton of <br/>\nspells and each class can use some direct damage.  Shamans and druids... well <br/>\nthey are just great and have a ton of diversity.  However we are wizards and <br/>\nthe exact opposite of warriors.  Warriors do nothing but bash in close combat <br/>\nand they are damn good at it.  Wizards do nothing but destroy with magic and <br/>\nthey are damn good at that.  We are the only class that can teleport to other <br/>\nplanes &quot;although secret entrances do exist for the people that don&#39;t want to <br/>\nfind a wizard&quot;.  Our travel spells are very nice as are our area affect <br/>\nspells at high levels with a party.  You pay a price with power and that <br/>\nprice is a lack of diversity I think.  Truely no one can come close to the <br/>\ndamage a wizard can do in less then 5 seconds.  Truely a sight to see when a <br/>\n20th leve MOB is beating on your level 8 party and you can&#39;t hit it, then a <br/>\n36th level wizard walks by we yelled for help, he casts one spell and the MOB <br/>\ndies like that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDiversity Suggestions..<br/>\nWizard Only Special Robes and more graphics for them.  I must say the ones <br/>\nthey have now are great, but more couldn&#39;t help.  Again more quests and fix <br/>\nthe broken ones, this is everquest after all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI for one belive in the power of the wizard and I do know that brad and <br/>\nverant have absolutely no intent of changing them.  I quote &quot;Wizards are by <br/>\nfar the most balanced casting class and to change anything to them now would <br/>\ndestroy 1 years worth of game balancing&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAdaar<br/>\nEruidte Wizard Welcoming all comments =)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
