First of<br/>\nall the library is in 3rd Gate.  There are basically 3 big buildings in 3rd<br/>\ngate, the stores are the smaller buildings.  These three building are the<br/>\nthiefs guild, the necro guild, and the library.  The necro guild you may<br/>\nknow is behind one of the other 2 big buildings, either the thief guild or<br/>\nthe library.  If the library is not in front of the necro guild, then it is<br/>\nthe other big building in 3rd gate.  Just look around for it, won&#39;t take you<br/>\nlong, it&#39;s hard to miss.
