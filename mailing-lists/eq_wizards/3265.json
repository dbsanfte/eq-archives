And until it gets old, thse group teleports<br/>\n&gt; are fun to play with.

Nice too feel needed with your group Teles. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not had any problem with fizzles since about level 16, so I&#39;m<br/>\nusing Inferno Shock and loving it. I don&#39;t know what good Thunder Strike<br/>\nis, though. Is it just useless?<br/>\n<br/>\nToo bad I failed all my research attempts for level 29 spells. But I<br/>\nthink I&#39;ll probably keep using column of Lightning as my AE anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nSergey<br/>\n<br/>\nWorker bees can leave<br/>\nEven drones can fly away<br/>\nThe queen is their slave</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
