But at higher","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1911039825\">First off.. you guys are still low lvls.. and everybody does pretty much the <br/>\nsame dmg... clerics, wiz, shamans, mages.. no real big difference.  But at <br/>\nhigher lvls us wizards there are no equal.  At 24 you get a 200dmg DD.  at <br/>\n30 you get one that does 300dmg plus stuns.  Shamans are weak healers, weak <br/>\nfighters, and weak nukers at high lvls.  At high lvls, everybody will ahve <br/>\njourneyman&#39;s boots or the new Rings of Running (please don&#39;t ask me about <br/>\nthem, i do&#39;nt know enough info to really talk about them), so they&#39;re SoW <br/>\nwill be useless.  Plus, us wiz get teleportation and plane travelling spells <br/>\nthat no other class except the druid has.  Believe me, at lvl 30+ certain <br/>\nclasses are pretty much useless.. shamans and mages come to mind (pets are <br/>\ncrap and their attack spells are crap.. nobody likes the pet eating the exp. <br/>\neither).  Tell your shaman friend about the group portals, evacuation, and <br/>\nplane portal spells he will never have.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m a level 11 wizard about to turn 12.  Well my friend is a shaman who <br/>\n&gt;just<br/>\n&gt;turned 14. Well he just brought<br/>\n&gt;his new damage spell and he said it does 77 damage, to which i replied kewl<br/>\n&gt;my next spell does that amount<br/>\n&gt;too. That was a mistake he started laughing and saying things like &quot;why<br/>\n&gt;would anyone want to play the wizard<br/>\n&gt;when they can play the shaman&quot;.  &quot;the shaman can stand toe to toe like the<br/>\n&gt;warrior and do the same damage<br/>\n&gt;as the wizard, Ha HA HA HA .....&quot; . Then he went on saying crap like now he<br/>\n&gt;knows the shaman is the best<br/>\n&gt;class in the game. All he could talk about before was the sow spell, and <br/>\n&gt;now<br/>\n&gt;it is he does the same damage<br/>\n&gt;as the wizard.  My question is this, i thought i picked the wizard so i<br/>\n&gt;would not have to hear stuff like this?<br/>\n&gt;I thought level 12 was when the wizard started to leave other mage class<br/>\n&gt;behind.  Know i have to hear alot<br/>\n&gt;aggraviating crap from this shaman, laughing at the wizard class. Dam that<br/>\n&gt;is going to suck.  Someone<br/>\n&gt;please tell me there is hope out there as far as the damage spells go. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
