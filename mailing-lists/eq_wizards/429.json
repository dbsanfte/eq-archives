Hold on there, Iggie didn&#39;t say YOU, he said that there are a lot<br/>\nof +pvp players that are jerks. There are also a ton of -pvp players that<br/>\nare jerks as well. I&#39;ll tell you about Elyas the loser Paladin on Solusek Ro<br/>\nsometime. Enabling +pvp or -pvp is a choice you make, and because Verant has<br/>\ndecided to offer you this choice, it is also up to them to protect players<br/>\nthat don&#39;t share a +pvp view. They&#39;ve given you &#39;free zones&#39; where even -pvp<br/>\nplayers are fair game, they&#39;ve given you an entire +pvp server. I don&#39;t see<br/>\nwhat more they can offer? Are thee bugs, yes that&#39;s true, but I think that<br/>\nfixing global bugs that affect everyone will be more of a priority than bugs<br/>\nthat affect a single class. So you have restrictions that I do not have as<br/>\na -pvp wizard. It was your choice, so live with it. Learn to get around it,<br/>\nand I&#39;m sure that you&#39;ll have a much better experience for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n    You also have to remember that it&#39;s THEIR world  you&#39;re in, so you have<br/>\nto conform to them, they don&#39;t have to conform to you, even though a lot of<br/>\nplayer suggestions have been implemented. I&#39;m still waiting for a patch that<br/>\nwill save the choice of how I view servers. Why would anyone want to view by<br/>\nnumber of players once you&#39;ve created and levelled your characters is a<br/>\nmystery to me. : )<br/>\n<br/>\n    Try and remember that there&#39;s nothing that they&#39;ve done is to be<br/>\nintentionally harmful to the -pvp class, but given a choice the majority has<br/>\nto rule, and that majority is -pvp. Their priorities concerning +pvp will<br/>\nalways come first. However, non combat spells you should be able to cast on<br/>\nothers. Bind Affinity, O&#39;Keils radiation, Invisibility, great spells, and<br/>\nI&#39;m behind you 110% in that you should be able to use them on others. I&#39;m<br/>\nsure they&#39;ll change it in the future, but how long depends on how hard it is<br/>\nto code.<br/>\n<br/>\nZalbar<br/>\n14th Wizard<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: John Cuyle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johncuyle@...\">johncuyle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: 22 avril, 1999 12:08<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Re: Digest Number 18<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;John Cuyle&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johncuyle@...\">johncuyle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There you have it, even players say &quot;screw you, +PvP people.
