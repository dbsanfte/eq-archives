I&#39;m pretty sure they still<br/>\n&gt; aggro me sometimes though...even at 38, I&#39;ve known them to jump on me.  Of<br/>\n&gt; course, this happens more often than not when I&#39;m TPing into Cazic with<br/>\n&gt; someone else...you&#39;re more likely displaced a little bit off of the pyramid<br/>\n&gt; where the lizzies will jump you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually there is an easy way to gate to cazic. if the roamer jump you ,<br/>\njust root it , step back and inviso yourself and run away west.<br/>\ni used this gate a bunch of time and never got any trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nHanidus 50 wiz of karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
