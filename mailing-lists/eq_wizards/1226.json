At the start of a new level I start off with my great<br/>\nstaff, then I move on to my trusty cracked staff, and I finish off the level<br/>\nwith my snake fang.  During level 4 and 5 I tried to work on my hand2hand, but<br/>\nalas I am not a monk.  Also something I&#39;ve noticed, you can improve on your<br/>\nthrowing skills by attacking &quot;con green&quot; mobs.  The simple reason I go through<br/>\nall of this is because sooner or later Verant will probably introduce new<br/>\nweapons to the game, and whatever skill it uses, I want to be ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy Hunting<br/>\n<br/>\nMalkin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
