If you actually know how to get<br/>\nthe spell that takes you there, please tell me.  I would love to have a<br/>\nteleport there, but to date I have never seen the actual spell.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, regarding the other question about the Cazic-Thule gate, if you go<br/>\nstrait west from the teleport pyramid, you will come to the door to<br/>\ncourtyard.  The path curves a bit, but go as close to strait west as<br/>\npossible, and you should be able to find your way out.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Shadowwalker</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
