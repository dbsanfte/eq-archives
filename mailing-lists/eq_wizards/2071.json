Remember how you could only put ONE point in at lvl 16 well<br/>\nonce you hit lvl 20 (something to do with that spell circle) you can then<br/>\npump many more points into it from your guildmaster. And then each level<br/>\nthereafter.

I had been collecting runes for a while, so I had a sizable<br/>\n&gt; collection in the bank.  Just thought I would share the results.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Project Lightning - I had enough runes to attempt this spell twice.  The<br/>\n&gt; first attempt failed, the second one succeeded!  My first spell!  Ok, 1<br/>\n&gt; out of 2 is not bad.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Pillar of Fire - Well, I only had one rune of nagafen, so I could only<br/>\n&gt; attempt this one once.  It failed.  Now at 1 of 3 attempts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Identify - Now I had heard this spell was useless, but I figured I still<br/>\n&gt; wanted to play with research.  I had enough runes to attempt this spell<br/>\n&gt; 4 times.  I had 3 failures and a success on the fourth try.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Total success rate:  2 out of 7 tries.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure if the research skill ever goes up, mine did not.
