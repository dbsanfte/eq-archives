Goblin Wizard in BB is the <br/>\nexample I&#39;ll cite. I&#39;ve seen him be interrupted numerous times, by me, <br/>\nas I blast him into oblivion for not taking back what he said about my <br/>\nmother. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for getting experience in a group, I find the best results occur <br/>\nwhen you group with people of your own level, with no one higher than <br/>\none level above you. Depending on what you&#39;re killing, you may do well <br/>\neven with people 2 levels above you in the group, but for the most <br/>\npart stick with your own level as much as you can.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally - I reached 8th level, got some sort of fire bolt spell that <br/>\ndoes 45 points/shot. Talk about an attention-getter! I use it in CB to <br/>\nblast Cents and Legionnaires, so my party has less work to do to <br/>\nfinish them off. <br/>\n<br/>\nEventually, I&#39;ll post something on mana conservation, a topic near and <br/>\ndear to all our hearts..<br/>\n<br/>\nVash, 8th Rank of Wizardry, Felwithe, E&#39;Ci<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
