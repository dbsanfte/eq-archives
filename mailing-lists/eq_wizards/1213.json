Perhaps it is just the<br/>\n&gt; personality of my character that he enjoys helping others and gets full<br/>\n&gt; satisfaction out of the good deed itself, not needing any sort of physical<br/>\n&gt; compensation.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is also why I suggested you invest in useful life-saving spells<br/>\nbefore checking Bind. If someone binds me, I&#39;ll give something (usually the<br/>\ngold I have at hand) if possible, but do not expect to be given something<br/>\nonce it&#39;s me doing the binding.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might charge something (probably) symbolic once I get to the gates and<br/>\nportals levels, since I took upon the Wizard class almost solely for the<br/>\npurpose of using these spells (I enjoy teleport. I always end up a gaming<br/>\nsession by bowing to friends, then gating for the fun of it. Even when I<br/>\nwas in Faydark&#39;s Orc camp and moving back to Felwithe). &quot;Newbie transport<br/>\nservice. Express from Faydark to Erud or Queynos.

I remember when I was level 8 just travelling over<br/>\n&gt; to freeport.  I only had a couple of my new 3rd circle spells because they<br/>\n&gt; were so expensive and I was flat broke.  I saw people auctioning: &quot;Binding<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One trick, which works for some spells only alas: Look at other guild<br/>\nmerchant. Some have spells that are shared across classes, and are of lower<br/>\ncircle than ours for other classes. Why, I was surprised at the Freeport<br/>\nguild of finding an Sense Summoned (level 8) for 4gp... until I realised<br/>\nthe merchant was a Magician merchant (and they get Sense at level 4)...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I guess it is just based on your roleplaying style, but even if I have no<br/>\n&gt; money and still have spells to buy, I would not ask for or accept any sort<br/>\n&gt; of payment for using my talents.  Does anyone else agree with me or do you<br/>\n&gt; all think that you SHOULD rightfully earn a profit from using your skills?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Alas, I am afraid it is the only part of the player economy that works...<br/>\nbecause it costs nothing to make :(<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
