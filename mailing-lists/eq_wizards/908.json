It <br/>\n&gt;stands just inside the zone entrance of Ak&#39;Anon, usually very near, if not <br/>\n&gt;right on top of, a clockwork jeweler.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So, the upshot is, if you chose Tunare as deity, you will be attacked the <br/>\n&gt;instant you enter Ak&#39;Anon.  You can try running away into the city, but I <br/>\n&gt;have never witnessed anyone successful at that.  Also, I have once observed <br/>\n&gt;this merchant running into a wall farther into the city, but that was only <br/>\n&gt;one time.  Every other time I have been into Ak&#39;Anon, it has been right <br/>\n&gt;there at the entrance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
