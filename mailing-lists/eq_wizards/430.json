I assume he is in the East Freeport zone and not<br/>\n<br/>\nNorth Ro?<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t found the locked box.  I made the same mistake thinking you could<br/>\nswim to the island, but after re-reading the info you are given, I believe you<br/>\nhave<br/>\nto take the boat out.  I have taken the boat out to the first island stop,<br/>\nsearched<br/>\nand found nothing.  I also made it to the second stop, searched and found<br/>\nnothing.<br/>\nI had to stop playing at this point, but I understand there is one more island<br/>\nstop<br/>\n(it was my first trip on the boat).  Let me know if you find it or get any<br/>\nmore<br/>\ninformation.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the bright side, my swimming skill is pretty high now!<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                                        Thanks<br/>\nagain,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSoren<br/>\n<br/>\nBilly Sun wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Billy Sun&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bsun@...\">bsun@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lydl Mastat is near the East Freeport.  He walks around between 1pm to 7pm<br/>\n&gt; game time.  In regard to the second quest, where did you find the locked<br/>\n&gt; box?

Find Lydl Mastat outside of Freeport and get the locked book from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; him.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have tried to find him out both gates, in North Ro, and in East<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Commanlands<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and can&#39;t find him.  Where is he?  Does he only appear at certain<br/>\n&gt; &gt; times?  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have looked MANY times and can&#39;t find him.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2.  Get the locked strongbox back.  I have found that the box is on an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; island<br/>\n&gt; &gt; which is straight out from the docks.  Is it possible to swim there or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do I need<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a boat?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Soren<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Are you hogging all the fun?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Friends tell friends about ONElist!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking to expand your world?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ONElist has over 115,000 e-mail communities from which to chose! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
