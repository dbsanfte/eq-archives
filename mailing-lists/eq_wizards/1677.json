These players then hand their unused items to friends who<br/>\nthen hand them to the newbie character.  <br/>\n  The only problem with this is that the item will not be that useful<br/>\nto the new low level character.  This person will receive the benefits<br/>\nof the robes but due to their low level, will still get pounded by orc<br/>\npawns without problem.  Level has the majority factor in these cases. <br/>\nYes it irritates me too.  Im level 21 and still have these stupid Sr.<br/>\nApprentice robes.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Ziffnab of Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Neil Lambert &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:smartass@...\">smartass@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; i was in the bank at freeport today when i saw the<br/>\n&gt; most horrifying thing i&#39;ve ever seen. a LEVEL TWO<br/>\n&gt; erudite magician (how&#39;d she get there??) with a<br/>\n&gt; FLOWING BLACK ROBE and RUNED TOTEM<br/>\n&gt; STAFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; this should be against the rules<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;HR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;<br/>\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;<br/>\n&lt;META content=&quot;text/html; charset=windows-1252&quot;<br/>\nhttp-equiv=Content-Type&gt;<br/>\n&lt;META content=&quot;MSHTML 5.00.2014.210&quot; name=GENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BODY bgColor=#ffffff&gt;<br/>\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;i was in the bank at freeport today when i saw the<br/>\nmost <br/>\nhorrifying thing i&#39;ve ever seen. a LEVEL TWO erudite magician (how&#39;d<br/>\nshe get <br/>\nthere??) with a FLOWING BLACK ROBE and RUNED TOTEM <br/>\nSTAFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;this should be against the<br/>\nrules&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
