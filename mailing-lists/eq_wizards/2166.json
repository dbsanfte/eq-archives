I went to the karanas.  Instead of enstill I had root memed.  I didn&#39;t have Force Shock memed either.  To my suprise the root rooted griffawns and griffines great.  They resisted my enstill all the time when I tried to solo out in the karanas last time.  Then to kill it I just used any spell other then Force Shock.  I soloed fine.  A druid friend of mine and I then got together and killed reds very easily.  Great exp for 2 people.   Well it seem to be that the lower level spells work better.  Perhpas enstill will work well when I am 30ish.<br/>\n<br/>\nVenlaan<br/>\n21st DE Wizard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
