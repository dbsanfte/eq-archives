The XP there just sucks, ok you can get XP to but for the most part your group will be zoning and waiting for members to get back when dieing. It can make a difrence if your in a group with close friends but mostley you will not do much fighting. I went to south karana and Lake Rahathe and WOW i made a litle more then 2 bubbles of XP in 4 hours of fighting.. I�m staying there thats for sure!!..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n/Askur Gnome &quot;happy again&quot;  Wizard of Veeshan <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Why do WOMEN ASTRONAUTS have such BAD HAIRCUTS?<br/>\n&gt;What happens if you CLEAN your self-cleaning OVEN?  <br/>\n&gt;The DR. has answers:&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.drscience.com/u\">http://www.drscience.com/u</a> &quot;&gt;Click&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
