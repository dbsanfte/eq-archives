I think that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we (or everybody) should get spells every lvl or every other lvl.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Especially for wizards.  My friend who is a lvl 5 enchanter almost has<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more spells then I do.  They gave us so many useless spells.  Like the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; low lvl Sphere of light.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another case of not thinking about what others need. You are probably a<br/>\n&gt; High Elf, and fail to see that human wizards need this spell, as they<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t see in the night.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Sergey<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
