This is my first (and probably last) mailing list and I didn&#39;t realize that they are only for one-shot answers to questions.

Besides having beta tested for UO, playing Everquest and various info searches, I dont really spend any &quot;social&quot; time online and didnt realize that I was breaking Netiquette rules here.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
