I have, at<br/>\none time in my EQ life, sold binds to others for about 6gp per cast.  I did<br/>\nthis because I was flat broke and needed coins to buy spells.  Once I was<br/>\nestablished I will do the this for free because my char has been in tough<br/>\ntimes and will help others as that is his nature.  Most of the time it gets<br/>\nhim into trouble because he always stays to the end of the fight and<br/>\nnormally will die to save his party.  Thing is, he is always welcome in any<br/>\nparty he has been with before...I know of many that are not welcometo join<br/>\ncertain groups,,fortunately he is not one of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Ziffnab of Xegony<br/>\n19th Wiz<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Marziani, Michael D.

I am only hoping<br/>\nto elicit some other opinions on this subject as well.<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t know why but it has never made sense to me to charge for services<br/>\nsuch as binding, invis, and language training.  Perhaps it is just the<br/>\npersonality of my character that he enjoys helping others and gets full<br/>\nsatisfaction out of the good deed itself, not needing any sort of physical<br/>\ncompensation.<br/>\n <br/>\nI realize that I will be able to make make up to a plat or more each per<br/>\nbind and a plat or more for invis (depending on how bad they want it) but<br/>\nthat just seems unkind.  I remember when I was level 8 just travelling over<br/>\nto freeport.  I only had a couple of my new 3rd circle spells because they<br/>\nwere so expensive and I was flat broke.  I saw people auctioning: &quot;Binding<br/>\nat S. Gate, 15gp&quot;, and there was no way i could afford that without selling<br/>\nthe few pieces of cloth armor i had left.  I was lucky to find a kind druid<br/>\nthat bound me and asked for nothing in return, but I just wonder why so many<br/>\nseek to earn a profit from their abilities rather than just use them to help<br/>\nothers and take joy in that.<br/>\n <br/>\nI guess it is just based on your roleplaying style, but even if I have no<br/>\nmoney and still have spells to buy, I would not ask for or accept any sort<br/>\nof payment for using my talents.  Does anyone else agree with me or do you<br/>\nall think that you SHOULD rightfully earn a profit from using your skills?<br/>\n <br/>\n-Solric<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ken Morris [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kmorris2@...\">kmorris2@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 11, 1999 2:30 PM<br/>\nTo: EQ Wizards<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Languages<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am excellent in Dragon, Combine, Old Eurdian, Elder Elvish, and am working<br/>\non Elder Tier&#39;Dal today.
