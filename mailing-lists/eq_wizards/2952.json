No questions or answers<br/>\n&gt;about Wizards or Necromancers. I don&#39;t know whether you play any of<br/>\n&gt;those, but if you don&#39;t, it might be a good idea to get a staff member<br/>\n&gt;to represent each caster race as they seem to betaking second third and<br/>\n&gt;fourth places to Enchanters.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Make no mistake, I am not telling you how to run your site, and these<br/>\n&gt;are not demands.
