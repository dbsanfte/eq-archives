It looked no different from the cracked great staff <br/>\n&gt;or fine steel great staff I was using.  The one I&#39;m looking for has <br/>\n&gt;the crooked knot on top?  Anybody know what that staff is?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Don&#39;t get me wrong, the runed totem staff is great and I think I got a <br/>\n&gt;fairly good deal.  But I&#39;ve been jealously looking at other cool mages <br/>\n&gt;with this big staff in their hands.  I&#39;ve got a list of creatures I&#39;d <br/>\n&gt;love to give a good WHACK on the backside to with this staff. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Good day,<br/>\n&gt;-- LimDul<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The staff your thinking of is a crook.<br/>\nI haven&#39;t seen damage and speed factors for it.  I assume its probably<br/>\nslower and for more damage than a standard Great Staff.  The really nice<br/>\nCrook that people have been carrying around is the Glowing Wooden Crook<br/>\nthat can be found on Lockjaw in Oasis.  Level 20 Crocodile.  However this<br/>\nparticular crook is not usable by Enchanters, Mages, or Wizards.  Its only<br/>\nusable by Druids, Shamen, Clerics and everyone else.  I am not sure if<br/>\nwizards can use normal crooks, but this particular one they can not.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the upper teens and mid 20s the ruined totem is probably one of the<br/>\nbetter staves to have.  Since it can hit magical creatures.  Very nice to<br/>\nhave if you want to take out a ghoul.  Root Nuke and if he is still alive<br/>\nat least you can hit him without the ghoul being INVULNERABLE.  Same for<br/>\nAir Elementals.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
