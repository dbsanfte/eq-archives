However, I read many<br/>\n&gt;reports from beta testers, guides and other people before setting out<br/>\n&gt;on the path of the wizard and have a question relating to that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What confuses me, now after playing the game myself, are all the tips<br/>\n&gt;in various &quot;wizard guides&quot; about the importance of avoiding hits as a<br/>\n&gt;wizard. That it is important is obvious, but how should one manage<br/>\n&gt;it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I decided to &quot;solo&quot; the first five levels in order to learn the game.<br/>\n&gt;My experience from that time is that it is almost impossible to avoid<br/>\n&gt;being hit during combat. Now at level seven I mostly team up with a<br/>\n&gt;necromancer friend of mine and it is much easier avoiding getting<br/>\n&gt;hit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What do the guides mean? Are the advice for higher levels where one<br/>\n&gt;have access to &quot;killed on impact&quot; spells or am I missing something<br/>\n&gt;obvious? What can one do except running away when trying to avoid<br/>\n&gt;hits? Is it the &quot;mini teleportation spells&quot; that are referred to or<br/>\n&gt;what? Please enlighten me so that I can continue my hitherto very<br/>\n&gt;rewarding and highly enjoying career as a wizard!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Regards,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Zachris, dark elf wizard of Bertoxxulous<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----<br/>\n&gt;Henrik Bergstr�m<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:henrik@...\">henrik@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Have you visited the new ONElist home page lately?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;ONElist: The Leading e-mail list and community service on the Internet!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
