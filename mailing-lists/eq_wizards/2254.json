This creates serious problem to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-358037101\">One very anoying thing what i have seen is that a you are not in<br/>\npossibility to see active spells on other players or mobs. This creates<br/>\nserious problem to recast SOW, Armours or other buffs and also can be<br/>\ninteresting to see what buffs have some particular mob.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne solution to this problem can be introduction of new spell &quot;Detect<br/>\nmagic&quot; wich when is active gives possibility to see active spells on other<br/>\nPC and NPC. It can give on left part of screen same list of spell icons<br/>\nwhat you have on right side for spells active on yourself this dont look as<br/>\ntoo hard to program and all grafic alredy exist for it. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf there are some possibilitys here can be introdced some variants like<br/>\npossibility to see only enchantments cast by ourselves or enchantments of<br/>\nour lv or lower in complexity of spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nIcons start flashing if they are to vanish as some armours do now but also<br/>\nfor debuffs or root, enstill what you casted on MOB.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso this can be made so that you can select one of detected spells and<br/>\ncast a &quot; Dispell magic&quot; only on selected spell !!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is my little 2 cents in our effort to make a EQ better (its already<br/>\nbest but can alwas make better :-) )<br/>\n<br/>\nSilverion<br/>\nHigh elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\nFenin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\nmoderator mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
