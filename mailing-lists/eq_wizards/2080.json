The spell resist issue hasnt been a problem for me because my group hasnt been going after that high of reds yet, when we did and my spells got resssed, I stood back and casted Okeil&#39;s on all my party, which granted does not do much dmg, but it was something.<br/>\nNow for the rant. Whay are we so limited in the way we all look. Heck, my friends can go out and buy a bracer or something for as little as 5 pp and they look different. I have been able to scrape together enough pp to buy the Skull of Jen&#39;tar(sp?). I was soo mad to seee the graphics on that!! Instead of looking like I am holding a skull in my hand, it looks as if I am walking around with my hand through a Dounut!!Give me a break Veratnt!!I stand in the hallway on the way to unrest and see all the cool things every one has on and just get madder and madder when I all I have is my hand in a dounut and a sickly green robe!! <br/>\nAnother Rant... Why can Druids cast SOW on others when we cant cast shieldskin on them? If we could cast shield skin on our party, we would be better loved, even if it takes a reagent and SOW does not(whats up with that?).<br/>\nAnyway lets get this petition going and maybe we all can make a few changes.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
