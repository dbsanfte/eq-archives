I&#39;ve found that it works on pretty much anything<br/>\nthat cons blue. This includes, Emperor Crush, Ambassador Dvinn, a whole host<br/>\nof orcs, Crag spiders. Yeah I&#39;ve fizzled but never twice in a row. I&#39;ve had<br/>\nit resisted ONCE by a blue. I wouldn&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;m not casting it<br/>\nmore than once a fight anyways. Takes forever to be able to cast it again,<br/>\nand eats up a TON of mana. I wouldn&#39;t worry about other people&#39;s<br/>\nexperiences. Have your own, and take it from there. Like your mother said,<br/>\nif you friend jumped off the bridge you would have to as well? Seems to me<br/>\nit&#39;s all in perspective. I&#39;ve had a blast with Force Shock.<br/>\n<br/>\nZalbar The Mad<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nJoin a new list today!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
