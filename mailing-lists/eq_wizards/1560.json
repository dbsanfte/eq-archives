Full Netted isn t hard to achieve.

I have seen one level 7 wizard in <br/>\n&gt; full netted with a glowing crook and what I am sure are 2 +15 mana <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Full Netted isn&#39;t hard to achieve. Netted is found on low-level frogloks<br/>\n(and is worth a few percent more than equivalent cloth in stores), and<br/>\nthese guys aren&#39;t far. Even a level 7 wizard should be able to go to<br/>\nInnothule or the Qeynos sewers - if he is careful - and get some.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, mighty high-elf wizard, netted is almost useless. Except for<br/>\nthe &quot;magic&quot; mention, it weights as much as the small pieces of clothing<br/>\n(excepting: pants, girth, shawl) I can afford. For humans it is probably<br/>\nmore desirable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; bracers and 2 +5 mana rings.  Come on!  At 9th I can&#39;t even afford all <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The rest of the stuff smells strongly like twinking. I had two insigna<br/>\nrings by level 7 (which I promptly lent to a monk friend, who has more use<br/>\nof them than I do), but that&#39;s because you can pick a pair for a single<br/>\nPP. Glowing crook? No way :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the useful spells through 8th level and am stuck worth a junky worn GS <br/>\n&gt; but this yahoo is walking around in 200 to 250pp worth of stuff and <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>At level 9, you can solo blue-conning Desert Tarantulas in North Ro.<br/>\nTypical loot per tarantula: Chitin (4-5s), Spider Silk (1 out 2-3, 1g7s),<br/>\nand Poison Sacs (1 out of 5, 4g5 each). I usually make a platinum per 2/3<br/>\nbubble of XP. And I can reassure you, I&#39;m alternating between the worn<br/>\ngreat staff and the dinky tarnished dagger (to get a tarnished dagger,<br/>\nfind a smith, or contact a scout of Tunare - one of their quests yield<br/>\na tarnished dagger).<br/>\n<br/>\nI am now 10, and I already have bought since I got there the 3 levels 12<br/>\nspells I mainly want: Shock of Lightning, Bind Affinity, Cancel Magic.<br/>\nAfter I&#39;ve bought Resistant Skin, the cash I&#39;ll be making will go into<br/>\nextra items purchase, should I find one of interest offered for sale.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I hit 12, I&#39;ll immediately start purchasing all level 16 spells I want,<br/>\nand then resume getting cash for items.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrong hint: Buy the spells first. Take fishing if you need to (about 1pp<br/>\nin 30-40mn, but boring as hell).<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
