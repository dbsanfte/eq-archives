I would say you could probably solo them at 8th to 10th level.<br/>\nYou do have to be careful with the Hunters because they will attack you on<br/>\nsight, so you can end up with others joining the fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best place to find them is just inside the zone entrance from South Ro.<br/>\nThis also leaves easy access to a zone in case things should go bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more piece of advice, stay away from the tower which is on one of the<br/>\nislands in that area.
