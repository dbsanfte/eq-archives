Wizards are a VERY balanced ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1453582571\">I don&#39;t see why everyone keeps wanting more wizard spells, increase wizards <br/>\nspell power, wizards need more of this and that.  Wizards are a VERY balanced <br/>\nclass, verant has admitted this and I have seen it.  Wizards are meant to be <br/>\nweak at low levels, they are meant to not be able to solo large groups of <br/>\nmonster and like every other class at upper levels they are meant to be in a <br/>\ngroup.  All of the suggestions I have seen to increase wizard spells, give us <br/>\na familiar, etc etc, all seem attempts to just give the wizard class that we <br/>\n&quot;like&quot; more power.  I have played every class to at least level 16 and the <br/>\nwizard is by far the most balanced.  If you want to be able to fight large <br/>\namounts of blue monsters play a shadow knight, paladin or warrior.  If you <br/>\nwant a pet then play a necro or magician.  There is no class that can have it <br/>\nall and it is my opinion that when wizards voice their opinions for more of <br/>\nthis and that then all they are wanting is more power.  I truely think that <br/>\nthese people will never be satisfied until with one spell they can kill <br/>\nanything, with one spell they can go to any zone or plane they wish, with one <br/>\nspell they can destory 6 fire giants etc etc.  A wizard CAN solo and he/she <br/>\nhas one of the safest positions in a well ordered party.  A wise wizard will <br/>\nalways have emergency mana for a final blast or gate, no tank gets that.  <br/>\nRemember its always the tanks that die first.  This response is at no one in <br/>\nparticular, just voiceing my opinon.  Bottom line is that I think if we are <br/>\ngoing to petition verant for things then petition to have more quests added, <br/>\nmore dynamic GM involvement, fix broken quests and give us more history of <br/>\nthe world.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAdaar<br/>\nErudite Wizard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
