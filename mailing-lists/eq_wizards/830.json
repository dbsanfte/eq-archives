It is<br/>\nvery easy to turn on clipping for monsters, but it would allow an obsene<br/>\namount of exploitable bugs.  For instance,  if you stand in a certin spot<br/>\nand open a door, your character will get stuck in the door.(I have done<br/>\nthis) If you gain the ability to do this to a monster, it would allow us<br/>\nweak mage types to solo mobs that con red.  It would also allow players to<br/>\nattack linked monsters one at a time by getting one to charge while the<br/>\nrest a stuck in a tent or behind a dungeon wall.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a good weekend, and Happy Hunting<br/>\nMalkin (Fennin Ro)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mprez20@...\">mprez20@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mprez20@...\">mprez20@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the contrary I was told that it was VERY hard to make buildings off<br/>\n&gt; limits.

This behavior where monsters can attack through<br/>\nsolid object is not a glitch.  It is a choice they have made, the code to<br/>\nturn clipping on for<br/>\nmonsters is there.  It would be very easy for them to make it so that<br/>\nmonsters cannot attack through things, but they have chosen to allow this.<br/>\nI personally can&#39;t<br/>\nthink of any reasons why they would allow this to happen, but I&#39;m sure they<br/>\nhave their reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nTandayen, Dark Elf Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
