I mean, if we KNEW this was going to be in an<br/>\n&gt; upcomming patch, then feedbacking ahead of time would be fine to ward it<br/>\n&gt; off.  As it stands right now, we would likely just be filling the feedback<br/>\n&gt; cues with messages asking them not to do something they weren&#39;t going to do<br/>\n&gt; anyway and wasting time that would be better spent fixing actual problems<br/>\n&gt; with the game.  Of course, that&#39;s just my opinion.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
