I think we<br/>\nshould just play the game and let people do whatever.    I would rather<br/>\ndiscuss spells and stuff in this list than people getting mad cus JOE FRIDAY<br/>\nhas full plate or whatever.  I don&#39;t really like twinking but it happens and<br/>\nto BAN it seems weird kinda strict.   There are too many scenerios.  I mean<br/>\nthere is this friend of mine in real life and he plays more than I do and is<br/>\nhigher lvl and he gave me a cool Savant Cap and I like it.  So should I be<br/>\nbanned?   Dunno, but I&#39;d rather talk about cool &quot;in-game&quot; stuff . . .<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Elkantar The Wizard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:the_elkantar@...\">the_elkantar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, May 24, 1999 11:08 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_wizards] Twinking = Diablo = UO<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Elkantar The Wizard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:the_elkantar@...\">the_elkantar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I hear a lot of players say that it is wrong and I agree. I hear few say<br/>\n&gt; leave it alone! I and a lot of other players left twinking alone in UO and<br/>\n&gt; look where that game is now. Same for Diablo. It does effect me and my<br/>\n&gt; character cause it will lead to every other player having to twinkle just<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; play on even ground. Then all the honest players will be left behind like<br/>\n&gt; UO.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Twinking the Definition....Giving high level gear to a low level<br/>\ncharacter.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I agree that &quot;low level&quot; is not lower level. I a 10th level wizard gave<br/>\n&gt; items to a fighter who is 7th level. Things I can not use but he can and<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; helps our party. He being only 3 levels under me. This just makes sense.<br/>\nBut<br/>\n&gt; when a 20th level character gives items high in value to a less then 10th<br/>\n&gt; level character that is simply foolish and exploitable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now at 5th level I did find a mighty magical item that someone had<br/>\n&gt; mistakenly dropped. I belive this is fair in the game. But to have a<br/>\n&gt; character outfitted by other, in a guild or no, is simply cheating and<br/>\nwill<br/>\n&gt; ruin the balance of the game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Elkantar Keeper of the Tome of Magi Lore<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
