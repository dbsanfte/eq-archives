You should let your Ranger take most of the hits.  Unless my group is in trouble I usually don&#39;t cast more than twice on any specific creature.  Even then, I usually cast the first time right away and don&#39;t cast the second time until the creature has under half the hit points remaining.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs always (and as stated here many times), make sure you are doing a /assist on your Ranger friend.<br/>\n<br/>\nRule of Thumb:  The Mages should always be the last to die.   The tanks should be willing to die for their Mages.  If your tank is not willing to die for you, then he shouldn&#39;t be grouped with a mage.  However, don&#39;t take your tank for granted and don&#39;t panic and run when he&#39;s in trouble.  You must work together!<br/>\n<br/>\nValacian - 18th Level Erudite Wizard, Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tJan Sterken [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsterken@...\">jsterken@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tThursday, April 22, 1999 2:43 PM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\t[eq_wizards] LVL10<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Jan Sterken&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsterken@...\">jsterken@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI play a High Elf Wizard. He is currently 10th lvl. The first 9 levels went<br/>\nvery quickly. I was one of the first Wizards in my area and on my servers to<br/>\nget to 9th. Now I am finding it very difficult to get past lvl 10. I seem to<br/>\ndie every time I am on whether grouped or solo. I almost never can get my<br/>\ngate spell off in time to get out of trouble.  I do not want to resort to<br/>\nKill Stealing (this is very easy for a wizard)<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have advice on how to advance faster. And combinations of spells<br/>\nto use when solo or in a group. I know there are not many options but I am<br/>\nhoping I have missed something and someone can help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mostly adventure right now with a friend (11th level ranger) in Crushbone.<br/>\nHe seems to be sucking up most of the experience.(even when we were at the<br/>\nsame level. The rest of the time I either solo or group (30% each)<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp<br/>\n<br/>\nHavil,<br/>\nHigh Elf Wizard of the 10th Circle<br/>\nServant of Mithaniel Marr<br/>\nBristlebane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nDid you know that knowledge is power?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\nJoin a new ONElist e-mail community and strengthen your mind!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
