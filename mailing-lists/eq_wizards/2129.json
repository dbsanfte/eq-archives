But, I have 2 ideas, one is wizard-specific, other could apply<br/>\nto ALL <br/>\nclass&#39;s.<br/>\n  <br/>\nFirst, idea #1 - a new wizard skill : Concentration<br/>\n  <br/>\nThis skill would have a few effects. But in general this would<br/>\n  <br/>\n- a skill that can be used once every few seconds,<br/>\n- When this skill is successfully used. It could have 1 of 2 effects (<br/>\ncomement on which one you would rather have )<br/>\n  <br/>\na) Reduce the ammount of mana used by certian % depending on skill<br/>\nb) Increase the ammount of damage that is dealt by a % depending on skill<br/>\nor<br/>\nc) Both A & B<br/>\n  <br/>\n.. Comments on which would be better BUT STILL KEEP BALANCE would be nice.<br/>\nSure, option C would be nice, but we need to keep in mind balance.<br/>\n  <br/>\nAlso, should this increase the casting time? reduce it? how often should<br/>\nthis be able to be used?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about c) being Casting time?  If the concentration check is good the<br/>\nspell goes off faster; if it flops, the spell takes longer to get off.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Pennaggolan, 3rd Circle Wizard of Felwithe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
