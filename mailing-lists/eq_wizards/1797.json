I used Shock of lightning.<br/>\nThen when I was half way to lvl 13 the root began to fail. And each time I<br/>\ngot hurt more and more. And my lightning spell began to fizzel both 4 and 5<br/>\ntimes a row and I had only to run to zone. Now I am a half bubble from lvl<br/>\n13 after dieing quite a bit.<br/>\nI wonder why the root falters and the Shock of lightning began to fizzle<br/>\nwhen my skill is maxed on lvl and I was almost 13. Not in the start  before<br/>\nmy skill became maxed. Is this to make us wiz harder to lvl?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any reply<br/>\n<br/>\nAvari lvl12 soon 13 Wiz Fenin ro<br/>\nAnd now excelent in Old Erudin</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
