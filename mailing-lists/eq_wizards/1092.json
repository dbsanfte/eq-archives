I met<br/>\nthe guy who developed all the spells, went to lunch with smed, etc. I even<br/>\nhad a chance to ask him about the runed totem and that skull. RUMOR. you can<br/>\ndo no such thing. his GM character has one and it&#39;s called the staff of<br/>\ndiscord and you probably get it if you kill the priest of discord. other<br/>\nthan that, the runed totem staff is ONLY the runed totem staff and cannot<br/>\ninto something else....</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
