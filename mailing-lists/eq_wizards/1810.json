Good grief.. if you don&#39;t <br/>\nlike twinking don&#39;t do it and ignore those who do.  I, personally, don&#39;t have a <br/>\nproblem with it.   Neither do I have any major heartburn about your position <br/>\nagainst it.  I do feel the discussion is getting old tho and am totally against the <br/>\nname calling I see starting to occur.  We are a group of human players behind <br/>\nthese wizard characters we&#39;ve chosen to play.  It is not necessary for others to <br/>\nagree with your position.. in fact, I think it&#39;s pretty obvious that it&#39;s not going to <br/>\nhappen.  Please rise above the name calling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nIggie<br/>\nCazic-Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
