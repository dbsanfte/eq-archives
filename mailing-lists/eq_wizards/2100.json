I consider myself to be a quite successful<br/>\n&gt;wizard, though I&#39;ve invested nothing (!!!) in my INT at character<br/>\n&gt;creation. I was a clueless newbie and I distributed the points around,<br/>\n&gt;putting a big part in WIS. My INT is still 102.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Great, this is exactly what I was talking about. I&#39;m glad you are<br/>\nhaving and easy time with it. Others are not.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I think most wizards underestimate wisdom, but I think it is the stat<br/>\n&gt;that gets checked for regaining concentration. At level 15 I regain<br/>\n&gt;concentration almost every battle when the mob gets melee with me. I<br/>\n&gt;actually Gated when 2 gnolls were hitting on me.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t think so. One of my high level characters has a fairly high Wis<br/>\nand it doesn&#39;t seem to make much of a difference. Good thought on it<br/>\nthough, maybe you are correct. Dayne rarely loses concentration, it&#39;s<br/>\nthat the mobs&#39; resist the spells so much.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The thing is, I think, is experience. Just knowing what to take and what<br/>\n&gt;not to take.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nope, this is not it in Dayne&#39;s case. I have logged tons of hours as<br/>\nevery single class so far and almost all the races, been playing since<br/>\nbeta. It&#39;s just that his spells are resisted. I did an exact even<br/>\ndistribute yesterday with a new DE wizard just to see. This character<br/>\nis 7th level now and as soon as I get him to 12th, I&#39;ll put up another<br/>\npost to update the comparison. But he is not having any of the<br/>\nproblems Dayne was having at his earlier levels.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Some mobs are very resistant to magic. Some are helpless.<br/>\n&gt;Some are very tough in melee (though they con blue) and some are not.<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s just traveling around, seeing the sights and knowing what you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt;doing.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yep, I know this game pretty well now.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;One thing I found is that groups full of wizards kick unbelievable ass.<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s amazing what 3 wizards in a group can do. Not even talking about 6.<br/>\n&gt;Try it. Have a designated rooter, a back up rooter, and all the rest<br/>\n&gt;blast. It&#39;s very fun, very quick and safe.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Agreed, but on karana, this is not an option with the dark elves,<br/>\nthere are not enough wizzies to go around(at this time). But this<br/>\nstill does not work with reds.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Also, always get SOW when you can. If you see a shaman in zone, get him<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;much we have, and store about half or a third of that in the familiar. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
