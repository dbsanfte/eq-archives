They sell two types one is Jr.<br/>\nApprentice Robes and the other are Sr. Apprentice robes.  I think the Sr<br/>\nones cost just under 5 plat but have an AC of 6 and also give some mana.<br/>\nNot much but something is better than nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kicker of it is that I am a GNOME.  I have been to every city.  Even<br/>\nthe Troll and oger city with other characters.  There re NO Gnome sized<br/>\nrobes.  Not even in Ak&#39;Akanon.  I lost my guild robe when I was first<br/>\nstarting out.<br/>\nGranted my Cloth Tunic has a better AC but I still would like to have a<br/>\nrobe, even if its just for show.  Has anyone found a Gnome Sized Robe.<br/>\nActually I think they sell one for Magicians Only in Freeport that a Gnome<br/>\ncould wear, but that kind a leaves my Wizard out of the picture......<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack<br/>\nCurse those Racist apparel makers :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
