I only<br/>\nfizzle on conjuation spells usually and I just looked BOTH are conjuration .<br/>\n. .<br/>\n<br/>\nDex helps your chance &quot;to hit&quot;...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Eye of Zoom is conjuration? I tought it was divination... I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; aware of any conjuration spell for Wizards.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Both Eye of Zomm and Halo of Light are Conjuration,although I have a<br/>\n&gt; feeling the latter one also checks against Divination.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ANSWER<br/>\n&gt; ---------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No, eye of zom is conjuration that s right but halo of light is divination<br/>\n&gt; (as sense magic). A question for all of you guys :<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do you know what s the purpose of the dexterity ?? I get a cape ac 8 plus<br/>\n </span></blockquote>5<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; in dexterity.. And i don t see any change for ac or for sepl. Any idea ?<br/>\n&gt; A second question : you just said eye of zom can open door cool : is it<br/>\n&gt; working for door like in befallen ????<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; thanks<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; yakos<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; level 18 wizzard opn karana<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
