And i dont<br/>\nhave any problem about it! <br/>\nIf they transfered items from their high lv caracters or if guild give it<br/>\nto them its ok for me i go around killing my bats and snakes and they do it<br/>\nin same way without skills they must work much things a same way as you do<br/>\na little bit easier but they alredy worked for it.<br/>\nI played a long time a everquest creating some middle lv caracter and i<br/>\nknow  how dificult it is to start it all over if you have find that your<br/>\ncaracter is not what you wish and you decite to start new class.<br/>\nIm shure that a people wich complain are ones wich have enugh money and<br/>\nfree time to play as long as they wish, ohers wich cannot support to pay a<br/>\n10 $ a month and 1 $ a hour (as connection rates to internet go in europe)<br/>\ni aprove fully to transfer their items to new started caracter. If this is<br/>\npossible to do in game then its ok to do if you wish to pay 100 $ a month<br/>\nso that you can have a payed gm controling every transaction in game then<br/>\nits ok for you send email to Sony saying that you are ready to pay 100 $ a<br/>\nmonth to play a game where every move will be GM controled so wou can be<br/>\nshure that every caracter is not twinked ;-), They willl accept this idea<br/>\ngladly as soon they start reciving your bucks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout guild camping im strongly against it i support idea that if person<br/>\nwich killes a monster is more then 5 lv higher then loot will be only<br/>\nnormal one and for special items only a 1/3 of normal chance or not at all<br/>\nso higer lv players wishing one item must buy it from a low lv players. it<br/>\nwill be a nice push to player interaction.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSilverion<br/>\nHigh elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\nFenin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
