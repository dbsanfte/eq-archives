Didn&#39;t<br/>\nwork.  I then tried a huge number of other cominations with no luck.  When i<br/>\nbought this skull from a friend he billed it as the skull of Vier Dal.  Like<br/>\nan idiot, i didn&#39;t check it out.  It turns out its the Skull of Jhen &#39;Tra.<br/>\nStats are mana +20, SV magic +3, Wt. 2.5, Race and Class: All.  When I<br/>\nqueried my friend he said the skull came from the same gnoll as the Skull of<br/>\nVier Dal and it should still work.  The stats appear to be very similar.<br/>\n<br/>\n3 questions:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  Has anyone seen the Skull of Jhen &#39;Tra and know how to utilize it?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Will this skull attach to the Runed Totem Staff?<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  How do you attach this skull or the skull of Vier Dal to the staff?  Has<br/>\nanyone succesfully dropped it on their picture, or is this just hearsay?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you in advance for your help,<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Maureen&quot;, lvl 12 wizard, Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
