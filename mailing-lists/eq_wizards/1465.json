I also have seen many people asking for magic user help. I guess<br/>\n&gt; they are starting to learn that all the mages are good for something!<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately, I often see them telling me to &quot;BLAST&quot; &quot;BLAST&quot; in the<br/>\n&gt; midst of battle when my better judgement tells me that I will get mobbed<br/>\n&gt; if I do so quick. My response of course, &quot;Dark Elf is about to die.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The answer is, of course to group with people who appreciate wizardry,<br/>\nand know when to defer to you for tactical combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI often put in blasts *during* combat. But I count how many blows the big<br/>\ntanks does, and rarely fire one off before he&#39;s done almost as much as I<br/>\ndo. Exception being when he&#39;s dropping in life, then I move away, nuke,<br/>\nnuke as fast as possible. When the mob switches focus to me, I suffer<br/>\nthe blows (and practice my combat :) while he finishes it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
