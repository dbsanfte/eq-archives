After level 29 or so you wont get close to reds, not even in a full party. :) So, its only a low mid level thing. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n2) Root/Enstill.  Remember when you got root at level 4 and it was horrible ? Remember how it got better at level 8 ? Same thing with Enstill, at 26+ it gets MUCH better.  Sure, you would recast in battle, but it works great.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n3) SoW, Speed Spells.  At level 24 or so you don&#39;t need this, you can teleport pretty much everywhere except planes.  If you need to run, just keep rooting and flee or just buy yourself SoW for a plat or so, dont ask, OFFER the plat.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n4) Petitions to Verant, utility spells ? Perhaps, anything that will make us better in combat, forget it.  We are already devastating.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n5) And Most Important.  Level 20-23 SUCKS !!!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI can ALMOST solo yellow Giants, HANG IN THERE !\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nGood luck my friends.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
