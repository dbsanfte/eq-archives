I am<br/>\ncurrent a level 14 wizard and I am slowly learning to conserve my manna<br/>\nand to keep the monsters off me while grouped.  What i do is generally<br/>\nstand just in range of the monster and hit it hard.  Then I fade back<br/>\nand let the tanks take it.  After the have the mob securely contained, I<br/>\nwatch the fight as it progresses.  If it&#39;s going easily for the tanks, i<br/>\nmay not even cast again.  If the going is tough, I will take the minster<br/>\ndown as fast as I can.  If we are fighting more than one, I try to<br/>\nmonitor the health of all the involved monsters and take down the<br/>\nweakest first.  A weak monster ca still hurt someone  nearly as well as<br/>\na strong one.  Once it&#39;s gone, I check for the next weakest or the one<br/>\nthat&#39;s hurting us the most. and flame it next.  With any luck, we all<br/>\nlive the mob dies and I still have a couple of bubbles of manna left and<br/>\nno loss of hit points.   Of course sometimes I mess up and hit something<br/>\ntoo hard and they start trashing me but usually a good group can pull<br/>\nand taunt the mob off of me.  If not there&#39;s always shadow step and then<br/>\nroot.<br/>\n<br/>\nDupont human Wizard of Freeport<br/>\nEspirit de Corps Order of the Head<br/>\nCazic Thule</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
