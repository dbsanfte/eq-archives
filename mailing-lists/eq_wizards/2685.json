One of the biggest reason I gave up on my PvP char there was that my<br/>\nown race was killing me.  Each Race should stick together and fight other<br/>\nraces not each other.  SO I think the faction system which then prevents<br/>\nthem from going into their own town because they killed their own kind if<br/>\nGREAT.  But I also must say that it takes more than one kill to make this<br/>\nfaction so.  It takes about 5-10 kills of your own race or any race to start<br/>\nto remove your good faction with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nShadair J&#39;Axx<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: Tom Bratina<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, July 07, 1999 1:36 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [eq_wizards] What is the best way to raise faction level with<br/>\nthe Merchants of Felwithe?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  i am not speaking of the NPC faction system, but rather the PC faction<br/>\nsystem they recently put in (which seems to be a totally different faction<br/>\nsystem).  when i kill a wood elf, my faction lowers with &quot;many elves&quot;.  what<br/>\ndo i kill to raise this faction? yes, it&#39;s pretty obvious if they explicitly<br/>\nstate which faction system u lose or gain with (such as indigo brotherhood<br/>\nin neriak), but &quot;many elves&quot;? what the hell is that?  and kos in ur own home<br/>\ntown after killing 2 or 3 of ur brethren? i don&#39;t know about the non-pvp<br/>\nservers, but this is a HUGE issue on rallos zek.  and what about interracial<br/>\nguild wars and duels on the other servers? i heard that they have ceased to<br/>\nexist since the faction system was put in. on zek, some ppl have just<br/>\ntotally given up on ever going &quot;home&quot;.  simply put, verant screwed up by<br/>\nputting it in, and i&#39;ve heard that they are going to remove it (maybe just a<br/>\nrumor, i don&#39;t know)...  too bad for all those that have already had the<br/>\nfactions fubar&#39;ed tho.<br/>\n<br/>\n  sinlaru ce`alen<br/>\n  rallos zek<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: John Penman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jpenman@...\">jpenman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Date: Wednesday, July 07, 1999 12:48 PM<br/>\n    Subject: Re: [eq_wizards] What is the best way to raise faction level<br/>\nwith the Merchants of Felwithe?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    You couldn&#39;t be more wrong.  The faction system makes you explore<br/>\ndifferent areas of the game to find ways to improve your faction.  If they<br/>\njust told you how to improve or destroy your faction with any races then why<br/>\nhave it.  Why would a DE be allowed to enter or even buy from venders of<br/>\nGood diety?  The faction system allows for a person to create their own<br/>\ndestiny by choosing which faction they wish to increase and hunting that<br/>\nmethod out.<br/>\n<br/>\n        In Guk there are two factions of Frogloks, Good and Undead (Ghoul).<br/>\nAt the begining if you do not harm any Good frogloks and head into Guk and<br/>\nget attacked by a Ghoul froglok, you can run to a good froglok and he will<br/>\nprotect you just like a guard would in your city.  This of course depends on<br/>\nyour starting faction with them.  Without a faction system then you will get<br/>\nattack by everyone of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Just my 2 cps worth.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Shadair J&#39;Axx<br/>\n    32 Wizard<br/>\n    The Chosen Ones<br/>\n    Karana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n      From: Tom Bratina<br/>\n      To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n      Sent: Wednesday, July 07, 1999 12:21 PM<br/>\n      Subject: Re: [eq_wizards] What is the best way to raise faction level<br/>\nwith the Merchants of Felwithe?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      well, i don&#39;t have an answer for u, but i think Verant royally screwed<br/>\nup with the PC faction system they implemented.  anyway, i say if Verant is<br/>\ngoing to continue with this patsy faction crap, they need to at least post<br/>\nhow u can alter ur faction in a positive manner.  or just totally remove the<br/>\nstupid friggin PC faction system.<br/>\n<br/>\n      just my rant.<br/>\n<br/>\n      sinlaru ce`alen<br/>\n      rallos zek<br/>\n        -----Original Message-----<br/>\n        From: Mike Browne &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mbrowne@...\">mbrowne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n        To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n        Date: Wednesday, July 07, 1999 10:48 AM<br/>\n        Subject: [eq_wizards] What is the best way to raise faction level<br/>\nwith the Merchants of Felwithe?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Hello, fellow Wizards!<br/>\n<br/>\n        Several weeks ago I participated in a guild war and slew a High Elf<br/>\nnot knowing that there would be a faction hit as a result.
