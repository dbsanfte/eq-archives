I don&#39;t think we have a snowballs chance in hell on some of this stuff, but I agree with the &quot;accountant&quot;.  You have to give them something to say no to.  My 2 favorite suggestions are increasing the med skill cap (this would be a HUGE help) and the line of sight shadowstep.  Specialization is just as important, but this should be in the game already damnit.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Here&#39;s an idea I&#39;ve been kicking around with my friends lately, what about a &quot;Lay Mana&quot; skill where we can fully or partially regen all of our mana once per day like the paladins can?  This would go a long way to making soloing a more viable alternative for wizards (I enjoy both soloing and grouping).  My friends have suggested that this would break wizards, especially during group play, so perhaps it wouldn&#39;t be able to be used if your grouped?  just a thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nADD MY NAME TO THAT LETTER<br/>\n<br/>\nMaureen, Lvl 18 SuperWizz, Povar</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
