Anyone with anything remotely usefull<br/>\nabout Wizards, <br/>\nquests, armor, items, jewelry, good zones, where to hunt what, how to do what<br/>\nanything at all that you feel would help others send it to me and i&#39;ll put<br/>\ntogether <br/>\nsome sort of FAQ or maybe even slap it up on a website, depending on how much<br/>\ninfo i get. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 05:13 PM 6/14/99 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: James Dwyer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdwar@...\">jdwar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve noticed an alarmingly low amount of information about wizards out<br/>\n&gt;there (on the net and such). There are several websites dedicated to<br/>\n&gt;many of the other classes from warriors to rogues and druids to<br/>\n&gt;necromancers. We need a place for wizards. Hehe, not that I have the<br/>\n&gt;time or energy to do this, but I have enough to recognize the need!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Any ideas on what to do? Rather than having all the same questions asked<br/>\n&gt;here over and over again we can have a central repository of information<br/>\n&gt;(faq?). Like for instance, strategies at certain levels, where to hunt,<br/>\n&gt;spell combinations, class combinations, etc. Let me know if anyone is<br/>\n&gt;interested maybe we can make something work :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Croesus Illuminatus (Xegony)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Looking for a new hobby?
