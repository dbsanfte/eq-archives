(so MANY posts to this list! =)<br/>\nBut anyway Cornn, I just wanted to give a fellow Wiz encouragment.  I <br/>\nthink lvl 8-10 was my toughest levels as well.  Slow going and you <br/>\ndon&#39;t have enough punch to survive on your own much.  I just recently <br/>\nachieved 12 and it&#39;s getting to be a LOT more fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nHead over to the Felwithe area instead of Freeport.  Crushbone is a <br/>\ngood key area and the goblin camps in ButcherBlock are good too.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know what it is, but it seems the people in Freeport are not <br/>\nquite as friendly (no offense =).  Not to mention the Sand Giants and <br/>\nMadmen can get downright dangerous for a Wiz over there, IMHO.   If <br/>\nyou have a strong, trusted party, you might venture to Steamfont for <br/>\nhunting Minotaurs.  They give you Mino Axes with will fetch you ~10pp <br/>\nover in Queynos or about 5pp in the local area.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was real dangerous for me to travel to Queynos, even in an <br/>\nexperienced party.  I don&#39;t regret seeing new sites, but I should have <br/>\nstayed home till at least 12 lvl.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- LimDul<br/>\n12lvl High Elf Wiz<br/>\nVeeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 5<br/>\n&gt;   Date: 18 Apr 1999 23:53:54 -0000<br/>\n&gt;   From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ulrich1@...\">ulrich1@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: What should I do<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ok I have a problem....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am a level 8 Human Wizard in Freeport, Xegony server.
