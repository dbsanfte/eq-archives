My problem is I do not have any friends playing EQ. My game so far has been solo. The levels are coming very slow. I have grouped up with people several times. This turns into a nightmare. Most of the time we all just run around aimlessly, it takes so much time just to get sometime going its not really worth it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAnyone have any suggestions? I have a friend who is going to buy the game soon, its just hard to wait. It took me 1 week to level up from 7 to 8.\r<br/>\nNot to mention Humans can&#39;t see in the dark.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSorry for the long winning post.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThanks \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nCornn (I love this game)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
