However, let me give you an example of how it saved my life, once.  We were hunting in Unrest.. (party of 5 or 6 level 11-14s)..   We&#39;re doing fairly well.. avoiding the really tough ones, etc.. etc..   Our tanks are doing ok too, but only one of us has a magical weapon, and non magicians in the party.  Anyway..  we get attacked by a dark boned skeleton.  This thing was hitting us for HIGH damage, and we almost decided to run from the very start.  The warriors had the thing down to half health, and it resisted almost EVERYTHING I cast at it.  So..  I hit all of our tanks with O&#39;Keils Radiation.  2 dmg here, 2 dmg there..   eventually they started adding up..  and the health of the skel started dropping quicker.  I guess what I&#39;m saying is...   if you have 4 people hitting a monster that is resisting your spells... you can use O&#39;Keils radiation on your tanks.. and it WILL get through.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust MHO.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrev<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tshypht[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:evanschu@...\">evanschu@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tSunday, April 18, 1999 10:18 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[eq_wizards] Re: O&#39;Keill&#39;s Radiation<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; O&#39;Keills Radation is a damage shield. You cast the spell on yourself or another person, and everytiem the monster does melee damage to them, it reflects back some damage. This spell only does 2 damage and I find it to be useless, the Magi damage shields are MUCH MUCH better. At lvl&gt; �4 it was reflecting 5 damage, compared to mine that only did 2, and I am pretty sure that the higher-lvl ones dish out more. I am not sure if we get any more damage shields tho.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; \tFrom: Teri &lt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:greenidminx@...\">greenidminx@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \tTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; \tDate: Sunday, April 18, 1999 12:00 PM<br/>\n&gt; \tSubject: [eq_wizards] O&#39;Keill&#39;s Radiation<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tI&#39;m a little confused as t o the effect of O&#39;Keill&#39;s Radiation.� Would<br/>\n&gt; \tsomeone be so kind as to enlighten me to its&#39; proper purpose and<br/>\n&gt; \tusage?<br/>\n&gt; \t�<br/>\n&gt; \tI&#39;m a level 6 wiz on Fennin Ro.� Please say hello if you see me about.<br/>\n&gt; \t�<br/>\n&gt; \t=)<br/>\n&gt; \t�<br/>\n&gt; \tXimena<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
