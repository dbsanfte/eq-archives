Line your self up opposite<br/>\nthe stealer and cast your weakest shock spell on a non engaged MOB that is a<br/>\nhelper to the one that your stealer is fighting (another bandit) and zap...<br/>\nthe bandit will tag your stealer on his way to you and your stealer has two<br/>\nnasties he has to deal with)  (I apologize ahead of time but I was very mad<br/>\nat this post)<br/>\n<br/>\nRutreeii<br/>\nCazic-Thul<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:yur@...\">yur@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 08, 1999 4:01 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Wizards are fun !<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:yur@...\">yur@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I probably will get flamed for this for sure, but who cares.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I made it all the way to lvl 12 as an erudite wizard.   I found that<br/>\nleveling<br/>\n&gt; was very slow indeed and it was getting really boring camping with my<br/>\ngroups<br/>\n&gt; till the sun comes up.   However, i was on a few days ago in the morning<br/>\nand my<br/>\n&gt; regular group wasn&#39;t on.  I shouted for about 30 min and no one wanted to<br/>\njoin<br/>\n&gt; up with me for bandit hunting.  Out of boredom, i went down to the bandit<br/>\ncamps<br/>\n&gt; to see if i can find a group there(West karanas on top of Hill).  I found<br/>\nthis<br/>\n&gt; group of 6 there camping the bandits so i just sat around shouting for<br/>\ngroups<br/>\n&gt; once again. But while those guys were fighting the bandits, i thought, hey<br/>\nmight<br/>\n&gt; as well try to see if i can kill one solo, if i can&#39;t, then they will<br/>\nprobably<br/>\n&gt; help me anyways.  I attacked one bandit and killedh im in 3 shots with<br/>\nShock of<br/>\n&gt; Lightning.  and WOW ! so much XP !!!   so i just kept going.  I got around<br/>\n10-15<br/>\n&gt; pp in 30 min and gained 1 bubble of xp. normall i gain 1 bubble in 6-8<br/>\nhours of<br/>\n&gt; playing.   FINALLY ! i found how to have fun with my wizard and not be the<br/>\nlamer<br/>\n&gt; that spent all his time trying to group and get shitty XP cuz of the split<br/>\n&gt; between members !!   who cares if they think i am a kill stealer, its not<br/>\nlike<br/>\n&gt; they can do anything about it HAHAHA.  too bad for them that they wont<br/>\ngroup<br/>\n&gt; with me.  I also found some wizards are really stupid, the group  of 6 i<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; stealing from had a lvl 14 wizard and a lvl 11 wizard. and none of them<br/>\ncould<br/>\n&gt; stop me from stealing. its odd but true... ppl just don&#39;t think.. oh<br/>\nwell.. i<br/>\n&gt; hope you all try to just have fun and not give a shit what other ppl think<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; once.   then you might find why Varent say we are a balanced race, i<br/>\npersonally<br/>\n&gt; think we were made to give grief to others heehhe.. j/k   I personally<br/>\nthink we<br/>\n&gt; should be changed to Erudite Magical Theives hehe..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking for a new hobby?
