It may seem almost obvious to some but I want to make sure that<br/>\neveryone knows.<br/>\n<br/>\nDistance Distance Distance!  If you are in an area in which you have good<br/>\nsight distance, get to the maximum range that you can cast your spell from.<br/>\nCast your most powerful spell and then WHILE you are recovering BACK UP even<br/>\nmore and then cast again when recovered.  Using this strategy I can hit with<br/>\n2 shocks of lightning (at level 13, so I am sure it works at level 12 also)<br/>\nfor a total of 158 damage (if they both hit for full damage) BEFORE the<br/>\nenemy gets to me!  Against blues and sometimes evens, this will be enough<br/>\ndamage so that I can now switch to shock of ice (which casts fast enough to<br/>\nuse between them hitting me) and finish them off in 2 or 3 castings.  If you<br/>\ndon&#39;t want the monster in your face, cast root instead of the 2nd DD spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother strategy that someone posted (should have been obvious but I didnt<br/>\nthink of it) uses the fact that your bolt spells dont actually hit until the<br/>\nbolt reaches them (using the distance tactic).  Cast your most powerful bolt<br/>\nat maximum distance (I haven&#39;t done this but it should work) and while it is<br/>\nstill on the way you can recover enough to root the enemy, then blast away.<br/>\nI would change this tact for slightly easier enemies and instead of rooting,<br/>\ncast your best shock spell and then you might even be able to cast again<br/>\nbefore the monster gets to you.  I haven&#39;t played with this bolt tactic yet<br/>\nso it is all theory.  I will try tonight and let you all know.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Solric of the 4th circle</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
