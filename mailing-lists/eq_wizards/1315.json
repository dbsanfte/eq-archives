I met the guy who<br/>\nmade ALL the spells in the game. His EQ name is Geoffrey the ArchMagi. he<br/>\nhas a staff with a skull on it and i asked him if that was a RTS with a<br/>\nskull attached he laughed his ass off (i&#39;m not making any of this up i<br/>\npromise... you don&#39;t have to believe me, i know it&#39;s true and that&#39;s all<br/>\nthat counts) he entered EQ and showed me what it was. The Geoffrey Staff!<br/>\ndesigned by the same guy that gave Aradune his green armor! it&#39;s just for<br/>\nhim! and the priest of discord&#39;s staff is called the Staff of Discord. I<br/>\nimagine you get it when you kill him and it probably gives some cool bonus<br/>\nlike making you PK when you equip in and regular when you unequip it. that&#39;s<br/>\nit<br/>\n<br/>\nit&#39;s a rumor.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: that was the best day i ever spent anywhere it was really fun and if any<br/>\nof you live in San Diego you should really email someone and ask if you can<br/>\nvisit for a day. it was a great experience for me<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Aura Dracul &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:auradracul@...\">auradracul@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Thursday, May 13, 1999 2:03 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Staff Question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Aura Dracul&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:auradracul@...\">auradracul@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Any of you Wizards out there know what skull, you need to combine with a<br/>\n&gt;Ruined Totem Staff...and what NPC combines them for you?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Auraelle<br/>\n&gt;E&#39;ci Server<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Get involved.
