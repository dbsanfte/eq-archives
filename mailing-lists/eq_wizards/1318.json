I answer the question of wizards being a weak class as I play my<br/>\ngame...in character.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a lot of sniveling going on in the apprentice ranks of our mighty<br/>\nclass.  No pets, no buffs, too much meditating.  Ours is not a class for<br/>\nthose looking for the easy road.  Find a sword or a mace and go punch a<br/>\ncritter if that&#39;s your cause.  Ours is a class of discipline.  The road is<br/>\nhard, but so are the rewards.  The magics we wield allow us to do one thing<br/>\nthat few classes can.  Solo the entire realm.  I&#39;m currently of the tenth<br/>\nlevel, and while I have adventured with a few for fun, 97 per cent of all of<br/>\nmy time has been alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nOccasionally I even bail out the weak swordslingers, shaking at their<br/>\nfifteen point hits, while I send ice or fire raining down upon my enemies<br/>\n(and sometimes theirs) for double or even triple their damage.  So there are<br/>\nfew things I fear in this world of Norrath.  There are few things you should<br/>\nas well.  Use your head.  Attack with caution and strategy.  And use your<br/>\nspells in combinations that will win you the day.  Yes we spend much time in<br/>\nmeditation, but we are the scholars, the students, and the finders of lost<br/>\npower.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdopt the right attitude and use your head in stead of your staff and you&#39;ll<br/>\nagree.<br/>\n<br/>\nDjorin<br/>\nLevel 10<br/>\nE&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
