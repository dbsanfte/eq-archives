The problem was that I really couldn&#39;t verify<br/>\n&gt; how well<br/>\n&gt; \tit works, because I&#39;m not certain if monsters take damage from<br/>\n&gt; falling or not.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tBut what I would do is hit a monster from long distance with a<br/>\n&gt; spell, then<br/>\n&gt; \trun up a VERY VERY steep cliff.  Once at the top of the cliff I wait<br/>\n&gt; till<br/>\n&gt; \tthe monster hits me, then I hit the fade button.  9 times out of 10,<br/>\n&gt; fade<br/>\n&gt; \ttakes me to the bottom of the cliff.  The monster then jumps off the<br/>\n&gt; cliff<br/>\n&gt; \tto get me, and I&#39;m assuming it takes some damage from the fall.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tI did this a couple times... the biggest problem is finding suitable<br/>\n&gt; cliffs<br/>\n&gt; \tto fade from, and the second worst problem is being careful not to<br/>\n&gt; fall in<br/>\n&gt; \tmyself.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \tFlik<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; \tGet involved.
