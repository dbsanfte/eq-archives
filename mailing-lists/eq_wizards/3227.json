Yeah, I just went back and got those recently.  I was essentially a<br/>\n&gt; rat exterminator for a couple days.  :)  The thing that&#39;s irritating about<br/>\n&gt; this quest is that you have to wait for 3 random things:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1) Cubert doesn&#39;t spawn all the time<br/>\n&gt; 2) He doesn&#39;t always carry the quest item<br/>\n&gt; 3) When you bring the item to the NPC..he doesn&#39;t always give you the<br/>\n&gt; earring.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How irritating is that?  Is this supposed to be fun? ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
