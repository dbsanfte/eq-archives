You all ran 20 min to your fav kill spot.  Played for<br/>\nhours of fun.  Night is over.  Do you gate home, leaving your tanks to<br/>\nrun thru what might end up being hostile areas (but usually aren&#39;t), or<br/>\ndo you run with them?<br/>\n<br/>\n2nd is harder.  Basically, do you die with your party, or abandon them<br/>\nwhen there is trouble?  All of this talk of shadowstep gate has made me<br/>\nthink Im in the minority here.  My tanks actually tell me they expect to<br/>\ndie so I can live, if it comes to that.  BUT - I don&#39;t think its right<br/>\nto leave them. Am I doing them a disservice ?  I would rather try one<br/>\nmore time to get that root off on the MOB killing them so we can all<br/>\nlive (or die) together.<br/>\n<br/>\n#2 has lead me to doing a LOT more solo fighting, cause I hate the idea<br/>\nof either possiblity actually!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
