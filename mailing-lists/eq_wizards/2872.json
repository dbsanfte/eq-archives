They were thrilled since that <br/>\n&gt; spell is a Level 16 spell, I believe, for them, and costs a few plat at that <br/>\n&gt; level.  I then turned around after finding out how expensive Root was for a <br/>\n&gt; shaman to purchase (I think I was told 8 plat...don&#39;t really remember now) <br/>\n&gt; and gated back to Felwithe and spent 4 gold and some odd coins each on 10 <br/>\n&gt; root spells and handed them out to shamans who gave me sow :).  I NEVER have <br/>\n&gt; to worry about being SoW&#39;d while in Halas or Permafrost now.  A little <br/>\n&gt; kindness and thoughtfulness towards others can go a long way and many people <br/>\n&gt; do NOT forget things like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That surprise me.<br/>\nNot the gratitude, the prices.<br/>\nAll spells that are common to various classes, are, so far, priced at the<br/>\n*lowest* level they can be gained by someone. That is why I could purchase<br/>\nthe summon drink spell at my level 5 of shaman for 1g, while the rest of<br/>\nthe level 5 spells were a little over 5g each. Or getting invisibility<br/>\nat a price much much lower than the level 16 for wizard it suggested.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
