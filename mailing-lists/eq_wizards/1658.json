I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-983575150\">I did write in to the senior guides and I am awaiting a reply after they check things out as far as the guide I dealt with and also the points I made.    I made the very same point to them and the definition of safe zones (as is posted on the official site) does not fit the doors at najena.  The only place you are truly safe is in the midst of time where you are zoning, either side can be a problem when you come out.<br/>\nI play on Veeshan server, so it&#39;s possible the guides and gms on other servers are more lax, but I would expect them to be somewhat cohesive in what they do.  The means needs to be about the same to acheive a similar &quot;end&quot; on all of the servers.  Just my silly view but I think many others would agree.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: Karl Hatteland &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:karlh@...\">karlh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n    Date: Saturday, May 22, 1999 7:31 PM<br/>\n    Subject: Re: [eq_wizards] GM/guides will chew you for this.. read so you dont get in trouble<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    Thanks for the information, though I cant see the problem becouse all the monsters can go in there and then it is not a safe zone. In beta there where places the monsters didnt go to even if U were attacking them, you could just go to safe zone and the monster run away.<br/>\n     <br/>\n    I will stop doing it until I hear something else.<br/>\n    Avari lvl 12 wiz fenin ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
