I have yet to meet a happy level 24 magician, or an early level<br/>\nenchanter.  Magicians sometimes  go eight levels before getting their next DD<br/>\nspell.  Enchanters get resisted way more than us. (They never figured out that<br/>\nthey need to boost Cha, not Int).  My point is that levels 1-11 WE SUCK.  12-19<br/>\nwe&#39;re growing, and 20+ get out of our way.  Don&#39;t look at mana to damage<br/>\nratios, look at damage to time ratios.  That is the important stat because the<br/>\nquicker the mob is dead, the less down time the group has, and nobody past the<br/>\nlevel of 20 can touch us in that area.  As for specialization, if any other<br/>\nclass specializes in evocation they are doing themselves a great disservice.<br/>\nIt&#39;s not their area, just as conjuration is not ours.  Necros and Enchanters<br/>\nlive and die with Alteration, Mages conjure, Druids Abjurate, etc.  I<br/>\npersonally like the fact that wizards start so weak, people give up with it and<br/>\nthat separates the wheat from the chaff.  I&#39;m glad to see that you are sticking<br/>\nwith it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note, I found out that tanks don&#39;t see the damage that we inflict on<br/>\nthe mob.  We see &quot;mob says hit for 86 non melee damage&quot;.  The tanks get the the<br/>\nmessage &quot;a mobs skin freezes&quot; But I digress.<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy Hunting<br/>\nMalkin<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Nuke them till they glow -- and then sell them as greater lightstones&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
