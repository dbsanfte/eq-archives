I found lvl 8 and 9 to be my hardest thus<br/>\nfar simply because when you go solo everything is either too hard, or too<br/>\neasy.. there aren&#39;t many in betweens.  (at least that is what I found for<br/>\nthe creatures around the neriak/freeport area)  The way I made it through<br/>\nwas by meeting people who played the game well, and we went out and hunted.<br/>\nFor a lower lvl wizard going solo can be disastrous.. at 14 I still have<br/>\ntons of problems solo.  The only advice I can give you, is keep trying in<br/>\nthe parties.. eventually you will find some good people who play well, and<br/>\nwho you get along with.  Then when you play after that you&#39;ll know who to<br/>\nlook for a little better so that you can get back together as a good group.<br/>\nSorry I have nothing really conforting to say.. but grouping is a major part<br/>\nof playing a wizard.  If it&#39;s impossible to find anyone around the freeport<br/>\narea, then you try moving to another city.  Travelling to Qeynos is not<br/>\nextremely hard from freeport (1 really hard zone) and I&#39;m sure you could<br/>\nfind someone there to bind you, and hopefully more people who you would be<br/>\nable to group with.  Good luck to you...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTandayen, Dark Elf Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ulrich1@...\">ulrich1@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ulrich1@...\">ulrich1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Sunday, April 18, 1999 8:23 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] What should I do<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ulrich1@...\">ulrich1@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ok I have a problem....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am a level 8 Human Wizard in Freeport, Xegony server.
