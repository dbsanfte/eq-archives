Most people will buy it off of you for 20pp.  You should just /auction it off.  I&#39;m looking for one right now also.  =)   But, I am IN the section that I need to be in, to get one, and probably wouldn&#39;t pay 20pp for one.  I&#39;d give you your 13pp back if you&#39;re on Tarew Marr.   13pp is a very good deal for the staff.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrev<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tLarimus La&#39;shain[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:larimus@...\">larimus@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tMonday, April 19, 1999 12:18 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[eq_wizards] Runed Totem Staff<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Larimus La&#39;shain&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:larimus@...\">larimus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; After many levels of wishing I finally got my Runed Totem Staff for <br/>\n&gt; the bargan basement price of 13 pp (though I&#39;m quite broke now). <br/>\n&gt; However it isn&#39;t as effective as I thought. Anything that is tough <br/>\n&gt; enough to need a good damage weapon I generally can&#39;t hit ( I believe <br/>\n&gt; my 2h blunt is maxed ) and anything that isn&#39;t that tough I can nuke <br/>\n&gt; in no time. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So my question is should I sell it for 20 pp and buy more of my ranks <br/>\n&gt; spells ( i&#39;m level 12 and only have Shock of Lightning and bind <br/>\n&gt; affinity ) If so which spells should I buy? Or should I stick with <br/>\n&gt; the staff. Just want some friendly advice.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; TIA<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
