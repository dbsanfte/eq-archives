Anything that is tough <br/>\nenough to need a good damage weapon I generally can&#39;t hit ( I believe <br/>\nmy 2h blunt is maxed ) and anything that isn&#39;t that tough I can nuke <br/>\nin no time. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo my question is should I sell it for 20 pp and buy more of my ranks <br/>\nspells ( i&#39;m level 12 and only have Shock of Lightning and bind <br/>\naffinity ) If so which spells should I buy? Or should I stick with <br/>\nthe staff. Just want some friendly advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nTIA<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
