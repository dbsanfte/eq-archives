But no one<br/>\never wants a wizard.  About the only time I can get in a group is if my friends that I know in real life are on.<br/>\nWhich isn&#39;t every time I play. How am I to lvl up and play the game, if this is a grouping game as they (verant)<br/>\nsay, when I can&#39;t find anyone to group with?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as I can tell the wizard is pretty much useless and I have put him on the side because I can&#39;t solo (tried<br/>\nmany a time) and I can&#39;t find a party that wants me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a bard, necro, and SK as other chars and find groups all the time with no problem. Either we need to <br/>\nstart a petition or wizard will just continue to pretty much suck.<br/>\n<br/>\nVenlaan - Mith. Marr</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
