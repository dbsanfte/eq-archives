We were both level 19 and sad thing is, I think he is<br/>\n&gt; right!  Can anyone tell me how much mana is used and damage delivered<br/>\n&gt; for the magician DD spell (16th level) equivelant to Fire Shock?  I<br/>\n&gt; have a feeling it will be the same which is sad really.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Before I rant on my class I will need to know the truth on this matter.<br/>\n&gt;  I love being a wizard and believe the long road to true power is a<br/>\n&gt; long one.  But we should be doing more damage than a damn magician and<br/>\n&gt; plus he gets a pet.  Let me know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; - Ziffnab of Xegony<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _____________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Free instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  where real people with real interests get connected.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
