If everyone were able to solo fairly effectively...  everyone would be in the upper levels eventually.  As far as I&#39;m concerned you have the ability to solo.  If you dont know how to use your abilities to an efficient level..   then you stay down at the lower levels..  which is perfectly balanced.  Those of us who adapt to what we&#39;re given, and overcome, will rise in levels beyond the capabilites of those who cannot.  Also.. some of the utility spells are useless...  but I&#39;d imagine that (in a fantasy type setting) there would be hundreds of spells that served no immediately obvious purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoot works perfectly fine.  What you&#39;re saying is that anyone should be able to cast root on you without you having a chance to go unaffected by the spell.  Or are you just saying that only monsters should not be able to resist being rooted?  =) haha  When solo&#39;ing .. if youre root only lasts one second.. then yes.  You wasted your mana.  But thats the chance you take.  If you want better odds.. practice casting that particular skill.  There is no point in playing the game if everything has a set number on it.  Random is much better.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you dont like how a particular spell works..  dont use it.  Its easy.<br/>\n<br/>\n..oh, and by the way...   root will last much longer later on.  I&#39;m just about to level 19 now.. and root sometimes holds them for over a minute and a half.  (..and of course sometimes they resist it, and I end up running.)   <br/>\n<br/>\nDrev <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tKen Morrison[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ken.morrison@...\">ken.morrison@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tMonday, May 17, 1999 2:21 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[eq_wizards] Wizards -R- US<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well I think we all realize that Verant seems to have done a pretty good job balancing the classes.&gt; � It is also evident that they have slanted the whole game towards grouping...which makes perfect sense.� It is an online, social game.� If all one wants to do is solo, go play another game, like Might and Magic or a similar game.� Fine, no problem, everyone understands that.<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; My point, and one which someone has no doubt made before is, that you cant always go on at the same time as your regular group of close friends, or you cant always find a &quot;good&quot; bunch of people to spontaneously group with.� Therefore, there SHOULD be some kind of provision for ALL classes to be able to solo fairly effectively.� What I am not saying is Verant make Wizards powerhouses, just revamp the &quot;utility&quot; spells that are supposed to be helpful, but which arent.<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; Take, for instance, the Root spell (again).� Having a set minimum time limit to it, even for 10 seconds, doesnt really greatly enhance its effectiveness for grouping, but makes a HUGE difference for soloing.� In a group, if you ever cast it at all (and what would be the point, assuming you have some warriors) it would be a waste of mana because the warriors are there to take punishment and taunt the mob to keep it off of spellcasters.� If the mob runs, sure cast Root (or just blast and finish it for a more spectacular finish ;-), if you have mana left, and the warriors finish it anyway, which will be in way under 10 seconds, guaranteed.� While soloing, if my Root only lasts for 1 sec, why did I even bother casting it at all.� Didnt help me and I could have used the mana to blast it for a free shot at first or to get a head start running.<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; Just seems to me that Root, Fade and Shadowstep are ALMOST insultingly useless spells because of lazy programming.� Seems like they got away with generating some random numbers for spells and are happy that no one is complaining that much.<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; Alhassim 8th (happily creeping up on 9 by soloing and grouping!) Erudite Wizard of E&#39;ci<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n&gt; P.S.� (And I dont care about the creatures willpower or magic resistance, who says Root isnt an impenetrable dome of force that traps it physically rather than mentally.)&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
