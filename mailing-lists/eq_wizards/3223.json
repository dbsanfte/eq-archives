Fighting a steady<br/>\n&gt;stream of blues, a group that includes a cleric will almost have no use for<br/>\n&gt;us until the puller yells,  &quot;Oh Shit, I pulled something big guys, get<br/>\n&gt;ready&quot;  That is when we shine.  With our burns, nobody can save the <br/>\n&gt;situation<br/>\n&gt;faster than a wizard.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree.  In panic train situations, you may even find that you don&#39;t even <br/>\nneed to kill the Mobs...you just need to nuke them down to about 20%..that&#39;s <br/>\nwhere they turn tail and start walking away.  That&#39;s one less Mob that the <br/>\ntanks have to worry about.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, it&#39;s wise to go after that Mob or else he&#39;ll come back after a <br/>\nlittle rest.  Either finish off that Mob with a nuke, or arrange one of your <br/>\ntanks to break off of battle and go after that one.  I think this works for <br/>\nMobs in both Cazic and Mistmoore.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s not as crazy, it&#39;s best to wait a little longer so you can get the <br/>\nkill shot and save your group from a chase. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhoohoo, trains are exciting sometimes...when you live of course heh.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
