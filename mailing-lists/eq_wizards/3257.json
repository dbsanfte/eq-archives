Both times, there was a banner<br/>\non the login server saying that either CERF.net had router problem, or<br/>\nEarthlink &quot;customers&quot; had too. (I am not an earthlink customer, but somehow<br/>\nmy connectivity goes thru them when reaching CERF).<br/>\n<br/>\nUsual symptom: if you are on a UUNET server (old servers), try a CERFnet<br/>\nserver (a recent one). If you can get in, then you have &quot;transient&quot;<br/>\nconnectivity block. Sweat it out :(<br/>\n<br/>\n(my symptoms are usually: can&#39;t log in Tunare or Quellious. Click on Bertox,<br/>\n and I get in. I then switch off the computer and head to bed :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
