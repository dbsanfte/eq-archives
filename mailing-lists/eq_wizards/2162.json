Has it<br/>\n&gt; been that way since day one, and I&#39;ve just been lucky until now?<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s happened 3 or 4 times to me so far.  Once when it was a life or<br/>\n&gt; death situation.  I died and it really pissed me off.   I did a shadow<br/>\n&gt; step then a gate.  The gate went through the complete casting time, used<br/>\n&gt; 100 mana, did the graphics, and then came up with that message.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Malkin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Did you know each week we feature a ONElist story?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; How has ONElist changed your life?
