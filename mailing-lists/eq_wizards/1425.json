We were both level 19 and sad thing is, I think he is<br/>\nright!  Can anyone tell me how much mana is used and damage delivered<br/>\nfor the magician DD spell (16th level) equivelant to Fire Shock?  I<br/>\nhave a feeling it will be the same which is sad really.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore I rant on my class I will need to know the truth on this matter.<br/>\n I love being a wizard and believe the long road to true power is a<br/>\nlong one.  But we should be doing more damage than a damn magician and<br/>\nplus he gets a pet.  Let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n- Ziffnab of Xegony<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree instant messaging and more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.yahoo.com\">http://messenger.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
