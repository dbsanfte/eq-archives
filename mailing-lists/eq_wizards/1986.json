I grouped<br/>\nwith the following to get one last night and let me tell you it was not<br/>\neasy:<br/>\n<br/>\n        25 Troll SD<br/>\n        27 DE    Wiz<br/>\n        25 DE    Wiz (myself)<br/>\n        24 WE   Paladin (Go figure on this oen)<br/>\n        24 Gnome Mag<br/>\n<br/>\n    We attempted to kill Nejena 3 times and all 3 times she did not spawn.<br/>\nShe is a rare spawn but when she does she always has a Robe on.  Along with<br/>\nher in the room are 2 other mages and their pets that hit damn hard,<br/>\neverytime we went in we almost lost someone in the party.  If she does not<br/>\nspawn some type of elemental will spawn in her place.  So I hope this helps<br/>\nyou guys out.  Good Luck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Shadair J&#39;Axx<br/>\n    25th Wizard<br/>\n    Karana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
