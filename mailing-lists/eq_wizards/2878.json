You are right in that paper and quill is not needed to make any spell.  However, the practice runes are supposed to use them according to the book that explains how to make them.  But the problem is that none of the recipies in the book work correctly, with or without the paper and quill.<br/>\nBTW, the source of this stuff (Books and Concordance of Research) in a quest in North Karana.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Shadowwalker<br/>\n<br/>\n  One-You should read up on what you are trying to combine.  It makes for a reduction in &#39;these items don&#39;t combine&#39; messages.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Two-I have never had to use paper and quill to make spells.  Runes were sufficient enough for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hopefully, this stuff works (and hope the paper and quill thing is something I missed for certain spells).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kakarot Dreamflange</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
