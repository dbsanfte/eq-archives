Anyway, it is possible to advance <br/>\none point past your speakers level.  Therefore your partner, or you, whomever <br/>\nknows the basics of the language, talks the other person to one point past <br/>\nthe speakers current level.  You both zone.  You are now one point better <br/>\nthan the person who was speaking to you.  They sit down, and you speak to <br/>\nthem.  They become as good as you are, by you talking to them, and then as <br/>\nyou continue to spam them to death, they advance another skill point.  Now <br/>\nyou both zone.  You repeat this until, as I have said, you are both either <br/>\nbored, or excellent in your language of study.  I know that this works for a <br/>\nfact, as I have mastered nearly every language in the game by it.  Time well <br/>\nspent, as it is satisfying to pick up any book, and to be able to read it.  <br/>\nPlease, feed my habit.  Brandy is prefered, although I drink any alcoholic <br/>\nbeverage.<br/>\nZaeq, Wizard, Linguist, Boozer.  E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
