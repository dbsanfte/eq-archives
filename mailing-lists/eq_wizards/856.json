[cut] I have heard that the formula for mana should be INT/5 and rounded down and to this you add 2 and multiply with your level and that gives:","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1629158622\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;From: &quot;mitchell weiner&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:evweiner@...\">evweiner@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[cut]<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Does anyone know the formula used to calculate mana points?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[cut]<br/>\n<br/>\nI have heard that the formula for mana should be INT/5 and rounded down and <br/>\nto this you add 2 and multiply with your level and that gives: Mana = (INT/5 <br/>\n+ 2)*level. But when i tested it it seemed more like i had (INT/5 + <br/>\n2)*(level+1). But the +1 to level also sounds reasonable enough since normal <br/>\nskills are also in that form (like 5*(level +1)). But im by no means sure <br/>\nthat this is the right formula.<br/>\nNote that the INT/5 is rounded down so having 134 in int should give the <br/>\nsame as 130. Of course you will later on acquire equipment that raises your <br/>\nINT so no need to worry that you may have wasted 4 points in INT. It will be <br/>\nusefull later on.<br/>\nBut in conclusion i think that you should have something in the range of <br/>\n(INT/5 + 2)*level. Mayby people could post how many mana they think they <br/>\nhave at which level and we could figure out the correct formula out. At <br/>\nlevel 14 it seemed like i had about 440-450 mana with 142 in INT but mayby i <br/>\ngot a bit of mana back while testing (casting 4 bind affinity and some minor <br/>\nspells), but im not sure. I&#39;ll probably test again when i get enough <br/>\npatience to use all my mana while not in combat :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that helped.<br/>\n<br/>\nRotas Koth, Innoruuk.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
