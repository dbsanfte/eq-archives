Don&#39;t get me wrong , but as a reply to Greg<br/>\n(Kronan)<br/>\nI would say:<br/>\n<br/>\nAll caster class can do as much damage as a wizard until lev 15 at least (I<br/>\nam only 14 )<br/>\n<br/>\nMagicians does in the mid 70 dam with their spell DirectDam spell<br/>\nClerics do the same<br/>\nNecros i don&#39;t know about, but think they do about mid 70 as well<br/>\nWizards does 80dam per DD spell<br/>\nAt 16 you do about 100 dam as your DD spell<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you would not see your class shine until higher lev..<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps 20.. I don&#39;t know but i heard the DD Wizard spell did 200dam there..<br/>\noffcourse the Cleric undead spell at that lev does  close to 200 dam as<br/>\nwell.. But thats just against undeads.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am 14th lev now and all the other casters i meet do just as much damage as<br/>\nme and have much more nicer utility spell like pets. buffs/debuffs etc..<br/>\nI am in need of another player to really get xp (or actually any xp at all<br/>\nwithout the danger of dying or zoning to save my butt on every mob i<br/>\nattack).. wheras the magics and necros etc can solo perfectly alone..<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sure the reward will be GREAT, BUT it will come at a later level than<br/>\n14, believe me.<br/>\nmaybe 20 maybe higher.<br/>\n<br/>\nHang in there fellow Wizard, we WILL rule the world *snicker*<br/>\n<br/>\nOonagh the Gnome Wizard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
