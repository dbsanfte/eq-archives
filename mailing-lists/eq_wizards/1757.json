First, where did everyone get the idea<br/>\nthat you have to spend a training point to learn a language?  Is this true<br/>\nonly for some langauges?  It surely is not true for all of them, since I<br/>\nlearned Dwarvish and Gnomish without spending any training points at all.  I<br/>\njust listened to someone who was proficient in the language.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second point of confusion is how two people could ever become excellent<br/>\nin any language just by listening to each other speak, if neither one is<br/>\nexcellent to begin with.  When I first started learning Dwarvish, for<br/>\nexample, I was being taught by a Gnome who was himself only average in it.<br/>\nSo my language understanding only climbed to average.  No matter how much he<br/>\nspoke after that, I went no higher.  How could your method teach someone a<br/>\nlanguage better than you know it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DSchm75588@...\">DSchm75588@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, May 24, 1999 8:57 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] On possible twinking, with language info<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DSchm75588@...\">DSchm75588@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; People who have high level items at low levels may not necessarily have<br/>\nbeen<br/>\n&gt; twinked.  As I was not twinked, but had many hundreds of platinum by level<br/>\n&gt; 12.  There have been in the past messages posted requesting language<br/>\n&gt; assitance.  Well, if someone has mastered all of the main languages in the<br/>\n&gt; game, player languages, monster languages, and most importantly the<br/>\nresearch<br/>\n&gt; languages (Old Erudian through elder Dragon).  Its amazing how well people<br/>\n&gt; will pay to become excellent in the research languages.  Its really not<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; hard to become excellent either, the most difficult thing is to find the<br/>\n&gt; languages. Just search the land, looking for someone who will train you<br/>\none<br/>\n&gt; point in the language, and then get a friend, sit by a zone.  Whomever has<br/>\n&gt; learned the language begins by speaking while one sits on the ground<br/>\n&gt; listening.  When you have stopped improving, stand up and zone.  Then your<br/>\n&gt; friend sits down, and you speak in the language until your friend improves<br/>\n&gt; two points.   Then your friend stands up and you both zone again.  Repeat<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; two point then zone process till your tired of it, or you&#39;re excellent.<br/>\nThis<br/>\n&gt; method will take you from awful or higher to excellent, in an hour or two.<br/>\n&gt; Enjoy.  If anyone finds this info helpful, then I would appreciate a few<br/>\n&gt; alcoholic beverages!  Enjoy, and good learning.<br/>\n&gt; Zaeq, Wizard and Boozer of E&#39;ci.
