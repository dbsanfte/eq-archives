Don&#39;t know about other servers - on Solusek Ro HP<br/>\nwas considered a FFA zone - i.e. everyone would try to steal. That&#39;s<br/>\ngreat for me, as a lone wizard I was able to take blacks and yellows<br/>\nregularly because groups would always try to steal and help me out in<br/>\nthe process. 20-27 I spent in MM and Lake Rathe. Soloing in MM is hard,<br/>\nthough I did pull it off. Lake Rathe is solo only, if the aviaks are<br/>\ncamped you get in on rotation. 27-30 I spent in Cazic, yes soloing. Most<br/>\npeople will say this is BS - but it is true, I regularly soloed in the<br/>\nmaze and in the TR CY. It is possible to pull singles, you just have to<br/>\nknow what you&#39;re doing and know where you are. Now at 30 I see no<br/>\nsoloing alternatives (no I won&#39;t camp treants or any good monsters for<br/>\nthat matter) so I&#39;m seriously thinking about quitting.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nSergey<br/>\n<br/>\nWorker bees can leave<br/>\nEven drones can fly away<br/>\nThe queen is their slave</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
