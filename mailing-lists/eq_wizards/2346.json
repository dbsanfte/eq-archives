Methinks you can &quot;Exploit a bug&quot; and call it cheating :P<br/>\n&gt; But usually when you take advantage of a good situation, that situation<br/>\n&gt; was not intended by the designers. Actually talking about really good<br/>\n&gt; situation, like where you find bronze stuff on decaying skel or<br/>\n&gt; somesuch. And I&#39;d call that cheating and exploiting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hm, guess I don&#39;t really differentiate.

So let<br/>\nthem fix the bugs and not tell us &quot;no you can&#39;t do this&quot;. That&#39;s stupid. They<br/>\ncreated the game and I&#39;m playing it the way it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nfurthermore, nowhere on their site do they have a list of exploits that should be<br/>\navoided. They do not give us a list when we log in to the game. Yet, we&#39;re<br/>\nsupposed to just know them? How stupid is that?<br/>\n<br/>\nTHEY made the design error / bug, and now they expect us not to &quot;exploit&quot; it<br/>\nwithout even letting us know what&#39;s an exploit and what&#39;s not!
