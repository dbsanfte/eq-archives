I am only hoping<br/>\n&gt; to elicit some other opinions on this subject as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know why but it has never made sense to me to charge for services<br/>\n&gt; such as binding, invis, and language training.  Perhaps it is just the<br/>\n&gt; personality of my character that he enjoys helping others and gets full<br/>\n&gt; satisfaction out of the good deed itself, not needing any sort of physical<br/>\n&gt; compensation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I realize that I will be able to make make up to a plat or more each per<br/>\n&gt; bind and a plat or more for invis (depending on how bad they want it) but<br/>\n&gt; that just seems unkind.  I remember when I was level 8 just travelling<br/>\nover<br/>\n&gt; to freeport.  I only had a couple of my new 3rd circle spells because they<br/>\n&gt; were so expensive and I was flat broke.  I saw people auctioning: &quot;Binding<br/>\n&gt; at S. Gate, 15gp&quot;, and there was no way i could afford that without<br/>\nselling<br/>\n&gt; the few pieces of cloth armor i had left.  I was lucky to find a kind<br/>\ndruid<br/>\n&gt; that bound me and asked for nothing in return, but I just wonder why so<br/>\nmany<br/>\n&gt; seek to earn a profit from their abilities rather than just use them to<br/>\nhelp<br/>\n&gt; others and take joy in that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I guess it is just based on your roleplaying style, but even if I have no<br/>\n&gt; money and still have spells to buy, I would not ask for or accept any sort<br/>\n&gt; of payment for using my talents.  Does anyone else agree with me or do you<br/>\n&gt; all think that you SHOULD rightfully earn a profit from using your skills?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Solric<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Ken Morris [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kmorris2@...\">kmorris2@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, May 11, 1999 2:30 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: EQ Wizards<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [eq_wizards] Languages<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am excellent in Dragon, Combine, Old Eurdian, Elder Elvish, and am<br/>\nworking<br/>\n&gt; on Elder Tier&#39;Dal today.
