If my<br/>\ngroup needs an evac you can bed I will be clicking on my stone till I am<br/>\neither dead or have the exp to evac to safty.  At the levels that a stone<br/>\nbecomes accessable, there is a fair chance that you will be grouped with a<br/>\nShamen or a Druid.  Chloroplast regenerates about 15points of health each<br/>\ntick, more if your sitting down.  Regenerate is about 10, I believe.  With<br/>\nthe combined use of the stone and a Regenerate or Chloroplast spell your<br/>\nmeditation rate effectively increases by 5 more mana per tick.  In the time<br/>\nit took you to read my message you just would have gained back about 30<br/>\nmore mana than you would have access to with out the stone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure an item that increased regen rate would be great.  It would keep all<br/>\nthe casters on crack all the time.  However for game balance reasons and to<br/>\nbe fair to the Enchanters and Bards, it would have to be 1) Hard to get, 2)<br/>\nLore No Drop, 3) Not function as well as Clerity and not stack with that<br/>\nspell, 4) Be camped to hell night and day, 5) Verant would probably put the<br/>\nitem on a mob that was 100% resistant to magic just to annoy us.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack, Knight Defender of the BCK<br/>\nMaster of Recruiting<br/>\nwww.bck.org<br/>\n&quot;The Crimson Knights&quot;<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
