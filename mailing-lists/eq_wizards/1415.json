I<br/>\n&gt; personally know that a 8th level mage, vs. a 8th level wiz is no contest..<br/>\n&gt; the mage has a pet and spells...  Now you are saying that the mage doesn&#39;t<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, if you let him cast. We&#39;re talking about organised duels, right?<br/>\nNo pets summoned before the duel begins is the rule.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen preparing for such a duel, whip out your trusty old tarnished dagger<br/>\n(the weapon you&#39;re likely to have at that level) with 22 speed.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you get the signal, JUMP the mage. And don&#39;t let him cast. If he casts,<br/>\nyou&#39;re not fighting one to one, you&#39;re fighting to one to two, and you lost.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgainst any spell caster, the strategy for a spell caster isn&#39;t &quot;root and<br/>\nnuke&quot;, it&#39;s jump on him and hit fast... while trying to get your spells<br/>\nin. If the mage uses a staff or slow weapon, he&#39;s dead: he won&#39;t interrupt<br/>\nyou often enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you intend to participate in duels, your most important investment is getting<br/>\na weapon with the shortest speed factor. I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a combine<br/>\nor fine steel dagger, but a steel dagger (speed 20) is a good weapon. You don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to do damage, you just want to interrupt the opponent&#39; spells. Against<br/>\na melee fighter, the weapon is irrelevant anyway, root and nuke, and don&#39;t<br/>\nmove near him.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
