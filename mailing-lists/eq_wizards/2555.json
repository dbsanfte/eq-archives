He does close dmg to me now at lvl 20.<br/>\nHe says at lvl 49 mages do lava bolt which does 950 whereas ice comet does<br/>\n1100.  That is almost the same damage as the wizard.  So it seems to me<br/>\nthat there isn&#39;t much of a use to be a wizard if you can be a mage and do<br/>\nalmost the same amount of direct damage plus you have a pet.  So anyone<br/>\ntell me something good about the wiz class to make it worth playing them to<br/>\nhigh levels?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
