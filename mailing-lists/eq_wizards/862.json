Being able to stand inside a building in safety while<br/>\nnuking a monster that cannot hit you is not using your head but cheating.<br/>\nPerhaps this isn&#39;t what you were referring to in your message, but this<br/>\nwould seem to be want Verrant is protecting against, and now that I think<br/>\nabout it, I&#39;d say it&#39;s wise.  Other wise people could go out and solo just<br/>\nabout anything without ever getting hit.  They&#39;d be levelling 2-3 times a<br/>\nday, and the game would be easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nTandayen, Dark Elf Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Wizard LABBS &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wizard-labbs@...\">wizard-labbs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Saturday, May 01, 1999 3:42 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] Re: BUG/FEEDBACK<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Wizard LABBS&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wizard-labbs@...\">wizard-labbs@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Seems like this would be an example of us using our heads to trap and fight<br/>\n&gt;monster reaistily. I don&#39;t know about you but part of any battle involves<br/>\n&gt;having the best position and if we can trp a bunch of dumb monsters in a<br/>\n&gt;building and light it up... Well seems like that is using our heads. The<br/>\n&gt;monster can do this to us and we have to scramble to find an exit.

It is<br/>\n&gt;&gt;very easy to turn on clipping for monsters, but it would allow an obsene<br/>\n&gt;&gt;amount of exploitable bugs.  For instance,  if you stand in a certin spot<br/>\n&gt;&gt;and open a door, your character will get stuck in the door.(I have done<br/>\n&gt;&gt;this) If you gain the ability to do this to a monster, it would allow us<br/>\n&gt;&gt;weak mage types to solo mobs that con red.  It would also allow players to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;attack linked monsters one at a time by getting one to charge while the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;rest a stuck in a tent or behind a dungeon wall.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Have a good weekend, and Happy Hunting<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Malkin (Fennin Ro)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mprez20@...\">mprez20@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mprez20@...\">mprez20@...</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; On the contrary I was told that it was VERY hard to make buildings off<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; limits.  To implement that code for every creatures AI would have been a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; large task and due to time constraints was not implemented<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Just to inform everyone.  This behavior where monsters can attack through<br/>\n&gt;&gt;solid object is not a glitch.  It is a choice they have made, the code to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;turn clipping on for<br/>\n&gt;&gt;monsters is there.  It would be very easy for them to make it so that<br/>\n&gt;&gt;monsters cannot attack through things, but they have chosen to allow this.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I personally can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;&gt;think of any reasons why they would allow this to happen, but I&#39;m sure<br/>\n </span></blockquote>they<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&gt;have their reasons.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Tandayen, Dark Elf Wizard<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Have you visited the new ONElist home page lately?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt;ONElist: The Leading e-mail list and community service on the Internet!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Did you know that we add over 1,000 new e-mail communities every day?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Explore a new hobby, discover a new friend, laugh at a new joke! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
