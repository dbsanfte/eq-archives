You all ran 20 min to your fav kill spot.  Played for<br/>\n&gt;hours of fun.  Night is over.  Do you gate home, leaving your tanks to<br/>\n&gt;run thru what might end up being hostile areas (but usually aren&#39;t), or<br/>\n&gt;do you run with them?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2nd is harder.  Basically, do you die with your party, or abandon them<br/>\n&gt;when there is trouble?  All of this talk of shadowstep gate has made me<br/>\n&gt;think Im in the minority here.  My tanks actually tell me they expect to<br/>\n&gt;die so I can live, if it comes to that.  BUT - I don&#39;t think its right<br/>\n&gt;to leave them. Am I doing them a disservice ?  I would rather try one<br/>\n&gt;more time to get that root off on the MOB killing them so we can all<br/>\n&gt;live (or die) together.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;#2 has lead me to doing a LOT more solo fighting, cause I hate the idea<br/>\n&gt;of either possiblity actually!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Abandon ship, run, gate, zone or otherwise haul butt.  The tanks know your<br/>\nworthless in melee, and if you&#39;ve given it your best shot, they would MUCH<br/>\nrather see you survive than to see you die needlessly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I played a tank, if I knew the end was near, I told everyone to<br/>\nzone... its useless for an entire party to die, when the deaths can be<br/>\nlimited to just 1 or 2 individuals.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never had the first bit of qualm about running...  Your tanks will<br/>\nactually feel better if you get away, because at least they didn&#39;t die for<br/>\nnothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nFlik</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
