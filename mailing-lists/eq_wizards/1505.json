Hate and Sky (or <br/>\n&gt;air). The spells are Alter Plane: Hate and Alter Plane: Sky. They are both <br/>\n&gt;lvl 44 spells. I have a friend who traveled there. He said there are liches <br/>\n&gt;on the hate plane. Personally i cant wait to get to go there but are there <br/>\n&gt;only certain places from which you can cast these spells? This i do no know <br/>\n&gt;he didnt say, but from the way you were talking there is. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
