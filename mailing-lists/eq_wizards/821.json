Now","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-31648167\">When I first started of corse all I had was my handy newbie rusty dagger.<br/>\nOnce I got to about 9 skill I found a staff and have been using one ever<br/>\nsince.  Now I am 15th level.  Around 13th I noticed that I never saw my<br/>\n2hblunt skill going up.  Maybe I just wasn&#39;t meeling enough.  But I stuck<br/>\nwith the Great Stave.  Near the end of 14th and all through 15th.  Only<br/>\nwhen I am with a party I have been using a Giant snake fang just to try to<br/>\nget my piercing up to a semi respectable level.  Now 12 woo hoo :)<br/>\nI have noticed that the only time that it ever seemes to increase is when<br/>\nthe creature is actually beating on me.  If I am just stabbing at a monster<br/>\nas it beats on a party member I have never noticed my skill increase.  The<br/>\ndown side to this is that now at 15th most all blue things will totally<br/>\nwaste me within a few rounds of melee combat.  So its slow for that reason.<br/>\n I can almost always get the creature to attack me.  I just blast it once<br/>\nfor 81 dmg (SoL) and then step into melee.  I get the 3rd degree on<br/>\noccasion from the clerics because they have to spend extra time healing me.<br/>\n But how else will my defense ever increase?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have herd and through practice I must agree.  You will never gain melee<br/>\nskills (Defense, Offence, Peircing, 1hb, 2hb) if you are meleeing something<br/>\nthat is green to you.  Your skills will increase faster if you are in melee<br/>\nwith a yellow or even better a red.  But when the red Dry bones are<br/>\nspanking me for 40 a pop 2 hits a round.  200+ hit points dosen&#39;t last very<br/>\nlong.  Just don&#39;t let yourself drop below 3 bars when using this tactic.<br/>\n1. The clerics will get pissed  that they have to waste more mana on you.<br/>\n2. As you get lower in health MOBS become harder to taunt off of you.  They<br/>\nfeel as you and I do.  Might as well kill the wounded one so he dosen&#39;t<br/>\nrest up and come back later.<br/>\n<br/>\nLomack<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Message: 19<br/>\n&gt;   Date: Thu, 29 Apr 1999 17:03:06 -0700<br/>\n&gt;   From: Donald Taber &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dtaber@...\">dtaber@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: 2-Handed Staff Skill<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;When I started, I was using a one-handed staff and my skill rose<br/>\n&gt;relatively quickly to about 25-30.  I then switched to 2-Handed<br/>\n&gt;staff to raise that skill, but it has NEVER gone up (while raising<br/>\n&gt;from 6th level to 10th).  I tried seeding the skill with a few<br/>\n&gt;training points, and it still has NEVER gone up.  Does the game<br/>\n&gt;have an idea of a primary weapon or something?  Or have I<br/>\n&gt;just been unlucky on raising the skill?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                                                            Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Soren<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
