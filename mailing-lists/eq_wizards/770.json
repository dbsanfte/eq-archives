I am wondering how long it lasts.  From my<br/>\nresearch I think it lasts for X number of hitpoints damage or X number of<br/>\nhits from the MOB.<br/>\n<br/>\nI attack yellow Scythe Beetles with my sheildskin on and perform the ever<br/>\npopular CAST, RUN, CAST technique till my mana is gone.  Normally a yellow<br/>\ncreature will retain a small amount of their hitpoints left so I must melee<br/>\nit.  The beetles hit damn hard (26-40 points) on about half their hits.<br/>\nThis can spell disaster for all your hard work to bring it down.  I swing<br/>\naway and when the beetle strikes me, my magical shield absorbs the ALL the<br/>\ndamage..but for a limited time..normally enough for me to kill the creature.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, anyone know how many hits I can absorb before the shield wears off?<br/>\n<br/>\nZiffnab,<br/>\n<br/>\n17th level wizard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
