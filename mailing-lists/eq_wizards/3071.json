But lets say they shout for a Wizzie 5% of the time and the rest for outher classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nActualy i grouped with 4 outher Wizards in MistMoore and it was kind of nice, the zone was a bit to crowded when we did so i cant realy say much about it outher then we hade alot of fire power. 5 Wizzies doing around 170 points a round :-))<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that about dieing all the time as wizard, i grouped in MM with anather wizard the same level as me then (24) and a druid lv 26, (and 2 paladins and a shaman or something like that ) they both died 3-5 times on one night and i didnt die for 2 levels there and that was to a bug, i got zoned back in to MM when i zoned out :-((. So i think that it depends alot on play style if you die alot or not. And to stop from being flamed about chicking out and zone first or not getting in to the fights, i can tell ya that i almost always zone last in any group i�m in and i dont hesitate to drag that extra pull from the tank and finish him of up close, if it�s a blue or even fight that is. i even take a few hits from reds if need be. The shieldskin and leather spell is great.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n/Askur Wizzie of Veeshan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: Sergey Bukhman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sergeyb@...\">sergeyb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, September 14, 1999 4:04 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: SV: [eq_wizards] Wizard critique<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Sergey Bukhman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sergeyb@...\">sergeyb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Zinken wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Zinken&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zinken@...\">zinken@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hmm i bit of a rant there but as you can see, if wizards where more sought after for groups &gt; then it would be much easier for all us wizards in Norrath.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t know, wizards are pretty much sought after where I come from. I<br/>\n&gt; never have problems getting a group in Mistmoore, if there is a group<br/>\n&gt; wit ha free spot. People do want wizards because they know that if the<br/>\n&gt; situation gets bad, but not hopeless, a wizard can quickly turn the<br/>\n&gt; tides, thus saving someone&#39;s life. And I&#39;m not talking about stopping a<br/>\n&gt; higher level train here. I&#39;m talking bout a too big pull that the group<br/>\n&gt; is evenly matched with (pull does not necessarily refer to just one mob.<br/>\n&gt; I just mean an even fight all around), a wizard can very quickly take<br/>\n&gt; out one of the evens (with some minimal tanking to help) or take out one<br/>\n&gt; blue and seriously damage another. why is that important? Well, clearly,<br/>\n&gt; when you kill someone quickly, you no longer take damage from them for<br/>\n&gt; the rest of the fight. Then the wizard can med and maybe get enough for<br/>\n&gt; another blast or two while the rest of the party will end up beat up,<br/>\n&gt; but definitely not dead.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, evacs are a must at higher level. Yeah, druids have them too, but<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s just one other class with the skill. Shamans have SOW too, but<br/>\n&gt; you don&#39;t see that diminishing from Druid power.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; Sergey<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; KPS, PUNK (Paramilitary Undercover Nuclear Kamikaze)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ???
