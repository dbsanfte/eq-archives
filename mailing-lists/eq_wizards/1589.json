Although even 10pp pieces seems like <br/>\nan impossibility to me. This server seems to be dominated by guild <br/>\ncampers and privateers.  In the time I have been here (on nearly <br/>\nconstantly) for instance there is one and only one person offering int <br/>\nraising bracelets (Radigan) and I beleive they are ac+3, mana+15 and <br/>\nhe is asking a FIRM 15pp each.  I bought an entire set of banded <br/>\narmour \r(for my bard who is stinking rich by my wizards standards and <br/>\ncan make 30 pp in 5 hours of play) less cloak for nearly that price! <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for other items, I have seen a few auctions for woven, magical <br/>\nstaffs or other lore items.  When they are auctioned they are gone <br/>\nimmediately and the prices they fetch are insane (unless you know the <br/>\ncamper .... err seller).  I have seen simple pieces of netted at <br/>\nstarting prices of 30pp!  As for the majority which are never <br/>\nauctioned they are either camped then kept within the camping click or <br/>\nselfishly horded to prevent anyone else from attaining them.  Like I <br/>\nhave said before the game should actually be renamed to everGREED,  <br/>\nGREEDquest, PRIVATEERquest, BARTERquest. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess on a bright side I have heard stories (actually I know of <br/>\nseveral lucky Bast@#ds) that have aquired the runed totem staff for a <br/>\nmere 20pp.  Which is close to the asking price of the FS GS here in <br/>\nmithaniel (over priced land of powergammers) marr.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a 9th level wizard that currently walks Narrath in a shoddy sr <br/>\napprentise robe with a worn great staff.  I have lost count of the <br/>\nnumber of times I have died as a result of trying to do the last 3 <br/>\npoints of damage to a fleeing creature swinging once in what seems <br/>\nlike every 10 seconds yet not willing to wasted the precious 8 mana to <br/>\nfrost the critter to death.  Or was forced to run as a result of 2 <br/>\nsuccessful blows from an enemy.  Sye.... <br/>\n<br/>\nI have only been able to buy 8 spells TOTAL and have 7pp in the bank.  <br/>\nI played yesterday and had one of the most productive (highest kill to <br/>\ntime ratios) nights I can recall and after 18 straight hours of play I <br/>\nhad aquired 8pp! :(  How is one ever to afford anything?  You can&#39;t <br/>\nfight for it as it is camped. In the slim chance that you do get the <br/>\nopportunity to fight, Varent has reduced the odds of anything good <br/>\ndropping so low after the latest patchs (and keep in mind it must be <br/>\nyour turn to loot) that I have projected I would age 30 real years <br/>\nbefore I could ever hope of aquiring one decent item!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t even want to think about the 12th level spells and the fact I <br/>\nwill have to play 7 by 24 for a week to buy one spell! <br/>\n<br/>\nGuile (disillusioned wizard) of the 9th circle.<br/>\n<br/>\n(To twink or not to twink alas that is the question)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Cristie&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cristie@...\">cristie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Thu, 20 May 1999 12:05:52 -0700<br/>\n&gt; X-Priority: 3<br/>\n&gt; X-MSMail-Priority: Normal<br/>\n&gt; X-MimeOLE: Produced By Microsoft MimeOLE V4.72.3110.3<br/>\n&gt; Mailing-List: list <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>; contact <br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards-owner@onelist.com\">eq_wizards-owner@onelist.com</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Delivered-To: mailing list <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List-Unsubscribe: &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards-unsubscribe@...\">eq_wizards-unsubscribe@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mime-Version: 1.0<br/>\n&gt; Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [eq_wizards] Armor Question<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Cristie&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cristie@...\">cristie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Goss yields an AC of 8, and is magical, yet I don&#39;t know what the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>magic does<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; exactly.
