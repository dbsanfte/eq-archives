I camped the<br/>\n&gt; other day with two of my level 40+ friends (warrior and a cleric) and<br/>\n&gt; we killed shadowed men nonstop (as fast as was possible.  We were<br/>\n&gt; constantly waiting for them to respawn, and they respawn in about 5<br/>\n&gt; min or so) for about 3 hours strait and I saw several shadowed<br/>\n&gt; patches, eye, fist, mask, book, shining stone, and numberless weapons,<br/>\n&gt; but no ball.  Is it possible to get it or is it super rare??<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
