Tis the Shimmering Orb, not sure<br/>\nwhere it comes from though.  Does anyone know what level you need to be to<br/>\nget the flowing black robes?  I have started to see more and more<br/>\nspellcasters with this item on them, and some are only level 20.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as looking &quot;cool&quot;, one of my main reasons for wanting to get to level<br/>\n24 (I am 21 now) is for a stylistic reason, namely levitate.  I just think<br/>\nthis is one of the coolest spells out there, even beyond its practical uses.<br/>\nHehe, oh well it should be fun :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Solric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Lim Dul [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sevendegrees@...\">sevendegrees@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 02, 1999 2:35 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] bath robes<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Lim Dul&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sevendegrees@...\">sevendegrees@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHehe.  Yup, although it won&#39;t ruin my gaming experience to keep things as <br/>\nthey are...I think we are all missing out on one of the fun things about the<br/>\n<br/>\ngame: *looking cool* ;)   I was a little dissapointed (? sorry my spelling <br/>\nis bad because I play too much :)  that the one of the strongest robes we <br/>\nhave to look forward to is that fluffy Observer robe that looks as if it was<br/>\n<br/>\nout of the closet of Liberace.  yuck!<br/>\n<br/>\nClosest thing to being visually cool I&#39;ve seen is this Wizard I saw last <br/>\nnight carrying a pulsing rod (forget what it was called).  His wrist kept <br/>\npulsing with a luminescent light...neat!<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;- Graphical features to all Bath Robe wearers is in dire need.<br/>\n&gt;  -- You get that nice savants cap, black iron medallion, damask<br/>\n&gt;leggings, skull of jen tra, different daggers and staff types (no new<br/>\n&gt;graphics for them...warrior classes see differences in every<br/>\n&gt;weapon..just about).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
