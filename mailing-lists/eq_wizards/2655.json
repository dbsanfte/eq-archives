A group of mostly clerics (better killstealers than wizards against undead) and i think a paladin. i saw a wizard and a friend attempting to get fair kills while the cleric group kept stealing from them.<br/>\nthe group was taking both the Reanimated Hand room, and the room adjacent to it, so the wizard and his friend were completely unable to get a kill. Finally when the hand spawned the wizard was fed up and kill stole it (maybe because clerics can&#39;t dismiss undead it?) the other group completely went ballistic and shouted all over the zone that he was a killstealer and never to group with him. i observed this all from outside on the roof (if anyone has been there they&#39;d know what i&#39;m talking about).<br/>\n<br/>\ni just think it&#39;s wierd how the group didn&#39;t even acknowledge that they had stolen every kill the wizard and his friend had tried to get. anyways i think it was just funny</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
