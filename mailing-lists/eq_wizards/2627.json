She was<br/>\n&gt;killing Orc&#39;s on the Kithi side of the<br/>\n&gt;pass. So I cast the eye - moved it around the ORC spawning area - but<br/>\n&gt;could not see her.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;She, however could see me ( the eye ) - then I noticed when I went to<br/>\n&gt;meet her that there where a LOT more Players in the area than I could<br/>\n&gt;see through the eye before .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I asked her to stay there and repeated it again . Out of the 10 players<br/>\n&gt;present - I could only see 2 through the eye - the others were just not<br/>\n&gt;visable. I could see all the ORC&#39;s that spawned - just not all the<br/>\n&gt;players - through the eye.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Is this some form of &quot; cant see all the PC&#39;s through the eye &quot; bug ?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Junerius.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt;Get your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Join a new list today!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Silverion Dragonirder<br/>\n<br/>\nHigh elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\nFenin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\nmoderator mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
