Where is this secret location you<br/>\nmight ask?  Well it is non other than Lake Rathe.  The Lake support Aviak<br/>\nGuards that are great exp and loot for soloing.  There are several Island<br/>\ninside Lake Rathe and have different variations of the Gaurds, ie., ! guard<br/>\nPost with 1 Guard, or 1 Guard Post with 2 guards or 2 Posts with 1 Gaurd<br/>\neach Post......  So choose you destiny.  I would HIGHLY suggest not taking<br/>\non the 2 guards at once unless you have someone with you.  Even at lvl 24 I<br/>\nfind it very difficuly to fight 2 solo.  Reason being is that they are Lvl<br/>\n20-24 but Hit like Lvl 30 Mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso a bit of warning.....If you do not have high swimming skills you best<br/>\nget them up there fast.  The Lake supports a Sea Monster (lvl 53 Mob) that<br/>\nhits for over 100+ per shot.  Now there are boats to tkate you from island<br/>\nto island but mostly I swam.  Started with a low swimming and now have 120<br/>\nswimming in 4.5 Lvls.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell Good Luck, and hope this helps all those stuggling to reach 20+.<br/>\n<br/>\nShadair J&#39;Axx<br/>\n23rd Wizard<br/>\nKarana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
