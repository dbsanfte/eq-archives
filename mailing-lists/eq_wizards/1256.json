I generally hunt with a similar level warrior.  By scrimping and saving <br/>\ntho I have gotten a full set of cloth armor and most of my level 8 spells.  Currently am <br/>\nlevel 10.  Now begins the scrimping and saving to get level 12 spells.  I know that <br/>\nsome others have taken up smithing, etc to make money.. but I chose to save my <br/>\nmoney for the spells themselves rather than spend the little I made on supplies for a <br/>\nskill like smithing.  I&#39;d love to find a money tree but since I think that&#39;s unlikely will just <br/>\nplay patiently and save up slowly.  As others have pointed out here, I suspect that <br/>\ngetting cash will be easier at higher levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nIggie<br/>\nLevel 10 Gnome Wizard<br/>\nCazic-Thule<br/>\n<br/>\n-you have now made level 570 in beer spilling while fishing- &lt;G&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
