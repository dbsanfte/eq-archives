Simply an idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone remembers I suggested earlier that Fade and Shadowstep were generally useless or at least not as useful as they could be.  I also suggested that they should teleport us forward a minimum distance straight ahead (still makes sense to me...???).  Well, one other benefit of revamping the spells that way is that they also then become Travel spells, kind of.  So you dont nescessarily have to be in battle to use them AND it fits in with our class description AND it becomes actually useful in either situation AND we wouldnt have to go beggin to Druids for SoW or Enchanters for Invis at 8th level etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt still wouldnt unbalance the game, its not as if you go all that far in one swipe and it would allow us more travelling abilities.  Would also make the Glimpse line of spells make WAY more sense.  Hmmm I want to pop ahead...what&#39;s up there anyway &lt;casts Glimpse&gt;  oh nothing right now, lets go!<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry people, years of DM&#39;ing and creating two different RPG systems (non-commercial, you can&#39;t really make any money at it nowadays) have warped my brain into trying to fit things into a system that makes sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlhassim, 9th Level Erudite Wizard of E&#39;ci</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
