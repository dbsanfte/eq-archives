So what? Well, except on PvP, why are you compelled to outlevel (because that s what you want?) the powerlevelers? ... Why? If you re on Tunare, I can","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1493136213\">According to Wizard:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; many people trying all classes and it was funny, but as game advance new<br/>\n&gt; specialized tactics come out and in many times Verant is a last one to see<br/>\n&gt; exploit and not a first one as it have to be. Now i have seen that at 5<br/>\n&gt; newer servers first to reach a higest lv are druids !! at valos zek pvp<br/>\n&gt; server it is a same reason is of course kiting and dot spells wich they<br/>\n&gt; have. This is something wrong !<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So what? Well, except on PvP, why are you compelled to outlevel (because<br/>\nthat&#39;s what you want?) the powerlevelers?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Second thing i noted was farming of glowing stain wich we have seen in last<br/>\n&gt; 2 weeks from nowere to see there are now nearly every higer lv caster have<br/>\n&gt; one! It is funny for my glowing black stone wich was a hard to get item is<br/>\n&gt; now nearly underpowered item :) This was stoped unfortunatly to late and<br/>\n&gt; now we wich dont get a stain will never get it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why? If you&#39;re on Tunare, I can probably arrange to get you one for a<br/>\nvery &quot;reasonable&quot; sum.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Now i start to see one other problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So what?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So what hapends .. to make example i spend some time building a wizard and<br/>\n&gt; a warrior to 6 lv and i twinked them with items to make a probe.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Warrior with nearly full large bronze and fine stell sword .. Wizard with<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Loot dropped from level 25+ mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; full woven, rts skull, +10 mana earings ect.. Normaly warrior dies on 3<br/>\n&gt; high blues 100% on this lv .... wizard dont have mana to kill 2 high blue .. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Loot dropped from level 10-20 mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you&#39;ve hit the nail there. A warrior&#39;s prowess is directly linked to the<br/>\nitems he uses, so, even barring the skill levels (which means that a level 1<br/>\nfull of rubicite still cannot take on a level 3 mob and survive, except by<br/>\nthe best of flukes), this helps. A wizard&#39;s prowess is directly linked to<br/>\nthe skill he has (includes spells available), so a wizard cannot be twinked<br/>\noverly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich means WE are the balanced class. Nerf the fighters! :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My warrior take against 8 !!! BLUES and survived .... so he realy have been<br/>\n&gt; affecter imensly... Wizard tryed against same 2 blues and he died in same<br/>\n&gt; mode as before.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Once, as a level 3 warrior, with 2 cloth, guild tunic, and one patchwork<br/>\nand a tarnished long swords, I was *locked* in place (=1.5 bubble of health,<br/>\ncan&#39;t run or you die) against a stream of level 2 mobs. I killed almost<br/>\n10 before being overwhelmed :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNo need to twink :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Same effect i have seen in mistmore .. grouping with many people i have<br/>\n&gt; seen what diference can make overpowered items... warrior hitting for 70 a<br/>\n&gt; hit it is 140 - 160 counting a bash ... without mana use a turn!!  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ok, get a warrior and shut up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Wizard at 27 lv can do only 178 damage and he will be out Of mana in 6 - 7<br/>\n&gt; hits a warrior can go without end and with god items he will alos need less<br/>\n&gt; cleric healing!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ok, get a warrior and shut up.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan your warrior gate? Can your warrior save the whole party without dying<br/>\n(evacuates)? Can your warrior root its ennemy and kill him safely?<br/>\n<br/>\nWith &quot;god&quot; items (i.e. the best in line before planar items), your warrior<br/>\ncan no more solo an unending stream of blue monsters than a wizard.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I see this as a very big problem wich will get worse as time pass if<br/>\n&gt; something is not done. What are yours opinion on this are there any<br/>\n&gt; possible solution wich you see for this?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What problem? Do the groups reject you as being a weakling? Do they say to<br/>\nyou &quot;sorry, we want to keep up our average of 5.3 minutes per mob, and <br/>\nyou&#39;re slowing us down?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf so, the problem is not your class, it&#39;s the people you group with.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nVincent ARCHER  -=-=-  Herve Schauer Consultants -=-=-   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:archer@...\">archer@...</a><br/>\nTel: +33 1 41 40 97 00                          Fax: +33 1 41 40 97 09<br/>\n        01 41 40 97 00                                  01 41 40 97 09</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
