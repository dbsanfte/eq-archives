So you can colect one quest<br/>\nitem, log off colect another one log off and when you have all you go to<br/>\nNPC and he will make a item for you. This will also be much more in spirit<br/>\nof everquest. All normal items can be found on one of mobs of same level in<br/>\none dungeon, so if you wish one item you have to harvest all dungeon to<br/>\nfind it! <br/>\n<br/>\nOther thing is to make a items wear so after some time you have to buy a<br/>\nnew one.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis will end with a spot hunting will give more interesting things to do<br/>\nin game. Only problem is that it will give more job for verant guys in<br/>\ncreating quests, at wich they are very slow .... (broken quest, practice<br/>\nresearch quest....)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also read a veri interesting article by a 50 lv wizard Samir from<br/>\nFire of heavn guild wich say that a problem with balancing magic classes is<br/>\nthat we are no more balanced with mele and wisdom clases as they are much<br/>\nmore item dipendent and they start to be significaly stronger as stronger<br/>\nitems are vidly disponible, much more then any int casting class wich are<br/>\nmore dependent on lv and spell dispnibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nexample my warior with full bronze armour have win a fight against 8 blue!<br/>\nat 7 lv he also can take freely against any yelloy , wizard twinked with a<br/>\nFBR and RTS skull int rings  with full woven (wich is a same lv items as<br/>\nbronze armour) will lost against 3 blue 100% and will lost against any<br/>\nyellow. So it is ovius that items help much more mele classes to past low<br/>\nlv but not nearly as much a int classes. hmmm There is something wrong for<br/>\nmy opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSilverion Dragonirder<br/>\n<br/>\nHigh elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\nFenin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\nmoderator mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
