A magician&#39;s pet is<br/>\nMUCH more powerful than an actual tank at higher levels.  I saw this when my<br/>\nguild got together and the main even was when the melee types had one on<br/>\nones with the magician&#39;s pet.  Even though the pet was blue it had a nasty<br/>\ntendency to shred the tanks.  A paladin was able to beat one when he used<br/>\nhis LOH and a ranger was able to kite one to death, but in melee it was no<br/>\ncontest.  We&#39;re talking like pet did 5 bars of damage and tank did one.  I<br/>\nthink this more than anything indicates that pet wielding classes are<br/>\noverpowered.  Their pets are better tanks than tanks and their nukes aren&#39;t<br/>\nTHAT far below ours.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
