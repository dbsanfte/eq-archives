At this point, I haven&#39;t traveled around too much, but i rarely <br/>\n&gt;see<br/>\n&gt;people from Erudin that i&#39;ve grouped with or talked to in the past.  I play<br/>\n&gt;around the Qeynos area, usually West karanas, so its not too far from my <br/>\n&gt;home<br/>\n&gt;town.  With a population of approximately 2000 - 3000 players on the server <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;a zone population of around 30-50 ppl, no one gives a shit about my name or <br/>\n&gt;if i<br/>\n&gt;have KS from them before or not.  So my reputation is pointless at this <br/>\n&gt;time and<br/>\n&gt;i don&#39;t give a shit if people hate me.  There are some people i steal from <br/>\n&gt;often<br/>\n&gt;and they do hate me to some extent, but i don&#39;t really care about that.  <br/>\n&gt;Since<br/>\n&gt;they can just go else where if they don&#39;t want me to KS from them, but i <br/>\n&gt;can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;travel solo too much since i die easily as a wizard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      On the power gaming / whining issue of my personality.   YES ! I LOVE <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;powergame !  Currently, i play around 6 hours/day after work, and 12 - 15<br/>\n&gt;hours/day on the weekend.  I love to level just for the hell of it, don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;really<br/>\n&gt;care too much about Role Playing, although I do RP sometimes.  But not very<br/>\n&gt;often.  maybe only 20-30% of the time I am on.  Power Gaming keeps the fun <br/>\n&gt;in it<br/>\n&gt;for me,  I don&#39;t like spending a lot of time doing NOTHING.  Its more fun <br/>\n&gt;for me<br/>\n&gt;to see that i&#39;ve gained some lvl after spending x amount of time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      You also inform me that people like to train stuff to me after i KS <br/>\n&gt;from<br/>\n&gt;them, maybe this is the issue in dungeons but i don&#39;t goto dungeons often.  <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt;like to stay out doors cuz dungeons are just too messy with tones of ppl <br/>\n&gt;around.<br/>\n&gt;So there is little risk for me to get trained.  Sometimes people try to <br/>\n&gt;train<br/>\n&gt;bandits at me(west karanas), but they just end up dying themselves with me<br/>\n&gt;stealing a few off their trains. This has happened quite a number of times <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;its not a problem for me to deal with.  I also had other Wizards from <br/>\n&gt;groups<br/>\n&gt;standing behind me in an attempt to train, but i usually keep an eye on my <br/>\n&gt;msg<br/>\n&gt;board to see when they cast, and i wait for them to cast first.  If they <br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;cast and just waiting for me to make the first move, i usually cast a weak<br/>\n&gt;spell(shock of frost) on the mob and let them cast harder to train <br/>\n&gt;themselves.<br/>\n&gt;I also had this happen quite a few times.  But again, its not a big <br/>\n&gt;problem.  It<br/>\n&gt;is also funny sometimes the people i KS from think that if they just go in <br/>\n&gt;while<br/>\n&gt;i med, or something, then i won&#39;t have mana to KS from them.  But i usually <br/>\n&gt;med<br/>\n&gt;anywas out of habbit even though i have full mana, i usually just keep <br/>\n&gt;pressing<br/>\n&gt;F8 and keep an eye on who is attacking etc through the msg board.  Those <br/>\n&gt;people<br/>\n&gt;who go in too fast are usually unprepared and not organized,  they get in<br/>\n&gt;trouble themselves and ask for their group to help.  But a lot of times <br/>\n&gt;their<br/>\n&gt;groups don&#39;t have clerics or other types of healers(a lot tanks around west<br/>\n&gt;karanas)  so they end up dying and then get mad at me cuz i didn&#39;t KS the <br/>\n&gt;bandit<br/>\n&gt;so they could live.  I&#39;ve had this happen 3 times so far.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      After saying that, i see a lot of skill involved in KS , not just <br/>\n&gt;over<br/>\n&gt;power but to see when to KS and when to wait.  There is much more strategy<br/>\n&gt;involved with KS than just grouping and kill/med all the time.  Its more <br/>\n&gt;fun for<br/>\n&gt;me to go around picking ppl&#39;s kills when i don&#39;t have a group so i can <br/>\n&gt;still lvl<br/>\n&gt;and not just sit around doing dick all.  I tried the method of looking up <br/>\n&gt;using<br/>\n&gt;/who lvl, for ppl who are my lvl, but  a lot of ppl are anonymous(as am I) <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;the people who are not, i usually ask.  They either are already grouped<br/>\n&gt;themselves or are logging off(maybe thats just an excuse).  I don&#39;t blame <br/>\n&gt;people<br/>\n&gt;for not grouping with me, they do their stuff i do mine.  And i don&#39;t care <br/>\n&gt;if<br/>\n&gt;they blame me for KS their kills.  In a non-PVP environment, i do whatever <br/>\n&gt;i<br/>\n&gt;want, they do whatever they want.  If they don&#39;t like how i operate , they <br/>\n&gt;can<br/>\n&gt;try to train me, but it has NEVER worked so far.  Trains usually hate them <br/>\n&gt;way<br/>\n&gt;more than me and shadow step works quite nicely most of the time.  The only<br/>\n&gt;times I die is when i am stupid for not saving enough mana for shadow step <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;then gate, or that some mob spawns beside me while i am attacking.   It <br/>\n&gt;does not<br/>\n&gt;happen often, but its always my fault when it happens.  It is, however, <br/>\n&gt;NEVER<br/>\n&gt;due to the fact that someone else purposely tried to kill me.  Maybe this <br/>\n&gt;will<br/>\n&gt;be different if i am in a dungeon, but again i don&#39;t goto dungeons and <br/>\n&gt;won&#39;t go<br/>\n&gt;anytime soon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      To those people who are very ANTI--KS, i used to be just like you.  <br/>\n&gt;Anonyed<br/>\n&gt;at everyone who stole from me or my group, but now i just do whatever i <br/>\n&gt;want, i<br/>\n&gt;group a lot as well, and i KS the rest of the time.  It puts more fun into <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;game for myself since i love to PowerGame and lvl fast.  Do what you will , <br/>\n&gt;try<br/>\n&gt;to KILL those darn KSer if u wish, if they die, its their fault for being <br/>\n&gt;stupid<br/>\n&gt;and not carefully looking at the situation at hand.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Looking to expand your world?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;ONElist has over 165,000 e-mail communities from which to choose! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
