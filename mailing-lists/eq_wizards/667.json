Wizards have it tough already getting to high levels.<br/>\nUntil<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lvl 12 or so you are effectively a magician with no pet (and therefore a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pretty weak magician.)  If they hurt wizards offensively there would<br/>\nhave to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be some change defensively to offset it.  I mean, wizards only real way<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; survive is nuke the critter into oblivion fast enough that it can&#39;t take<br/>\n&gt; &gt; down your paltry hit point pool through your nearly nonexistant AC.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; seriously think this is just a rumor, though.  EQ is balanced to be PvE,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a Wizard is, in general, not better off than any other classes.  I mean,<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; high levels you may be the only one who can solo a Hill Giant, but after<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do that a young lion could maul you because it takes all your mana to<br/>\nkill<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the giant.  I think the drill here is remain calm and then if they gimp<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wizards flood them with polite feedbacks on why this was bad.  Heck,<br/>\nWizards<br/>\n&gt; &gt; were gimped right near the end of beta, too, and feedbacks seem to have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; improved that situation.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Share the wealth!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Tell a friend about ONElist&#39;s 130,000 free e-mail communities!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
