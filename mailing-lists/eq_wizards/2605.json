All races do well in groups but I solo<br/>\n90% of the time.  When soloing, for me, its all about mana as I dont get hit<br/>\nunless I want to melee a bit.  With the highest starting int, the Erudite<br/>\ncan have the highest int of any of the races.  I started my Erudite with 140<br/>\nint.  I didn&#39;t know exaclty what I was doing at that point so I didn&#39;t max<br/>\nmy int at 142.  Not that big a deal...  Anyways, with some decent items my<br/>\nint is now at 165 and i know i can easily get it to 180 with a few more<br/>\nitems.  My total mana at level 29 is 1060 compared to 870 without wearing my<br/>\nequipment.  190 mana or about 20 percent(one bubble) extra mana makes a huge<br/>\ndifference.  This is very significant when soloing as it often means the<br/>\ndifference between taking down that yellow or attacking those two blues.<br/>\nAlso the Erudite has a very high stamina stat.  This is very important to me<br/>\nin that I play on Rallos Zek and two Flame Shocks(lvl 29 DD 237 dmg) will<br/>\nvery nearly kill me whereas it might kill another race.  This has been the<br/>\ndifference between other wizzies and I when going head to head...<br/>\n<br/>\nEuros Arcane<br/>\nRallos Zek<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mark Stokes [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mark.Stokes@...\">Mark.Stokes@...</a>]On Behalf Of<br/>\nmstokes<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 29, 1999 7:31 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_wizards] Race diference?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: mstokes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mstokes@...\">mstokes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; what you think about other races?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>All I can say is that I love my Gnome.  Right now my Int is only 130, but<br/>\nwith a<br/>\ndecent group I&#39;m never using more than 20% mana in a fight anyway (unless<br/>\nthings<br/>\nget ugly).  I&#39;ve gotten my Dex up to 101 and at level 12 I regain<br/>\nconcentration<br/>\nat least once every 2 fights.  That is when the mob gets to me :).  High<br/>\ndexterity and intelligence is great for trade skills.  I&#39;ll gain 2 skill<br/>\npoints<br/>\nfor every three to four attempts while baking and brewing, and have a<br/>\nsuccess<br/>\nrate much higher than the spoiler boards predict.  I certainly hopes this<br/>\nholds<br/>\ntrue when it comes to spell research.  I think Gnomes will hold a very clear<br/>\nadvantage in this area.  I just wish we had more choices when it comes to<br/>\nour<br/>\nrobe selection.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nMalkin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nWho is the most visited e-mail list community Web Service?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nONElist.com - where more than 20 million e-mails are exchanged each day!<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
