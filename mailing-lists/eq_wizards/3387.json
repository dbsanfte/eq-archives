I already got that and<br/>\nthe acumen mask and the runescale cloak. I&#39;m now trying to get the<br/>\ntemperate flux staff, but it&#39;s not easy since Sol A and Permafrost are<br/>\ncompletely horrible dungeons (ever wonder why they are virtually<br/>\nempty?). <br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nSergey<br/>\n<br/>\nWorker bees can leave<br/>\nEven drones can fly away<br/>\nThe queen is their slave</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
