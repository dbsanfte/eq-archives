Unlike UO, you do not need a supply of<br/>\nreagents to cast spells.  Once you have the spell you can cast as much as<br/>\nyou like as long as you have sufficient mana, which you can always get by<br/>\nresting or meditating.  Meditation is a skill, use it a lot and you will<br/>\nregain mana faster.  It&#39;s pretty cool, b/c you can practice as much as you<br/>\nwant without cost.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think in higher level spells there are items you need to have in your<br/>\npossesion to cast certain spells, but I am level six and haven&#39;t run into it<br/>\nyet.  I think it&#39;s rare though.  Good luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:XxDEANERxX@...\">XxDEANERxX@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:XxDEANERxX@...\">XxDEANERxX@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Thursday, April 29, 1999 3:03 PM<br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] wizard spells<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:XxDEANERxX@...\">XxDEANERxX@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;can someone tell me what i need to create spells for a human wizard....i<br/>\n </span></blockquote>have<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;not yet gotten the game but will in the next week(i need a new<br/>\n&gt;proccesor)....please help me<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Cooking, health, entertainment, travel, politics, business...<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Whatever your interest, ONElist has something for everyone!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
