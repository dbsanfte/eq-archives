Well I am a 24th level Wizard who has been solo-ing since lvl 16.  I<br/>\n&gt; thought to get exp I had to be grouped, that I could not solo anything.<br/>\n&gt; Well granted that was the case sometimes, but I Learned to adapt to the<br/>\n&gt; environment I fought in.  Like fighting YK&#39;s in West Commonlands, which then<br/>\n&gt; turned into fight Kodiaks in WC.  From there I went to the Oasis and fought<br/>\n&gt; Caimans, crocks, and Deep Water crocks and Caimans.  Know your limits<br/>\n&gt; people, our class was not meant to jump into a fight and melee the monster,<br/>\n&gt; we were meant to stand back and blast them out of existence.  If you have<br/>\n&gt; not seen on any of the messages before our melee skills are only (lvl +1) *<br/>\n&gt; 3 which is quite low for any class.  Maybe this should be a hint to you as<br/>\n&gt; not to try and jump into a fight.  If you are in a group that is fighting<br/>\n&gt; RED mobs and your spells are being resisted then I say you shouldn&#39;t be in<br/>\n&gt; that group to begin with.  Those mobs are 5+ levels above you and your<br/>\n&gt; skills as a WIZARD can not help.  Go back to that spot after a few more<br/>\n&gt; levels and try again, don&#39;t whine that you couldn&#39;t do anything to help.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have my share of deaths, and until I found Lake Rathe at Level 19 I was<br/>\n&gt; getting waxed by Sand Giants in Oasis of Marr because people were training<br/>\n&gt; them left and right down the beach for fun.  At Level 24 I am still solo-ing<br/>\n&gt; most the time I am on in South Karana fighting Centaur Archers or Avaik<br/>\n&gt; Harriers.  I die everyone in a while because my timing may be off, or a blue<br/>\n&gt; mob resists 3 of my spells which leave me with no mana and about 1/4 of his<br/>\n&gt; health.  Sure I would love to be able to jump in there and melee it.  And<br/>\n&gt; for those times I have to I use O&#39;Kiels Radiation which gives me a little<br/>\n&gt; extra punch to the mob.  I rarely fight White or Yellow mobs unless I am<br/>\n&gt; grouped.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Whining that Veriant did us wrong or that we are weak is not the correct<br/>\n&gt; thing to do.  The best thing I see is make the best of wheat we have and<br/>\n&gt; that is our power and knowledge of how to use it wisely, not foolishly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shadair J&#39;Axx<br/>\n&gt; 24th Wizard<br/>\n&gt; Karana<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Give back to your community through &quot;Grow to Give.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; See homepage for details.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGet free personalized email from GTE at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gtemail.net\">http://www.gtemail.net</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
