I am a level 17 Wizard on Fennin Ro.  I find that the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; only way I can nuke an opponent is to Root him first because it is<br/>\nutterly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; impossible to Nuke, say, Ambassador DVinn while he&#39;s piercing you.  I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; excellent at timing casts, and they just attack to fast for us to get<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cast before their next hit, and most likely, they will.  I don&#39;t see at<br/>\nall<br/>\n&gt; &gt; how Wizards cast fast, that&#39;s one of our fallbacks, the other is the<br/>\nlong<br/>\n&gt; &gt; waiting times for mana regeneration.  But no worries.  There are things<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; &gt; may get that help restoration of mana.  Back to casting... It&#39;s terribly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; slow, Flame Shock takes a LONG time to cast, and it is impossible to<br/>\ncast it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on enemies that can Duel Wield and Bash.  Thankfully Root is there to<br/>\nsave<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you, because Root casts relativlely fast, but Root hardly holds.  And my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Alteration is maxed.  I have 142 INT, soon to be 148.  I get 5 casts out<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Flame Shock for 102 Dmg each on enemies with lower magic resistance.<br/>\nOk,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; well, that was a fun chat.  I still love my Wizard and would never give<br/>\nhim<br/>\n&gt; &gt; up for any other class.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Did you know that we add over 1,000 new e-mail communities every day?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Explore a new hobby, discover a new friend, laugh at a new joke!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Did you know that knowledge is power?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Join a new ONElist e-mail community and strengthen your mind!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
