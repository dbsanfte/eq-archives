Then hang back again.  If I&#39;m FM I hit him twice with shock again.  If we&#39;re in a relatively safe place, I&#39;ll actually sit and start medding.  I try not to let my mana go below 60%.  So I never burn on a creature that we&#39;re obviously going to kill anyway.  Unless:  Someone is about to die, the creature can only be hit by magical weapons or spells, or the creature resists my root spell and is running away.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrev<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; From: \tPaul McClung[SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:p.e.mcclung@...\">p.e.mcclung@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Reply To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: \tTuesday, April 20, 1999 11:54 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: \t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: \t[eq_wizards] Mana management?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Paul McClung &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:p.e.mcclung@...\">p.e.mcclung@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In groups, whats a typical strategy for managing mana?  At 12th level, I<br/>\n&gt; guesstimate I have about 360-370 mana, almost enough for 6 lightning shock<br/>\n&gt; spells, but I don&#39;t want to waste it all on just one kill, and yet I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; feel very comforatable sitting around doing nothing.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; - Flik<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking for a new hobby?
