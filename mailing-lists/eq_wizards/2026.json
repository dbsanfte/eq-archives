Hell even if the familiar did<br/>\nabsolutely NOTHING for us at all and cost 200 mana to cast I would still use<br/>\nit!  As many people have stated we really dont have anything that makes us<br/>\nunique.  We just have the best offensive DD spells and that&#39;s it (which in<br/>\nsome cases does not even make us very useful).  A familiar would be a nicer<br/>\nstylistic sign that we are wizards and not just some bozo in a bath robe.<br/>\nIt would be the coolest thing to have a little black cat at your heels all<br/>\nthe time even if they didnt act as a mana battery.  Anyway... I am rambling<br/>\nI will probably feedback this idea cause its so darn cool.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Solric<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: James Dwyer [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdwar@...\">jdwar@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 27, 1999 3:46 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_wizards] The worth of a Wizard (long)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: James Dwyer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdwar@...\">jdwar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have an idea. All the other spellcasting classes have pets (including<br/>\nhybrids with their charms). Instead of getting a pet, since we are so<br/>\nmana dependent ( and the other classes have pets which do WAY more for<br/>\nthe mana then we can do with DD over time) we get a familiar.<br/>\n<br/>\nA familiar is similar to a pet ( a MOB that would follow us ) but it<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be for battle. It would act as a mana battery increasing our<br/>\ntotal mana. It would cast a lot more mana to cast than it gives us. If<br/>\nit dies, we lose the amount of mana that it gives us and maybe damage us<br/>\na bit. It will not attack or defend. It will attract the frenzy of<br/>\nintelligent MOBs but it will also turn invisible with us.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt could be a small cat, dog, skunk, whatever (random?) and we would get<br/>\nmaybe 3 or 4 throughout our ranks that have increasing amount of mana.<br/>\nThis would offset a lot of our complaints on being a unique class, being<br/>\nable to compete, etc. Plus it would be fun! Wizards throughout lore have<br/>\nused familiars to aid them in their studies. Since we rely ENTIRELY on<br/>\nour mana to survive (unlike others who have permanent pet to aid) this<br/>\nwould help us get that extra root off and run, or that last blast to get<br/>\nthe 2nd blue.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think? I know it&#39;s unlikely it will happen, but it sure<br/>\nsounds like a good idea :) And it would make us unique and it would<br/>\nenhance our artillerly challenged butts :P<br/>\n<br/>\nCroesus Illuminatus (Xegony)<br/>\n*Go for the eyes Boo!
