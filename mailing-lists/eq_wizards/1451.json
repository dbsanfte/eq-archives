How much higher level mob do you think a duo (wizard and tank), or a full group 4-5 people with you the wizard can solo? I realise that going over 5 levels up for a wizard is suicide because the mob will resist all your spells and then methodically work it&#39;s way through you.<br/>\n<br/>\nCase in point, my group was in the Gorge of King Xorbb hunting muddies and the gorge and chasm minos. For some reason we were deathly afraid of the evil eyes. I don&#39;t know why, but that&#39;s how it is. Fortunately one of them noticed one of us and started casting spells at us, and it&#39;s pet started whacking us. All of us thought we were gonna die, but we&#39;d  go down fighting. We tore loose with everything we had on the eye, and it died in under 5 seconds flat. No joke. It&#39;s pet was harder to kill than the eye.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my short list of excellent XP places. <br/>\n<br/>\nLvls 10-13    Black Burrow - Giant Snakes Good loot, GREAT xps<br/>\nLvls 12-14    Erud&#39;s Crossing - Pull the zombie sailors for good loot and xps (left of the docks)<br/>\nLvls 14-16    Oasis - Caimans and Crocodiles.<br/>\nLvls 14-16    Black Burrow - Elite Gnolls and Commanders<br/>\nLvls 15-17    Infected PAW - Gnoll Shamans, Renn Rexx, High Shaman Phido, Gnoll Nobles, Gnoll Captains<br/>\nLvls 15-18    Oasis - DeepWater Caimans and Deep Water Crocodiles <br/>\nLvls 17-20    Beholder/Gorge of King Xorbb - Chasm and Gorge Minotaurs as well as Evil Eyes<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s as far as I&#39;ve gotten. Hope this helps anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nZalbar<br/>\n18th Wizard<br/>\nSolusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
