I am not sure where\r<br/>\nthis parchment was trying to lead me, since I am\r<br/>\nnot sure where this parchment was trying to lead\r<br/>\nme, since I am still a lower leveled wizard, and\r<br/>\ndo not have much knowledge of Norrath yet.  Has\r<br/>\nanyone else gotten this piece of parchment?  Does\r<br/>\nanyone know about this quest?\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI just thought anout it when someone was talking\r<br/>\nabout killing scarecrows at some garden place.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAppreciate any info.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDason Falth\r<br/>\nErudite Wizard Lvl 6</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
