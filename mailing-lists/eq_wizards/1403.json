Verant need to do something about the mages, enchanters and<br/>\nwizards. I think Ken has a point, combine the lot into one. When Verant split<br/>\nthem it sounded a great idea, I thought it was at the time too. But, the<br/>\nreality is quite different, unfortunately.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGregory Egan wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Gregory Egan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gemd@...\">gemd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was attracted to playing a wizard by the way the class was described in<br/>\n&gt; the game&#39;s manual, but if I had to do it over again (and I won&#39;t because I<br/>\n&gt; have already put a lot of time into my character, and want to play with my<br/>\n&gt; friends who are of the same level as I), I would pick a druid or shaman<br/>\n&gt; type character. They have great spells, which can also be cast on other<br/>\n&gt; party members, and aren&#39;t so weak in weapons and AC as wizards are. I hate<br/>\n&gt; it when I tell my friends about the spells I can get, only to find out they<br/>\n&gt; can be cast only on myself (shielding, resistant skin, etc.) My ranger<br/>\n&gt; friend casts Skin like Wood on my all the time, I have nothing to<br/>\n&gt; reciprocate. I think wizards as a class are short changed, and have never<br/>\n&gt; seen anyone do a /shout looking for a wizard to join with them as they do<br/>\n&gt; for rangers, shamans, bards, etc. Just my 2 cents.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Greg (Kronan)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking to expand your world?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ONElist has over 145,000 email communities to choose from! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
