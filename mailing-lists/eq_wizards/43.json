Spell damage seems to be linked to level somehow, anyone<br/>\n&gt;have any idea how?  Is it just 1 extra point per level?  Is<br/>\n&gt;it spell dependant?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;For example, as a fifth level wizard using Shock of Fire, I was<br/>\n&gt;consistantly doing 13 points of damage.  After going to 6th<br/>\n&gt;level, I am consistantly doing 14 points.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes it does 1 additional damage per lvl but there is a cap. Shock of Fire<br/>\ncaps at 15 dmg if i remember correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2.  Also, I have been playing around with the spells, and I am having<br/>\n&gt;trouble getting O&#39;keils Radiation to work.  How does it work and<br/>\n&gt;what is the best way to use it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My opinion is O&#39;keils is really a waste of mana, i bought it for my Wiz<br/>\nduring P4 (of course it wasn&#39;t working during P4)<br/>\nSince then i have seen it cast on others and people have cast it on me.<br/>\nIt&#39;s like a shielding spell that does damage to <br/>\nmonsters that are close to you. The problem with it in my opinion is that<br/>\nit doesn&#39;t last nearly long enough to make it <br/>\nworth casting. Total time it lasts about 30 secs or so.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;3.  Any idea where I can find a Glimpse spell in Freeport?  I have<br/>\n&gt;tried the guild and can not find it for sale.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not that<br/>\n&gt;great<br/>\n&gt;of a spell, but I think it&#39;s the only one I don&#39;t have.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No idea .. sorry ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;                                                        Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                                                            Soren<br/>\n&gt;                                                            Wizard Level<br/>\n&gt;6<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ONElist.com\">http://www.ONElist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Visit our homepage and share with us your experiences at ONElist of the Week! </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
