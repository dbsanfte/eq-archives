I found that leveling<br/>\nwas very slow indeed and it was getting really boring camping with my groups<br/>\ntill the sun comes up.   However, i was on a few days ago in the morning and my<br/>\nregular group wasn&#39;t on.  I shouted for about 30 min and no one wanted to join<br/>\nup with me for bandit hunting.  Out of boredom, i went down to the bandit camps<br/>\nto see if i can find a group there(West karanas on top of Hill).  I found this<br/>\ngroup of 6 there camping the bandits so i just sat around shouting for groups<br/>\nonce again. But while those guys were fighting the bandits, i thought, hey might<br/>\nas well try to see if i can kill one solo, if i can&#39;t, then they will probably<br/>\nhelp me anyways.  I attacked one bandit and killedh im in 3 shots with Shock of<br/>\nLightning.  and WOW ! so much XP !!!   so i just kept going.  I got around 10-15<br/>\npp in 30 min and gained 1 bubble of xp. normall i gain 1 bubble in 6-8 hours of<br/>\nplaying.   FINALLY ! i found how to have fun with my wizard and not be the lamer<br/>\nthat spent all his time trying to group and get shitty XP cuz of the split<br/>\nbetween members !!   who cares if they think i am a kill stealer, its not like<br/>\nthey can do anything about it HAHAHA.  too bad for them that they wont group<br/>\nwith me.  I also found some wizards are really stupid, the group  of 6 i was<br/>\nstealing from had a lvl 14 wizard and a lvl 11 wizard. and none of them could<br/>\nstop me from stealing. its odd but true... ppl just don&#39;t think.. oh well.. i<br/>\nhope you all try to just have fun and not give a shit what other ppl think for<br/>\nonce.   then you might find why Varent say we are a balanced race, i personally<br/>\nthink we were made to give grief to others heehhe.. j/k   I personally think we<br/>\nshould be changed to Erudite Magical Theives hehe..</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
