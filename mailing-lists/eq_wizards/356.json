Look for<br/>\ndeath beetles.  These should con yellow to your level 10 friends.  They hit<br/>\nhard sometimes but are excellent XP givers.  Also Tormented Dead and Gtr<br/>\nSkeletons are good to find and kill...oh yeah..look for the Jack O&#39;<br/>\nLantirns.  All these should be fine.

I&#39;m 14th level and just coming into<br/>\nmy power right now. Right now the rest of the people in my group are between<br/>\n3-5 levels below me. So I figure I&#39;ll just solo and get xps slower, but also<br/>\nnot hinder their progress either. Where should I go? I&#39;ve gone to the<br/>\nchessboard and killed pawns, bishops and their annoying pets, as well as the<br/>\nodd King that shows up. A dwarven friend of mine was telling me how his 6<br/>\nmember lvl 10 party was completely wiped out in Unrest down to the last man.<br/>\nI made the following conclusions:<br/>\n<br/>\na. Unrest is nasty<br/>\nb. My dwarven friend&#39;s party is stupid for not running from something they<br/>\ncan&#39;t win<br/>\n<br/>\nI can admire going out gloriously next to your comrade, but not when death<br/>\nisn&#39;t permanent.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, question, if I take my group into unrest what should I be looking to<br/>\nkill? Is there somwhere else that is nearby that I should go instead? My<br/>\ndwarf friend said to hit the steamfonts, suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nZalbar<br/>\n14th Wizard<br/>\nSolusek Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nNew hobbies?
