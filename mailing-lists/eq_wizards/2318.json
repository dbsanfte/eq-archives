Let the tanks deal some damage before you start<br/>\ncasting. And don&#39;t cast again right away. If you can get the timing right,<br/>\nit is much easier and you have a lot less down time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the Druid, I don&#39;t know their spells that well. But I do know that<br/>\nDruids are mainly for outdoors, so my thought is, can she do that kind of<br/>\ndamage in a dungeon? Or is that spell an outdoor spell only?<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jay Hollums [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhollums@...\">jhollums@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, June 11, 1999 1:17 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [eq_wizards] General new observations from a level 13 wiz<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Jay Hollums&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhollums@...\">jhollums@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I guess it is bad I come on here to give my observations, but here<br/>\nthey are:<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I have discovered the wonders of doing the most damage to a Monster,<br/>\nThey come right at you.  Hunt you till you cry, and then kill you, no matter<br/>\nwhat your friends do to try to save&#92;taunt&#92;interpose for you.  I have to<br/>\nstand so far back that I don&#39;t even get the combat messages or sounds, and<br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t even work all the time.  Yes I&#39;m kicking ass and taking<br/>\nnames... but at what cost...  (It was great when a dwarf was complaining<br/>\nabout me being in the group as a exp. stealer when I shocked of lighting<br/>\nonce too often and  the monster left the party 100 yards back in preference<br/>\nfor me. :)  shut him up quick *chuckle*)<br/>\n<br/>\nNext I have discovered the POWER of the druids...  What I&#39;m about to relate<br/>\nto you was fully observed and discussed with a druid in my clan...  She at<br/>\n14th level gets a spell called conflageration(sp)  it does 65 points of<br/>\ndamage for 35 mana. 1.86 dam per mana.  I do at level 13, 79 points of<br/>\ndamage for 60 mana. 1.32 dam per mana.  We casted the spells at close to the<br/>\nsame rate... we timed 5 of mine to 4 of hers.  How can we claim to be the<br/>\nmasters of anything after this little show of power? btw at the end of the<br/>\ntest she did 260 hps dam for 140 mana and I did 395 hps dam for 240 mana.<br/>\nFruther I would like you to realize that when I get to level 14 i&#39;ll do 1<br/>\nmore hps dam in a slightly shorter period of time.  Not bad but nothing like<br/>\ni would expect from the masters of damage that I expected and still do<br/>\nexpect the wizard to be.  (she pulled a monster off of me with her spells<br/>\nonce and another time she pulled the monster on herself after a set of<br/>\nspells [it saved vs 2 of mine I had cast doing only 36 and 39 respectivly])<br/>\n(these were wolly calfs, and orc Mounteneers/shamans)<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nHaving difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\nTry ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
