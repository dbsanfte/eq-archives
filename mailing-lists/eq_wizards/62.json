MS for its obvious protective benefits, Frost Bolt<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s a nice basic offensive spell, Root (to hold a creature) and<br/>\nIS (to smack him around with sleet). You&#39;ll need to study Alteration a<br/>\nbit or Root will constantly fizzle until you build it up around 10. <br/>\n<br/>\nRight now my life mainly consists of fishing, practicing spells and<br/>\nmedidating, with the occasional hunting expedition. =) (Meditating is a<br/>\ngreat skill, if you don&#39;t have it yet get it as soon as you can. It sucks<br/>\nwaiting around for your mana to trickle back.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helped a bit, must be back to work...<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nskeizer (the gnome)<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;shut up! just because i live in the bowels of the earth <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean i&#39;m not allowed to be a frost mage!&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n___________________________________________________________________<br/>\nYou don&#39;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>\nGet completely free e-mail from Juno at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html\">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>\nor call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
