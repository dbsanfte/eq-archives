It seems to me<br/>\n&gt; that we are short-changed compared to magicians and<br/>\n&gt; necromancers, whose<br/>\n&gt; spells seem a lot better, and can have &quot;pets&quot; fight for<br/>\n&gt; them. It&#39;s also<br/>\n&gt; hard to make signifant amounts of money to buy spells. I<br/>\n&gt; still like the<br/>\n&gt; game, just wondered if anyone else felt the same way.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think that the wizard becomes much more powerful at higher levels.<br/>\nUp until level 8 you&#39;re very weak.  After that it gets a little<br/>\nbetter, and at level 12 you really start to become impressive.  My<br/>\nadvice is to stick with it, continue to grow and explore.  At level 12<br/>\nyou get &quot;Bind Affinity&quot;, which makes travelling around a lot easier.<br/>\nYou will get high damage spells which cast faster and easier as you<br/>\nadvance.  As soon as you pass that mark, you&#39;ll be able to deal<br/>\n300-400 hitpoints of damage in a few seconds.  At level 20 you&#39;ll be<br/>\nable to teleport to certain locations, and if I am not mistaken,<br/>\nyou&#39;ll be able to gate your party members.<br/>\nStick with the wizard for now.  Before you know it, you will have a<br/>\nvery powerful character that many people will want to have in their<br/>\nparty.<br/>\n<br/>\nAznyin, level 10 Erudite Wizard</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
