But spells like Bind<br/>\nare used by sooo many people that your particular guild area might not<br/>\neven carry it - look for either a common seller (like the center<br/>\nmerchants in the Gnome city or others), or check other classes guild<br/>\nhalls.  When I wanted Gate, I ended up hitting the Clerics in Felwithe.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMicon<br/>\nLev 14 (or 13, depending on if Crush catches me yet again tonight)<br/>\nKarana</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
