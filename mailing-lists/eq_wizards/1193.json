I am a 17lvl erudite wiz playin on Rallos Zek.  I get challenges<br/>\nto duel fairly frequently.  I have accepted one against a Dark Elf wiz and<br/>\nwhipped him as he had cast root first and I cast shock of lightning first.<br/>\nI was able to get him lower quicker and when he tried to run I then cast<br/>\nroot.  I was wondering what kind of strategies we should use in dueling<br/>\nother classes.  I know that we can do the most damage quickly but some<br/>\nclasses have heal and other spells which can ruin my day such as blind or<br/>\nfear.  When it comes to the pure melee type classes such as warriors or<br/>\nmonks, it seems fairly easy to beat them as long as you can root them.  The<br/>\ntwo classes that worry me the most are necros and druids.  The necro can<br/>\ncast DOT spells then fear me so I can&#39;t attack and just wait as I slowly die<br/>\nand the druid seems to be able to melee me, cast good Direct Damage and heal<br/>\nmore efficiently than I can hit for.  Plus if the druid is able to keep the<br/>\nbattle goin for a while thier DOT spells are extremely mana efficient.  Let<br/>\nme know what you guys think, I don&#39;t like backing down to an even fight when<br/>\nsomeone is being an a$$, but with my inexperience in dueling other classes I<br/>\nreally would hate to lose.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nJames</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
