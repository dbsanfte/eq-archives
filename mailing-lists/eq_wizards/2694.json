Verant took the system, which was<br/>\nbad to begin with, and made it equally bad or worse, IMO.  And there&#39;s also<br/>\nthe issue that people don&#39;t like the rules of the universe getting changed<br/>\non them all of the time, regardless of the potential for improvement.  I<br/>\ntotally appreciate their frustration.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; just any faction hits at all, but more or less unhappy with the particular<br/>\n&gt; PC faction system that verant decided to slip in.  all-in-all, it seems to<br/>\n&gt; have been a failure (as noted by urself when u said that verant would be<br/>\n&gt; removing their PC related faction system until they could find an<br/>\n </span></blockquote>alternate<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; way to implement some type of faction system that the customers are happy<br/>\n&gt; with).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; u make some good points, but alas, the PC faction system is now defunct<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(if<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it is true what u say about verant removing the faction hits).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; sinlaru ce`alen<br/>\n&gt; rallos zek<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ps. i can have my way without affecting u, because i play on the PvP<br/>\n </span></blockquote>server,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and u don&#39;t...  isn&#39;t that why they implemented the PvP server??? :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think it works out this simply.  My choice to not play on Rallos Zek<br/>\nstems entirely from Verant&#39;s original implementation of PvP (i.e. no faction<br/>\nhit) which you approve of.  So, yes, it already affected me.  I wanted to<br/>\nplay there, but chose not to deal with all of the non-role-playing types who<br/>\nsaw EQ as just massively multiplayer deathmatch Quake.  If Verant ever<br/>\nmodifies the rules on Rallos Zek to even remotely approximate a realistic<br/>\nfaction system, I&#39;ll be there in a heartbeat.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlyphin E&#39;Mondredon<br/>\nThe Rathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
