Well, I can no longer purchase or sell items in Felwithe. I&#39;ve tried everything that I know of to improve my faction standing with the Merchants there, but to no avail. My faction standing with the guards is &quot;amiable&quot; -- It is with the &quot;Merchants&quot; that I need a faction adjustment. Does anyone have any ideas? Suggestions? Personal experience? Would appreciate any and all advice.<br/>\n     <br/>\n    Wizzy Lightseeker<br/>\n    L25 Gnome Wizard<br/>\n    Solusek Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
