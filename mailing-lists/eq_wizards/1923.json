Maybe not *7, *6 would be fine. Remember<br/>\n    that one point makes all the differece between clerics and melee<br/>\nclasses.<br/>\n    And it makes game sense.  Wizards burn faster than any other class and<br/>\nare<br/>\n    more mana dependent, so it only makes sense that they would learn to Med<br/>\n    faster than any other class, because it would be that much more<br/>\nimportant to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - Specialization skill with some real advantages to our class<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    This is where they could implement the faster med times. Give the wizard<br/>\nonly<br/>\n    option to specialize in Medditation. Its a long time to wait, but it<br/>\ncould be a<br/>\n    place to implement it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - resolving a problem of high resistence of DD spells at lv 20 resisted by<br/>\n&gt; (greens and blues )and other ( if this is becouse of stun effect we wish<br/>\n&gt; one spell without this efect at same level)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    Absolute must.

Well having<br/>\nour spells<br/>\n    not be useless against mobs that melee characters in groups of our own<br/>\nlevel can fight<br/>\n    would be an excellent start.  And if its all about wizards being more<br/>\npowerful at later<br/>\n    levels all I can say is that we better be THE most powerful by a fair<br/>\nmargin at those<br/>\n    levels to make it worth all the time we were not that powerful.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - beter use of time when meditating (acces to main chat server in separate<br/>\n&gt; window)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    Credits for originality, but lets be realistic here.
