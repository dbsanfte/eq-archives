He wasnt able to get the name &lt;&lt; of this npc though.<br/>\nDoes anyone know the name of this npc so I can steer clear of him. <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nThe merchant is a clockwork merchant--it doesn&#39;t have a personal name.  It<br/>\nstands just inside the zone entrance of Ak&#39;Anon, usually very near, if not<br/>\nright on top of, a clockwork jeweler.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt is true that the murderous merchant does NOT like elves at all, but race<br/>\nis not how it decides who to kill.  It is a question of deity.  I have<br/>\nobserved the clockwork killing people, and it yells something about &quot;pagan<br/>\nreligion&quot; when it strikes.  It will attack any character (elf or not) who<br/>\nhas chosen TUNARE as deity.  This includes ALL High elf clerics and<br/>\npaladins, since Tunare is their only deity choice.  The same is true of Wood<br/>\nelf Druids or Rangers, since they, too, have only Tunare to choose from as<br/>\ndeity.  Other races and classes either cannot choose Tunare at all (like the<br/>\nGnomes) or have other choices available to them.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSo, the upshot is, if you chose Tunare as deity, you will be attacked the<br/>\ninstant you enter Ak&#39;Anon.  You can try running away into the city, but I<br/>\nhave never witnessed anyone successful at that.  Also, I have once observed<br/>\nthis merchant running into a wall farther into the city, but that was only<br/>\none time.  Every other time I have been into Ak&#39;Anon, it has been right<br/>\nthere at the entrance.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
