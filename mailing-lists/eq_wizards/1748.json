What other<br/>\npeople do DOES have an affect on the rest of us.  That is what an<br/>\ninteractive game is all about.  We haven&#39;t heard from GMs on this topic, but<br/>\nI suspect that if they are going to suspend people for giving high level<br/>\nitems to their low level characters, then we can all be pretty well assured<br/>\nthat someone has a problem with this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Sergey Bukhman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sergeyb@...\">sergeyb@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eq_wizards@onelist.com\">eq_wizards@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, May 24, 1999 12:01 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [eq_wizards] Horrifying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; What exactly is so bad about it? How ever easy or hard it is on her, has<br/>\n&gt; no effect on you, so why don&#39;t you just mind your own business and stop<br/>\n&gt; being so uptight.

You&#39;re just upset<br/>\n&gt; that she gets an advantage you didn&#39;t, right? Well, life is tough like<br/>\n&gt; that. Whether she gets an advantage or not, is none of your business<br/>\n&gt; because it doesn&#39;t really affect you. And remember, she had to work her<br/>\n&gt; way to level 22 before that as well, so she is only giving her other<br/>\n&gt; Char something she rightfully earned.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just concentrate on your own character and stop being a jerk about it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Qenelin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking for a new hobby?
