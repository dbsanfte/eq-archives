I am at level 16 and<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I notice that the higher I get, the less and less well I fare in melee.  I<br/>\n&gt;&gt;have a runed totem staff as well and I can hit ok against blue creatures,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;but against a red where my spells are being resisted I can barely even<br/>\n&gt;&gt;scratch the mob in melee...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This is what I was talking about in an earlier post, but was assured by<br/>\n&gt;many others that it gets better at higher levels, like in the 20&#39;s to 30&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;(I&#39;m 11 now). I thought at the time that this was a ridiculously long time<br/>\n&gt;to wait for the game to get better for wizards. Why SHOULD it have to take<br/>\n&gt;so long? Now I see from someone with a lot more experience than I that it<br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t get better. I think we need to seriously petition Verant about the<br/>\n&gt;shortcomings of the wizard class. We need more buff spells to help<br/>\n&gt;ourselves and our parties, and spells of protection, like you mentioned. It<br/>\n&gt;seems to me that this is the sort of things wizards should be able to do<br/>\n&gt;anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Resistanco to our spells i aprove it must be lowered but whan you start to<br/>\nspeak about buffs and debuffs we are solo players in idea and for us is<br/>\nimportant to protect ourselves and to deal as much damage as we can. buffs<br/>\ndebuffs go to other classes i dont need them i wish to our class beter<br/>\ntravel spells and also faster mana recovery then to others as we need it<br/>\nmuch more take a look at my next letter about wizards (long very long)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Greg (Kronan) <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;ONElist:  the best source for group communications.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Join a new list today!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Silverion<br/>\nHigh elf wizard (against all statistics eheheeh)<br/>\nFenin Ro<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tip.it/wizard\">http://www.tip.it/wizard</a><br/>\n<br/>\nmoderator mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_EQ_magic@onelist.com\">_EQ_magic@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
