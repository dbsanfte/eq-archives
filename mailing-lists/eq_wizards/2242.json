I&#39;ve been <br/>\nreading this kind of thread since the first digest here.  Yes, the Wizards <br/>\ncan use a little bit of tweaking here and there, but as a whole I cannot <br/>\nthink of another class I would rather be.  Yes it&#39;s slow, and yes, it can be <br/>\nfrustrating at times....but where&#39;s your sense of challenge?<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t offer help to you if you go solo.  I&#39;ve found it most slow and <br/>\nfrustrating when I tried solo back when I was younger.  Not to mention <br/>\nstaring at your book during meditations can get old if you have nobody to <br/>\ntalk to. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can find good allies, you can hit all of the good xp spots around <br/>\nNorrath.  Unrest, Northern Ro, Oasis, Highhold Pass, Crushbone, BlackBurrow, <br/>\nBefallen, etc.   All of these spots are great xp...granted NOT good solo <br/>\nareas.  If one area is not working for you...try another.  No sense beating <br/>\na dead dog.  It&#39;s funny how it works...but once you get a group that trusts <br/>\nyou, you can get all the xp and money your heart desires.  I got 50pp+ and 1 <br/>\nbub of xp just playing a little over an hour of play at Highhold last night. <br/>\n  The 50pp came from my group members sharing me their wealth no strings <br/>\nattached.  This is not a bunch of folks I knew either...just folks who <br/>\nappreciated the help.  So please don&#39;t keep up this whining...if you want to <br/>\nchange things about the class, offer *positive* suggestions instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasic things I&#39;ve learned in the many groups I&#39;ve been with:<br/>\n-- don&#39;t use area effects...use assist and DD<br/>\n-- know your limits...run if you have to and let your tanks know you are <br/>\nrunning.  You are no help to the group if you die...then they have to wait <br/>\nfor you to recover your corpse too.<br/>\n-- be honorable...it does no good to our class to start kill stealing.  A <br/>\npox on all you Wizards who hide behind the efforts of others for personal <br/>\ngain.<br/>\n-- if your new spells are not reliable...use the old ones.  They will be <br/>\nmore efficient for you anyway until you&#39;ve comfortably leveled enough to use <br/>\nthe new ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t make these suggestions to sway all your opinions about the class if <br/>\nyou are negative about it anyway.  I offer these tips to younger Wizards <br/>\nlooking ahead to the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nSafe journey,<br/>\n-- Lim&#39;Dul<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
