I don&#39;t buy them from dealers,<br/>\nand I suggest not doings so because they put anything from rat poison to<br/>\nembalming fluid on their products to enhance it (killing your brain in the<br/>\nmean time).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, about trying something new.  How is whoever you got your information<br/>\nabout drugs so righteous? It seems you have a strong fear against them, I<br/>\nwould also if they are dealer sold, rat poison LSD is not very good for<br/>\nyou.Although opium and morning glory LSD have no known long term effects<br/>\n(unliketobacco and alcohol).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I noticed that my original spelling of disappointments was wrong.<br/>\nAnyways what am I rambling at (another fun feature of substances) I need to<br/>\nget to school.I give up on whatever we wear arguing about, lets never<br/>\nmention it again.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nATTENTION ONElist MEMBERS:  Get your ONElist news!<br/>\nJoin our MEMBER NEWSLETTER here:<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/newsletter2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/newsletter2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
