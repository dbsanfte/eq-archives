As a dwarf, my <br/>\ntemper is Earthen, and I have a really hard time finding the <br/>\nnecessary components to make it. I can get the drops of Mercury from <br/>\nEarth Elementals in Steamfont, but for the life of me, finding Lava <br/>\nRock has been a nightmare (I have 1 piece at the moment).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I don&#39;t want to waste my precious Tempers too early in the <br/>\nprocess. About what skill level is reasonable to start the Imbued <br/>\narmors?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMany thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n- Khazade<br/>\nPaladin of the Duke of Below<br/>\nGM, The Peacekeepers of Norrath<br/>\nTallon Zek<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:khazade@...\">khazade@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cheatsearch.com/eq\">http://www.cheatsearch.com/eq</a><br/>\n&lt;img src=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cheatsearch.com/images/khazade.gif&quot;\">http://www.cheatsearch.com/images/khazade.gif&quot;</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
