This is also not the first company like this I<br/>\nhave worked for.  It is in the Aerospace field.  I often bid jobs and<br/>\nwork up what the overall price will be to do a certain job.  Believe me<br/>\nwhen I say failures and scrap are included in the price.  Now I do<br/>\nestimate a certain percentage of scrap in the final price.  That means<br/>\nthat any failures or waste over that I have to eat.  GM, Boeing,<br/>\nGateway, and every other company operates the same way.  t is how you<br/>\nmake profit.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSolomon</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
