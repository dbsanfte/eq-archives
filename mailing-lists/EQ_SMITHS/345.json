The best smithing idea I&#39;ve seen actually<br/>\ncame from a MMORPG that really sucked (The Realm). Up until I left the game,<br/>\nsmiths could still make armor and sell it any time they chose. Of course, that&#39;s<br/>\nprobably due to item deterioration, but let&#39;s not get into that, I&#39;m not going<br/>\nto start another flame war. Anyway, their smithing had several different blocks<br/>\nof metal you could buy (didn&#39;t even have to convert it from ore =P) and make the<br/>\ndifferent armors out of. The thing I liked was you did NOT have to use a mold!<br/>\nEach item took however many blocks of metal and when you used the smithing<br/>\nskill, a list would pop up and as you what you&#39;d like to make. Could make<br/>\neverything - all nonmagical armors (even wood), shields, weapons.... it was<br/>\ngreat!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also makes sense considering smiths of old did NOT use molds... they heated<br/>\nmetal and hammered away at it at a forge. Banded mail is made from taking many<br/>\nmany small strips of metal and riveting those strips together to make a thick<br/>\nstrip of metal. This metal is then attached to a piece of soft chain armor.<br/>\nMolds are no part of the process. This is just background info, though, it<br/>\nreally means nothing =P<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is, it would be nice to have different kinds of ore to make different<br/>\narmors. Adamantium, Mithril, Steel (what we have now), Iron, etc. It&#39;d also be<br/>\nneat if ogres and trolls got a race-specific skill called sculpting. Take a<br/>\nblock of (clay, rock, granite, etc.) and make something out of it. This could<br/>\nmake stone armors that only trolls and ogres can use. Would be heavy as hell,<br/>\nbut those races can take it :) Again, though, just idle thought like the name<br/>\ntag thing. I don&#39;t expect anything to be done about this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say it again: don&#39;t flame me, I won&#39;t answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Rennin of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n Trade Council GM<br/>\n<br/>\nkale usi wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;kale usi&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Nick Emmerich &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seorin@...\">seorin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I think the best solution for enchanted armor is to allow metal &gt;sheets to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;be made of precious metals. Then enchanters would already &gt;have the spells<br/>\n&gt; &gt;implemented. We&#39;d be able to make enchanted silver &gt;banded, enchanted<br/>\n&gt; &gt;electrum banded, enchanted gold banded, and &gt;enchanted platinum banded :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;That&#39;d be neat, and it&#39;s the easiest to &gt;implement...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;-Rennin of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Trade Council GM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I thought about that as well. Guess it&#39;s a matter of implementing it though.<br/>\n&gt; I also like the idea of a tag to show who made the item. Not sure if it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; feasible or not.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d also like to see being able to use other ores/metals as well, (like<br/>\n&gt; steel, admanatium, bronze etc.) and to be able to smith weapons (using these<br/>\n&gt; ores as well). Perhaps quests could lead to the discovery of these<br/>\n&gt; metals/ore locations?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The planet&#39;s eCenter for health & well-being.
