We all bought and paid for <br/>\na game that we love playing.  We all pay money each month to play this game <br/>\nonline.  As a programmer myself I feel as if the bugs should have been <br/>\nworked out by now.  I have gone through this same routine with the guys at <br/>\nVerant and can say it is the worst customer service that I have ever <br/>\nreceived.  I sat online for 4 hours waiting for a GM to help me out and <br/>\nstill no one came.  Sure there are a few hundred people saying they lost <br/>\nthings when they really didn&#39;t lose anything at all..<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still waiting for an email regarding a video problem that I&#39;m having. I <br/>\nswitched video cards and can&#39;t get the game to work properly.  I&#39;ve been <br/>\nwaiting for that email for 2 1/2 weeks now....<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen game companies release a game they should make sure that the bugs are <br/>\npretty much gone after beta testing.  Sure there are going to be problems, <br/>\nbut then these companies should have the support needed to  help customers <br/>\nout..<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO<br/>\n<br/>\nThx<br/>\nJeremy (Shanuk)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tCurtis Beck [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jungle@...\">jungle@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tThursday, July 08, 1999 8:09 AM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com\">EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\tRe: [EQ_SMITHS] Raw deal - need help!<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Curtis Beck &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jungle@...\">jungle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nKale,<br/>\n\tI know how you feel, but I don&#39;t have a solution for you.
