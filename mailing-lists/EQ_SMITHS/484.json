When I was able to make my<br/>\n&gt; first few pieces, not enough other players had any money to spend on<br/>\n&gt; fancy armor, so sales were slow, but starting yesterday (server 1 week<br/>\n&gt; old), WOW!  I was kept very busy, and feel I have finally achieved<br/>\n&gt; enough skill and customers to make a profit with my smithing.  I found<br/>\n&gt; I got much more response when I changed my auctions from &quot;WTS small<br/>\n&gt; banded gorget, bracer .....  1pp per PC&quot;  to &quot;Heros of Norrath, make<br/>\n&gt; sure you fight in style.  Buy Shaepley Armor.  Small banded gorget,<br/>\n&gt; bracer...... now in stock.  1pp per PC&quot;  and other such variations.<br/>\n&gt; Putting my name in the ads really helped folks remember me, and I<br/>\n&gt; started getting tells at other times, asking for armor.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My skill is now at 124.  I started with sharpening weapons, then did<br/>\n&gt; scalers, lanterns, skewers, pots, and now sewing kits.  I tried my<br/>\n&gt; first simple banded pieces when I reached a skill of 70.  I do pretty<br/>\n&gt; well with most pieces now, except those stubborn leggings and mail<br/>\n&gt; pieces.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My question to you all is, now what?  I thought about making forged<br/>\n&gt; weapons (already trivial), but was disappointed to find the cost of<br/>\n&gt; making the weapons (without failure) was more than what I could sell<br/>\n&gt; them for.  I want to be able to make the new fine plate armor, but<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know what I should do to prepare for that.  What skill level<br/>\n&gt; should I achieve before then?  How do I get that level? (more banded?)<br/>\n&gt; Are there items I should be collecting now that I will need later?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All thoughts greatly appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shaepe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The EQ BlackSmithy Discussion Group<br/>\n&gt; List Administrator:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chade@...\">chade@...</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
