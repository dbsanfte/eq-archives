You must have seen the posts on the Everquest official website. Some guys offered to tell you the building order to become a Master blacksmith in no time IF you gave them a certain amount of pp. I am sure that they were not trying to trick anybody BUT knowledge should be free, everyone should have acces to it IMO.<br/>\nSo is someone on this list a master Smith and knows the magic build order to go from skill 0 to 135 in notime ??<br/>\nI would love (and i am sure i am not alone) to see a complete guide on smithing.<br/>\nAfter all that is the purpose of this list isn&#39;it ?<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope to be enlighten by your knowledge very soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nNekratal, Level 13 Paladin on the Karana Server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
