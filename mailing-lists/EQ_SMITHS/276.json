People don&#39;t understand what<br/>\nand how smithing should be.  First off is the time it took you to get to 110 or what<br/>\never you got to before you started on banded.  Secondly, there is your time.  Your<br/>\ntime is worth money.  If you stand around making and selling armor for 5 hours.  Thats<br/>\n5 hours of your time.  I raise the price of my items a bit to add that in.  Thirdly<br/>\nthere is failure rate.  Ever smith will agree some items fail more then others.  I&#39;m<br/>\nat 165 smithing skill and I still fail on stinkin masks and such more then I should.<br/>\nLastly of course is the cost of the materials.  We all know that buying materials with<br/>\na high cha is the best bet, and all customers must assume all smiths have a 250 cha.<br/>\nWell, I did create my &quot;smithing character&quot; with min/max smithing in mind.  110 Cha,<br/>\nand 120 Int base.  Since then I have raised my Int to 147 and Cha to 133 through<br/>\nmagical items.  But this dosen&#39;t have to be passed down through to the customer.  This<br/>\nis like stream lining your factory.  You do it for my profit, not to give the profit<br/>\nto the customer.  I have a really basic formula for prices.. (This has NO scientific<br/>\nbasis)  5pp per metal sheet an item takes.  So, Boots, Bracers, Gorgets 5pp Masks,<br/>\nHelms, Sleeves, Mantles, Belts 10pp I fudge on the cloak cause of the failure rate, I<br/>\ncharge 15pp for the cloak and again, I fudge for the Tunic and Leggings, for failure<br/>\nrate and for popularity on the Tunic and Leggings. I charge 20pp for those 2.  Now, on<br/>\nalmost all items I have left myself a SMALL margin (in my mind) to lower the prices<br/>\ndepending on the customer.  I usually won&#39;t go to low on leggings, cloak or the 5pp<br/>\nitems.  Well, if your ever on the Erollis Marr server in the freeport area.. you&#39;ll<br/>\nmore then likely hear this auction...<br/>\n<br/>\nMedium Banded Mail Armor 4Sale! Gorgets, Bracers, Boots 5pp Masks, Belts, Helms,<br/>\nSleeves, Mantles 10pp Cloaks 15pp Tunics, Leggings 20pp (Full Suits 100pp)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, happy smithing to all..<br/>\n<br/>\n Draxle &quot;Master Smith Of Freeport&quot; Ironworks<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Libertn2@...\">Libertn2@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Libertn2@...\">Libertn2@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the Karana Server, prices have hit the floor.  The following is what I<br/>\n&gt; sell at (and I have stock in my bank that has been there for weeks):<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; bracers, gorgets, helms, boots, arms, masks, belts - 5p<br/>\n&gt; mantles and cloaks 10p<br/>\n&gt; tunic and legs - 13p<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now this is rediculous but I have masks, arms and mantles in the bank that I<br/>\n&gt; cant get rid of at these prices.  Go figure.
