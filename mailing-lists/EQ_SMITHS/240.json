(That means YOU don&#39;t get to play)<br/>\nThe might still be working on this game getting the bugs out.  You<br/>\nwould still be playing Quake2.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.

The release this game in March, you get to enjoy the game, albiet with<br/>\na few bugs.  Play around the bugs, live with the bugs because the rest<br/>\nof the gaming experience is so fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you honestly feel that you shouldn&#39;t play this game until the bugs are<br/>\nworked out.
