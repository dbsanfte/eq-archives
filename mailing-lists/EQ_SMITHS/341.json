Now the actual problem is how fast can the database<br/>\n&gt;retrieve the information for the item with unique identifiers on each<br/>\n&gt;one. Currently a given item held by any person in the game (e.g. banded<br/>\n&gt;gorget) goes to a generic stats file to retrieve its data. The hit from<br/>\n&gt;adding names of crafters is the extra time when it has to retrieve the<br/>\n&gt;crafters&#39; name. Each item has a unique name in the game so adding the<br/>\n&gt;data field there might not be too bad since it is keeping track of the<br/>\n&gt;item on the character with that unique name. If they were stored<br/>\n&gt;together it might make it faster. Oh well, just the musing of a<br/>\n&gt;programmer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Depending of course on how they implemented the item database.
