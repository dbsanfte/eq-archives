A day or so after I posted I found a good trivial list at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eq.castersrealm.com/tradeskills/smithing/trivials.asp\">http://eq.castersrealm.com/tradeskills/smithing/trivials.asp</a><br/>\nNow I know why those mantles and cloaks have been such bears!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt looks like it&#39;s time for Shaepley Armor to start holding periodic<br/>\nsales on mantles, gauntlets, and leggings, to keep the inventory<br/>\nmoving.  My skill is now up to 136, and I must be one of the wealthier<br/>\nlevel 9 players on Tholuxe Paells.  ;)  I was visiting Freeport for a<br/>\nbit yesterday and saw someone selling Fine Steel armor already.

I thought about making<br/>\nforged<br/>\n&gt; &gt; weapons (already trivial), but was disappointed to find the cost<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; &gt; making the weapons (without failure) was more than what I could<br/>\nsell<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them for.  I want to be able to make the new fine plate armor, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t know what I should do to prepare for that.  What skill level<br/>\n&gt; &gt; should I achieve before then?  How do I get that level? (more<br/>\nbanded?)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Are there items I should be collecting now that I will need later?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
