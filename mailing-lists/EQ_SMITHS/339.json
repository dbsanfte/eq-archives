It&#39;s a good idea, but I&#39;d rather see them get the bugs worked <br/>\nout first, and do something about smithing other things like plate, weapons <br/>\netc. I&#39;d also like to see them do something about using different ores (IE - <br/>\nmithril, adamantite etc.) and possibly enchanting magic weapons and armor <br/>\n(by no means do I think that these should be easy tasks to do in game!)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
