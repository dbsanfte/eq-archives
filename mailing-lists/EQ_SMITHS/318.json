On one hand, verant let<br/>\nthe pottery/brewing problem go on for FAR to long. One day would have been enough<br/>\nto fix it.. Then on the other hand, I got on this morning to crys of anguish..<br/>\nWas MUSIC to my smithing ears.. &quot;WTF my pottery/brewing dosen&#39;t make money<br/>\nanymore&quot;  &quot;Why can&#39;t I sell mindless amounts of x-product back the merchant for a<br/>\nhuge profit&quot;  I was rolling in my chair laughing at these people.. some stuck<br/>\nwith tons of brewing materials that will net them nothing.  Well, That is only a<br/>\nchildish reaction from me, for that I guess I should be sorry.. But Verant still<br/>\nneeds to FIX the trade skills.  I don&#39;t care if your a smith, brewer, fletcher..<br/>\nAll the trade skills are broken.  Only Jewelry is even close to being useful.<br/>\nBut it to will go the way of the banded armor, once the market is flooded with<br/>\nitems that can&#39;t break, and will pretty much never get lost.  I mean right now<br/>\nthe only way to lose a single item is to have your coprse disappear.. That dosent<br/>\nhave very often once people get past 6th level.. and how hard is that..  Insted<br/>\nof whining about smithing prices, or what not.. We should be on Verants ASS to<br/>\nfix the trade skills.  I mean come on, you can&#39;t tell me that smithing as a trade<br/>\nshould or was ever thought to be nothing more then making banded armor? (No I&#39;m<br/>\nNOT the kind of person to make a petition..... But one of you save the whale<br/>\ntypes should.. (Oh I can hear the flames for that one already))  Snicker..<br/>\n<br/>\nDraxle (not very PC) Ironworks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Libertn2@...\">Libertn2@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Libertn2@...\">Libertn2@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The problem with smithing and diminishing prices is the fact that once an<br/>\n&gt; item is created, it usually never leaves circulation.  Most, if not all<br/>\n&gt; banded is passed down and sold to others when it no longer has a use.  What<br/>\n&gt; this means is that eventually, there will be little to no market for banded<br/>\n&gt; AT ALL.  What smiths and other crafters need is some sort of item degrade.<br/>\n&gt; This is the only way to keep the trade skills working indefinitely and the<br/>\n&gt; only way to remove items from circulation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, another major problem with trade skills and the economy as a whole is<br/>\n&gt; the fact that Verant said they would not allow for you to sell back to a<br/>\n&gt; merchant at a profit, then went ahead and did it anyway.  I was one very few<br/>\n&gt; people that was a Master at Brewing and Pottery before &quot;The Patch.&quot;  Now<br/>\n&gt; everyone and their mother is a brewer and a potter simply for the exploit.<br/>\n&gt; Can you imagine what would have happened if this was true for smiths and<br/>\n&gt; jewelers??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Verant needs to stick to its word about no profit from selling to merchants.<br/>\n&gt; Already, no one sells good items any more for plat because plat is worthless.<br/>\n&gt;  The current economy just leads to more camping and kill stealing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hawkwin of Hawkwin&#39;s Roaming Emporium<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; The EQ BlackSmithy Discussion Group<br/>\n&gt; List Administrator:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chade@...\">chade@...</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
