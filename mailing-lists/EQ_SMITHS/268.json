I tell &#39;em ta flip off,<br/>\n&gt; but still.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All of us blacksmiths need to figure out a SET price for banded.  The norm<br/>\n&gt; that we ALL will follow.  This way, no matter where you go, all will KNOW<br/>\n&gt; the minimums to banded.  They can still bid over it if there is a &quot;bidding<br/>\n&gt; war&quot;, but we all need to have the same prices.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That will never happen, there will always be a person or two who will<br/>\nundersell the others, and then the customers will want it for his/her price.<br/>\nHowever, these people will forever be in the minority, since they will<br/>\nquickly realize that they can not supply enough of the items to make a<br/>\ndecent profit.  Even if they never fail, they simply will not make enough<br/>\nmoney for them to want to continue to invest so much time into it.  And even<br/>\nif do?  Well, kudos to them, as they have done what the player driven<br/>\neconomy is all about, undersold their competition.  Sounds a bit like real<br/>\nlife doesn&#39;t it?  But think about it this way, even if you do half the<br/>\nbusiness of those types, and you are charging double the price, you are<br/>\nstill making the same as them for half the work.  As for people who always<br/>\nwant to buy cheaper and cheaper, well guess what, it&#39;s not going to go that<br/>\nlow, at least not consistently.  Those that ask for such abysmally low<br/>\nprices have probably seen someone sell for that price, either one of the<br/>\nabove mentioned lowballers, or someone who simply no longer needed the<br/>\nitems, and wanted to get rid of them quickly.  If they continue to seek such<br/>\na low price, they will probably eventually get it, of course they may be in<br/>\ntheir high teens, low twenties and still in mostly patchwork....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRob<br/>\n~Chaos, panic, & disorder-my work here is done.~</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
