What I am wondering is what is a <br/>\ngood practice mold to get my skill above 100?  Will skewers allow me to go <br/>\nthat high?  If not I would like to find one that will.  Money is not that <br/>\nbig of a deal at the moment, I just think there has got to be a mold that <br/>\nuses bits not sheets that can get me above 100.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nGrak the Troll Blacksmith<br/>\nRodcet Nife<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
