I am trying\r<br/>\nto level up but it is going really slow.  Banded\r<br/>\nbracers and gorgets are not trivial yet so i keep\r<br/>\nmaking them.  The problem is that i spent like \r<br/>\ntwenty plat making bracers with no skill advancement.\r<br/>\nIs there other items i should be making instead\r<br/>\nof the bracers and gorgets?? Something cheaper to \r<br/>\nmake??  Also..does anybody know if we can make chain\r<br/>\nmail?? and if so..is it a better quality item??\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThanks\r<br/>\nAppylon\r<br/>\nveeshan server</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
