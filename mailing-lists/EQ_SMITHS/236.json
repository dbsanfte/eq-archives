You can make them earlier but your success rate<br/>\n&gt;will be low so wait, then when banded stuff is trivial try harder stuff,<br/>\n&gt;70pp should be good to start, I wish i had that much, I only got around 25,<br/>\n&gt;30pp.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Level 13 Barbarian Warrior,<br/>\n&gt;Bristlebane server<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>70 P is a good start, but not nearly enough to get you to skill lvl 80 <br/>\n(where it starts becoming profitable enough to pay for itself, or least so I <br/>\nhear; I&#39;m a skill lvl 43 blacksmith right now). Although making scalers can <br/>\nincrease your skill, I&#39;d highly recommend making lanterns until lvl 80. <br/>\nThey&#39;re cheaper, you&#39;ll have more successes with them, and you can sell them <br/>\nback to merchants for about half of what it cost you to buy the components.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
