I am level 4 paladin. I<br/>\n&gt; have 0 smithing. I was wondering if this is enough money to get good, I can<br/>\n&gt; wait four levels and put all into smithing, because I would like to make my<br/>\n&gt; own plate and chainmail armor. Or should I forget about smithing because I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; in Qeynos, and try tailoring or something?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Honestly?<br/>\n<br/>\nWait till you can at least put 5-10 points into smithing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen just hunker down because it will cost you most of your saved<br/>\nfortune to<br/>\nearn enough skill.  I do not know if your skill can exceed your level<br/>\ntimes 5 + 5 <br/>\nas that restriction is on normal skills (hence my 1h slash maxes at 90<br/>\nfor 17th)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust make bits upto 20 skill points,  and if you have lots by then (like<br/>\n100 bits)<br/>\nthen do the lantern thing.  Other wise try to make bits in 100 amounts<br/>\n(five full<br/>\nstacks) and then convert to making those into lanterns.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis will take lots and lots of time.  So don&#39;t do it on days you<br/>\nnormally adventure<br/>\non.   And be prepared for your mouse fingers to be really sore</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
