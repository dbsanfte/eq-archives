I&#39;m currently doing a quest from RiverVale where I need to <br/>\ncollect some items for a bug collection. I need a fire beetle, spiderling <br/>\neye, giant fire beetle leg, giant wasp wing, and a giant scarab egg sac. I <br/>\ncan get all of the items I need in the Misty Thickey, RiverVale hunting <br/>\nhunting grounds, except for the giant fire beetle leg. The only places I <br/>\nknow how to get them is from the Queen Klacknak and giant fire beetles in <br/>\nWest Karana. This means if I wanted to do this quest I would need to run all <br/>\nthe way there. I have never gone through Highpass Hold (only way I know how <br/>\nto get there). I was wondering if there was anywhere closer to Freeport, <br/>\nthat dosen&#39;t require a high level character. I&#39;m only level 10 right now, <br/>\nand don&#39;t want to risk it. then die somewhere were I cannot retreive my <br/>\ncorpse. Is there anywhere I can go? Past the Desert of Ro or something? If <br/>\nanyone has any of the legs near Freeport I&#39;m am VERY willing to buy a few of <br/>\nthem. Well I hope you guys can help =)<br/>\n<br/>\nHenning Seljenes (Irontoe, Xegony)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
