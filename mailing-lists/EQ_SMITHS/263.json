I then made Metal<br/>\nbits LOTS of Metal Bits I needed them for EVERYTHING until around 85-95 when<br/>\nI could actually make some money making banded. You DO NOT want to learn<br/>\nusing banded it costs too much to fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter Metal bits where trivial I started making scalers with all those bits<br/>\nI had. After bits go triv though I failed a fair bit at them still. So I<br/>\nonly made 20 at a time then made scalers to improve my skill before making<br/>\n20 more.  After Scalers went trivial I started making Skewers. I failed ALOT<br/>\nat skewers at first, there might be an item that is a little cheaper to fail<br/>\nat but I am not sure? Anyway Skewers took me all the way to 115 after about<br/>\n90 though I started making the easier banded items. Bracers and Gorgets.<br/>\nAfter abou 100 I went to making banded on an as needed basis. I stayed with<br/>\nskewers though for skill gain.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if someone will buy things at a price I can make some money at including<br/>\nthe fact that I am a busy person and my time is worth something as well as<br/>\nmy 220pp I initially invested I make almost anything if people try to haggle<br/>\nI simply tell them I am not a charity and am not here to give them a deal I<br/>\nam here to make some pp. I am selfish and I don&#39;t care. I am after all a<br/>\ndwarf...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you where to make a character just for making banded it would likely not<br/>\ncost you as much but I thought what sense does it make to have some frail<br/>\nwizard making armor?? They might damage themselves doing that if I am going<br/>\nto make armor I am going to do it as Dwarf!!! I seem ro remember though that<br/>\nelven chain was usually pretty good wasn&#39;t it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThump Ghoulsbane<br/>\nCleric on Karana<br/>\nMaster Smith<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Tim Polsfoot &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:polsfoot@...\">polsfoot@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com\">EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com\">EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Thursday, July 08, 1999 7:47 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_SMITHS] Sharpening Rusty knives<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Tim Polsfoot &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:polsfoot@...\">polsfoot@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have decided to learn a trade.
