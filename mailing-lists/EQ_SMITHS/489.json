Women who wear their purse straps across <br/>\ntheir chests rather than over their shoulders are at risk for broken <br/>\nnecks and, possibly, decapitation!!  Purse snatchers&#39; usual method of <br/>\noperation involves approaching an unsuspecting woman, quickly pulling <br/>\nher purse from her shoulder, and fleeing the scene. Purse snatchers do <br/>\nnot check to see if the purse is around the woman&#39;s neck first!! Purse <br/>\nstraps will not break, your neck most likely will!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n\tFourteen  women have already died!! Beware!!! The first <br/>\nreported case of a purse strap-related death occurred in Los Angeles <br/>\nin 1987. A young woman was leaving a local mall when a man mistakenly <br/>\nbroke her neck in an attempt to steal her purse, which was  holding a <br/>\nmeasly $20!!!!! X-rays revealed the woman&#39;s neck was nearly severed in <br/>\ntwo! Another woman in 1988 suffered not only a twice fractured neck <br/>\nbone, but a completely shattered jaw! One woman survived this grisly <br/>\nordeal only to be left quadriplegic for life!!<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe scariest news is that with purse snatching on the rise, 6 <br/>\ndeaths were reported just over the past  year!!! Remember this: more <br/>\npurse snatchings are reported during Christmas time than any other <br/>\nseason. Please tell your mothers, daughters, sisters, and friends: DO <br/>\nNOT WEAR YOUR PURSE STRAP ACROSS YOUR CHEST!!!!</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
