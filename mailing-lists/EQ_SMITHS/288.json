Any of you remember the &quot;oil crisis&quot; of the 70&#39;s?  You <br/>\nknow, when we had to wait in line at the gas stations because of the huge <br/>\n&quot;oil sortage&quot; and all along the oil tankers were sitting in the Delware <br/>\nRiver loaded with oil waiting for prices to go up before they&#39;d bring in the <br/>\noil? Well, I say we smiths do the same. All smiths stop making/selling <br/>\nbanded until there&#39;s such a high demand that the people who want to buy it <br/>\nkeep raising the price they are willing to pay. I think we can get the price <br/>\nto go up 3-5pp if everyone cooperates. Think about that, 7pp for a banded <br/>\ngorget. It can happen. We can make it happen. We can hold Norrath by its <br/>\nballs.  WE SMITHS CAN RULE NORRATH!<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I&#39;ll have to work on my smithing considering it&#39;s only at about <br/>\n13 right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nKulin &lt;lvl 10 warrior on the Rallos Zek server&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
