Of course, you<br/>\nspecifically wouldn&#39;t want to. Too many flames aimed towards your kind and people<br/>\nwho refuse to see the logic of a successful business.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo clarify, this is not a personal attack at you.

You want to know what else?  They don&#39;t care one<br/>\n&gt; bit for your failures either.  They are buying the successes.  No one wantes<br/>\n&gt; to pay for the ones you screw up on, they are not buying the skewers you used<br/>\n&gt; to practice with either.  If anything, get anrgy with EQ on the sucess ratio.<br/>\n&gt;  Once something is trivial, I think it should be VERY rare that you fail.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Talthoron<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; The EQ BlackSmithy Discussion Group<br/>\n&gt; List Administrator:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chade@...\">chade@...</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
