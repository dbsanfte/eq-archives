There are also race specific forges and some new<br/>\nkinds of metal and hammers that are also race specific. They haven&#39;t<br/>\nreleased any recipes for the various items yet (at least we haven&#39;t found<br/>\nthem)  so nobody knows how to make any of it yet. (would be VERY expensive<br/>\nto test, some of those molds cost 20-30pp, same with the metals)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_SMITHS@egroups.com\">EQ_SMITHS@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_SMITHS@egroups.com\">EQ_SMITHS@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, August 25, 2000 3:02 AM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_SMITHS] Digest Number 98<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; There is 1 message in this issue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Topics in this digest:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;       1.

I decided to go<br/>\ncheck out the plate rumors on the Test server and scoped out the various<br/>\nsmithing books - no changes. However, one of the vendors in E Freeport, Kif<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; believe, no longer had chain armor, but instead a bunch of shield molds -<br/>\nover a dozen (to account for the various sizes, I believe). I checked after<br/>\nthe patch yesterday on The Nameless, but there was no change there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Ellsa Quintess<br/>\n&gt; Priestess of Bristlebane<br/>\n&gt; Night Custodian, Chapel of Mischief<br/>\n&gt; Rivervale Olympic Diving Champion<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
