I am trying\r<br/>\n&gt; to level up but it is going really slow.  Banded\r<br/>\n&gt; bracers and gorgets are not trivial yet so i keep\r<br/>\n&gt; making them.  The problem is that i spent like \r<br/>\n&gt; twenty plat making bracers with no skill advancement.\r<br/>\n&gt; Is there other items i should be making instead\r<br/>\n&gt; of the bracers and gorgets?? Something cheaper to \r<br/>\n&gt; make??  Also..does anybody know if we can make chain\r<br/>\n&gt; mail?? and if so..is it a better quality item??\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n&gt; Thanks\r<br/>\n&gt; Appylon\r<br/>\n&gt; veeshan server\r<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; The EQ BlackSmithy Discussion Group<br/>\n&gt; List Administrator:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chade@...\">chade@...</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
