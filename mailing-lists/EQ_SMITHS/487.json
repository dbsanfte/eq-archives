Much to my <br/>\nsurprise, all of the recipes on reputable sites (EQ Casters, <br/>\nAllaKhazam&#39;s Magical Realm, etc.) were the same, but none of them <br/>\nworked!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Dwarven Plate Armor recipes worked, yet most of the sites just <br/>\nadded an Imbued Ruby to the list to upgrade Dwarven Plate to Dwarven <br/>\nPlate Armor of Brell Serilis. When I made my attempt, the Stormguard <br/>\nForge just spit the components back at me saying that they would not <br/>\ncombine in those quantities. Fortunately, none of the VERY expensive <br/>\ncomponents were lost in the failure (I just closed and reopened the <br/>\nforge to find my items waiting for me).<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the most advanced racial/diety armor bugged, or do we just not <br/>\nknow what the correct recipe is yet?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the help.<br/>\n <br/>\n- Khazade<br/>\nPaladin of the Duke of Below<br/>\nGM, The Peacekeepers of Norrath<br/>\nTallon Zek<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:khazade@...\">khazade@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cheatsearch.com/eq\">http://www.cheatsearch.com/eq</a><br/>\n&lt;img src=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cheatsearch.com/images/khazade.gif&quot;\">http://www.cheatsearch.com/images/khazade.gif&quot;</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
