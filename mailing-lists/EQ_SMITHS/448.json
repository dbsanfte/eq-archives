So far, I<br/>\nhave uncovered 3 new items we can make.  The molds are available from a<br/>\nvendor near the entrance to Kaladim, in Butcher Block.  The new items are:<br/>\n<br/>\nForged Morning Star, 1HB, 8 damage, 38 Delay<br/>\n1 water flask + 1 metal sheet + Spiked Ball mold + Hilt Mold<br/>\n<br/>\nForged 2 Handed sword, 2HS, 12 damage, 44 delay<br/>\n1 water flask + 1 metal sheet + Pommel mold + Hilt mold + Heavy Steel Blade<br/>\nmold<br/>\n<br/>\nForged Bastard Sword, 1HS, 7damage, 33delay<br/>\n1 water flask + 1 metal sheet + Pommel mold + Hilt mold + Dual-edge Blade<br/>\nMold<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cost of the molds from me (I have high charisma and the dwarves con<br/>\namiable to me):<br/>\n<br/>\nDual-edge Blade Mold \t1p9g1s8c<br/>\nHeavy Steel Blade Mold \t3p8g3s6c<br/>\nSpiked Ball Mold \t\t2p5g5s7c<br/>\nHilt Mold \t\t\t 6g3s9c<br/>\nPommel Mold \t\t 6g3s9c<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are pretty good weapons except for one glaring problem, they can&#39;t hit<br/>\nmagic only creatures.  So far, the response to them on E Marr has been<br/>\ndeafening silence, hehe.  I have made one of each of these and auctioned<br/>\nthem in the Freeport area.  No one showed the slightest interest in them<br/>\nexcept other smiths wanting to know how they were made.  IMHO, great<br/>\ntwinking weapons but prolly not viable to produce unless there is a way to<br/>\nmake them magic (then tons of people will want them).  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be<br/>\nable to sell any of them for the 8 to 10pp they are worth.  What do you guys<br/>\nthink?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, anyone notice any other new items we can make, particularly new armor<br/>\n(or know when or if new armor for us will be implemented).  Any other<br/>\nlocations for the molds?  Any thoughts on what we should charge for these<br/>\nthings if I&#39;m wrong about the demand for them?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
