When I was able to make my<br/>\nfirst few pieces, not enough other players had any money to spend on<br/>\nfancy armor, so sales were slow, but starting yesterday (server 1 week<br/>\nold), WOW!  I was kept very busy, and feel I have finally achieved<br/>\nenough skill and customers to make a profit with my smithing.  I found<br/>\nI got much more response when I changed my auctions from &quot;WTS small<br/>\nbanded gorget, bracer .....  1pp per PC&quot;  to &quot;Heros of Norrath, make<br/>\nsure you fight in style.  Buy Shaepley Armor.  Small banded gorget,<br/>\nbracer...... now in stock.  1pp per PC&quot;  and other such variations. <br/>\nPutting my name in the ads really helped folks remember me, and I<br/>\nstarted getting tells at other times, asking for armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy skill is now at 124.  I started with sharpening weapons, then did<br/>\nscalers, lanterns, skewers, pots, and now sewing kits.  I tried my<br/>\nfirst simple banded pieces when I reached a skill of 70.  I do pretty<br/>\nwell with most pieces now, except those stubborn leggings and mail<br/>\npieces.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question to you all is, now what?  I thought about making forged<br/>\nweapons (already trivial), but was disappointed to find the cost of<br/>\nmaking the weapons (without failure) was more than what I could sell<br/>\nthem for.  I want to be able to make the new fine plate armor, but<br/>\ndon&#39;t know what I should do to prepare for that.  What skill level<br/>\nshould I achieve before then?  How do I get that level? (more banded?)<br/>\nAre there items I should be collecting now that I will need later?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll thoughts greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShaepe</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
