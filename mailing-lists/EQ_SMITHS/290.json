I&#39;ll make the<br/>\nsame amount over one night&#39;s spread without advertising. I just respond to people<br/>\nwho need banded. Whether I&#39;m hunting or practicing a different trade, I always<br/>\nhear calls for smiths. I answer them without having to spend hours advertising<br/>\nand altering prices to meet demand. I make plenty :)<br/>\n-Rennin of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n Trade Council GM<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Talthoron@...\">Talthoron@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Talthoron@...\">Talthoron@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m simply stating the facts of the real business world.  If a worker at GM<br/>\n&gt; screws up and breaks a windshield, does the customer pay for that broken<br/>\n&gt; windshield and the cost that it takes to fix it? no.  When they buy the car,<br/>\n&gt; they are paying for what it takes to make that car.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You think banded is low on some of your servers, you should see Cazic Thule.<br/>\n&gt; There is a guy in Freeport (obviously made and twinkled by a high level char<br/>\n&gt; just to be a smith) who sells banded dirt cheap.  I&quot;m talking from 2pp for a<br/>\n&gt; gorget to 9pp for a tunic or cloak.  Today at the Bazaar he had someone<br/>\n&gt; standing in teh area of the bazzar announceing banded for sell then refering<br/>\n&gt; them to the guy making it in freeport.  I went to the forge and watched for a<br/>\n&gt; bit, there was never less then 8-10 people lined up waiting on costum made<br/>\n&gt; banded.  He was there for hours makeing banded after banded item for dirt<br/>\n&gt; cheap.  He&#39;s making a killing on banded armor because he&#39;s found a way to<br/>\n&gt; sell a ton of it at dirt cheap prices.  and no, he&#39;s not taking a loss.  He<br/>\n&gt; has a VERY high smithing skill and only charges for what it costs to make the<br/>\n&gt; banded plus a little for the work.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Talthoron<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Personaly, my prices are more in your guys&#39;s range  Gorget 4pp clear to a<br/>\n&gt; tunic for 20pp.  yes, I can sell it for these prices but I don&#39;t make nearly<br/>\n&gt; the sales nor the money that the guy in freeport does.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; The EQ BlackSmithy Discussion Group<br/>\n&gt; List Administrator:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chade@...\">chade@...</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
