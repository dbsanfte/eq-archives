Good luck.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The pelts are EXTREMELY rare. As a tailor who has been searching for those<br/>\n&gt;pelts, I can say that I don&#39;t think I would sell a pack for less than 20p.<br/>\n&gt;And I know at least a dozen people who would jump at the chance to get one<br/>\n&gt;that cheap.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In fact, the going rate on my server is 5-10p to make the pack for you if<br/>\n&gt;you supply the pelt.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;When I go around trying to find pelts, I offer 1p for the raw pelt. So far<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve been able to buy 5. That&#39;s after 4 weeks of searching. Every time I<br/>\n&gt;enter or leaave a zone I auction for them, and soemtimes if I spend a long<br/>\n&gt;time in a zone I&#39;ll auction again. All that, and only 5 pelts have turned<br/>\n&gt;up. I&#39;ve also spent a large portion of time killing bears. Not one single HQ<br/>\n&gt;skin has fallen out of a bear I&#39;ve attacked.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I pass all my skins on to my friend who is a better tailor than I.
