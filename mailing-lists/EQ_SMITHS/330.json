They&#39;re just shiny <br/>\n&gt;pieces of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; plastic<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  that only cost 10 cents to produce. Since you don&#39;t pay for any <br/>\n&gt;overhead and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  simply sticking to cost, this is the most you should ever let yourself <br/>\n&gt;pay<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  CD of any kind.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I see your not paying attention.  when you buy a CD your not just buying <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;shiny piece of plastic.  you are paying for what is one it, you are <br/>\n&gt;paying<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for someone to put it on there as well.  You are not paying for someone <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; check each one to make sure it was done right as it was supposed to have <br/>\n&gt;been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; done right in the first place.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  2 - Never ever rent anything or visit a video arcade You aren&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;actually<br/>\n&gt; &gt; buying<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  anything, and therefore aren&#39;t aquiring these precious materials that <br/>\n&gt;are all<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  anybody ever charges for. If you don&#39;t get materials, they don&#39;t lose<br/>\n&gt; &gt; materials,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  so they should charge nothing because they are losing nothing. If you <br/>\n&gt;pay<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  than nothing, you are again violating your own principles.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t rent =)  and why go to an arcade?  I have a computer to play <br/>\n&gt;games on.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  3 - Don&#39;t buy gas for your car. Don&#39;t even buy a car! The gas for your <br/>\n&gt;car is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  sold in bulk, and therefore at discount. When you buy gas from a gas<br/>\n&gt; &gt; station, it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  has gone through several middlemen who add a little to the price each <br/>\n&gt;time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Since<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  you could buy petroleum from the middle east and process it yourself <br/>\n&gt;for no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  than cost, you shouldn&#39;t pay the price a gas station will charge <br/>\n&gt;because it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; has<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  been marked up several times. Same goes for cars. No car company that I <br/>\n&gt;know<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  mines the metal it needs and then shapes it into the parts needed for <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; car.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  This again means middlemen and markups, so if you want a car, you need <br/>\n&gt;to go<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mine<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  all the materials yourself, process even more petroleum into the <br/>\n&gt;plastics<br/>\n&gt; &gt; needed,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  build your own engine and any other moving parts, and put it all <br/>\n&gt;together<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  yourself. This way you make sure to not pay anything more than cost of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; materials.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; again, your just looking at the materials, you pay for materials and the <br/>\n&gt;work<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it takes to make it into what you want.  You are not paying for someone <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; check and recheck that work, etc.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  4 - Refuse paychecks from your place of employment. The only things <br/>\n&gt;ever<br/>\n&gt; &gt; paid for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  are material costs, time and work aren&#39;t included.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  5 - If you ever get into a legal battle, don&#39;t hire an attorney. The <br/>\n&gt;paper<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  used on your case does not cost what they charge you. Since they are <br/>\n&gt;charging<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  more than cost, you must refuse to pay them and therefore boycott their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; services.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  You can represent yourself for cost.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; again and again &lt;sighs&gt;  materials+the accual work that it takes, not <br/>\n&gt;all the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; etra work that doesnt&#39; NEED to be done.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Yes, I know this is all rather ridiculous, but that&#39;s what things would <br/>\n&gt;be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  if you really followed your ideas here. It&#39;s almost as bad as saying <br/>\n&gt;&#39;don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; use<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  plastic, they charge too much!&#39;. Well... where would you be without <br/>\n&gt;plastic?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Think along those lines... where would you be without business? If <br/>\n&gt;everybody<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  charged for cost and nothing more, employees wouldn&#39;t get paid and all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; businesses<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  would eventually collapse because any failures they made over the years<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would add<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  up. Since they only charge what it costs them, they don&#39;t make any <br/>\n&gt;money in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  business so everything comes from their pockets. Since other businesses <br/>\n&gt;can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  afford to pay employees, there is nowhere else to work to gain any <br/>\n&gt;money.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Timber!! There goes business as we know it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Seriously, reconsider what you&#39;re saying here. It makes absolutely no <br/>\n&gt;sense.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  all know EQ isn&#39;t a real economy (it&#39;s downright terrible). Actually, <br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; weaker<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  than a real economy. You see what charging for cost does to a real <br/>\n&gt;economy,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  you imagine what it would do to EQ&#39;s? It would be nearly irreversible. <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  begin to explain the damages your ideas will cause if they are <br/>\n&gt;practiced by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  -Rennin of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Trade Council GM &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; first learn what I am saying then try and make comments.  Your only <br/>\n&gt;taking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; half of what I said.  perhaps you should go back and reread it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ONElist:  your connection to like-minds and kindred spirits.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The EQ BlackSmithy Discussion Group<br/>\n&gt; &gt; List Administrator:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chade@...\">chade@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt;Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;The EQ BlackSmithy Discussion Group<br/>\n&gt;List Administrator:<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chade@...\">chade@...</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
