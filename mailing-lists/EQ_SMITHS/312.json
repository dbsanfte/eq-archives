They&#39;re just shiny pieces of <br/>\nplastic<br/>\n that only cost 10 cents to produce. Since you don&#39;t pay for any overhead and <br/>\nare<br/>\n simply sticking to cost, this is the most you should ever let yourself pay <br/>\nfor a<br/>\n CD of any kind.<br/>\n <br/>\nI see your not paying attention.  when you buy a CD your not just buying the <br/>\n&quot;shiny piece of plastic.  you are paying for what is one it, you are paying <br/>\nfor someone to put it on there as well.  You are not paying for someone to <br/>\ncheck each one to make sure it was done right as it was supposed to have been <br/>\ndone right in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\n 2 - Never ever rent anything or visit a video arcade You aren&#39;t actually <br/>\nbuying<br/>\n anything, and therefore aren&#39;t aquiring these precious materials that are all<br/>\n anybody ever charges for. If you don&#39;t get materials, they don&#39;t lose <br/>\nmaterials,<br/>\n so they should charge nothing because they are losing nothing. If you pay <br/>\nmore<br/>\n than nothing, you are again violating your own principles.<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t rent =)  and why go to an arcade?  I have a computer to play games on.<br/>\n<br/>\n 3 - Don&#39;t buy gas for your car. Don&#39;t even buy a car! The gas for your car is<br/>\n sold in bulk, and therefore at discount. When you buy gas from a gas <br/>\nstation, it<br/>\n has gone through several middlemen who add a little to the price each time. <br/>\nSince<br/>\n you could buy petroleum from the middle east and process it yourself for no <br/>\nmore<br/>\n than cost, you shouldn&#39;t pay the price a gas station will charge because it <br/>\nhas<br/>\n been marked up several times. Same goes for cars. No car company that I know <br/>\nof<br/>\n mines the metal it needs and then shapes it into the parts needed for the <br/>\ncar.<br/>\n This again means middlemen and markups, so if you want a car, you need to go <br/>\nmine<br/>\n all the materials yourself, process even more petroleum into the plastics <br/>\nneeded,<br/>\n build your own engine and any other moving parts, and put it all together<br/>\n yourself. This way you make sure to not pay anything more than cost of <br/>\nmaterials.<br/>\n <br/>\nagain, your just looking at the materials, you pay for materials and the work <br/>\nit takes to make it into what you want.  You are not paying for someone to <br/>\ncheck and recheck that work, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n 4 - Refuse paychecks from your place of employment. The only things ever <br/>\npaid for<br/>\n are material costs, time and work aren&#39;t included. <br/>\n<br/>\n 5 - If you ever get into a legal battle, don&#39;t hire an attorney. The paper <br/>\nthey<br/>\n used on your case does not cost what they charge you. Since they are charging<br/>\n more than cost, you must refuse to pay them and therefore boycott their <br/>\nservices.<br/>\n You can represent yourself for cost.<br/>\n  <br/>\nagain and again &lt;sighs&gt;  materials+the accual work that it takes, not all the <br/>\netra work that doesnt&#39; NEED to be done.<br/>\n<br/>\n Yes, I know this is all rather ridiculous, but that&#39;s what things would be <br/>\nlike<br/>\n if you really followed your ideas here. It&#39;s almost as bad as saying &#39;don&#39;t <br/>\nuse<br/>\n plastic, they charge too much!&#39;. Well... where would you be without plastic?<br/>\n Think along those lines... where would you be without business? If everybody<br/>\n charged for cost and nothing more, employees wouldn&#39;t get paid and all <br/>\nbusinesses<br/>\n would eventually collapse because any failures they made over the years <br/>\nwould add<br/>\n up. Since they only charge what it costs them, they don&#39;t make any money in <br/>\ntheir<br/>\n business so everything comes from their pockets. Since other businesses can&#39;t<br/>\n afford to pay employees, there is nowhere else to work to gain any money.<br/>\n Timber!! There goes business as we know it.<br/>\n <br/>\n Seriously, reconsider what you&#39;re saying here. It makes absolutely no sense. <br/>\nWe<br/>\n all know EQ isn&#39;t a real economy (it&#39;s downright terrible). Actually, it&#39;s <br/>\nweaker<br/>\n than a real economy. You see what charging for cost does to a real economy, <br/>\ncan<br/>\n you imagine what it would do to EQ&#39;s? It would be nearly irreversible. I <br/>\ncan&#39;t<br/>\n begin to explain the damages your ideas will cause if they are practiced by <br/>\nall.<br/>\n -Rennin of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n  Trade Council GM &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nfirst learn what I am saying then try and make comments.  Your only taking <br/>\nhalf of what I said.  perhaps you should go back and reread it.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
