I have lost<br/>\na character before on the Karan server when it was crashing all of the<br/>\ntime. <br/>\nLost a level 12 char with full banded.  Luckly for me I had some friends<br/>\nthat <br/>\nwere able to get me some patchwork armor and a mino axe and worked my<br/>\nway back<br/>\nto where I was.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\tTanaman<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nkale usi wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: kale usi &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I feel as though I&#39;m getting the raw end of the deal from Verant. I lost 10<br/>\n&gt; P and an Opalline earring (paid 25 P for it) off an alt character, due to<br/>\n&gt; yet another bug/glitch with the boat. I&#39;ve done everything I can possibly<br/>\n&gt; think of, (/tell, /shout, /petition, /bug, /feedback, and email directly to<br/>\n&gt; a GM at the suggestion of a Guide) to get this equipment restored. And I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; done them all numerous times and still nothing!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One Guide told me that a request to have my equipment restored had been<br/>\n&gt; forwarded, and that it would take 2 days at most to get it restored (now<br/>\n&gt; going onto day 4); quite truthfully, I&#39;m more upset at losing the opalline<br/>\n&gt; earring than any of the other gear (it being the hardest and most expensive<br/>\n&gt; to replace); and still nothing has been said or done about it - no email, no<br/>\n&gt; /tell&#39;s, no nothing in any way shape or form to explain what the holdup is.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In fact, all I keep getting from most of the Guides about anything, is that<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m too busy right now. Please /petition it.&quot; If I petition one more time<br/>\n&gt; and get no response, I&#39;m going to scream! As a matter of fact, I still have<br/>\n&gt; a petition in queue right now in the queue of my primary character and the<br/>\n&gt; alt that lost the equipment, and guess what, it&#39;s still not answered!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What I&#39;d like, is for any Verant employee/cohort to sit up and take notice,<br/>\n&gt; or for anyone who has an idea about how to get this situation taken care of<br/>\n&gt; to submit their suggestions via post or email, so that I can get this<br/>\n&gt; straightened out once and for all!!! I&#39;m sick to death of hearing &quot;I&#39;m too<br/>\n&gt; busy&quot; or &quot;It&#39;s not our policy&quot; or &quot;Sorry. It&#39;s against policy to do that&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve done everything I can short of calling Verant&#39;s support hotline, like<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m supposed to! Are you GM&#39;s and Guides there just to create lag? Or for<br/>\n&gt; once will you do what it is that you&#39;re s there to do?
