The customer does pay for all of that just like the <br/>\nplayers would pay if it took that much to do the job. If it took 3 people to <br/>\nmake a banded cloak, and those 3 people had to share the money 3 ways, the <br/>\naverage price of a banded cloak would go up from about 20pp to 35-40pp at <br/>\nleast. The guy that drives the forklift doesn&#39;t get paid by the government, <br/>\nhe gets paid by Fleetwood who makes their money from the RVs and motor homes <br/>\nits customers buy. And after the cost of the motor home pays off everyone <br/>\ninvolved in making, there&#39;s still a huge chunk of money left over called <br/>\nprofit, that Fleetwood uses to invest in other things (what us smiths use to <br/>\nget some nice plate.) I don&#39;t care what they say, corporations like GM and <br/>\nFleetwood sell their products at way over 2x production cost...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Talthoron@...\">Talthoron@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com\">EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com\">EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EQ_SMITHS] Looking for a few good men (and women)<br/>\n&gt;Date: Mon, 12 Jul 1999 17:39:36 EDT<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Talthoron@...\">Talthoron@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Fleetwood, the top maker of moter homes and RV&#39;s, Pella, the number one <br/>\n&gt;maker<br/>\n&gt;of window, GM (which has been mentioned) all will tell you the same thing,<br/>\n&gt;Screw ups, inspections, the people working in the office, the people who<br/>\n&gt;drive the fork lefts carting material all day....all the work they do and<br/>\n&gt;much work that others do is NOT what the costumer buys.  The customer buys<br/>\n&gt;what it takes to make the product and that is all.  They are not paying for<br/>\n&gt;the time it takes to train John Doe, not for the time it takes for someone <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;fix or check his work. They do not pay for the people to run the accounts,<br/>\n&gt;they do not pay for the guy to drive around on a forklift.  Would you?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;When you buy something, do you want to pay for all that extra that had<br/>\n&gt;nothing to do with building your car?  You can say it did have something to<br/>\n&gt;do with your car, but the fact of the matter it isn&#39;t.  Efficency is the <br/>\n&gt;key.<br/>\n&gt;  If the people doing the paid for work are good enough, then THEY pay the<br/>\n&gt;cost of all that excess.  I don&#39;t charge people for me learning to smith, I<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t charge for failure rates.  I charge for my work and the matrials <br/>\n&gt;needed<br/>\n&gt;to make the given item.  I have about the same prices.  I guess I just <br/>\n&gt;value<br/>\n&gt;my work more then you do yours.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Talthoron<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ONElist users:  YOU can win a $100 gift certificate to Amazon.com.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Check out the FRIENDS & FAMILY program to find out how.
