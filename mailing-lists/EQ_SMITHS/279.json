I<br/>\nam not meaning this as an attack at you, but rather as an observation. As I<br/>\nstated I don&#39;t care that much as I simply won&#39;t sell at these prices I would<br/>\nrather hunt somwhere and get exp and loot than waste my time making banded<br/>\narmor.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way I see it is if most smiths stick to a reasonable price the populace<br/>\nwill have to pay for it. Sure there will always be someone who will sell<br/>\nstupidly cheap but if that is an exception rather than a rule they can&#39;t<br/>\npossibly keep up with demand. I still sell a little at the prices I<br/>\nmentioned earlier I may not sell as much as others but I make just as much<br/>\nmoney in less time.
