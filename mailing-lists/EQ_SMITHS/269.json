I&#39;m still afraid to accept orders for leggings ever since I failed 14<br/>\ntimes in a row *shudder*. That was a dark day at the forge. My formula is the<br/>\nbasic cost, multiplied by three, rounded, modified by up to +/- 3 plat for<br/>\ndifficulty/demand. That formula yielded the following:<br/>\n<br/>\nGorget: 4 plat<br/>\nMask: 9 plat<br/>\nHelmet: 12 plat<br/>\nBracer: 5 plat<br/>\nSleeves: 10 plat<br/>\nMantle: 11 plat<br/>\nMail: 16 plat<br/>\nCloak: 16 plat<br/>\nBelt: 10 plat<br/>\nLeggings: 15 plat<br/>\nBoots: 10 plat<br/>\n<br/>\nI rarely don&#39;t make a sale off of these prices. They are standard or lower on<br/>\nthe E&#39;Ci server and I do sometimes lose money by providing these for so cheap.<br/>\nIt&#39;s not hard to fail twice on a cloak. That&#39;s practically breaking even. The<br/>\nfear of any smith is selling the full banded suit for a discount price. I sold<br/>\none for 110 plat... curse banded leggings!! I lost a total of 45 plat making<br/>\nthat full suit and selling for only 110 :) Don&#39;t set your prices too low or<br/>\nyou&#39;ll find smithing is NOT worth your time because of the minor prices.<br/>\nRemember: you can ALWAYS lower your price and you can NEVER raise it. Always get<br/>\nresponses like &quot;he&#39;s selling cheaper...&quot; or &quot;but you gave so-and-so a cheaper<br/>\nprice than that&quot; or &quot;that&#39;s not what you said yesterday&quot;. Trust me, don&#39;t sink<br/>\ntoo low. Keep the standards high!! Banded is mostly ruined on price, let&#39;s not<br/>\nlet plate get ruined once they implement it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of plate, I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s done with folded metal sheets? Book is<br/>\nwrong as to the ingredients (yes, I tried BLOCK, not large brick) and I was<br/>\nwondering if it&#39;s broken or if there is a different recipe. I&#39;d like to start<br/>\nexperimenting with folded metal, lockpicks, and tool boxes (book is wrong on<br/>\nthem all).<br/>\n-Rennin of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n Trade Council GM<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Bradshaw wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;David Bradshaw&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Logain@...\">Logain@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I sell for:<br/>\n&gt; Bracers, Gorgets     4pp<br/>\n&gt; Boots                        6pp (the mold costs more)<br/>\n&gt; Mask, Sleeves, Helm, Mantle and Belt    8pp<br/>\n&gt; Leggings and Tunics    15pp<br/>\n&gt; Cloaks    20pp (They are harder to make and people will pay it)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Basically I insist on making double my money.
