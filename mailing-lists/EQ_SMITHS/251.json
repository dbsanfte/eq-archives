I was only asking for some help, and will admit that I let my <br/>\nemotions get the better of me (hence my whining). LET IT DROP! You&#39;re just <br/>\nadding to the &quot;spam&quot; that no one wanted to and/or wants to see here.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo all those whom I offended, I apologize. I cross posted hoping that <br/>\nsomeone could help me out. Instead, I started a major flame war. All I can <br/>\nsay..... LET IT BE! IT&#39;S OVER! NOW DROP IT WILL YOU?!?!<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the last public crosspost of an extremely off topic subject that I&#39;ll <br/>\npost. Now I&#39;ll take my own advice, get off the soapbox I&#39;m on, and drop it <br/>\nleaving the matter be (IE - the last time I&#39;ll bring it up or crosspost; I <br/>\npromise).</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
