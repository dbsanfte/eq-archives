The game is still buggy, lets delay shipment until the game is<br/>\nno longer buggy.  (That means YOU don&#39;t get to play)  <br/>\nThe might still be working on this game getting the bugs out.  You<br/>\nwould still be playing Quake2.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  The game is still buggy, exec&#39;s at Verant decide to can this project<br/>\nsince the bugs will never be worked out and it just isn&#39;t feasible.<br/>\nYOU never get to play.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  The release this game in March, you get to enjoy the game, albiet with<br/>\na few bugs.  Play around the bugs, live with the bugs because the rest<br/>\nof the gaming experience is so fun.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you honestly feel that you shouldn&#39;t play this game until the bugs are<br/>\nworked out.  Cancel your account, and I will email you when the last bug<br/>\nis gone, at which time you can open a new account.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Jeremy Spielmann &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:spielman@...\">spielman@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Curtis..<br/>\n&gt; I have to say I disagree with the way you feel.  We all bought and paid for <br/>\n&gt; a game that we love playing.  We all pay money each month to play this game <br/>\n&gt; online.  As a programmer myself I feel as if the bugs should have been <br/>\n&gt; worked out by now.  I have gone through this same routine with the guys at <br/>\n&gt; Verant and can say it is the worst customer service that I have ever <br/>\n&gt; received.  I sat online for 4 hours waiting for a GM to help me out and <br/>\n&gt; still no one came.  Sure there are a few hundred people saying they lost <br/>\n&gt; things when they really didn&#39;t lose anything at all..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m still waiting for an email regarding a video problem that I&#39;m having. I <br/>\n&gt; switched video cards and can&#39;t get the game to work properly.  I&#39;ve been <br/>\n&gt; waiting for that email for 2 1/2 weeks now....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When game companies release a game they should make sure that the bugs are <br/>\n&gt; pretty much gone after beta testing.  Sure there are going to be problems, <br/>\n&gt; but then these companies should have the support needed to  help customers <br/>\n&gt; out..<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; IMO<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thx<br/>\n&gt; Jeremy (Shanuk)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From:\tCurtis Beck [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jungle@...\">jungle@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent:\tThursday, July 08, 1999 8:09 AM<br/>\n&gt; To:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com\">EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject:\tRe: [EQ_SMITHS] Raw deal - need help!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Curtis Beck &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jungle@...\">jungle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kale,<br/>\n&gt; \tI know how you feel, but I don&#39;t have a solution for you.  I have lost<br/>\n&gt; a character before on the Karan server when it was crashing all of the<br/>\n&gt; time.<br/>\n&gt; Lost a level 12 char with full banded.  Luckly for me I had some friends<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; were able to get me some patchwork armor and a mino axe and worked my<br/>\n&gt; way back<br/>\n&gt; to where I was.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\t\tTanaman<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; kale usi wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: kale usi &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I feel as though I&#39;m getting the raw end of the deal from Verant. I lost <br/>\n&gt; 10<br/>\n&gt; &gt; P and an Opalline earring (paid 25 P for it) off an alt character, due to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; yet another bug/glitch with the boat. I&#39;ve done everything I can possibly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think of, (/tell, /shout, /petition, /bug, /feedback, and email directly <br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a GM at the suggestion of a Guide) to get this equipment restored. And <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; &gt; done them all numerous times and still nothing!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; One Guide told me that a request to have my equipment restored had been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; forwarded, and that it would take 2 days at most to get it restored (now<br/>\n&gt; &gt; going onto day 4); quite truthfully, I&#39;m more upset at losing the <br/>\n&gt; opalline<br/>\n&gt; &gt; earring than any of the other gear (it being the hardest and most <br/>\n&gt; expensive<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to replace); and still nothing has been said or done about it - no email, <br/>\n&gt; no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; /tell&#39;s, no nothing in any way shape or form to explain what the holdup <br/>\n&gt; is.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In fact, all I keep getting from most of the Guides about anything, is <br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m too busy right now. Please /petition it.&quot; If I petition one more <br/>\n&gt; time<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and get no response, I&#39;m going to scream! As a matter of fact, I still <br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a petition in queue right now in the queue of my primary character and <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; alt that lost the equipment, and guess what, it&#39;s still not answered!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What I&#39;d like, is for any Verant employee/cohort to sit up and take <br/>\n&gt; notice,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or for anyone who has an idea about how to get this situation taken care <br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to submit their suggestions via post or email, so that I can get this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; straightened out once and for all!!! I&#39;m sick to death of hearing &quot;I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; too<br/>\n&gt; &gt; busy&quot; or &quot;It&#39;s not our policy&quot; or &quot;Sorry. It&#39;s against policy to do <br/>\n&gt; that&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve done everything I can short of calling Verant&#39;s support hotline, <br/>\n&gt; like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m supposed to! Are you GM&#39;s and Guides there just to create lag? Or for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; once will you do what it is that you&#39;re s there to do?
