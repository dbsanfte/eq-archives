I took up Smithing when I was a<br/>\nlvl7 Barbarian Warrior. At that time, I put 19 practice points in it, and<br/>\nthat was it. I started sharpening things, and quickly became lvl20. After<br/>\nthat, I made a few metal bits, and became lvl21. A few files and skewers<br/>\nlater, I became lvl24, and then I tried my first Banded Helm. It worked. You<br/>\ncan imagine how surprised I was when I read that I shouldn&#39;t start with<br/>\nbanded until I got to lvl70-80. I have now become a lvl9 Warrior, and have<br/>\n10 more practice points to waste. I tried to dump them into Smithing as<br/>\nwell, but my trainer refused to teach me any further. I wonder why...<br/>\nanybody have a clue? Also... I am currently stationed in Rivervale, and I<br/>\nwonder if they sell the components you need for smithing over there. I found<br/>\na forge, but that was all. (And I really don&#39;t feed like going to Freeport<br/>\nagain, way too many Griffins)<br/>\nTips for a beginning smith (it seems that is what I am) are most welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nGornar.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
