How do","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1947068225\">HAHAHAHA<br/>\n<br/>\nNOW THAT IS FUNNY<br/>\n<br/>\nSince WHEN have customers NOT payed overhead.....Listen to what you are saying....<br/>\n<br/>\nCustomers ONLY pay for the end product?   How do all the other bills get payed, research, defelopment, testing, quality control, rent, utilities, employee benefits, advertising, marketing, transportation, training, etc.....you honestly think that when you go to buy a car, the cost assocated with the above mentioned are not calculated into the price YOU pay?<br/>\n<br/>\nAgreed that a GOOD business will reduce these expenses as much as possible, but they are always there, and will always be there, and we as customers will allways pay for them.  Look at VCRs for example.  When they were &quot;new&quot; people payed out the wazoo for them.  Why did they cost so much?  Because there were only a few people who possesed the skills to produce them.  Now, everybody and their dog has those skills, and now the prices on VCRs are dirt cheap.  Point being, as the knowledge and skills required to make VCRs became more widely known the prices dropped, and continue to drop as more and more people now make VCRs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several varieties of VCRs now, some only play, some can play and record, some can even be programmed to record events.....now this would be a very interesting thing to put into smithing....varying qualities of armor.....ie someone with low skill and high failure rate would make heavier, less effictive armor.....while a master would be able to make lighter more effiecient armor....but thats another discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Talthoron@...\">Talthoron@...</a>&gt; 7.12.99 4:39:36 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Talthoron@...\">Talthoron@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nFleetwood, the top maker of moter homes and RV&#39;s, Pella, the number one maker <br/>\nof window, GM (which has been mentioned) all will tell you the same thing, <br/>\nScrew ups, inspections, the people working in the office, the people who <br/>\ndrive the fork lefts carting material all day....all the work they do and <br/>\nmuch work that others do is NOT what the costumer buys.  The customer buys <br/>\nwhat it takes to make the product and that is all.  They are not paying for <br/>\nthe time it takes to train John Doe, not for the time it takes for someone to <br/>\nfix or check his work. They do not pay for the people to run the accounts, <br/>\nthey do not pay for the guy to drive around on a forklift.  Would you?</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
