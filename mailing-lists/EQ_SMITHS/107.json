I just knew there had to be a market for the stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, are there any smiths on the Tunare server who would like to team up<br/>\nwith a Tailor?  I am a very skilled tailor, but have not had the training<br/>\npoints or money to invest in smithing yet.  Please let me know if you are<br/>\ninterested.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a second note, I am also very skilled in pottery, so can be of help<br/>\nmaking ceramic linings if you are practicing your skill in smithing with<br/>\nitems that require those and do not wish to invest in the pottery<br/>\nproficiency.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nTanaltuset, Halfling Rogue, Tunare server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; A freind of mine is a Ranger/Tailor and they have had extensive<br/>\n&gt; talks about<br/>\n&gt; studed/reenforced on the Ranger mailing list he is on,  He and I<br/>\n&gt; are also in<br/>\n&gt; bussiness selling the stuff in the Kelethin area (I supply the studs, we<br/>\n&gt; both go kill the puma&#39;s for the pelts, and he makes the armour)<br/>\n&gt; from what I<br/>\n&gt; have been told the ac is a little better on some pieces of armour, where<br/>\n&gt; studed and reinforced become usefull is in their absourbtion.  as<br/>\n&gt; an example<br/>\n&gt; say in leather you get hit for 8 points of dammage the exact same hit in<br/>\n&gt; studed armour would do 6 damm and 4 damm in reinforced.  This of course is<br/>\n&gt; just an example of the numbers which will probally vary....<br/>\n&gt; because of this<br/>\n&gt; extra absourbtion and better AC studed/reinforced is well worth it for the<br/>\n&gt; people who can&#39;t use better. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
