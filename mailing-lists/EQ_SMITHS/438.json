So you just miss understood who ever you talked too.<br/>\nYou get a file and a large lid for each one you make.  Then goto skewers<br/>\ntill 115. Then armour. As far as studds i think thay area easy at 40 and<br/>\nbonings at around 60. Dont do lanturns thay are too exspensive. You may fail<br/>\nmore with skewers but thay are cheeperer. As far as studd selling prices<br/>\nthay cost about 6 gp a shot to  try to make one depending on your chr and<br/>\nnatority level. Usuale sell them for a min of a plat. In truth I wouldnt<br/>\nbother making these unless someone requests them. Just keep making scalers<br/>\nthen skewers till about 115. You can make armour about 110 with some good<br/>\nluck. I made the one sheet things about half the time at this level. It cost<br/>\nme about 100 plat to get too 110 but i have a high chr and was amiable to<br/>\nthe vendors.<br/>\n<br/>\n                                 if you have any other questions let me know<br/>\nhon<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                 Sylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Robert Tortajada &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bobt@...\">bobt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com\">EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com\">EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Thursday, October 07, 1999 5:50 PM<br/>\nSubject: [EQ_SMITHS] Trivial Levels<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Robert Tortajada &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bobt@...\">bobt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Someone told me to make scalars (files) from skill level 20 to 40.
