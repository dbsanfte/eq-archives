If a worker at GM <br/>\nscrews up and breaks a windshield, does the customer pay for that broken <br/>\nwindshield and the cost that it takes to fix it? no.  When they buy the car, <br/>\nthey are paying for what it takes to make that car.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou think banded is low on some of your servers, you should see Cazic Thule.  <br/>\nThere is a guy in Freeport (obviously made and twinkled by a high level char <br/>\njust to be a smith) who sells banded dirt cheap.  I&quot;m talking from 2pp for a <br/>\ngorget to 9pp for a tunic or cloak.  Today at the Bazaar he had someone <br/>\nstanding in teh area of the bazzar announceing banded for sell then refering <br/>\nthem to the guy making it in freeport.  I went to the forge and watched for a <br/>\nbit, there was never less then 8-10 people lined up waiting on costum made <br/>\nbanded.  He was there for hours makeing banded after banded item for dirt <br/>\ncheap.  He&#39;s making a killing on banded armor because he&#39;s found a way to <br/>\nsell a ton of it at dirt cheap prices.  and no, he&#39;s not taking a loss.  He <br/>\nhas a VERY high smithing skill and only charges for what it costs to make the <br/>\nbanded plus a little for the work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTalthoron<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonaly, my prices are more in your guys&#39;s range  Gorget 4pp clear to a <br/>\ntunic for 20pp.  yes, I can sell it for these prices but I don&#39;t make nearly <br/>\nthe sales nor the money that the guy in freeport does.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
