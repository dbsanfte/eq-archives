Players stop playing their warrior and<br/>\nstart up another character that will need his own banded.  The level 30s<br/>\nthat finally get their replacement for banded armor often are not interested<br/>\nin haggling, meeting, and reselling banded to players for 2 or 3 p<br/>\ngain (vs selling it to a merchant)  I know a couple of people at level 22-23<br/>\nthat don&#39;t even bother selling FS weapons to players because it is a waste<br/>\nof time, it is the same with banded.  (and no, these players<br/>\nare not master potters or brewers)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we need is the ability to make steel armor, or at least<br/>\nbronze, that way we can cater to more than 1 level range of players.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Libertn2@...\">Libertn2@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The problem with smithing and diminishing prices is the fact that once an <br/>\n&gt; item is created, it usually never leaves circulation.  Most, if not all <br/>\n&gt; banded is passed down and sold to others when it no longer has a use.  What <br/>\n&gt; this means is that eventually, there will be little to no market for banded <br/>\n&gt; AT ALL.  What smiths and other crafters need is some sort of item degrade.  <br/>\n&gt; This is the only way to keep the trade skills working indefinitely and the <br/>\n&gt; only way to remove items from circulation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, another major problem with trade skills and the economy as a whole is <br/>\n&gt; the fact that Verant said they would not allow for you to sell back to a <br/>\n&gt; merchant at a profit, then went ahead and did it anyway.  I was one very few <br/>\n&gt; people that was a Master at Brewing and Pottery before &quot;The Patch.&quot;  Now <br/>\n&gt; everyone and their mother is a brewer and a potter simply for the exploit.  <br/>\n&gt; Can you imagine what would have happened if this was true for smiths and <br/>\n&gt; jewelers??<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Verant needs to stick to its word about no profit from selling to merchants.  <br/>\n&gt; Already, no one sells good items any more for plat because plat is worthless. <br/>\n&gt;  The current economy just leads to more camping and kill stealing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hawkwin of Hawkwin&#39;s Roaming Emporium<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members? <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; The EQ BlackSmithy Discussion Group<br/>\n&gt; List Administrator:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chade@...\">chade@...</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
