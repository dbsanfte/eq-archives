After 1 and a half hours, I had 215pp on me.<br/>\nI had about 3 people decline my services.  The rest bought them.  I also<br/>\nsell full sets at 130pp, and I sold 1 full set (of small armor, which was a<br/>\npain for me.  being in gfay, and having to run to BB to get the molds was a<br/>\nbother).  Anyhow, I believe if we stick to these prices, which still seem to<br/>\nsell well, we will do good.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaijar the Mage Blacksmith</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
