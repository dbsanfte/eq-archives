Please, nobody argue with this, it would defeat the<br/>\n&gt;entire purpose of this post. I won&#39;t even respond if this gets flamed,<br/>\n&gt;and I would hope nobody else will either. Anyway, here goes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I just thought it&#39;d be a neat idea to have &#39;name tags&#39; on trade-made<br/>\n&gt;products. Maybe not for cooking or brewing, as those items aren&#39;t meant<br/>\n&gt;to last, but on generally anything else. Something in the status window<br/>\n&gt;that says, &quot;made by: name&quot;. Wouldn&#39;t that just be neat? Buy a banded<br/>\n&gt;tunic 6 months from now with one of your secondary characters and say,<br/>\n&gt;&quot;hey! I made that!!&quot; I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s even possible for them to code<br/>\n&gt;this, nor do I expect or really even want them to. I just think it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;kinda neat, that&#39;s all :) Too much coding for the effect it would<br/>\n&gt;produce (or should I say lack of effect =P). Just, as I said, neat :)<br/>\n&gt;-Rennin of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n&gt; Trade Council GM<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt;----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Books, music, auctions, and more.
