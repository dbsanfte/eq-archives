I made 70 plat profit. I said<br/>\nmy price is higher than most, I said I wouldn&#39;t sell for lower, and I gave the<br/>\nbuyer the option to shop around and find a better price or to buy from me right<br/>\nthen and there. Well, I sold the suit :) People pay the prices, and the more of<br/>\nus that sell for a higher price, the rarer the cheap banded, and the more<br/>\nwilling they are to pay our price instead of shopping around. I&#39;m not trying to<br/>\nbe greedy, but my time invested into smithing is worth more than a few plat per<br/>\nsale, or in some cases, actually losing money. I won&#39;t continue to lose money, I<br/>\nam not dropping my prices. I sell fine at 130 per suit (will drop to 120), 6 per<br/>\ngorget, 12 per mask, 14 per helmet, 8 per bracer, 13 per sleeves, 14 per mantle,<br/>\n20 per mail, 19 per cloak, 13 per belt, 19 per leggings, 13 per boots.<br/>\n-Rennin of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n Trade Council GM<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Bradshaw wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;David Bradshaw&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Logain@...\">Logain@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Exactly the fact is we can factor in the costs of our failures or we can let<br/>\n&gt; players deflate the costs. If we won&#39;t sell for less what are they going to<br/>\n&gt; do?? Summon it? I don&#39;t think so... Seems there is one place it comes from<br/>\n&gt; that is smiths if we don&#39;t sell it for almost nothing they can&#39;t buy it for<br/>\n&gt; almost nothing no matter how much they suck or are mean or whatever.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I haven&#39;t bothered to even make any unless they will buy for the prices I<br/>\n&gt; mentioned awhile ago. You can say people won&#39;t pay that. I say fine then<br/>\n&gt; they won&#39;t get any armor from me. Now if you go and make it for the same<br/>\n&gt; price you are the one allowing them to get away with it. They WILL pay the<br/>\n&gt; minimum we will sell it for or they won&#39;t get it simple.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do you think GM will sell cars for a loss if people moan and groan enough.

Of course, you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;specifically wouldn&#39;t want to.

You want to know what else?  They don&#39;t care<br/>\n&gt; one<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; bit for your failures either.  They are buying the successes.  No one<br/>\n&gt; wantes<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to pay for the ones you screw up on, they are not buying the skewers you<br/>\n&gt; used<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to practice with either.  If anything, get anrgy with EQ on the sucess<br/>\n&gt; ratio.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  Once something is trivial, I think it should be VERY rare that you fail.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Talthoron<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; How has ONElist changed your life?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Share your story with us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The EQ BlackSmithy Discussion Group<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; List Administrator:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chade@...\">chade@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Attention ONElist list owners!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html\">http://www.onelist.com/info/news.html</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Check out the new &quot;DEFAULT MODERATED STATUS&quot; option.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The EQ BlackSmithy Discussion Group<br/>\n&gt; &gt;List Administrator:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chade@...\">chade@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; The EQ BlackSmithy Discussion Group<br/>\n&gt; List Administrator:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chade@...\">chade@...</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
