I was polishing a<br/>\nrusty<br/>\ntwo-handed sword yesterday (I was at skill level 22) and Lo and behold, I<br/>\ngot a<br/>\nskill increase!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been watching closely and I believe you CAn raise skills in the low<br/>\n20&#39;s at<br/>\npolishing weapons BUT the weapon you polish has a factor.  <br/>\nI can polish rusty daggers & short swords with 80% success and never see an<br/>\nincrease.<br/>\nI can polish rusty battle axes, and two handed swords with a 50% success<br/>\nand see<br/>\nan occasional skill increase even though I am STILL getting the trivial<br/>\nmessage.<br/>\nIt seems the damage/value of the weapon is included in the difficulty<br/>\nformula.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, oddly enough I have made 4 metal studs in 5 attempts at a skill level<br/>\nof only 23.<br/>\nI have yet to see a skill increase making studs even though studs are,<br/>\nsupposedly,<br/>\na more difficult task than scalers or files.<br/>\nI have made 8 files in 10 attempts<br/>\nI have made 4 studs in 5 attempts<br/>\n<br/>\nI bought my blacksmithing to 21 with pracs and the only increases I have<br/>\nseen were <br/>\npolishing weapons with a sale value of greater than 2 gold.  Obviously I<br/>\nHAVE &quot;trived&quot; <br/>\nout on the cheaper weapons such as daggers and short swords but this game<br/>\nseems <br/>\nto reward sacrifice.  Try your polishing on weapons that have a 2+ gold<br/>\nmonetary value <br/>\nand you MAY still get an increase for the effort.
