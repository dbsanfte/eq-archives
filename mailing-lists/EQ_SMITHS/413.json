Is there <br/>\nsomething less difficult to make at this lv?<br/>\n<br/>\nQildar Goodheart<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&lt;&lt; Make skewers to get your skill up, these are good until skill 115, <br/>\n&gt;although<br/>\n&gt;  around skill 110, I was good enough at making banded that I stopped <br/>\n&gt;advancing<br/>\n&gt;  my skill and just made armor for sale.  I believe after skewers you can<br/>\n&gt;  make skewing kits up to skill 175. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yes...you will save money in the long run bringing your skill to 115 with<br/>\n&gt;skewers... Then...if you want and have a little extra money...and a bit of<br/>\n&gt;extra time...Sewing Kits will bring your skill to 135...to get to 175, <br/>\n&gt;you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt;need to make banded...the problem is, is that only banded Cloaks, Mantles <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;Leggings are not trivial at 135.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
