I have never seen<br/>\n&gt; studded leather in any form, and I have seen websites that say<br/>\n&gt; studded leather has the same AC as leather, and I have seen sites<br/>\n&gt; that say studded leather is between leather and chain.  My<br/>\n&gt; character Cassin (Povar), is both a tailor and a smith (and not<br/>\n&gt; very good at either!), so I was wondering if this would be a<br/>\n&gt; smart endeavour.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
