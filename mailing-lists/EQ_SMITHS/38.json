I took up Smithing when I was a<br/>\n&gt; lvl7 Barbarian Warrior. At that time, I put 19 practice points in it, and<br/>\n&gt; that was it. I started sharpening things, and quickly became lvl20. After<br/>\n&gt; that, I made a few metal bits, and became lvl21. A few files and skewers<br/>\n&gt; later, I became lvl24, and then I tried my first Banded Helm. It worked. You<br/>\n&gt; can imagine how surprised I was when I read that I shouldn&#39;t start with<br/>\n&gt; banded until I got to lvl70-80. I have now become a lvl9 Warrior, and have<br/>\n&gt; 10 more practice points to waste. I tried to dump them into Smithing as<br/>\n&gt; well, but my trainer refused to teach me any further. I wonder why...<br/>\n&gt; anybody have a clue? Also... I am currently stationed in Rivervale, and I<br/>\n&gt; wonder if they sell the components you need for smithing over there. I found<br/>\n&gt; a forge, but that was all. (And I really don&#39;t feed like going to Freeport<br/>\n&gt; again, way too many Griffins)<br/>\n&gt; Tips for a beginning smith (it seems that is what I am) are most welcome.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Regards,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Gornar.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Looking for a fun, easy way to stay in touch with family members?<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Create a ONElist community just for your family!<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; The EQ BlackSmithy Discussion Group<br/>\n&gt; List Administrator:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chade@...\">chade@...</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
