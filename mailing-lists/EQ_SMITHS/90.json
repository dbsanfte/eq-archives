That&#39;s large patchwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in Kelethin it was usually 2-4 gold per piece, 4 being for the tunic<br/>\nand legs I beleive, but I got a whole suit for 2 gold per piece.  That was<br/>\nsmall patchwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the Halas patchwork is most likely so cheap because there are just<br/>\nso many polar bear cubs in the everfrost peaks.  (not to mention polar<br/>\nbears, but they kinda hurt..)<br/>\n<br/>\nAerian Spiritwind<br/>\nICQ: 1438115</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
