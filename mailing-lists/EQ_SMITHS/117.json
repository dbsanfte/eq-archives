Before I continue with my occupation in Smithing, however, I<br/>\nhave some very simple questions that I believe are important to all beginning<br/>\nsmiths, as well as non-smiths.<br/>\n<br/>\n#1 - Where is the closest place that a smith in Qeynos may purchase basic smithing<br/>\nitems (i.e. Metal Bits, scraps, bars, blocks, File Molds, etc.)?<br/>\n<br/>\n#2 - At what skill level should a Smith begin to create Banded armor, and what type<br/>\nshould be produced first (i.e. Boots, Belts, Leggings, etc.)?<br/>\n<br/>\n#3 - What are the standard prices on Studs and Banded armor (both minimum and<br/>\nmaximum prices)?<br/>\n<br/>\n#4 - Are there any other things that Smiths can produce, other than in the Basic<br/>\nBlacksmithing Books (i.e. non-Banded armor, weapons, etc.)?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank all of you in advance for your time!<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nPraetor</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
