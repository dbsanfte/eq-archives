I do not want to cause waves, get ripped, or over<br/>\ncharge. =)<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it safe to charge double or tripple the cost of 1 attempt to make for<br/>\neach item you can make?<br/>\nie.<br/>\n1 MQ sheet = 21p with high Cha.<br/>\nBracer Mold = 7p (I think, can&#39;t remember exactly)<br/>\n* Padding not worth adding in as a cost<br/>\nSo sale price = 60p or 90p (or more?)<br/>\n<br/>\nOr does FS Plate sell by the AC?<br/>\nie.<br/>\n10 plat per AC point<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does being Dyed effect this price?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen selling a &quot;Full Set&quot; of dyed FS Plate, is this only the visual pieces,<br/>\nor dyed visual pieces and un-dyed non-visual pieces?<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes the color effect sale price? If so, how?<br/>\nie<br/>\nblack (6k visual only) &gt; red (5.5k visual only) &gt; blue (5k visual only) &gt;<br/>\nyellow (3.5k Visual only)... or all colors reguardless are 4-6k depending on<br/>\nserver...<br/>\n<br/>\nResin is roughly 6 plat per, so Resin 3 (neon from what I have seen) is the<br/>\nmost expensive... how do most of you add this in to the price?<br/>\nie.<br/>\nAdd 20p(resin 1), 40p (resin 2), 60p(resin 3)for each piece?<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes Size effect price?<br/>\nie.<br/>\nI had to go to Halas/Grobb to get the molds, so is more... (?)<br/>\n<br/>\nA &quot;full set&quot; of non-dyed (all pieces) sells for how much?<br/>\nAssuming no failures on ore conversion, and making ore into folded sheets,<br/>\nbase cost of ore for making 1 of each piece is 511 plat.<br/>\nBP mold is 22 plat, Bracer Mold is around 7 plat, everything else is in<br/>\nbetween. Average 14p per mold and you get 182 plat for molds.<br/>\nTotal: 693 plat to make 1 complete suit of FSp Plate. Round to 700 to make<br/>\nthe math simple...<br/>\nWith the above sale suggestion, sale price: 1400 or 2100 plat. This even<br/>\nclose on most servers?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally, what type of demand is there for FS Plate?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI got into Smithing mainly because I wanted to be able to twink my SK with<br/>\nblood red FS plate, and to be able to make things my guild needed. To get to<br/>\n173 in smithing, I spent less plat than I believe it would have cost me to<br/>\nbuy what I made, and I made a set for my wife&#39;s cleric to. So I know in the<br/>\nend, I saved alot of plat. Plus, later if i want a new color, I can do it<br/>\nrelatively easy. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all your help, and for reading this far.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nArakine Uktena *Changing Tide*<br/>\nFennin Ro</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
