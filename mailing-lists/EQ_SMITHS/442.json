I tried to research what to do next,<br/>\n&gt; but I am finding conficting information.  Should I be making<br/>\n&gt; lanterns or skewers now?  Or should I be making something else?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks very much for your help,<br/>\n&gt; -Sarah<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The progression is metal bits (21), scalers (41), lanterns (68), skewers<br/>\n(115), pots (122) and finally sewing kits (135).  Everything you need to<br/>\nmake metal bits is in N Freeport.  Everything else is in E Freeport until<br/>\nyou are ready to make sewing kits.  When you reach skill 122, pick up and go<br/>\nto high pass hold to the Serpent&#39;s Supply.  There is a forge right next to<br/>\nthe vendor with needle and thimble molds.  This is kinda important for your<br/>\nsanity because sewing kits are containers and take up a whole inventory<br/>\nslot.  The postition of the vendor means you can simply turn around and sell<br/>\noff your kits to make room for more.  Personally, I had alot of trouble<br/>\nmaking armor profitably until I maxed my skill out with the sewing kits.<br/>\nAlso, note that many of the guides out there have incorrect information on<br/>\nhow to make cloaks.  The correct formula is mold + 2 metal sheets (not 3!) +<br/>\nwater.<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome to the wonderful art of smithing.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
