Now what?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have gone as far as I can go with Skewers. I wish to have high enough skill <br/>\nto make plate when it does come out, so what can I practice on? I know some <br/>\nwill say banded but I don&#39;t want to spend the money on banded and I hate <br/>\ntrying to sell a ton of armor I have laying around. When I do sell banded I <br/>\nmake it to order that way I don&#39;t have a ton of armor no one wants.<br/>\nSo what can I do? what will give me a good skill gain? <br/>\nHas anyone hit the coveted 255?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your time<br/>\n<br/>\nFezik the decent smith</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
