BTW, I am<br/>\non the Rathe Server (Archonon)<br/>\n<br/>\nI started with a 10 skill, and now have 40. I have spent 62p doing this<br/>\nand have the system figured out<br/>\npretty well. I have 100p left to spend, afterward I will have to go out<br/>\nand earn some spending cash or<br/>\nsell some stuff off..... (I think its more fun to go earn the money<br/>\nhowever)<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom x-20 points of skills just make metal bits, and don&#39;t sell them!<br/>\nWhen you cross 20 skill just make<br/>\nas many as ore you have left on hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen fall into this rotation.... buy and use enough skewer molds to use<br/>\nup all the metal bits you have<br/>\nassembled (try to do a min of 20-30 per cycle). When you run out of<br/>\nbits, go make more, on the order<br/>\nof 100 or so (meaning 200ore + 100water + extras for all the failures)<br/>\n<br/>\nThen just turn them all into skewers (I have made 9-12 skewers). You<br/>\nwill fail all the time, but you still<br/>\ngain skill points from failure. If your lucky you can sell a skewer back<br/>\nto make up some lost cash, but<br/>\nnot much. Never sell the metal bits, its better to just bank them until<br/>\nyou can afford to smith more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe key is too build up a big supply of bits so that your skewer<br/>\ncreation attempts run one after the other<br/>\nas this seems to affect the skill rewarding.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far the average cost has been 21-24gold per point of skill.<br/>\n<br/>\n11 copper per water,  56 copper per ore,  89 copper per mold.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last step in all of this is!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGO BACK AND BEG YOUR FRIENDS TO LET YOU BACK INTO THE GROUP!!! ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n(actually I am only spending the weekday nights doing this (90 mins a<br/>\nnight) and will rejoin the groups I<br/>\nusually find by Saturday)<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nWith more than 14 million emails exchanged daily...<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n....ONElist IS the place where the world talks!<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nThe EQ BlackSmithy Discussion Group<br/>\nList Administrator:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chade@...\">chade@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Free Email and Do More On The Web.
