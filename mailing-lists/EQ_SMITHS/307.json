I bid, sell and perform engineering services.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2130126702\">Overhead &#92; o-ver-hed&#92; adj 1 :  business expense not chargeable to a<br/>\nparticular part of the work or product.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bid, sell and perform engineering services.  Overhead is a constant in ANY<br/>\nbusiness.  As Webster&#39;s dictionary (see above) states the overhead cost for<br/>\na business is not billable to a particular product or part of a product.  It<br/>\nis, however, passed along to the consumer in the form of a generally higher<br/>\nprice.  GM, and any other business MUST, as a necessity, pass along the<br/>\ncosts of health insurance, equipment maintenance, downtime, quality<br/>\nassurance and yes...even employee incompetence to the consumer.  Not in the<br/>\n1st car off the assembly line or the 2nd or the 200th.  But as an average of<br/>\nthe products they sell the overhead must be covered or the company simply<br/>\nfails to make money.<br/>\nWe do not live in an altruistic society.  GM is not in business because it<br/>\nlongs to provide a job to all those poor UAW union members.  They are in<br/>\nbusiness to MAKE MONEY.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trick to handling overhead is to pass along as much of it as possible to<br/>\nthe consumer and still make a profit.  When, in the name of selling your<br/>\nproduct, you lower your price to the point that the overhead % is higher<br/>\nthan your profit you lose.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a consulting engineer my corporate overhead rate is 131%.  This means<br/>\nthat, as I bid work, I must take my actual hourly rate and multiply it by<br/>\n131% just to BREAK EVEN.<br/>\n<br/>\nBah.  This is no place for a lesson in economics.<br/>\nIf some idiot wants to eat all of his failures let him.  I certainly wont.<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: David Bradshaw &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Logain@...\">Logain@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com\">EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com\">EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, July 12, 1999 6:59 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_SMITHS] Looking for a few good men (and women)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;David Bradshaw&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Logain@...\">Logain@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So your saying that most business lose money? I mean if I pay for materials<br/>\n&gt;and the worker that works on those materials only the company is going to<br/>\n&gt;lose money right?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hmmmmm I wonder why they are still in business doesn&#39;t make much sense to<br/>\n&gt;me. I think you should take a close look at what you are saying. If no one<br/>\n&gt;pays for overhead then the business loses money. SOMEONE must pay for it,<br/>\n&gt;the workers driving the forklift and the forklift itself do NOT work for<br/>\n&gt;free. I don&#39;t know of any business that loses money and stays open for very<br/>\n&gt;long. Unless of course it is run by a government....
