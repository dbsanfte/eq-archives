Tailoring is probably next to be worked on<br/>\nafter make poison, and then probably tinkering or alchemy from what I&#39;ve<br/>\nread all around), we should only sell for 5 to 10 plat less than the<br/>\nmagical plates are sold for. We can&#39;t sell for NPC plate prices (people<br/>\nwould just buy magical plate) but I really don&#39;t want to shoot myself in<br/>\nthe foot and have the same thing happen with plate as it did to banded.<br/>\nPlease, no flames, I know some of you will only want 10 plat profit per<br/>\npiece, that&#39;s your right, and this is mine. This is what I will be doing<br/>\nand I would hope if you&#39;re concerned over smithing, please do the same.<br/>\nPlate will NOT be cheaper to make oneself (not only the 150 plat it<br/>\ntakes to get to banded, but all the time selling banded to get to making<br/>\nplate), so we don&#39;t have to worry about that happening. Just gotta be<br/>\ncompetetive with magical plates. Again, please no flames, I&#39;m terribly<br/>\nsick of them, and I will not respond. Please, if you&#39;re on my side,<br/>\ndon&#39;t respond to any flames either. Let the baby have his/her bottle.<br/>\n-Rennin of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n Trade Council GM</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
