Then enchanters would already have the spells<br/>\nimplemented. We&#39;d be able to make enchanted silver banded, enchanted electrum<br/>\nbanded, enchanted gold banded, and enchanted platinum banded :) That&#39;d be neat,<br/>\nand it&#39;s the easiest to implement...<br/>\n-Rennin of E&#39;Ci<br/>\n Trade Council GM<br/>\n<br/>\nkale usi wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;kale usi&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaleusi@...\">kaleusi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Libertn2@...\">Libertn2@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I just thought it&#39;d be a neat idea to have &#39;name tags&#39; on trade-made<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;products. Maybe not for cooking or brewing, as those items aren&#39;t &gt;meant<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to last, but on generally anything else. Something in the &gt;status window<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that says, &quot;made by: name&quot;. Wouldn&#39;t that just be neat?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The idea had crossed my mind once or twice. Never really suggested it to<br/>\n&gt; Verant though. It&#39;s a good idea, but I&#39;d rather see them get the bugs worked<br/>\n&gt; out first, and do something about smithing other things like plate, weapons<br/>\n&gt; etc. I&#39;d also like to see them do something about using different ores (IE -<br/>\n&gt; mithril, adamantite etc.) and possibly enchanting magic weapons and armor<br/>\n&gt; (by no means do I think that these should be easy tasks to do in game!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Get $20 off all MotherNature brand products!<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/mothernature1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/mothernature1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; The EQ BlackSmithy Discussion Group<br/>\n&gt; List Administrator:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chade@...\">chade@...</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
