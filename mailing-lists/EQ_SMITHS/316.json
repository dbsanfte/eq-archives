Most, if not all<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;banded is passed down and sold to others when it no longer has a use. <br/>\n&gt;What <br/>\n&gt;this means is that eventually, there will be little to no market for<br/>\n&gt;banded <br/>\n&gt;AT ALL.  What smiths and other crafters need is some sort of item<br/>\n&gt;degrade.  <br/>\n&gt;This is the only way to keep the trade skills working indefinitely and<br/>\n&gt;the <br/>\n&gt;only way to remove items from circulation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, another major problem with trade skills and the economy as a<br/>\n&gt;whole is <br/>\n&gt;the fact that Verant said they would not allow for you to sell back to<br/>\n&gt;a <br/>\n&gt;merchant at a profit, then went ahead and did it anyway.  I was one<br/>\n&gt;very few <br/>\n&gt;people that was a Master at Brewing and Pottery before &quot;The Patch.&quot; <br/>\n&gt;Now <br/>\n&gt;everyone and their mother is a brewer and a potter simply for the<br/>\n&gt;exploit.  <br/>\n&gt;Can you imagine what would have happened if this was true for smiths<br/>\n&gt;and <br/>\n&gt;jewelers??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Verant needs to stick to its word about no profit from selling to<br/>\n&gt;merchants.  <br/>\n&gt;Already, no one sells good items any more for plat because plat is<br/>\n&gt;worthless. <br/>\n&gt; The current economy just leads to more camping and kill stealing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hawkwin of Hawkwin&#39;s Roaming Emporium<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor<br/>\n&gt;----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Having difficulty getting &quot;in synch&quot; with list members? <br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Try ONElist&#39;s Shared Calendar to organize events, meetings and more!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The EQ BlackSmithy Discussion Group<br/>\n&gt;List Administrator:<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chade@...\">chade@...</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
