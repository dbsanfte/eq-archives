I&#39;m currently doing a quest from RiverVale where I need to <br/>\n&gt;collect some items for a bug collection. I need a fire beetle, spiderling <br/>\n&gt;eye, giant fire beetle leg, giant wasp wing, and a giant scarab egg sac. I <br/>\n&gt;can get all of the items I need in the Misty Thickey, RiverVale hunting <br/>\n&gt;hunting grounds, except for the giant fire beetle leg. The only places I <br/>\n&gt;know how to get them is from the Queen Klacknak and giant fire beetles in <br/>\n&gt;West Karana. This means if I wanted to do this quest I would need to run all <br/>\n&gt;the way there. I have never gone through Highpass Hold (only way I know how <br/>\n&gt;to get there). I was wondering if there was anywhere closer to Freeport, <br/>\n&gt;that dosen&#39;t require a high level character. I&#39;m only level 10 right now, <br/>\n&gt;and don&#39;t want to risk it. then die somewhere were I cannot retreive my <br/>\n&gt;corpse. Is there anywhere I can go? Past the Desert of Ro or something? If <br/>\n&gt;anyone has any of the legs near Freeport I&#39;m am VERY willing to buy a few of <br/>\n&gt;them.
