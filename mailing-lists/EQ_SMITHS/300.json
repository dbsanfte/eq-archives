I&#39;m <br/>\nlooking for two level 16 wizards, one level 14-16 monk, one level 14-16 <br/>\ncleric and a level 14-16 magician or enchanter to go on a journey to upper <br/>\nguk. the point of this journey is to accumulate lots of money and magical <br/>\nitems so we can make money to use to further our smithing skill. i am <br/>\ncurrently broke. this is on the fennin ro server, i am a level 15 warrior <br/>\nnamed Coil. I would prefer that you are a small to medium character because <br/>\ntrolls barbarians and ogres can block passage ways. Also if anyone wants to <br/>\ngive me money if they are high level and have too much i&#39;d accept it =) Email <br/>\nme if you are interested please, thanks.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
