The customer buys <br/>\nwhat it takes to make the product and that is all.  They are not paying for <br/>\nthe time it takes to train John Doe, not for the time it takes for someone to <br/>\nfix or check his work. They do not pay for the people to run the accounts, <br/>\nthey do not pay for the guy to drive around on a forklift.  Would you?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you buy something, do you want to pay for all that extra that had <br/>\nnothing to do with building your car?  You can say it did have something to <br/>\ndo with your car, but the fact of the matter it isn&#39;t.  Efficency is the key. <br/>\n If the people doing the paid for work are good enough, then THEY pay the <br/>\ncost of all that excess.  I don&#39;t charge people for me learning to smith, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t charge for failure rates.  I charge for my work and the matrials needed <br/>\nto make the given item.  I have about the same prices.  I guess I just value <br/>\nmy work more then you do yours.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalthoron</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
