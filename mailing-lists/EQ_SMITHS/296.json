Not aimed<br/>\nat anyone person.<br/>\n<br/>\nPoint 1.  BS.  The customer is to paying for the failures, and my time for that<br/>\nmatter.  It&#39;s called OVERHEAD.  (example) If I were making cloaks, and the<br/>\nfailure rate was really high, even for a 150+ smith.  Say like you only made 1<br/>\ncloak out of 10, do you really think people would sell cloaks for 10-15p each?<br/>\nGet a grip.  My time, materials, and the persons personality go into the price.<br/>\nThe last factor can lower the price if they are nice and don&#39;t look twinked, and<br/>\nsay they can&#39;t afford the cost by a couple of plat.  Then I&#39;m happy to lower it<br/>\ndown for them.  The Aholes, that come off saying hey, your greedy.. I&#39;m not<br/>\nbuying from you.  Then 30 mins later when they can&#39;t find it for less or at<br/>\nall.. want to buy from me..  hahahah I won&#39;t lower it a copper.. I might just<br/>\nraise it a few plat.<br/>\n<br/>\nPoint 2.  Over all armor costs..  I have a completely TWINKED smith.  I&#39;ll be<br/>\nthe first to admit it.  I have a 25+ warrior, and I used cash from him and<br/>\npurchased magical items to get my smith character up in smithing skill.  I run<br/>\nmy smith for the SOLE purpose of making money to feed my warrior. (Have you seen<br/>\nthe prices of steel plate??) and to help my wives mage buy spells.  But, I don&#39;t<br/>\nNOTHING to hurt the smithing trade.  I won&#39;t lowwe my prices to 50p for a full<br/>\nsuit of banded or sell components for 1p over cost.  I sell at a fair price to<br/>\nboth me and the customer.  If you get on the Erollis Marr server, I&#39;m known as<br/>\n&quot;the banded guy&quot;.  Lots of people buy my banded at my prices.  I don&#39;t have to<br/>\nwork hard at all to make 300-400p a day on the weekends.. and 100-200p on the<br/>\nweek nights.. profit.  Then I go off and spend it in the market place (PCs) and<br/>\nadventure... I&#39;m not a full time smith.<br/>\n<br/>\nPoint 3.  I&#39;m NOT going to help another little smith ever again. (On Errolis<br/>\nMarr anyways).  The last 3 people that I have &quot;helped&quot; get to 100-110 smithing<br/>\nso they could begin to make money turn around, and undercut me and try to steal<br/>\nall of my business.  That is crazy.  There are TONS of people wanting banded all<br/>\nthe time.  We could all sell for the same price and make plenty of plat.  but<br/>\nno.  They have to try and undercut me.  Well, to bad for them, that people know<br/>\nwhen they are getting a good deal and alot of people will only buy from me, and<br/>\nword of mouth is powerful...  Sorry young smiths on Errolis Marr, your on your<br/>\nown.  To bad things have to come to this.. I hate seeing people try to make<br/>\nbanded at 50skill wasting TONS of money.. and not really getting anywhere.. then<br/>\nspending hours on top of hours trying to sell gorgets and bracers.. (This is<br/>\nsomething I did in the begining cause I didn&#39;t know better) then a very friendly<br/>\nsmith pointed me in the right direction.  This is why in the begining I made it<br/>\na point to help smiths out...  Only take a couple bad apples....<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, I think most smiths here, that are actually thinking about the whole<br/>\npicture have about the same prices.  4-5pp for Gorgets or Bracers (Items that<br/>\ntake 1 sheet) to 17-20pp (items that take 3 sheets)  I think my prices are right<br/>\nin the middle.. I saw some smiths selling (2 sheet items) helms, belts etc for<br/>\n8-12.. I sell mine for 10.  It&#39;s pretty basic.. 1 sheet = 5pp 2sheets 10pp<br/>\n(mantles can go for 12p cause of failures) 3 sheets 15-20p depending on item and<br/>\nfailures.  (For faulires see point #1)<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, this is lastly.. I just wanted to ask a few other smiths out there that are<br/>\n140+ at least.. How do you see your success rates for Mantles, Cloaks, Leggings<br/>\nand Tunics?  Do you feel that when the last patch came out they changed the<br/>\nCloak %?  I used to fail alot on cloaks, now I hardly ever fail...  Even at 150+<br/>\nI fail on Masks, Belts and Leggings the most.. and Masks, and Belts are<br/>\nTrivial...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your time..<br/>\n<br/>\nDraxle Ironworks The disappointed Smith of Freeport...<br/>\nErrolis Marr Server.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Bradshaw wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;David Bradshaw&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Logain@...\">Logain@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Actually you know what?

If a worker at GM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;screws up and breaks a windshield, does the customer pay for that broken<br/>\n&gt; &gt;windshield and the cost that it takes to fix it? no.  When they buy the<br/>\n&gt; car,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;they are paying for what it takes to make that car.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;You think banded is low on some of your servers, you should see Cazic<br/>\n&gt; Thule.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;There is a guy in Freeport (obviously made and twinkled by a high level<br/>\n&gt; char<br/>\n&gt; &gt;just to be a smith) who sells banded dirt cheap.  I&quot;m talking from 2pp for<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;gorget to 9pp for a tunic or cloak.  Today at the Bazaar he had someone<br/>\n&gt; &gt;standing in teh area of the bazzar announceing banded for sell then<br/>\n&gt; refering<br/>\n&gt; &gt;them to the guy making it in freeport.  I went to the forge and watched for<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;bit, there was never less then 8-10 people lined up waiting on costum made<br/>\n&gt; &gt;banded.  He was there for hours makeing banded after banded item for dirt<br/>\n&gt; &gt;cheap.  He&#39;s making a killing on banded armor because he&#39;s found a way to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;sell a ton of it at dirt cheap prices.  and no, he&#39;s not taking a loss.  He<br/>\n&gt; &gt;has a VERY high smithing skill and only charges for what it costs to make<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;banded plus a little for the work.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Talthoron<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Personaly, my prices are more in your guys&#39;s range  Gorget 4pp clear to a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;tunic for 20pp.  yes, I can sell it for these prices but I don&#39;t make<br/>\n&gt; nearly<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the sales nor the money that the guy in freeport does.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;ONElist:  your connection to people who share your interests.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The EQ BlackSmithy Discussion Group<br/>\n&gt; &gt;List Administrator:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chade@...\">chade@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; The EQ BlackSmithy Discussion Group<br/>\n&gt; List Administrator:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chade@...\">chade@...</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
