It was suggested I switch over to lanterns as the<br/>\nsuccess rate was higher to make product<br/>\nand you could sell it. <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday I went the lantern route. My standard preparation is too take<br/>\ntwo small chests and put 50 water and<br/>\n100 ore in each. Then I produce metal bits out of this. (usually I get<br/>\nbetween 85-95 bits per round). This takes<br/>\ntime, and is tiresome, especially since you cannot stack in the forge,<br/>\nlet alone there is no easy way to pull one<br/>\npiece of a stack of twenty).<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter making all the bits, I then restock the water to an amount equal<br/>\nto the bits, and buy the same number of<br/>\nbottles (6 copper variety). I then buy lantern molds in 24 piece lots<br/>\n(161 copper per mold). If you succeed with a<br/>\nlantern you can sell it for 225 copper. The price of ore for me was 56<br/>\ncopper, water was 11 copper. I measure<br/>\neverything in copper.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy average cost per skill point making skewers was 23-25 gold per point.<br/>\nUsing the lantern approach (and<br/>\nincreases in skill) I was able to lower that to 17-21 gold per point.<br/>\nThe last batch I made gained my 6 skill points<br/>\nin 24 attempts and I made 23 lanters, meaning I paid about 6 gold for<br/>\neach of the last skill points. <br/>\n<br/>\nI now have 63 skill points in Blacksmithing. I am sure I can push it<br/>\nhigher with the lantern work, but honestly I just<br/>\ngot tired of doing this. I figure it took me on the order of 7 hours to<br/>\nraise my skill and this was good because<br/>\nmost of the time I was the only one at a forge. However the first day I<br/>\nwas there it took me awhile to find an<br/>\nempty forge in Freeport (having never been there)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo how should you do this yourself based on my experience?<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Have 5 chests/backpacks. (you want 3 open inventory slots for other<br/>\nthings). You should reserve the two top<br/>\nrows of your top backpack for your personal food/water ... (and its a<br/>\ngood place to store batches of 20bits)<br/>\n2. Make bits and never sell them. Make lots of them, until your blue in<br/>\nthe face. Usually I do 50 water and 100<br/>\nore per chest. Convert them all. Never sell them.<br/>\n3. Once over 20 skill. Buy 20 lantern molds and 20 bottles at a time.<br/>\nKeep the molds in your crates/backpacks.<br/>\nPut 20 water, 20 bits, and 20 bottles in your open inventory slots. Make<br/>\nlanterns, returning completed ones to the<br/>\nsame place you pulled the mold from.<br/>\n4. Rinse and repeat step 3 until out of bits or cash.<br/>\n5. Go to step 2 and repeat to here until your skill is what you want or<br/>\nyou have no cash.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow figure on averaging a cost of 20-25gp per point of skill. If you do<br/>\nthe lantern version throughout you should<br/>\nbe less than that (but remember your failures are pretty consistent at<br/>\nlower skill levels, hence the cost will be<br/>\nhigher to get through the 20s, and decrease afterward). The gains are<br/>\noften streaky as well, I did not gain a<br/>\nsingle point in one 24 lantern pass, only to gain 7 points in the next<br/>\nbatch. <br/>\n<br/>\nTwo other things.<br/>\n1. Don&#39;t try this during primetime.<br/>\n2. Don&#39;t do this on days you have enough time to do real adventuring.<br/>\n(thats why I am back home in Felwithe - its<br/>\nthe weekend and I may have some real time to play)</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
