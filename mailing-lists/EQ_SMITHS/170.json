I am currently at 69 smithing, I have a 50<br/>\nto 75% success rate on bracers and gorgets and slightly lower on boots and<br/>\nroughly 25% on helms and masks. I am still working off and on with skewers<br/>\nbut it has been a while since I have gotten any gain from them. So question<br/>\nis: From a strictly skill improvement point of view what is the best way to<br/>\nraising smithing at 69 skill. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again<br/>\nSilver</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
