I&#39;m fairly sure there is somewhere in Neriak to get them, but<br/>\nfor the life of me I couldn&#39;t find them, part of the reason is probably that<br/>\nI got<br/>\ntired of ducking through every door in that tiny little town.  I almost have<br/>\nmy<br/>\nfaction fixed in Highhold such that I could look there as well, but not<br/>\nquite.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, any help on where to find scaler/skewer molds in Neriak/Oggok/Grobb,<br/>\nand as for lanterns, they seem about as complicated to make as containers<br/>\nare... I found a great supply of the parts for containers, but buying 3<br/>\nparts per<br/>\ncontainer, putting them in the forge, adding a bit and a flask, then if I<br/>\nsucceed<br/>\nI lose an inventory slot, just seems way too tedious.  If i can find<br/>\nscaler/skewers,<br/>\nat least it&#39;s only 3 parts to combine that way, plus they fit in containers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nWauke - 20th TSK on EM</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
