They can wear the Ogres<br/>\nthough. As far as Overthere goes I wouldnt even go there because the prices<br/>\non everything are double and the last time i tryed the forge it was<br/>\nunusable. The last time i used Skewer molds was along time ago i purchased<br/>\nthem in freeport. You may need to have a friend purchase them for you. The<br/>\nonly bad thing about this is the amout of trips to get your skill up. If its<br/>\npossible the best solution is to get your faction up with freeport then go<br/>\nthere yourself. That or the Iskars **howerver thats spelled** town is a<br/>\noption. I know you can get good faction with them because my troll shadow<br/>\nknight can enter calibis as long as i avoid necros. =P<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                              Toadak **Da Big Bashers!**</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
