Or should I attempt something else<br/>\nto raise my skill?  Skewers seem to be the most cost effective....<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I run out of cash I will journey home,  spend a few days and come back with another<br/>\n100-200p to invest.  So far it seems to average 3pp per points... anyone else have some figures on this?<br/>\n<br/>\nArchonon  - Rathe - High Elf Paladin 17th Circle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.archonon.com/everquest\">http://www.archonon.com/everquest</a><br/>\n(if you want to see a lot of pictures - like 400 or so)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\nEagles may soar, but weasels don&#39;t get sucked into jet engines. <br/>\n<br/>\nwww.archonon.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
