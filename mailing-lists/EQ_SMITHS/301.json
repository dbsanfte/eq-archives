I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; looking for two level 16 wizards, one level 14-16 monk, one level 14-16 <br/>\n&gt; cleric and a level 14-16 magician or enchanter to go on a journey to upper <br/>\n&gt; guk. the point of this journey is to accumulate lots of money and magical <br/>\n&gt; items so we can make money to use to further our smithing skill. i am <br/>\n&gt; currently broke. this is on the fennin ro server, i am a level 15 warrior <br/>\n&gt; named Coil. I would prefer that you are a small to medium character because <br/>\n&gt; trolls barbarians and ogres can block passage ways. Also if anyone wants to <br/>\n&gt; give me money if they are high level and have too much i&#39;d accept it =) Email <br/>\n&gt; me if you are interested please, thanks.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ONElist:  your connection to online communities.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; The EQ BlackSmithy Discussion Group<br/>\n&gt; List Administrator:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chade@...\">chade@...</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}}
