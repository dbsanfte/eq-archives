What is the difference, if any,<br/>\nbetween a sewing kit purchased from a merchant and a sewing kit made by us?<br/>\nWhat would be really nice is if the sewing kit made by us improved the<br/>\nchance of a tailor suceeding.  Right now after patchwork it is almost<br/>\nimpossable to make the other types of leather based armor.  It would be<br/>\ngreat if we could make a kit that would help them out.  Of course this is<br/>\njust and idea.  I have no idea what the difference really is.<br/>\n<br/>\nMark<br/>\n<br/>\nAmazing $14,000 Opportunity.
