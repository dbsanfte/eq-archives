<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667779413">How do I make bits? How do I make studs?<br/>
<br/>
COME ON!!!<br/>
<br/>
Ok listen. I just started smiting. The first thing I did was buy the 2<br/>
books. Basic blacksmithing and advanced.... It tells you all the things<br/>
needed to make it. I have made bits, studs, and files.<br/>
<br/>
So how about some intelligent questions here. Grrr!!</div>
