<b>Subject:</b> Attempting to Power Smith this skill.... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-434585477">Well after crossing 17th with my HighElf Paladin I have decided to pickup smithing.<br/>
<br/>
I have journeyed to Freeport as it seems to have everything I need to get the job done.<br/>
<br/>
So,  starting with a skill of 10 I have advanced to 25,  making bits and turning it into <br/>
skewers.<br/>
<br/>
I have spent about 40p so far,  and have another 120p that I am willing to invest.<br/>
<br/>
My question is,  do I just keep attempt skewers?  Or should I attempt something else<br/>
to raise my skill?  Skewers seem to be the most cost effective....<br/>
<br/>
Once I run out of cash I will journey home,  spend a few days and come back with another<br/>
100-200p to invest.  So far it seems to average 3pp per points... anyone else have some figures on this?<br/>
