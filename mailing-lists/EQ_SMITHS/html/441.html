<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834105235">Yes most definatly lanterns. Then scewers. I watched<br/>
my brother sink 80 plat into his skill and start<br/>
making banded at skill rank 80 in the space of 2 days.<br/>
And he even made very few studs, just went on into<br/>
steel boing because of the time factor. Of course he<br/>
does have a Wisdom of 100 and a Int of 105.  <br/>

&gt; I just made 40 in smithing.  I tried to research<br/>
&gt; what to do next, but I am finding conficting<br/>
&gt; information.  Should I be making lanterns or skewers<br/>
&gt; now?  Or should I be making something else?<br/>
