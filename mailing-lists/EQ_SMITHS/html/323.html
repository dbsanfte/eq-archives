<b>Subject:</b> Steel Boning <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2079536398">I just started making steel boning.  What can it be used for?  A smith<br/>
told me you can make armour with it.  Ok if I can make armour with it<br/>
where would I find a book that descirbes the armour I can make?  I took<br/>
up smithing because 1. I can make my own armour 2.  Craft weapons.  3.<br/>
I can make magical weapons and armour.  Does anyone out there know of<br/>
any more smithing books?  I have the two basic books.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
