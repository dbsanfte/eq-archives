<div id="ygrps-yiv-1740776611">After 68 it seems we are forced to try (and fail a lot) at Skewers.   I<br/>
spent around 20pp the other day to get 3 skill points on Skewers.  Kind of<br/>
expensive.  I&#39;ll be glad to get away from Skewers and those dang metal bits<br/>
though.  :)<br/>

Skewers just aren&#39;t fun. I was having the same problem and just switched to<br/>
lanterns. My skill started going up frequently and I also get some return on<br/>
my<br/>
money for smithing. According to the posts I got back today, lanterns will<br/>
take<br/>
you to 68 skill so .... why not do lanterns instead of skewers until you hit<br/>
68?<br/>
<br/>
By the way Grak, how was the pottery skill? I heard a master potter telling<br/>
me<br/>
he was quite profitable now and had been since about 75 in skill or so.<br/>

&gt; I have found that it took me at least 10 skewers to get 1 point of skill.<br/>
&gt; One time I went through 3 backpacks of skewers and did not get one point.<br/>
&gt; Then on my next run I got 3 points in 3 tries =) I am a master in 3 trade<br/>
&gt; skill now, and smithing is by FAR the hardest to get up.  If I had to make<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; choice I would not learn to smith again.<br/>
