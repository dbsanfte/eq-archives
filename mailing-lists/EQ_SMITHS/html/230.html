I have to say I disagree with the way you feel.  We all bought and paid for <br/>
a game that we love playing.  We all pay money each month to play this game <br/>
online.  As a programmer myself I feel as if the bugs should have been <br/>
worked out by now.  I have gone through this same routine with the guys at <br/>
Verant and can say it is the worst customer service that I have ever <br/>
received.  I sat online for 4 hours waiting for a GM to help me out and <br/>
still no one came.  Sure there are a few hundred people saying they lost <br/>
things when they really didn&#39;t lose anything at all..<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still waiting for an email regarding a video problem that I&#39;m having. I <br/>
switched video cards and can&#39;t get the game to work properly.  I&#39;ve been <br/>
waiting for that email for 2 1/2 weeks now....<br/>
<br/>
When game companies release a game they should make sure that the bugs are <br/>
pretty much gone after beta testing.  Sure there are going to be problems, <br/>
but then these companies should have the support needed to  help customers <br/>
out..<br/>
<br/>
IMO<br/>
<br/>
Thx<br/>

	I know how you feel, but I don&#39;t have a solution for you.  I have lost<br/>
a character before on the Karan server when it was crashing all of the<br/>
time.<br/>
Lost a level 12 char with full banded.  Luckly for me I had some friends<br/>
that<br/>
were able to get me some patchwork armor and a mino axe and worked my<br/>
way back<br/>
to where I was.<br/>
