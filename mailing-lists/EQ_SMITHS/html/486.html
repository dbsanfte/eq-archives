<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234938605">Thanks.  A day or so after I posted I found a good trivial list at<br/>

Now I know why those mantles and cloaks have been such bears!<br/>
<br/>
It looks like it&#39;s time for Shaepley Armor to start holding periodic<br/>
sales on mantles, gauntlets, and leggings, to keep the inventory<br/>
moving.  My skill is now up to 136, and I must be one of the wealthier<br/>
level 9 players on Tholuxe Paells.  ;)  I was visiting Freeport for a<br/>
bit yesterday and saw someone selling Fine Steel armor already.  Ack! <br/>
the competition!  &lt;Grin&gt;<br/>

&gt; Hello Shaepe<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      You should keep doing banded untill 175 then start on plate.<br/>
Plan to<br/>
&gt; spend about 1500pp or so unless your selling it all to players.  I<br/>
did<br/>
&gt; Mantle till 135 then gauntlets till 168 last of all cloak to 175.<br/>
You still<br/>
&gt; fail quite a bit at plate but not as much as you would if you<br/>
started lower.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; My question to you all is, now what?  I thought about making<br/>
forged<br/>
&gt; &gt; weapons (already trivial), but was disappointed to find the cost<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; making the weapons (without failure) was more than what I could<br/>
sell<br/>
&gt; &gt; them for.  I want to be able to make the new fine plate armor, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t know what I should do to prepare for that.  What skill level<br/>
&gt; &gt; should I achieve before then?  How do I get that level? (more<br/>
banded?)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Are there items I should be collecting now that I will need later?<br/>
