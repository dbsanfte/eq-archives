<div id="ygrps-yiv-187606541">I am pretty new to this list and I am sorry if this has been asked before but <br/>
I am a VERY new tailor/smith and I am wondering at about what skill does it <br/>
take to become pretty good at making the studs I need for studded armor?  And <br/>
if you could also help me I am wondering what ingredients it takes to make <br/>
those studs? <br/>
<br/>
and once again I am very sorry if you all have heard this questions a hundred <br/>
times<br/>
<br/>
new smith,<br/>
