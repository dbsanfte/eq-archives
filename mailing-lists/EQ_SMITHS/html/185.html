<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-772066478">Hi, I am a skill 91 blacksmith,  I have been making and selling the lower <br/>
lvl banded items since around skill 80.  What I am wondering is what is a <br/>
good practice mold to get my skill above 100?  Will skewers allow me to go <br/>
that high?  If not I would like to find one that will.  Money is not that <br/>
big of a deal at the moment, I just think there has got to be a mold that <br/>
uses bits not sheets that can get me above 100.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
