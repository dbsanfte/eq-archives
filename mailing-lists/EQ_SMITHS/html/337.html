&lt;&lt; Just want to say, when we are finally able to make plate (this isn&#39;t in<br/>
 the near future, mind you. Tailoring is probably next to be worked on<br/>
 after make poison, and then probably tinkering or alchemy from what I&#39;ve<br/>
 read all around), we should only sell for 5 to 10 plat less than the<br/>
 magical plates are sold for. We can&#39;t sell for NPC plate prices (people<br/>
 would just buy magical plate) but I really don&#39;t want to shoot myself in<br/>
 the foot and have the same thing happen with plate as it did to banded.<br/>
 Please, no flames, I know some of you will only want 10 plat profit per<br/>
 piece, that&#39;s your right, and this is mine. This is what I will be doing<br/>
 and I would hope if you&#39;re concerned over smithing, please do the same.<br/>
 Plate will NOT be cheaper to make oneself (not only the 150 plat it<br/>
 takes to get to banded, but all the time selling banded to get to making<br/>
 plate), so we don&#39;t have to worry about that happening. Just gotta be<br/>
 competitive with magical plates. Again, please no flames, I&#39;m terribly<br/>
 sick of them, and I will not respond. Please, if you&#39;re on my side,<br/>
 don&#39;t respond to any flames either. Let the baby have his/her bottle.<br/>

We are going to have serious problems with selling plate on mature servers.  <br/>
As you said, it will be a long time till they implement plate into the game.  <br/>
Already, very very few people buy store plate.  Most people move from banded, <br/>
to bronze, to magic.  I only see a market for steel if it is significantly <br/>
cheaper than magic and only slightly more expensive than bronze. (This <br/>
assumption is based on plate being exactly the same as store plate) If plate <br/>
was available from PC&#39;s from the beginning, then we would have a thriving <br/>
market.  Since deflation has already set in on most, if not all, mature <br/>
servers, it will be hard to start selling a high priced median item for much <br/>
of a profit (at least as much as it will take to get good at it).  We should <br/>
all pray to the EQ ghods for item decay ;-)<br/>
