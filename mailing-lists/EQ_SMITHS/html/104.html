&gt; There are several classes that CAN&#39;T wear banded.  So there is a definite<br/>
&gt; market for the studded and reinforced leather.  But, as mentioned before, if<br/>
&gt; the studded isn&#39;t any better than leather, it is more of a skill-builder<br/>
&gt; than anything.  I imagine sales on reinforced would be quite nice, however.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A freind of mine is a Ranger/Tailor and they have had extensive talks about<br/>
studed/reenforced on the Ranger mailing list he is on,  He and I are also in<br/>
bussiness selling the stuff in the Kelethin area (I supply the studs, we<br/>
both go kill the puma&#39;s for the pelts, and he makes the armour) from what I<br/>
have been told the ac is a little better on some pieces of armour, where<br/>
studed and reinforced become usefull is in their absourbtion.  as an example<br/>
say in leather you get hit for 8 points of dammage the exact same hit in<br/>
studed armour would do 6 damm and 4 damm in reinforced.  This of course is<br/>
just an example of the numbers which will probally vary.... because of this<br/>
extra absourbtion and better AC studed/reinforced is well worth it for the<br/>
people who can&#39;t use better.</div>
