<div id="ygrps-yiv-221371818">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I am a level 93 smith at the moment.  I am trying<br/>
to level up but it is going really slow.  Banded<br/>
bracers and gorgets are not trivial yet so i keep<br/>
making them.  The problem is that i spent like <br/>
twenty plat making bracers with no skill advancement.<br/>
Is there other items i should be making instead<br/>
of the bracers and gorgets?? Something cheaper to <br/>
make??  Also..does anybody know if we can make chain<br/>
mail?? and if so..is it a better quality item??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
