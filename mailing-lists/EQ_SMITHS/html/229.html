	I know how you feel, but I don&#39;t have a solution for you.  I have lost<br/>
a character before on the Karan server when it was crashing all of the<br/>
time. <br/>
Lost a level 12 char with full banded.  Luckly for me I had some friends<br/>
that <br/>
were able to get me some patchwork armor and a mino axe and worked my<br/>
way back<br/>
to where I was.  <br/>

&gt; I feel as though I&#39;m getting the raw end of the deal from Verant. I lost 10<br/>
&gt; P and an Opalline earring (paid 25 P for it) off an alt character, due to<br/>
&gt; yet another bug/glitch with the boat. I&#39;ve done everything I can possibly<br/>
&gt; think of, (/tell, /shout, /petition, /bug, /feedback, and email directly to<br/>
&gt; a GM at the suggestion of a Guide) to get this equipment restored. And I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; done them all numerous times and still nothing!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One Guide told me that a request to have my equipment restored had been<br/>
&gt; forwarded, and that it would take 2 days at most to get it restored (now<br/>
&gt; going onto day 4); quite truthfully, I&#39;m more upset at losing the opalline<br/>
&gt; earring than any of the other gear (it being the hardest and most expensive<br/>
&gt; to replace); and still nothing has been said or done about it - no email, no<br/>
&gt; /tell&#39;s, no nothing in any way shape or form to explain what the holdup is.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In fact, all I keep getting from most of the Guides about anything, is that<br/>
&gt; &quot;I&#39;m too busy right now. Please /petition it.&quot; If I petition one more time<br/>
&gt; and get no response, I&#39;m going to scream! As a matter of fact, I still have<br/>
&gt; a petition in queue right now in the queue of my primary character and the<br/>
&gt; alt that lost the equipment, and guess what, it&#39;s still not answered!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What I&#39;d like, is for any Verant employee/cohort to sit up and take notice,<br/>
&gt; or for anyone who has an idea about how to get this situation taken care of<br/>
&gt; to submit their suggestions via post or email, so that I can get this<br/>
&gt; straightened out once and for all!!! I&#39;m sick to death of hearing &quot;I&#39;m too<br/>
&gt; busy&quot; or &quot;It&#39;s not our policy&quot; or &quot;Sorry. It&#39;s against policy to do that&quot;.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve done everything I can short of calling Verant&#39;s support hotline, like<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m supposed to! Are you GM&#39;s and Guides there just to create lag? Or for<br/>
&gt; once will you do what it is that you&#39;re s there to do? Customer support!<br/>
&gt; ****(I&#39;m not holding my breath!!!!!!!!!!!)****<br/>
