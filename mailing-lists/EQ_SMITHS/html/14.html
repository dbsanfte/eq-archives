<div id="ygrps-yiv-894172142">Are there advanced books regarding armor manufacture available?  I&#39;ve got enough skill so that sharpening weapons and making metal bits is trivial, and want to know whats next.  Also, I&#39;ve noticed it takes quite a bit of coin to aquire the ore, water, etc. needed to make armor. In the end, is it more economical to make my own armor (chain or plate), or to buy it from a PC?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!</div>
