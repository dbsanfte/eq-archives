<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-283090527">Hi new here. I trained to level 20 at my guild and now it wont let me train<br/>
any more at smithing. it say now &quot;you neeed to davance this skill in the<br/>
feaild.&quot; Well I am a oger at level 5... In my home land I have a forge, but<br/>
no one sells a smithing book or molds. Doh.. how silly is that. maybe I will<br/>
become a poter and make my own. Well till then what is the closest city I<br/>
can train in my trade? molds and smithing books being the keys here!!!<br/>
