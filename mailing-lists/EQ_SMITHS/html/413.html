<div id="ygrps-yiv-2107281118">Speaking of what to make at what skill....<br/>
<br/>
My skill is 50 now, I tried making Skewers the other day and just wasted my <br/>
plat.. out of about 40 attempts not one imp, and maybe 10 skewers. Is there <br/>
something less difficult to make at this lv?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&lt;&lt; Make skewers to get your skill up, these are good until skill 115, <br/>
&gt;although<br/>
&gt;  around skill 110, I was good enough at making banded that I stopped <br/>
&gt;advancing<br/>
&gt;  my skill and just made armor for sale.  I believe after skewers you can<br/>
&gt;  make skewing kits up to skill 175. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yes...you will save money in the long run bringing your skill to 115 with<br/>
&gt;skewers... Then...if you want and have a little extra money...and a bit of<br/>
&gt;extra time...Sewing Kits will bring your skill to 135...to get to 175, <br/>
&gt;you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;need to make banded...the problem is, is that only banded Cloaks, Mantles <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;Leggings are not trivial at 135.<br/>
