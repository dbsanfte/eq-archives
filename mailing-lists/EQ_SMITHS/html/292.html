<div id="ygrps-yiv-69824817">Hi all<br/>
Ok a lot about prices. I tend to advertise when I&#39;m in town or answer if<br/>
someone asks. I sell average (I think) for my server but sometimes will drop<br/>
if the customer is the same class. I generally sell bracers for 4 or 5pp up<br/>
to tunics at 17pp. The worst I&#39;ve had is some guy who wanted leggings - he<br/>
said I sucked and they were only 10pp in freeport. Guess who got put on<br/>
ignore and will never get anything from me. Another I put on ignore would<br/>
kept hassling me to come to him to make his stuff. Considering I was hunting<br/>
in Guk and he was in Qeynos....<br/>
<br/>
I dont make gorgets. Being around Qeynos everyone has a blackburrow collar<br/>
so no point.<br/>
10 per mask, 10 per helmet, 5 per bracer, 10 per sleeves, 12 per mantle,<br/>
15 per mail, 20 per cloak, 8 per belt, 15 per leggings, 8 per boots.<br/>
<br/>
If those prices are too cheap for my colleagues on Karana I will hapily<br/>
raise the, I dont really need money from smithing at the moment but I dont<br/>
want to cheapen the market even further<br/>
