<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919489380">The closest place I know of that you can get molds is in West Karana.  If<br/>
you follow the river there is a Barbarian village and you can get all of the<br/>
molds there.  But if you are a Barbarian you are better off wearing Medium<br/>
armor.  Its lighter.  If you are a Troll or Ogre then you will have to get<br/>
them in one of those cities. I don&#39;t know where they are there.<br/>
