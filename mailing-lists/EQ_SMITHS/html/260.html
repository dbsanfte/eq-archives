<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339553571">What I did first was to spend a few training points on it.  Then I sharpened <br/>
rusty weapons until about level 25.  After that I started making studs.  That <br/>
is as far as I&#39;ve gotten.  I don&#39;t know about Qeynos, but I know you can buy <br/>
sharpening stones and ore in North Freeport at Groflah&#39;s Forge.  Hope you find <br/>
this helpful.<br/>

&gt;All I want to know is what goes into making your chances alot better, i.e.<br/>
&gt;INT, STR, DEX, etc. Also what exactly should I do at each skill, 1-10,<br/>
&gt;11-20, etc. Also how much should I spend and where I can buy all the<br/>
&gt;materials. Right now I&#39;m in Qeynos but I can get ore from a friend. I&#39;m a<br/>
&gt;level 13 Barbarian Warrior on the Bristlebain Server called Kinor, the next<br/>
&gt;time I&#39;ll be on though is Saturday afternoon. So if anyone can reply to this<br/>
&gt;and tell me as presise as you can to tell me what to do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanx so much,<br/>
