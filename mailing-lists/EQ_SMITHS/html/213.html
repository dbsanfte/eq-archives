<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089358442">I can get to level 26 in smithing pretty easily. After this I have heard a <br/>
few ways to raise skills here. Skewers, (skalers?), or large lanterns. I <br/>
want to know which way is the most effective but does not cost so much <br/>
money. I hear all kinds of differant opinions, and I just wanted some <br/>
information. If someone on Xegony could give me character a /tell (Irontoe), <br/>
or just send me an e-mail back.<br/>
