<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004420144">If you&#39;re going to stick to this concept of yours, then I have a few points of<br/>
advice:<br/>
1 - NEVER buy any CD for more than 10 cents. They&#39;re just shiny pieces of plastic<br/>
that only cost 10 cents to produce. Since you don&#39;t pay for any overhead and are<br/>
simply sticking to cost, this is the most you should ever let yourself pay for a<br/>
CD of any kind.<br/>
<br/>
2 - Never ever rent anything or visit a video arcade. You aren&#39;t actually buying<br/>
anything, and therefore aren&#39;t aquiring these precious materials that are all<br/>
anybody ever charges for. If you don&#39;t get materials, they don&#39;t lose materials,<br/>
so they should charge nothing because they are losing nothing. If you pay more<br/>
than nothing, you are again violating your own principles.<br/>
<br/>
3 - Don&#39;t buy gas for your car. Don&#39;t even buy a car! The gas for your car is<br/>
sold in bulk, and therefore at discount. When you buy gas from a gas station, it<br/>
has gone through several middlemen who add a little to the price each time. Since<br/>
you could buy petroleum from the middle east and process it yourself for no more<br/>
than cost, you shouldn&#39;t pay the price a gas station will charge because it has<br/>
been marked up several times. Same goes for cars. No car company that I know of<br/>
mines the metal it needs and then shapes it into the parts needed for the car.<br/>
This again means middlemen and markups, so if you want a car, you need to go mine<br/>
all the materials yourself, process even more petroleum into the plastics needed,<br/>
build your own engine and any other moving parts, and put it all together<br/>
yourself. This way you make sure to not pay anything more than cost of materials.<br/>
<br/>
4 - Refuse paychecks from your place of employment. The only things ever paid for<br/>
are material costs, time and work aren&#39;t included. Seeing as your place of<br/>
employment should only charge for materials, and you want to support your place<br/>
of employment because without them you wouldn&#39;t have a job, you should try and<br/>
help by not requiring a paycheck. Anything they pay you comes out of the owner&#39;s<br/>
pockets, because the consumer can&#39;t be charged. You might even want to pay the<br/>
company to work for them, as that would lighten the load on the owner&#39;s pockets<br/>
from all the employees who DO require payment.<br/>
<br/>
5 - If you ever get into a legal battle, don&#39;t hire an attorney. The paper they<br/>
used on your case does not cost what they charge you. Since they are charging<br/>
more than cost, you must refuse to pay them and therefore boycott their services.<br/>
You can represent yourself for cost.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I know this is all rather ridiculous, but that&#39;s what things would be like<br/>
if you really followed your ideas here. It&#39;s almost as bad as saying &#39;don&#39;t use<br/>
plastic, they charge too much!&#39;. Well... where would you be without plastic?<br/>
Think along those lines... where would you be without business? If everybody<br/>
charged for cost and nothing more, employees wouldn&#39;t get paid and all businesses<br/>
would eventually collapse because any failures they made over the years would add<br/>
up. Since they only charge what it costs them, they don&#39;t make any money in their<br/>
business so everything comes from their pockets. Since other businesses can&#39;t<br/>
afford to pay employees, there is nowhere else to work to gain any money.<br/>
Timber!! There goes business as we know it.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, reconsider what you&#39;re saying here. It makes absolutely no sense. We<br/>
all know EQ isn&#39;t a real economy (it&#39;s downright terrible). Actually, it&#39;s weaker<br/>
than a real economy. You see what charging for cost does to a real economy, can<br/>
you imagine what it would do to EQ&#39;s? It would be nearly irreversible. I can&#39;t<br/>
begin to explain the damages your ideas will cause if they are practiced by all.<br/>

&gt; Fleetwood, the top maker of moter homes and RV&#39;s, Pella, the number one maker<br/>
&gt; of window, GM (which has been mentioned) all will tell you the same thing,<br/>
&gt; Screw ups, inspections, the people working in the office, the people who<br/>
&gt; drive the fork lefts carting material all day....all the work they do and<br/>
&gt; much work that others do is NOT what the costumer buys.  The customer buys<br/>
&gt; what it takes to make the product and that is all.  They are not paying for<br/>
&gt; the time it takes to train John Doe, not for the time it takes for someone to<br/>
&gt; fix or check his work. They do not pay for the people to run the accounts,<br/>
&gt; they do not pay for the guy to drive around on a forklift.  Would you?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When you buy something, do you want to pay for all that extra that had<br/>
&gt; nothing to do with building your car?  You can say it did have something to<br/>
&gt; do with your car, but the fact of the matter it isn&#39;t.  Efficency is the key.<br/>
&gt;  If the people doing the paid for work are good enough, then THEY pay the<br/>
&gt; cost of all that excess.  I don&#39;t charge people for me learning to smith, I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t charge for failure rates.  I charge for my work and the matrials needed<br/>
&gt; to make the given item.  I have about the same prices.  I guess I just value<br/>
&gt; my work more then you do yours.<br/>
