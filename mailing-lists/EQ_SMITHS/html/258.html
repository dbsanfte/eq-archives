<div id="ygrps-yiv-1312464841">All I want to know is what goes into making your chances alot better, i.e. <br/>
INT, STR, DEX, etc. Also what exactly should I do at each skill, 1-10, <br/>
11-20, etc. Also how much should I spend and where I can buy all the <br/>
materials. Right now I&#39;m in Qeynos but I can get ore from a friend. I&#39;m a <br/>
level 13 Barbarian Warrior on the Bristlebain Server called Kinor, the next <br/>
time I&#39;ll be on though is Saturday afternoon. So if anyone can reply to this <br/>
and tell me as presise as you can to tell me what to do.<br/>
<br/>
Thanx so much,<br/>
