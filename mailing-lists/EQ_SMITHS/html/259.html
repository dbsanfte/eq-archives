<div id="ygrps-yiv-208397296">A really good way to get rusty weapons to sharpen for skill is offer to <br/>
sharpen rusty weapons for free.  You&#39;ll be surprised at the number of weapons <br/>
you&#39;ll have to sharpen then<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for what abilities effect smithing, I have only heard rumors.  The rumors <br/>
I heard are that STR and DEX are facters in sucess, and INT is used for <br/>
gaining skill.  Just a rumor I hear, could be complete BS for all I know.<br/>
