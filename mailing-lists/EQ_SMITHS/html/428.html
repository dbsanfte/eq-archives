<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733875064"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; needle and thimble molds are right outside of east freeport.  Go out east<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks.  It never occured to me to check outside the South Gate or Northern<br/>
Ro.  I did scour all 3 Freeport zones and East and West Commonlands without<br/>
finding them.  Luckily, I discovered the perfect place to make sewing kits<br/>
in High Pass Hold (in the Serpent&#39;s Supply).  I have finally maxed my skill<br/>
out for anything except banded cloaks (level 175, here I come).</div>
