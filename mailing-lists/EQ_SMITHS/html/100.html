<div id="ygrps-yiv-43362238">Studded leather is worth only the skill points you earn by making it.  It has the same AC as regular leather, and costs WAY more to make than you&#39;d pay for regular leather.  BUT, the benefit comes when you get high enough skill to make reinforced leather.  Reinforced leather should be the best armor that classes restricted to leather can wear.  Thus, you could name your price, once you were actually able to make it.<br/>

    Is it worth making studded leather armor?  I have never seen studded leather in any form, and I have seen websites that say studded leather has the same AC as leather, and I have seen sites that say studded leather is between leather and chain.  My character Cassin (Povar), is both a tailor and a smith (and not very good at either!), so I was wondering if this would be a smart endeavour.</div>
