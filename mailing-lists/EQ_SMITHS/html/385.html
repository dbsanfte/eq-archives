<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-632554837">Was wondering if someone would be so kind as to post/repost a complete <br/>
listing of items you can create/make with blacksmithing, the approximate <br/>
level they become trivial, the minimum skill level you&#39;d recommend before <br/>
trying to create/make them, and the approximate resale value to other <br/>
players. I know this was posted once before, but don&#39;t know what happened to <br/>
my copy - (I guess that&#39;s what I get for using a free email service). Thanks <br/>
in advance!</div>
