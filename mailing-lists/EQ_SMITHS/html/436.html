<b>Subject:</b> Trivial Levels <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1456880269">Someone told me to make scalars (files) from skill level 20 to 40. So I ran and<br/>
bout all the file molds I could carry only to find that they were trivial to me. I<br/>
had to sell all the molds back to the NPC and make studs. This brings up the<br/>
question, is there a list of objects and their trivial level? Also, what is the<br/>
best thing to make at 23? I think my choices are:<br/>
<br/>
Skewers<br/>
studs<br/>
lanterns<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
I would think that studs might be good if they can be sold to players, but I would<br/>
have no idea what studs would sell for.<br/>
