<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260330669"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Also, at the bazaar<br/>
&gt; Saturday night, someone was selling a book that allowed smithed to make<br/>
&gt; bronze armor with skill over 200 using bronze metal.  I forget the name<br/>
&gt; of the book and I did not have the 400p that the guy<br/>
&gt; was asking for.  Does anyone have information on this book?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most likely you ran across one of the scammers out there who is trying to<br/>
make a few bucks off any scam they can.  I seriously doubt this book had any<br/>
validity what-so-ever.  But hey, if it did, great.<br/>
