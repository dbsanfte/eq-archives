&gt; Here&#39;s is something I just discovered, in terms of<br/>
&gt; making and selling banded. People just don&#39;t give a<br/>
&gt; shit how long it took you too make it, or how long it<br/>
&gt; took you to reach that skill. They could care less. If<br/>
&gt; you want their money, then you sell it cheap. This<br/>
&gt; really sucks I know, but that&#39;s why you can&#39;t sell it<br/>
&gt; as much as you would like. People just suck.<br/>
