<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107789509">Well, there are new items for smiths to make since this mornings patch.<br/>
Time for people to collate our info on where, what and how much.  So far, I<br/>
have uncovered 3 new items we can make.  The molds are available from a<br/>
vendor near the entrance to Kaladim, in Butcher Block.  The new items are:<br/>
<br/>
Forged Morning Star, 1HB, 8 damage, 38 Delay<br/>
1 water flask + 1 metal sheet + Spiked Ball mold + Hilt Mold<br/>
<br/>
Forged 2 Handed sword, 2HS, 12 damage, 44 delay<br/>
1 water flask + 1 metal sheet + Pommel mold + Hilt mold + Heavy Steel Blade<br/>
mold<br/>
<br/>
Forged Bastard Sword, 1HS, 7damage, 33delay<br/>
1 water flask + 1 metal sheet + Pommel mold + Hilt mold + Dual-edge Blade<br/>
Mold<br/>
<br/>
The cost of the molds from me (I have high charisma and the dwarves con<br/>
amiable to me):<br/>
<br/>
Dual-edge Blade Mold 	1p9g1s8c<br/>
Heavy Steel Blade Mold 	3p8g3s6c<br/>
Spiked Ball Mold 		2p5g5s7c<br/>
Hilt Mold 			 6g3s9c<br/>
Pommel Mold 		 6g3s9c<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These are pretty good weapons except for one glaring problem, they can&#39;t hit<br/>
magic only creatures.  So far, the response to them on E Marr has been<br/>
deafening silence, hehe.  I have made one of each of these and auctioned<br/>
them in the Freeport area.  No one showed the slightest interest in them<br/>
except other smiths wanting to know how they were made.  IMHO, great<br/>
twinking weapons but prolly not viable to produce unless there is a way to<br/>
make them magic (then tons of people will want them).  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be<br/>
able to sell any of them for the 8 to 10pp they are worth.  What do you guys<br/>
think?<br/>
<br/>
So, anyone notice any other new items we can make, particularly new armor<br/>
(or know when or if new armor for us will be implemented).  Any other<br/>
locations for the molds?  Any thoughts on what we should charge for these<br/>
things if I&#39;m wrong about the demand for them?</div>
