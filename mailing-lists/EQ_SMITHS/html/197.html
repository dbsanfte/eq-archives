<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693730801">I have found that it took me at least 10 skewers to get 1 point of skill.  <br/>
One time I went through 3 backpacks of skewers and did not get one point.  <br/>
Then on my next run I got 3 points in 3 tries =) I am a master in 3 trade <br/>
skill now, and smithing is by FAR the hardest to get up.  If I had to make a <br/>
choice I would not learn to smith again.<br/>
