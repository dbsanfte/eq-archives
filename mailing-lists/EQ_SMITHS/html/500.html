<b>Subject:</b> FS Plate Pricing questions (I have alot of them) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175286976">I am on the Fennin server, so smiths from my server please let me know what<br/>
the trend is for our home. I do not want to cause waves, get ripped, or over<br/>
charge. =)<br/>
<br/>
Is it safe to charge double or tripple the cost of 1 attempt to make for<br/>
each item you can make?<br/>
ie.<br/>
1 MQ sheet = 21p with high Cha.<br/>
Bracer Mold = 7p (I think, can&#39;t remember exactly)<br/>
* Padding not worth adding in as a cost<br/>
So sale price = 60p or 90p (or more?)<br/>
<br/>
Or does FS Plate sell by the AC?<br/>
ie.<br/>
10 plat per AC point<br/>
<br/>
How does being Dyed effect this price?<br/>
<br/>
When selling a &quot;Full Set&quot; of dyed FS Plate, is this only the visual pieces,<br/>
or dyed visual pieces and un-dyed non-visual pieces?<br/>
<br/>
Does the color effect sale price? If so, how?<br/>
ie<br/>
black (6k visual only) &gt; red (5.5k visual only) &gt; blue (5k visual only) &gt;<br/>
yellow (3.5k Visual only)... or all colors reguardless are 4-6k depending on<br/>
server...<br/>
<br/>
Resin is roughly 6 plat per, so Resin 3 (neon from what I have seen) is the<br/>
most expensive... how do most of you add this in to the price?<br/>
ie.<br/>
Add 20p(resin 1), 40p (resin 2), 60p(resin 3)for each piece?<br/>
<br/>
Does Size effect price?<br/>
ie.<br/>
I had to go to Halas/Grobb to get the molds, so is more... (?)<br/>
<br/>
A &quot;full set&quot; of non-dyed (all pieces) sells for how much?<br/>
Assuming no failures on ore conversion, and making ore into folded sheets,<br/>
base cost of ore for making 1 of each piece is 511 plat.<br/>
BP mold is 22 plat, Bracer Mold is around 7 plat, everything else is in<br/>
between. Average 14p per mold and you get 182 plat for molds.<br/>
Total: 693 plat to make 1 complete suit of FSp Plate. Round to 700 to make<br/>
the math simple...<br/>
With the above sale suggestion, sale price: 1400 or 2100 plat. This even<br/>
close on most servers?<br/>
<br/>
And finally, what type of demand is there for FS Plate?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I got into Smithing mainly because I wanted to be able to twink my SK with<br/>
blood red FS plate, and to be able to make things my guild needed. To get to<br/>
173 in smithing, I spent less plat than I believe it would have cost me to<br/>
buy what I made, and I made a set for my wife&#39;s cleric to. So I know in the<br/>
end, I saved alot of plat. Plus, later if i want a new color, I can do it<br/>
relatively easy. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all your help, and for reading this far.<br/>
