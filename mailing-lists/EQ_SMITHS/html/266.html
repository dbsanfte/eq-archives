<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623547811">I just read someone selling banded gorgets for 8pp and banded bracers for<br/>
6pp or something like that?  Selling 2 banded bracers for 14pp????  Is this<br/>
right???<br/>
<br/>
I try selling banded bracers on my server (Bertox) for 4pp each, 7pp a pair,<br/>
and people tell me they will pay me 2pp for them!  I tell &#39;em ta flip off,<br/>
but still.<br/>
<br/>
All of us blacksmiths need to figure out a SET price for banded.  The norm<br/>
that we ALL will follow.  This way, no matter where you go, all will KNOW<br/>
the minimums to banded.  They can still bid over it if there is a &quot;bidding<br/>
war&quot;, but we all need to have the same prices.<br/>
<br/>
Lemme know.<br/>
