<div id="ygrps-yiv-2109703141">Level 19 character, completely new to smithing, seeks advice on what items<br/>
he make. I can&#39;t remember right away what my skill level is at(very low,<br/>
only the max a half elf ranger can be trained to by the guildmaster in<br/>
Surefall Glade), but cleaning rusty weapons does not raise skill. Can<br/>
someone tell me where I can find flasks of water, and is it possible to use<br/>
bottles of water instead? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all</div>
