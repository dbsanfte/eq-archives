<div id="ygrps-yiv-2069602698">That&#39;d be great if Reinforced weren&#39;t more expensive to make than Banded.<br/>
<br/>
Cost on Reinforced is like 6400 for a tunic.  (Assuming you&#39;re buying the<br/>
boning, like most tailors who are skilled enough to take a stab at<br/>
reinforced.)<br/>
<br/>
Reinforced is useful to those who cannot wear anything greater than<br/>
leather.  It&#39;s not someything you buy for your Barbarian warrior.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve yet to see any either, but it seems like there would be a good market<br/>
&gt; for studded and bonned armor for those people who can&#39;t quite yet afford<br/>
&gt; banded and already have leather....assuming that the AC is actually better.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Subject: [EQ_SMITHS] Studs and studded leather armor...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Is it worth making studded leather armor?  I have never seen<br/>
&gt; &gt; studded leather in any form, and I have seen websites that say<br/>
&gt; &gt; studded leather has the same AC as leather, and I have seen sites<br/>
&gt; &gt; that say studded leather is between leather and chain.  My<br/>
&gt; &gt; character Cassin (Povar), is both a tailor and a smith (and not<br/>
&gt; &gt; very good at either!), so I was wondering if this would be a<br/>
&gt; &gt; smart endeavour.<br/>
