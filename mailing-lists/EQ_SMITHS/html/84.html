&gt; On that note, what is everyone selling patchwork for as well?  General<br/>
&gt; pricing info so we all know what to charge. ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I sell patchwork at 1 gold per AC point value of the armour piece.<br/>
That is a little cheaper than what a merchant charges when<br/>
he/she happens to have a piece and less than double the amount that the<br/>
same merchant offers for the piece so I don&#39;t think I&#39;m too greedy.<br/>
<br/>
Why?<br/>
* It isn&#39;t normally sold by merchants.<br/>
* Even when it is it&#39;s cheaper per AC point than cloth but offers better<br/>
protection.<br/>
* Leather is usually only 1 AC point better than patchwork but costs at least 4<br/>
gold per AC point...<br/>
<br/>
You may even think my prices are too cheap? Are they?<br/>

Let&#39;s not give away our products.</div>
