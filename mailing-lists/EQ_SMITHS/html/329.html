<div id="ygrps-yiv-564955652">Fleetwood is lying.  The customer does pay for all of that just like the <br/>
players would pay if it took that much to do the job. If it took 3 people to <br/>
make a banded cloak, and those 3 people had to share the money 3 ways, the <br/>
average price of a banded cloak would go up from about 20pp to 35-40pp at <br/>
least. The guy that drives the forklift doesn&#39;t get paid by the government, <br/>
he gets paid by Fleetwood who makes their money from the RVs and motor homes <br/>
its customers buy. And after the cost of the motor home pays off everyone <br/>
involved in making, there&#39;s still a huge chunk of money left over called <br/>
profit, that Fleetwood uses to invest in other things (what us smiths use to <br/>
get some nice plate.) I don&#39;t care what they say, corporations like GM and <br/>
Fleetwood sell their products at way over 2x production cost...<br/>

&gt;Fleetwood, the top maker of moter homes and RV&#39;s, Pella, the number one <br/>
&gt;maker<br/>
&gt;of window, GM (which has been mentioned) all will tell you the same thing,<br/>
&gt;Screw ups, inspections, the people working in the office, the people who<br/>
&gt;drive the fork lefts carting material all day....all the work they do and<br/>
&gt;much work that others do is NOT what the costumer buys.  The customer buys<br/>
&gt;what it takes to make the product and that is all.  They are not paying for<br/>
&gt;the time it takes to train John Doe, not for the time it takes for someone <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;fix or check his work. They do not pay for the people to run the accounts,<br/>
&gt;they do not pay for the guy to drive around on a forklift.  Would you?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When you buy something, do you want to pay for all that extra that had<br/>
&gt;nothing to do with building your car?  You can say it did have something to<br/>
&gt;do with your car, but the fact of the matter it isn&#39;t.  Efficency is the <br/>
&gt;key.<br/>
&gt;  If the people doing the paid for work are good enough, then THEY pay the<br/>
&gt;cost of all that excess.  I don&#39;t charge people for me learning to smith, I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t charge for failure rates.  I charge for my work and the matrials <br/>
&gt;needed<br/>
&gt;to make the given item.  I have about the same prices.  I guess I just <br/>
&gt;value<br/>
&gt;my work more then you do yours.<br/>
