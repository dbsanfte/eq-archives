<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482223394">So your saying that most business lose money? I mean if I pay for materials<br/>
and the worker that works on those materials only the company is going to<br/>
lose money right?<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmmm I wonder why they are still in business doesn&#39;t make much sense to<br/>
me. I think you should take a close look at what you are saying. If no one<br/>
pays for overhead then the business loses money. SOMEONE must pay for it,<br/>
the workers driving the forklift and the forklift itself do NOT work for<br/>
free. I don&#39;t know of any business that loses money and stays open for very<br/>
long. Unless of course it is run by a government.... HEHE Hope none of you<br/>
work for the government or I will have to go get my asbestos undies.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I am not going to argue this point anymore =) If you still don&#39;t<br/>
agree then we will have to agree to disagree.<br/>
