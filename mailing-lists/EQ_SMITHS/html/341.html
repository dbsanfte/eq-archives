&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;From a programming point of view this would be very simple to implement.<br/>
&gt;Each item already has to be kept track of in the game as a unique item.<br/>
&gt;Adding the name of the player that created it would be one more data<br/>
&gt;field for each item. Now the actual problem is how fast can the database<br/>
&gt;retrieve the information for the item with unique identifiers on each<br/>
&gt;one. Currently a given item held by any person in the game (e.g. banded<br/>
&gt;gorget) goes to a generic stats file to retrieve its data. The hit from<br/>
&gt;adding names of crafters is the extra time when it has to retrieve the<br/>
&gt;crafters&#39; name. Each item has a unique name in the game so adding the<br/>
&gt;data field there might not be too bad since it is keeping track of the<br/>
&gt;item on the character with that unique name. If they were stored<br/>
&gt;together it might make it faster. Oh well, just the musing of a<br/>
&gt;programmer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Depending of course on how they implemented the item database.  If they<br/>
were lazy at all, adding fields might mean a lot of code changes.  In fact,<br/>
I seem to remember Brad saying something to that effect, but I can&#39;t<br/>
remember<br/>
where or when</div>
