<div id="ygrps-yiv-1257127638">Actually you know what? I bet GM has factored in that a percentage of<br/>
spoilage or errors will happen. That percentage is VERY likely factored into<br/>
the cost of your new car. I don&#39;t know of many business&#39;s that TRULY eat<br/>

Anyway that is my opinion. =)<br/>

&gt;screws up and breaks a windshield, does the customer pay for that broken<br/>
&gt;windshield and the cost that it takes to fix it? no.  When they buy the<br/>
