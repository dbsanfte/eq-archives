the giant fire beetle leg comes off the queen klicknik in the thicket.  She<br/>
spawns so rarely that i have never seen her as both my human mage who<br/>
fights near there and a halfling cleric who went all the way to level 11<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
there is also a queen that spawns in qeynos but i dont know if she has the leg<br/>

&gt;This dosen&#39;t have to do with smithing but I think this is the best place I <br/>
&gt;could ask. I&#39;m currently doing a quest from RiverVale where I need to <br/>
&gt;collect some items for a bug collection. I need a fire beetle, spiderling <br/>
&gt;eye, giant fire beetle leg, giant wasp wing, and a giant scarab egg sac. I <br/>
&gt;can get all of the items I need in the Misty Thickey, RiverVale hunting <br/>
&gt;hunting grounds, except for the giant fire beetle leg. The only places I <br/>
&gt;know how to get them is from the Queen Klacknak and giant fire beetles in <br/>
&gt;West Karana. This means if I wanted to do this quest I would need to run all <br/>
&gt;the way there. I have never gone through Highpass Hold (only way I know how <br/>
&gt;to get there). I was wondering if there was anywhere closer to Freeport, <br/>
&gt;that dosen&#39;t require a high level character. I&#39;m only level 10 right now, <br/>
&gt;and don&#39;t want to risk it. then die somewhere were I cannot retreive my <br/>
&gt;corpse. Is there anywhere I can go? Past the Desert of Ro or something? If <br/>
&gt;anyone has any of the legs near Freeport I&#39;m am VERY willing to buy a few of <br/>
&gt;them. Well I hope you guys can help =)<br/>
