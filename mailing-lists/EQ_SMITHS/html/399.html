<div id="ygrps-yiv-1673337906">I know that to make different sized banded items, you need to use the <br/>
appropriate molds. My question is, where can I get molds to make large and <br/>
medium banded items, and what are the mold names (IE - sm banded helm mold <br/>
etc.)? (Please note that I&#39;m near Freeport but am willing to travel to get <br/>
the correct molds)</div>
