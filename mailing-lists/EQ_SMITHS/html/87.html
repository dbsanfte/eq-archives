&gt; Ok, I got about 150pp, from being extreamly lucky. I am level 4 paladin. I<br/>
&gt; have 0 smithing. I was wondering if this is enough money to get good, I can<br/>
&gt; wait four levels and put all into smithing, because I would like to make my<br/>
&gt; own plate and chainmail armor. Or should I forget about smithing because I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; in Qeynos, and try tailoring or something?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Wait till you can at least put 5-10 points into smithing.<br/>
<br/>
Then just hunker down because it will cost you most of your saved<br/>
fortune to<br/>
earn enough skill.  I do not know if your skill can exceed your level<br/>
times 5 + 5 <br/>
as that restriction is on normal skills (hence my 1h slash maxes at 90<br/>
for 17th)<br/>
<br/>
Just make bits upto 20 skill points,  and if you have lots by then (like<br/>
100 bits)<br/>
then do the lantern thing.  Other wise try to make bits in 100 amounts<br/>
(five full<br/>
stacks) and then convert to making those into lanterns.<br/>
<br/>
This will take lots and lots of time.  So don&#39;t do it on days you<br/>
normally adventure<br/>
on.   And be prepared for your mouse fingers to be really sore</div>
