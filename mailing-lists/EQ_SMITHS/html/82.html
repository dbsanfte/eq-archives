<div id="ygrps-yiv-520048321">Greetings, folks...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve put up a survey at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.onelist.com/surveycenter/EQ_SMITHS,">http://www.onelist.com/surveycenter/EQ_SMITHS,</a><br/>
please feel free to head to that URL and cast your vote.  If there&#39;s a<br/>
survey question you have burning in your mind, please email me DIRECTLY<br/>
with that question, and in a short time, I&#39;ll post it up. :)<br/>
<br/>
Also, as a change of list format, we&#39;ll begin to discuss all aspects of<br/>
Smithing -- from Blacksmithy, to Jewelsmithy, to Tailoring as they all<br/>
tie in, in some way or another.  We&#39;re currently up to 95 subscribers<br/>
and a larger base would definitely help us all in getting some questions<br/>
answered -- please tell a friend to subscribe. :)<br/>
