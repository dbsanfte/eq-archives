<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt; snip some of Kelly&#39;s answers &gt;<br/>
<br/>
Most of Kelly&#39;s directions are perfect. There&#39;s just a few corrections to<br/>
the zone names and a couple of compass headings.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;To get to High Hold from Qeynos:<br/>
&gt;-If under level 15 or so ... put EVERYTHING into the bank except food. You<br/>
 </span></blockquote>won&#39;t be<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;able to kill mobs on most of the maps so you will be avoiding combat. If<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you die or get<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;lost .... who cares, all of your items are in the bank.<br/>
&gt;-Leave Queynos north on the road. Zone into Qeynos Hills.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>so far so good  :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;-After zoning in, follow the road to the marker, take the right path (going<br/>
 </span></blockquote>east) all<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the way along the road and through the valley until you zone into East<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Karana.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s West Karana.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;-Continue following the road into East Karana to the first road marker,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>turn right,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;following the road to the south until the road ends .. and you are running<br/>
 </span></blockquote>on the bare<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;plains. Go south all the way to the water.<br/>
&gt;-Turn east, following the water all the way across the map (a long way).<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Zone into West<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Karana.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s actually North Karana.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;-Continue on this zone along the water. You will come to a large white<br/>
 </span></blockquote>bridge. Do not<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;cross it. Continue again along the water heading east. There will be one<br/>
 </span></blockquote>raider camp<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;along the way, just against the water. Go around it by swimming, or running<br/>
 </span></blockquote>into the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;plains jut a little.<br/>
&gt;-You will come to a second bridge, this one will be wooden, and shaped like<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a large<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;linked chain. Turn south and cross this bridge .. in the middle you will<br/>
 </span></blockquote>zone into<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;South Karana.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ll actually be turning east and zoning into East Karana.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;-After exiting the bridge, follow the water left (again east) until you can<br/>
 </span></blockquote>just see<br/>
<br/>
north<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the mountains coming up. In the water is a large NPC you will want to avoid<br/>
 </span></blockquote>called<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Bruune. Skirt areound him and go up the mountain face until you cannot<br/>
 </span></blockquote>climb any<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;higher.<br/>
&gt;-Turn South and follow the mountain all the way to a valley when you must<br/>
 </span></blockquote>run down. Do<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;not go into the valley ... it zones into the Gorge.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>east<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;-Instead, go up the mountain on the other side, and once again go to the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>top, and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;continue running south. You will eventually reach a corner where you will<br/>
 </span></blockquote>have to curve<br/>
<br/>
east<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;around and run west. Continue running west along the mountain top to the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>next valley.<br/>
<br/>
south<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;-Looking into the valley you will see road winding up on the right hand<br/>
 </span></blockquote>side. Take this<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;route and follow it up all the way around the mountains (quite a hike). You<br/>
 </span></blockquote>will zone<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;into the High Hold map.<br/>
&gt;-After zoning be careful!! There are gnolls and orcs on this map that are<br/>
 </span></blockquote>high level.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;You most likely woudn&#39;t survive a fight with them so wait until they move<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(they seem to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;patrol the area) and then sneak by. You will have to follow the left hand<br/>
 </span></blockquote>wall around<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;all the inlets in the rocks. If you see lights .. you are getting close to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the Keep.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;You will come to one inlet that leads to a tavern/inn. Come out of this and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>contiue<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;left to the next inlet which should be the hold main entrance.<br/>
&gt;-Go into the hold, zone to it&#39;s map, cross the coutyard and go into the<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the hallway down and back to a large chamber with columns in it.<br/>
&gt;-At the back of the chamber is a set of steps going down. They will lead to<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;entrance. A miner just in the entrance sells sharpening stones as well as<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ore. Leaving<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;him, as you return to go back upstairs you should see the female bank<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Place your stuff in here for safe keeping.<br/>
&gt;-Follow the route back home or do like I do and explore until you get<br/>
 </span></blockquote>killed, whereby<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;you respawn in Qeynos and go to the bank to retrieve your items.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;- Don&#39;t get discouraged if you die ... I littered many of these maps with<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my corpse ...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;you can too.  :-p  Try to use a concept called &#39;bordering&#39; as much as<br/>
 </span></blockquote>possible. Mobs<br/>

&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>behind you,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;you will see a path leading up into the rocks. This path actually takes you<br/>
