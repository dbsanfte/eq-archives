<div id="ygrps-yiv-1670231458">they use hq bear?  what tailoring skill level?<br/>
<br/>
i have one in the bank and i usually make bearhide capes and sell them to<br/>
monks and casters for about 12pp, but a 10 slot pack would be cool<br/>

&gt;Wow, a whole 2-3p? Good luck.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The pelts are EXTREMELY rare. As a tailor who has been searching for those<br/>
&gt;pelts, I can say that I don&#39;t think I would sell a pack for less than 20p.<br/>
&gt;And I know at least a dozen people who would jump at the chance to get one<br/>
&gt;that cheap.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In fact, the going rate on my server is 5-10p to make the pack for you if<br/>
&gt;you supply the pelt.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When I go around trying to find pelts, I offer 1p for the raw pelt. So far<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been able to buy 5. That&#39;s after 4 weeks of searching. Every time I<br/>
&gt;enter or leaave a zone I auction for them, and soemtimes if I spend a long<br/>
&gt;time in a zone I&#39;ll auction again. All that, and only 5 pelts have turned<br/>
&gt;up. I&#39;ve also spent a large portion of time killing bears. Not one single HQ<br/>
&gt;skin has fallen out of a bear I&#39;ve attacked.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I pass all my skins on to my friend who is a better tailor than I. After 15<br/>
&gt;attempts at backpacks, we&#39;ve only made 2.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Perhaps you need to rethink how much you are willing to pay.<br/>

&gt;R<br/>
&gt;&gt; What would be really nice is if the sewing kit made by us improved the<br/>
&gt;&gt; chance of a tailor suceeding.  Right now after patchwork it is almost<br/>
&gt;&gt; impossable to make the other types of leather based armor.  It would<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My problem is that I am more than willing to pay 2-3p for player made<br/>
&gt;backpacks,  yet I can never find anyone making them!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;10 spaces! - with my normal &quot;smithing setup&quot; that gives me 14 more slots<br/>
&gt;to dump stuff into!<br/>
