<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683062164">The problem with smithing and diminishing prices is the fact that once an <br/>
item is created, it usually never leaves circulation.  Most, if not all <br/>
banded is passed down and sold to others when it no longer has a use.  What <br/>
this means is that eventually, there will be little to no market for banded <br/>
AT ALL.  What smiths and other crafters need is some sort of item degrade.  <br/>
This is the only way to keep the trade skills working indefinitely and the <br/>
only way to remove items from circulation.<br/>
<br/>
Also, another major problem with trade skills and the economy as a whole is <br/>
the fact that Verant said they would not allow for you to sell back to a <br/>
merchant at a profit, then went ahead and did it anyway.  I was one very few <br/>
people that was a Master at Brewing and Pottery before &quot;The Patch.&quot;  Now <br/>
everyone and their mother is a brewer and a potter simply for the exploit.  <br/>
Can you imagine what would have happened if this was true for smiths and <br/>
jewelers??<br/>
<br/>
Verant needs to stick to its word about no profit from selling to merchants.  <br/>
Already, no one sells good items any more for plat because plat is worthless. <br/>
 The current economy just leads to more camping and kill stealing.<br/>
