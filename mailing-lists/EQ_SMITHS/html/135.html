<b>Subject:</b> Early Profit <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2070498272">I wonder about the game design, and the fact that trades are seemingly not profitable early on.  Is this the way it is, or can we make it profitable from the get go?  I&#39;m an optimist, so I think so.<br/>
<br/>
Even a newbie can go out and whack a bat for a few copper from day one.  They want to encourage trade, I think...so why would they discourage it by making the trades so unprofitable at the early levels?  Or are they trying to discourage all but the most stubborn of us (that would include me...heheheh)<br/>
<br/>
I wondered about this when I saw the diffences in effectiveness and price between three dagger types: rusty, tarnished (the product of our handiwork) and just plain dagger.  If I recall correctly, the only difference is delay: 26, 24, and 22 respectively.  Now look at the vendor prices (approximate, from my memory): 0.0.3.4, 0.0.3.4, and 1.8.0.0 or thereabouts. (my notation - first is 3s 4c, last is 1p 8g 0s 0c).<br/>
<br/>
Based on the above, we ought to be charging around 0.5.0.0 (5 gold) for each tarnished dagger we sell to young wizards...if we just sell them back to vendors, we surely don&#39;t make money.<br/>
<br/>
I think we are supposed to be making money from the get-go...we&#39;ve just not been marketing right.  I for one am going to start hawking everything I smelt, sharpen, or smithï¿½and see how much I can make.<br/>
