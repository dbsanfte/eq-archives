<div id="ygrps-yiv-1748089758">The advanced smithing book and the basic smithing book are sold by ogres in<br/>
the ogre section of the city.  They are 2 street vendors as you walk in ...<br/>
they also sell some molds.  Also their are 2 forges in that area.  Although<br/>
when you petition ask about the fletching guides, because I have looked and<br/>
haven&#39;t found them in the city, being a Dark &quot;Elf&quot; you would think we would<br/>
have all the supplies to make arrows and bows, except for the stuff we have<br/>
to make. :)<br/>

That&#39;s all i know of, and you can&#39;t make weapons (I want to petition to sony<br/>
about that) Since you&#39;re evil, u would probably find the advanced books in<br/>
Neriak.<br/>
