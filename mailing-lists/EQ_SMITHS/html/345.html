<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074401180">I really like the alternate ores idea. The best smithing idea I&#39;ve seen actually<br/>
came from a MMORPG that really sucked (The Realm). Up until I left the game,<br/>
smiths could still make armor and sell it any time they chose. Of course, that&#39;s<br/>
probably due to item deterioration, but let&#39;s not get into that, I&#39;m not going<br/>
to start another flame war. Anyway, their smithing had several different blocks<br/>
of metal you could buy (didn&#39;t even have to convert it from ore =P) and make the<br/>
different armors out of. The thing I liked was you did NOT have to use a mold!<br/>
Each item took however many blocks of metal and when you used the smithing<br/>
skill, a list would pop up and as you what you&#39;d like to make. Could make<br/>
everything - all nonmagical armors (even wood), shields, weapons.... it was<br/>
great!<br/>
<br/>
It also makes sense considering smiths of old did NOT use molds... they heated<br/>
metal and hammered away at it at a forge. Banded mail is made from taking many<br/>
many small strips of metal and riveting those strips together to make a thick<br/>
strip of metal. This metal is then attached to a piece of soft chain armor.<br/>
Molds are no part of the process. This is just background info, though, it<br/>
really means nothing =P<br/>
<br/>
My point is, it would be nice to have different kinds of ore to make different<br/>
armors. Adamantium, Mithril, Steel (what we have now), Iron, etc. It&#39;d also be<br/>
neat if ogres and trolls got a race-specific skill called sculpting. Take a<br/>
block of (clay, rock, granite, etc.) and make something out of it. This could<br/>
make stone armors that only trolls and ogres can use. Would be heavy as hell,<br/>
but those races can take it :) Again, though, just idle thought like the name<br/>
tag thing. I don&#39;t expect anything to be done about this.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say it again: don&#39;t flame me, I won&#39;t answer.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I think the best solution for enchanted armor is to allow metal &gt;sheets to<br/>
&gt; &gt;be made of precious metals. Then enchanters would already &gt;have the spells<br/>
&gt; &gt;implemented. We&#39;d be able to make enchanted silver &gt;banded, enchanted<br/>
&gt; &gt;electrum banded, enchanted gold banded, and &gt;enchanted platinum banded :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;That&#39;d be neat, and it&#39;s the easiest to &gt;implement...<br/>

&gt; I thought about that as well. Guess it&#39;s a matter of implementing it though.<br/>
&gt; I also like the idea of a tag to show who made the item. Not sure if it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; feasible or not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d also like to see being able to use other ores/metals as well, (like<br/>
&gt; steel, admanatium, bronze etc.) and to be able to smith weapons (using these<br/>
&gt; ores as well). Perhaps quests could lead to the discovery of these<br/>
&gt; metals/ore locations?<br/>
