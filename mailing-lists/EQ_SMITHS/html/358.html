<div id="ygrps-yiv-709392979">Actually, it isnt strange at all.  Ogres and Trolls are vicious races that<br/>
barely get along with THEMSELVES, why should they get along with each other?<br/>
If you read the little blurb telling you about your race/class combination<br/>
when you create your character... you know, the one above the &quot;this<br/>
race/class combination is of HIGH difficulty&quot; line... then you would get a<br/>
small idea why.  Case in point.... The Greenbloods (Ogre shadowknights and<br/>
shamans) absolutely HATE the Ogre Warrior caste (cant remember thier name<br/>
right now.) and are convinced that the warriors are inferior.<br/>

&gt;Thanks! Isn&#39;t that strange?  You would think evil races would get along.<br/>
