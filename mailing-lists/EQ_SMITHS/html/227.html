<b>Subject:</b> Levels for banded <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1657163666">Hi all,<br/>
I just hit 102 in smithing last night, and I still have a pretty high<br/>
failure rate for some pieces of banded (especially cloaks - I&#39;m 0 for 20<br/>
with those for some reason). Does anyone know the levels at which the<br/>
various banded pieces become trivial (and thus their difficulty)?<br/>
<br/>
I know that bracers are trivial for me, and gorgets probably are too, but <br/>
what about the rest?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>

&quot;Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?&quot;<br/>
