<div id="ygrps-yiv-75353412">I have been having some horrible luck improving my skill.  My skill<br/>
is in the 100s, and I have been making medium sized banded armor<br/>
with a high-elf.  Most stuff except for leggings is fairly easy, but<br/>
leggings take about 5 tries on average.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that my skill<br/>
very rarely goes up.  I have made about 150 attempts at banded<br/>
armor, and it has only improved twice.  Am I not holding my tongue<br/>
right or something?  I&#39;m using store bought water/metal sheets/molds.<br/>
Does it matter if I have the smithing books in my inventory?<br/>
<br/>
Skewers are still helping, but it is more and more rare on those also.<br/>
Is there any nonbanded items that help after skewers?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
In other trades, does anyone know any pottery items more difficult<br/>
than Large Bowls?  How about Brews harder than Ol&#39;Tujims?<br/>

&gt; &gt;Subject: Raising from level 26<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I can get to level 26 in smithing pretty easily. After this I have heard a <br/>
&gt; &gt;few ways to raise skills here. Skewers, (skalers?), or large lanterns. I <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well I would use scalers till the 40&#39;s, I heard they work just as good but<br/>
&gt; less fails so you make back some money.  After that start skewers till it<br/>
&gt; no longer gives you skill(90`s).  After skwers no longer give you skill<br/>
&gt; start trying banded gorgets, I heard they are the easiest.  Stick with<br/>
&gt; things that only need one sheet metal, then move to things that need two<br/>
&gt; sheet metal and so on....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now large lanterns, from what I have heard, can be uses insted of the<br/>
&gt; skewer stage.  They seem to make more money back.  You make large lanterns<br/>
&gt; till skill 70`s then you start on the skewers when you get to the 90`s.  By<br/>
&gt; this time most ammor pieces should be easy.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;want to know which way is the most effective but does not cost so much <br/>
&gt; &gt;money. I hear all kinds of differant opinions, and I just wanted some <br/>
&gt; &gt;information. If someone on Xegony could give me character a /tell (Irontoe), <br/>
&gt; &gt;or just send me an e-mail back.<br/>

&gt; BTW.  Didn&#39;t I tell this to you already?<br/>
