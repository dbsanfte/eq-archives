<div id="ygrps-yiv-563170338">I&#39;m simply stating the facts of the real business world.  If a worker at GM <br/>
screws up and breaks a windshield, does the customer pay for that broken <br/>
windshield and the cost that it takes to fix it? no.  When they buy the car, <br/>
they are paying for what it takes to make that car.  <br/>

You think banded is low on some of your servers, you should see Cazic Thule.  <br/>
There is a guy in Freeport (obviously made and twinkled by a high level char <br/>
just to be a smith) who sells banded dirt cheap.  I&quot;m talking from 2pp for a <br/>
gorget to 9pp for a tunic or cloak.  Today at the Bazaar he had someone <br/>
standing in teh area of the bazzar announceing banded for sell then refering <br/>
them to the guy making it in freeport.  I went to the forge and watched for a <br/>
bit, there was never less then 8-10 people lined up waiting on costum made <br/>
banded.  He was there for hours makeing banded after banded item for dirt <br/>
cheap.  He&#39;s making a killing on banded armor because he&#39;s found a way to <br/>
sell a ton of it at dirt cheap prices.  and no, he&#39;s not taking a loss.  He <br/>
has a VERY high smithing skill and only charges for what it costs to make the <br/>
banded plus a little for the work.<br/>

Personaly, my prices are more in your guys&#39;s range  Gorget 4pp clear to a <br/>
tunic for 20pp.  yes, I can sell it for these prices but I don&#39;t make nearly <br/>
the sales nor the money that the guy in freeport does.</div>
