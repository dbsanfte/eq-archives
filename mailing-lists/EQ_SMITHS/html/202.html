<div id="ygrps-yiv-527989697">Ok, fairly new smith here, skill of 22, I&#39;m a Troll Shadowknight.<br/>
<br/>
I had a pretty easy time plowing through metal bits to go from zero to 22,<br/>
but<br/>
now I&#39;m stuck, since I can&#39;t find scaler/skewer molds anywhere (that I can<br/>
get<br/>
into anyhow).  I&#39;m fairly sure there is somewhere in Neriak to get them, but<br/>
for the life of me I couldn&#39;t find them, part of the reason is probably that<br/>
I got<br/>
tired of ducking through every door in that tiny little town.  I almost have<br/>
my<br/>
faction fixed in Highhold such that I could look there as well, but not<br/>
quite.<br/>
<br/>
So, any help on where to find scaler/skewer molds in Neriak/Oggok/Grobb,<br/>
and as for lanterns, they seem about as complicated to make as containers<br/>
are... I found a great supply of the parts for containers, but buying 3<br/>
parts per<br/>
container, putting them in the forge, adding a bit and a flask, then if I<br/>
succeed<br/>
I lose an inventory slot, just seems way too tedious.  If i can find<br/>
scaler/skewers,<br/>
at least it&#39;s only 3 parts to combine that way, plus they fit in containers.<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be appreciated.<br/>
