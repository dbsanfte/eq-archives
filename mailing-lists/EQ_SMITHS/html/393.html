<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132561037">Most people don&#39;t realize this.  I have had people ask me to sharpen all<br/>
sorts of things.  Once I had a person ask me to sharpen his axe.  I took it<br/>
and put in in the forge.  Then I inpected it to see exactly what it was.<br/>
Luckely I found out that it was a Mino Axe before I tried to shapen it.<br/>
This was back before the change and it would have been lost in a flash.<br/>
