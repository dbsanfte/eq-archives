<div id="ygrps-yiv-29643809">we do control prices, and I agree they should go up, but let&#39;s not get carried<br/>
away :) Prices need to be raised, but what I&#39;ve set mine at (I believe I already<br/>
posted it) works very well. I simply don&#39;t need to sell higher and I won&#39;t even<br/>
if I get an offer to pay higher. My prices are fair to me and to the buyer, we<br/>
both have walked away happy every time. I like it that way :)<br/>
<br/>
Summary: Prices should go up, just not too much :)<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve got an idea! Any of you remember the &quot;oil crisis&quot; of the 70&#39;s?  You<br/>
&gt; know, when we had to wait in line at the gas stations because of the huge<br/>
&gt; &quot;oil sortage&quot; and all along the oil tankers were sitting in the Delware<br/>
&gt; River loaded with oil waiting for prices to go up before they&#39;d bring in the<br/>
&gt; oil? Well, I say we smiths do the same. All smiths stop making/selling<br/>
&gt; banded until there&#39;s such a high demand that the people who want to buy it<br/>
&gt; keep raising the price they are willing to pay. I think we can get the price<br/>
&gt; to go up 3-5pp if everyone cooperates. Think about that, 7pp for a banded<br/>
&gt; gorget. It can happen. We can make it happen. We can hold Norrath by its<br/>
&gt; balls.  WE SMITHS CAN RULE NORRATH!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Of course, I&#39;ll have to work on my smithing considering it&#39;s only at about<br/>
&gt; 13 right now.<br/>
