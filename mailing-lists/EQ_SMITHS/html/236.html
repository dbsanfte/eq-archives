&gt;Well I&#39;m a new smith too but i know how to start. At first spend at least <br/>
&gt;10<br/>
&gt;points in it, then sharpen til about 20 or so, then make scalers, then<br/>
&gt;skewers for a while til skill is around 100, then you can make simple <br/>
&gt;banded<br/>
&gt;stuff and some harder ones. You can make them earlier but your success rate<br/>
&gt;will be low so wait, then when banded stuff is trivial try harder stuff,<br/>
&gt;70pp should be good to start, I wish i had that much, I only got around 25,<br/>
&gt;30pp.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>70 P is a good start, but not nearly enough to get you to skill lvl 80 <br/>
(where it starts becoming profitable enough to pay for itself, or least so I <br/>
hear; I&#39;m a skill lvl 43 blacksmith right now). Although making scalers can <br/>
increase your skill, I&#39;d highly recommend making lanterns until lvl 80. <br/>
They&#39;re cheaper, you&#39;ll have more successes with them, and you can sell them <br/>
back to merchants for about half of what it cost you to buy the components.</div>
