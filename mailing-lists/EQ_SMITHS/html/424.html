&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am a new smith on the Erollisi Marr server.  I have gotten my skill up to <br/>
&gt;112 but have only made one piece of banded armor so far.  I figure skewers <br/>
&gt;are good for another 3 points and then I could move onto pots and sewing <br/>
&gt;kits if needed.  My question is at what point can a smith make banded <br/>
&gt;cloaks with a reasonable degree of success?  Should I quit trying to raise <br/>
&gt;my skill and graduate to only making armor or should I blow the rest of my <br/>
&gt;platinum on pots and sewing kits?  Anyone have any experience with trying <br/>
&gt;to make the cloaks with only 112-115 skill level?  Does it become much more <br/>
&gt;cost effective (ie does it greatly increase you success rate) to move from <br/>
&gt;115 (skewers) to 122 (pots) and then 135 (sewing kits).  The only reference <br/>
&gt;I have for this is a guide to blacksmithing that says my skill needs to be <br/>
&gt;145 to make cloaks.  I see no way to bring it to that level except by <br/>
&gt;making armor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s more cost effective to work your skill to 135 and then start making <br/>
cloaks. At skill lvl 145, you&#39;ll be making them with about a 30% success (or <br/>
so I&#39;m led to believe; could be wrong though).</div>
