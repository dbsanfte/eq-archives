<b>Subject:</b> Studs and studded leather armor... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-342929246">Is it worth making studded leather armor?  I have never seen studded leather in any form, and I have seen websites that say studded leather has the same AC as leather, and I have seen sites that say studded leather is between leather and chain.  My character Cassin (Povar), is both a tailor and a smith (and not very good at either!), so I was wondering if this would be a smart endeavour.</div>
