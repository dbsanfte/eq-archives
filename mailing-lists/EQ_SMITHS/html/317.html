<div id="ygrps-yiv-882774906">Items do indeed go out of use.  Players stop playing their warrior and<br/>
start up another character that will need his own banded.  The level 30s<br/>
that finally get their replacement for banded armor often are not interested<br/>
in haggling, meeting, and reselling banded to players for 2 or 3 p<br/>
gain (vs selling it to a merchant)  I know a couple of people at level 22-23<br/>
that don&#39;t even bother selling FS weapons to players because it is a waste<br/>
of time, it is the same with banded.  (and no, these players<br/>
are not master potters or brewers)<br/>
<br/>
What we need is the ability to make steel armor, or at least<br/>
bronze, that way we can cater to more than 1 level range of players.<br/>

&gt; The problem with smithing and diminishing prices is the fact that once an <br/>
&gt; item is created, it usually never leaves circulation.  Most, if not all <br/>
&gt; banded is passed down and sold to others when it no longer has a use.  What <br/>
&gt; this means is that eventually, there will be little to no market for banded <br/>
&gt; AT ALL.  What smiths and other crafters need is some sort of item degrade.  <br/>
&gt; This is the only way to keep the trade skills working indefinitely and the <br/>
&gt; only way to remove items from circulation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, another major problem with trade skills and the economy as a whole is <br/>
&gt; the fact that Verant said they would not allow for you to sell back to a <br/>
&gt; merchant at a profit, then went ahead and did it anyway.  I was one very few <br/>
&gt; people that was a Master at Brewing and Pottery before &quot;The Patch.&quot;  Now <br/>
&gt; everyone and their mother is a brewer and a potter simply for the exploit.  <br/>
&gt; Can you imagine what would have happened if this was true for smiths and <br/>
&gt; jewelers??<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Verant needs to stick to its word about no profit from selling to merchants.  <br/>
&gt; Already, no one sells good items any more for plat because plat is worthless. <br/>
&gt;  The current economy just leads to more camping and kill stealing.<br/>
