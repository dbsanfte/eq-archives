<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186909738"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;What level should i make banded armor and studs at? I&#39;m level 20 in smithing, <br/>
&gt;what should i make? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> I&#39;m level 26 but i&#39;ve done lots of research. Make scalers. At level 70 you will be able to make banded armor on occasion. At 90 is when I&#39;vebeen told it is finally worthwile. At 125 it&#39;s easy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Also, i&#39;m in kelethin and they only have medium molds for <br/>
&gt;banded armor, where can i get small molds for banded armor?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> Outside of the Gnome City of Ak&#39;anon there are 4 houses. When facing the city on the right one of the 2 houses has small molds. On the left one has all the scaler and skewer mold and such.<br/>
