&lt;&lt; 1 - NEVER buy any CD for more than 10 cents. They&#39;re just shiny pieces of <br/>
plastic<br/>
 that only cost 10 cents to produce. Since you don&#39;t pay for any overhead and <br/>
are<br/>
 simply sticking to cost, this is the most you should ever let yourself pay <br/>
for a<br/>
 CD of any kind.<br/>
 <br/>
I see your not paying attention.  when you buy a CD your not just buying the <br/>
&quot;shiny piece of plastic.  you are paying for what is one it, you are paying <br/>
for someone to put it on there as well.  You are not paying for someone to <br/>
check each one to make sure it was done right as it was supposed to have been <br/>
done right in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
 2 - Never ever rent anything or visit a video arcade You aren&#39;t actually <br/>
buying<br/>
 anything, and therefore aren&#39;t aquiring these precious materials that are all<br/>
 anybody ever charges for. If you don&#39;t get materials, they don&#39;t lose <br/>
materials,<br/>
 so they should charge nothing because they are losing nothing. If you pay <br/>
more<br/>
 than nothing, you are again violating your own principles.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t rent =)  and why go to an arcade?  I have a computer to play games on.<br/>
<br/>
 3 - Don&#39;t buy gas for your car. Don&#39;t even buy a car! The gas for your car is<br/>
 sold in bulk, and therefore at discount. When you buy gas from a gas <br/>
station, it<br/>
 has gone through several middlemen who add a little to the price each time. <br/>
Since<br/>
 you could buy petroleum from the middle east and process it yourself for no <br/>
more<br/>
 than cost, you shouldn&#39;t pay the price a gas station will charge because it <br/>
has<br/>
 been marked up several times. Same goes for cars. No car company that I know <br/>
of<br/>
 mines the metal it needs and then shapes it into the parts needed for the <br/>
car.<br/>
 This again means middlemen and markups, so if you want a car, you need to go <br/>
mine<br/>
 all the materials yourself, process even more petroleum into the plastics <br/>
needed,<br/>
 build your own engine and any other moving parts, and put it all together<br/>
 yourself. This way you make sure to not pay anything more than cost of <br/>
materials.<br/>
 <br/>
again, your just looking at the materials, you pay for materials and the work <br/>
it takes to make it into what you want.  You are not paying for someone to <br/>
check and recheck that work, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 4 - Refuse paychecks from your place of employment. The only things ever <br/>
paid for<br/>
 are material costs, time and work aren&#39;t included. <br/>
<br/>
 5 - If you ever get into a legal battle, don&#39;t hire an attorney. The paper <br/>
they<br/>
 used on your case does not cost what they charge you. Since they are charging<br/>
 more than cost, you must refuse to pay them and therefore boycott their <br/>
services.<br/>
 You can represent yourself for cost.<br/>
  <br/>
again and again &lt;sighs&gt;  materials+the accual work that it takes, not all the <br/>
etra work that doesnt&#39; NEED to be done.<br/>
<br/>
 Yes, I know this is all rather ridiculous, but that&#39;s what things would be <br/>
like<br/>
 if you really followed your ideas here. It&#39;s almost as bad as saying &#39;don&#39;t <br/>
use<br/>
 plastic, they charge too much!&#39;. Well... where would you be without plastic?<br/>
 Think along those lines... where would you be without business? If everybody<br/>
 charged for cost and nothing more, employees wouldn&#39;t get paid and all <br/>
businesses<br/>
 would eventually collapse because any failures they made over the years <br/>
would add<br/>
 up. Since they only charge what it costs them, they don&#39;t make any money in <br/>
their<br/>
 business so everything comes from their pockets. Since other businesses can&#39;t<br/>
 afford to pay employees, there is nowhere else to work to gain any money.<br/>
 Timber!! There goes business as we know it.<br/>
 <br/>
 Seriously, reconsider what you&#39;re saying here. It makes absolutely no sense. <br/>
We<br/>
 all know EQ isn&#39;t a real economy (it&#39;s downright terrible). Actually, it&#39;s <br/>
weaker<br/>
 than a real economy. You see what charging for cost does to a real economy, <br/>
can<br/>
 you imagine what it would do to EQ&#39;s? It would be nearly irreversible. I <br/>
can&#39;t<br/>
 begin to explain the damages your ideas will cause if they are practiced by <br/>
all.<br/>

first learn what I am saying then try and make comments.  Your only taking <br/>
half of what I said.  perhaps you should go back and reread it.</div>
