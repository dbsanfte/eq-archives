&gt;I feel as though I&#39;m getting the raw end of the deal from Verant. I lost 10<br/>
&gt;P and an Opalline earring (paid 25 P for it) off an alt character, due to<br/>
&gt;yet another bug/glitch with the boat. I&#39;ve done everything I can possibly<br/>
&gt;think of, (/tell, /shout, /petition, /bug, /feedback, and email directly to<br/>
&gt;a GM at the suggestion of a Guide) to get this equipment restored. And I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;done them all numerous times and still nothing!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Shoot, I lost everything I had on my main character due to a bug<br/>
in befallen, I was told I MIGHT get a leg up kit (!)<br/>
<br/>
That was sunday, this is thursday, so far no contact from V, they<br/>
took my e-mail address .... but nothing<br/>
<br/>
In that time I sold a few items from my bank storage, started a<br/>
character specifically to make money, leveled him to 4, and passed<br/>
the &lt;20 pp I had to him.  Then started pottery, I now have almost<br/>
enough to re-equip, but it&#39;s been a long, fairly tedious time<br/>
that I COULD HAVE BEEN PLAYING!!!<br/>
<br/>
leg up kit?  I don&#39;t need no stinkin&#39; leg up kit!!!</div>
