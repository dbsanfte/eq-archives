<b>Subject:</b> Re: How do I make sewing kits... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-886637020">There is an idea I hadn&#39;t thought about.  What is the difference, if any,<br/>
between a sewing kit purchased from a merchant and a sewing kit made by us?<br/>
What would be really nice is if the sewing kit made by us improved the<br/>
chance of a tailor suceeding.  Right now after patchwork it is almost<br/>
impossable to make the other types of leather based armor.  It would be<br/>
great if we could make a kit that would help them out.  Of course this is<br/>
just and idea.  I have no idea what the difference really is.<br/>
