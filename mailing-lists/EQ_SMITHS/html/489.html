<br/>
	I just saw a segment of &quot;Oprah&quot; reporting on the deaths of at <br/>
least 14 women in the United States due to broken necks from  usually <br/>
harmless purse snatching!! Women who wear their purse straps across <br/>
their chests rather than over their shoulders are at risk for broken <br/>
necks and, possibly, decapitation!!  Purse snatchers&#39; usual method of <br/>
operation involves approaching an unsuspecting woman, quickly pulling <br/>
her purse from her shoulder, and fleeing the scene. Purse snatchers do <br/>
not check to see if the purse is around the woman&#39;s neck first!! Purse <br/>
straps will not break, your neck most likely will!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
	Fourteen  women have already died!! Beware!!! The first <br/>
reported case of a purse strap-related death occurred in Los Angeles <br/>
in 1987. A young woman was leaving a local mall when a man mistakenly <br/>
broke her neck in an attempt to steal her purse, which was  holding a <br/>
measly $20!!!!! X-rays revealed the woman&#39;s neck was nearly severed in <br/>
two! Another woman in 1988 suffered not only a twice fractured neck <br/>
bone, but a completely shattered jaw! One woman survived this grisly <br/>
ordeal only to be left quadriplegic for life!!<br/>
<br/>
	The scariest news is that with purse snatching on the rise, 6 <br/>
deaths were reported just over the past  year!!! Remember this: more <br/>
purse snatchings are reported during Christmas time than any other <br/>
season. Please tell your mothers, daughters, sisters, and friends: DO <br/>
NOT WEAR YOUR PURSE STRAP ACROSS YOUR CHEST!!!!</div>
