<div id="ygrps-yiv-260924235">Actually Ive seen a few smiths auction that they were resizing armor <br/>
for a fee. I thought this was bogus so I asked them how. They <br/>
remained tightlipped so I don&#39;t know if it was true or not. Nest time <br/>
I find one I&#39;m gonna give him some armor to see if they can really <br/>
resize it.<br/>

&gt; You have to size the armor when you create (use large/small/medium <br/>
molds<br/>

armor is<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyone have any info on resizing armor and what you need to do <br/>
this?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Will resizing work with Banded? Plate? Dyed Plate? Cultural? Ive<br/>
&gt; &gt; tried placing pieces of armor in a forge with a scaler to see what<br/>
&gt; &gt; happens and I get the message &quot;These items do not combine...blah <br/>
blah<br/>
&gt; &gt; blah&quot; Ive also tried adding a flask of water and nothing.<br/>
