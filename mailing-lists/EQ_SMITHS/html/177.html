The guy you are looking for is IN highpass keep, in the middle of the<br/>
highpass zone. Upon entering the keep (after crossing the courtyard), go<br/>
toward the back to a room with large columns. From the back of that room, or<br/>
close by anyway, is a set of steps leading down to the prison and mines. Take<br/>
the steps down, turn left around the corner, and you should see some guy who<br/>
is a Miner. He sells all types of ore, plus sharpening stones.<br/>
<br/>
In you need a bank, turn around and just before heading up the stairs you<br/>
should see a woman on your left. She is the banker so you may deposit you<br/>
items until your return to Qeynos.<br/>
<br/>
Happy smithing.<br/>

&gt; I am in Quenos and looking for ore so I can continue my smithing that I<br/>
&gt; started in Freeport.  Someone said that ore can be purchased a merchant<br/>
&gt; outside of a mine in east karana near where you zone to highpass.  I have<br/>
&gt; not been able to find this merchant.  Is this just a rumor ?<br/>
