<div id="ygrps-yiv-2130126702">Overhead &#92; o-ver-hed&#92; adj 1 :  business expense not chargeable to a<br/>
particular part of the work or product.<br/>
<br/>
I bid, sell and perform engineering services.  Overhead is a constant in ANY<br/>
business.  As Webster&#39;s dictionary (see above) states the overhead cost for<br/>
a business is not billable to a particular product or part of a product.  It<br/>
is, however, passed along to the consumer in the form of a generally higher<br/>
price.  GM, and any other business MUST, as a necessity, pass along the<br/>
costs of health insurance, equipment maintenance, downtime, quality<br/>
assurance and yes...even employee incompetence to the consumer.  Not in the<br/>
1st car off the assembly line or the 2nd or the 200th.  But as an average of<br/>
the products they sell the overhead must be covered or the company simply<br/>
fails to make money.<br/>
We do not live in an altruistic society.  GM is not in business because it<br/>
longs to provide a job to all those poor UAW union members.  They are in<br/>
business to MAKE MONEY.<br/>
<br/>
The trick to handling overhead is to pass along as much of it as possible to<br/>
the consumer and still make a profit.  When, in the name of selling your<br/>
product, you lower your price to the point that the overhead % is higher<br/>
than your profit you lose.<br/>
<br/>
As a consulting engineer my corporate overhead rate is 131%.  This means<br/>
that, as I bid work, I must take my actual hourly rate and multiply it by<br/>
131% just to BREAK EVEN.<br/>
<br/>
Bah.  This is no place for a lesson in economics.<br/>
If some idiot wants to eat all of his failures let him.  I certainly wont.<br/>

&gt;So your saying that most business lose money? I mean if I pay for materials<br/>
&gt;and the worker that works on those materials only the company is going to<br/>
&gt;lose money right?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hmmmmm I wonder why they are still in business doesn&#39;t make much sense to<br/>
&gt;me. I think you should take a close look at what you are saying. If no one<br/>
&gt;pays for overhead then the business loses money. SOMEONE must pay for it,<br/>
&gt;the workers driving the forklift and the forklift itself do NOT work for<br/>
&gt;free. I don&#39;t know of any business that loses money and stays open for very<br/>
&gt;long. Unless of course it is run by a government.... HEHE Hope none of you<br/>
&gt;work for the government or I will have to go get my asbestos undies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway I am not going to argue this point anymore =) If you still don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;agree then we will have to agree to disagree.<br/>
