*********************************<br/>
To make a dye extract you need to have a ALCHEMIST combind one of the<br/>
following items (it just lists the items and will not say what colors they<br/>
make) along with a flask of water...<br/>
Permafrost Crystals, Evergreen Leafs, Sarcoscypha Fungus, Russet Oxide,<br/>
Jack-o-lantern Fungus, Iron Oxide and Charcoal.<br/>
Each one makes a diffrent color extract.<br/>
You then take the extract (it is not clear but it sounds like this is also<br/>
by the alchemist) and combind it with 1 to 3 resins to get a diffrent shade<br/>
dye (Charcoal extract with 1 resin gives a diffrent shade of the same color<br/>
then Charcoal extract with 3 resins).<br/>
<br/>
You them add the dye along with lacquer in the forge when making steel plate<br/>
(it specifies steel plate so I guess there will be no tinted banded) and it<br/>
will be perminantly tinted.<br/>
<br/>
Jar of Lacquer - 1 gold, 1 silver, 8 copper - Steamfont Windmills - Prices<br/>

<br/>
Smithy Hammer - 14ish plat. Found in Hallis and Freeport (so far, probably<br/>
other locations as well). Note, this is not the same as the dwarven smithing<br/>
hammer or evlish smithing hammer.<br/>
