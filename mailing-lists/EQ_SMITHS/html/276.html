<div id="ygrps-yiv-919109361">Yes, I have to agree.. Smithing is getting rediculas..  People don&#39;t understand what<br/>
and how smithing should be.  First off is the time it took you to get to 110 or what<br/>
ever you got to before you started on banded.  Secondly, there is your time.  Your<br/>
time is worth money.  If you stand around making and selling armor for 5 hours.  Thats<br/>
5 hours of your time.  I raise the price of my items a bit to add that in.  Thirdly<br/>
there is failure rate.  Ever smith will agree some items fail more then others.  I&#39;m<br/>
at 165 smithing skill and I still fail on stinkin masks and such more then I should.<br/>
Lastly of course is the cost of the materials.  We all know that buying materials with<br/>
a high cha is the best bet, and all customers must assume all smiths have a 250 cha.<br/>
Well, I did create my &quot;smithing character&quot; with min/max smithing in mind.  110 Cha,<br/>
and 120 Int base.  Since then I have raised my Int to 147 and Cha to 133 through<br/>
magical items.  But this dosen&#39;t have to be passed down through to the customer.  This<br/>
is like stream lining your factory.  You do it for my profit, not to give the profit<br/>
to the customer.  I have a really basic formula for prices.. (This has NO scientific<br/>
basis)  5pp per metal sheet an item takes.  So, Boots, Bracers, Gorgets 5pp Masks,<br/>
Helms, Sleeves, Mantles, Belts 10pp I fudge on the cloak cause of the failure rate, I<br/>
charge 15pp for the cloak and again, I fudge for the Tunic and Leggings, for failure<br/>
rate and for popularity on the Tunic and Leggings. I charge 20pp for those 2.  Now, on<br/>
almost all items I have left myself a SMALL margin (in my mind) to lower the prices<br/>
depending on the customer.  I usually won&#39;t go to low on leggings, cloak or the 5pp<br/>
items.  Well, if your ever on the Erollis Marr server in the freeport area.. you&#39;ll<br/>
more then likely hear this auction...<br/>

Well, happy smithing to all..<br/>

&gt; On the Karana Server, prices have hit the floor.  The following is what I<br/>
&gt; sell at (and I have stock in my bank that has been there for weeks):<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; bracers, gorgets, helms, boots, arms, masks, belts - 5p<br/>
&gt; mantles and cloaks 10p<br/>
&gt; tunic and legs - 13p<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now this is rediculous but I have masks, arms and mantles in the bank that I<br/>
&gt; cant get rid of at these prices.  Go figure.  (smithing skill 135).<br/>
