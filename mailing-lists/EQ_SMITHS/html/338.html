<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053238539">From a programming point of view this would be very simple to implement.<br/>
Each item already has to be kept track of in the game as a unique item.<br/>
Adding the name of the player that created it would be one more data<br/>
field for each item. Now the actual problem is how fast can the database<br/>
retrieve the information for the item with unique identifiers on each<br/>
one. Currently a given item held by any person in the game (e.g. banded<br/>
gorget) goes to a generic stats file to retrieve its data. The hit from<br/>
adding names of crafters is the extra time when it has to retrieve the<br/>
crafters&#39; name. Each item has a unique name in the game so adding the<br/>
data field there might not be too bad since it is keeping track of the<br/>
item on the character with that unique name. If they were stored<br/>
together it might make it faster. Oh well, just the musing of a<br/>
programmer.</div>
