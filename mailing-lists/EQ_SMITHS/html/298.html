<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094430401">My skill is only around 118, but last night I managed to make a complete<br/>
set of banded without a failure.  I try to sell banded for 5-10-15 <br/>
in Freeport with very little success.  Too many smiths out there.  I have<br/>
mostly given up trying to make money smithing.  I have even tried<br/>
lowering my prices to 4-8-12 when I was in a good mood but still no<br/>
takers.<br/>
<br/>
Also, at the bazaar<br/>
Saturday night, someone was selling a book that allowed smithed to make<br/>
bronze armor with skill over 200 using bronze metal.  I forget the name<br/>
of the book and I did not have the 400p that the guy<br/>
was asking for.  Does anyone have information on this book?<br/>

&gt; I just read about 13 EQ_Smith posts.. So this is a general responce..  Not aimed<br/>
&gt; at anyone person.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Point 1.  BS.  The customer is to paying for the failures, and my time for that<br/>
&gt; matter.  It&#39;s called OVERHEAD.  (example) If I were making cloaks, and the<br/>
&gt; failure rate was really high, even for a 150+ smith.  Say like you only made 1<br/>
&gt; cloak out of 10, do you really think people would sell cloaks for 10-15p each?<br/>
&gt; Get a grip.  My time, materials, and the persons personality go into the price.<br/>
&gt; The last factor can lower the price if they are nice and don&#39;t look twinked, and<br/>
&gt; say they can&#39;t afford the cost by a couple of plat.  Then I&#39;m happy to lower it<br/>
&gt; down for them.  The Aholes, that come off saying hey, your greedy.. I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; buying from you.  Then 30 mins later when they can&#39;t find it for less or at<br/>
&gt; all.. want to buy from me..  hahahah I won&#39;t lower it a copper.. I might just<br/>
&gt; raise it a few plat.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Point 2.  Over all armor costs..  I have a completely TWINKED smith.  I&#39;ll be<br/>
&gt; the first to admit it.  I have a 25+ warrior, and I used cash from him and<br/>
&gt; purchased magical items to get my smith character up in smithing skill.  I run<br/>
&gt; my smith for the SOLE purpose of making money to feed my warrior. (Have you seen<br/>
&gt; the prices of steel plate??) and to help my wives mage buy spells.  But, I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; NOTHING to hurt the smithing trade.  I won&#39;t lowwe my prices to 50p for a full<br/>
&gt; suit of banded or sell components for 1p over cost.  I sell at a fair price to<br/>
&gt; both me and the customer.  If you get on the Erollis Marr server, I&#39;m known as<br/>
&gt; &quot;the banded guy&quot;.  Lots of people buy my banded at my prices.  I don&#39;t have to<br/>
&gt; work hard at all to make 300-400p a day on the weekends.. and 100-200p on the<br/>
&gt; week nights.. profit.  Then I go off and spend it in the market place (PCs) and<br/>
&gt; adventure... I&#39;m not a full time smith.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Point 3.  I&#39;m NOT going to help another little smith ever again. (On Errolis<br/>
&gt; Marr anyways).  The last 3 people that I have &quot;helped&quot; get to 100-110 smithing<br/>
&gt; so they could begin to make money turn around, and undercut me and try to steal<br/>
&gt; all of my business.  That is crazy.  There are TONS of people wanting banded all<br/>
&gt; the time.  We could all sell for the same price and make plenty of plat.  but<br/>
&gt; no.  They have to try and undercut me.  Well, to bad for them, that people know<br/>
&gt; when they are getting a good deal and alot of people will only buy from me, and<br/>
&gt; word of mouth is powerful...  Sorry young smiths on Errolis Marr, your on your<br/>
&gt; own.  To bad things have to come to this.. I hate seeing people try to make<br/>
&gt; banded at 50skill wasting TONS of money.. and not really getting anywhere.. then<br/>
&gt; spending hours on top of hours trying to sell gorgets and bracers.. (This is<br/>
&gt; something I did in the begining cause I didn&#39;t know better) then a very friendly<br/>
&gt; smith pointed me in the right direction.  This is why in the begining I made it<br/>
&gt; a point to help smiths out...  Only take a couple bad apples....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lastly, I think most smiths here, that are actually thinking about the whole<br/>
&gt; picture have about the same prices.  4-5pp for Gorgets or Bracers (Items that<br/>
&gt; take 1 sheet) to 17-20pp (items that take 3 sheets)  I think my prices are right<br/>
&gt; in the middle.. I saw some smiths selling (2 sheet items) helms, belts etc for<br/>
&gt; 8-12.. I sell mine for 10.  It&#39;s pretty basic.. 1 sheet = 5pp 2sheets 10pp<br/>
&gt; (mantles can go for 12p cause of failures) 3 sheets 15-20p depending on item and<br/>
&gt; failures.  (For faulires see point #1)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok, this is lastly.. I just wanted to ask a few other smiths out there that are<br/>
&gt; 140+ at least.. How do you see your success rates for Mantles, Cloaks, Leggings<br/>
&gt; and Tunics?  Do you feel that when the last patch came out they changed the<br/>
&gt; Cloak %?  I used to fail alot on cloaks, now I hardly ever fail...  Even at 150+<br/>
&gt; I fail on Masks, Belts and Leggings the most.. and Masks, and Belts are<br/>
&gt; Trivial...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for your time..<br/>

&gt; &gt; Actually you know what? I bet GM has factored in that a percentage of<br/>
&gt; &gt; spoilage or errors will happen. That percentage is VERY likely factored into<br/>
&gt; &gt; the cost of your new car. I don&#39;t know of many business&#39;s that TRULY eat<br/>
&gt; &gt; their mistakes.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway that is my opinion. =)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;m simply stating the facts of the real business world.  If a worker at GM<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;screws up and breaks a windshield, does the customer pay for that broken<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;windshield and the cost that it takes to fix it? no.  When they buy the<br/>
&gt; &gt; car,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;they are paying for what it takes to make that car.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;You think banded is low on some of your servers, you should see Cazic<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thule.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;There is a guy in Freeport (obviously made and twinkled by a high level<br/>
&gt; &gt; char<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;just to be a smith) who sells banded dirt cheap.  I&quot;m talking from 2pp for<br/>
&gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;gorget to 9pp for a tunic or cloak.  Today at the Bazaar he had someone<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;standing in teh area of the bazzar announceing banded for sell then<br/>
&gt; &gt; refering<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;them to the guy making it in freeport.  I went to the forge and watched for<br/>
&gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;bit, there was never less then 8-10 people lined up waiting on costum made<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;banded.  He was there for hours makeing banded after banded item for dirt<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;cheap.  He&#39;s making a killing on banded armor because he&#39;s found a way to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;sell a ton of it at dirt cheap prices.  and no, he&#39;s not taking a loss.  He<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;has a VERY high smithing skill and only charges for what it costs to make<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;banded plus a little for the work.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Talthoron<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Personaly, my prices are more in your guys&#39;s range  Gorget 4pp clear to a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;tunic for 20pp.  yes, I can sell it for these prices but I don&#39;t make<br/>
&gt; &gt; nearly<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;the sales nor the money that the guy in freeport does.<br/>
