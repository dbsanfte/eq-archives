<div id="ygrps-yiv-1886125650">Well when I learned my first lump sum was 100pp. I didn&#39;t bother with<br/>
sharpening but rather dumped 20points into the trainer. I then made Metal<br/>
bits LOTS of Metal Bits I needed them for EVERYTHING until around 85-95 when<br/>
I could actually make some money making banded. You DO NOT want to learn<br/>
using banded it costs too much to fail.<br/>
<br/>
After Metal bits where trivial I started making scalers with all those bits<br/>
I had. After bits go triv though I failed a fair bit at them still. So I<br/>
only made 20 at a time then made scalers to improve my skill before making<br/>
20 more.  After Scalers went trivial I started making Skewers. I failed ALOT<br/>
at skewers at first, there might be an item that is a little cheaper to fail<br/>
at but I am not sure? Anyway Skewers took me all the way to 115 after about<br/>
90 though I started making the easier banded items. Bracers and Gorgets.<br/>
After abou 100 I went to making banded on an as needed basis. I stayed with<br/>
skewers though for skill gain.<br/>
<br/>
Now if someone will buy things at a price I can make some money at including<br/>
the fact that I am a busy person and my time is worth something as well as<br/>
my 220pp I initially invested I make almost anything if people try to haggle<br/>
I simply tell them I am not a charity and am not here to give them a deal I<br/>
am here to make some pp. I am selfish and I don&#39;t care. I am after all a<br/>
dwarf...<br/>
<br/>
If you where to make a character just for making banded it would likely not<br/>
cost you as much but I thought what sense does it make to have some frail<br/>
wizard making armor?? They might damage themselves doing that if I am going<br/>
to make armor I am going to do it as Dwarf!!! I seem ro remember though that<br/>
elven chain was usually pretty good wasn&#39;t it?<br/>

&gt;I have decided to learn a trade. I chose Blacksmithing. I fish a lot and<br/>
&gt;find a lot of rusty knives. I currently &#39;live&#39; in Qeynos as a level 6<br/>
&gt;Paladin on the Prexus server. Does anyone know where to get sharping stones<br/>
&gt;and the process to sharpen knives?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks in advance for any help you can give me.<br/>
