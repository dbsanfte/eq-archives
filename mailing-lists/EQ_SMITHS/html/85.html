<div id="ygrps-yiv-154904209">Well as stated before I took Archonon (my 17th level High Elf Paladin)<br/>
to Freeport (on Rathe) to become a smith.<br/>
I used Freeport because it was more like going away to go learn a trade,<br/>
even though in essence I was<br/>
&quot;powergaming&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I took 162p with me, and had a starting skill of 10 in blacksmithing.<br/>
<br/>
Upto level 20 I exclusively made bits, after that I made skewers (only<br/>
succeeding about a dozen times out of<br/>
hundreds) to 40 skill. It was suggested I switch over to lanterns as the<br/>
success rate was higher to make product<br/>
and you could sell it. <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I went the lantern route. My standard preparation is too take<br/>
two small chests and put 50 water and<br/>
100 ore in each. Then I produce metal bits out of this. (usually I get<br/>
between 85-95 bits per round). This takes<br/>
time, and is tiresome, especially since you cannot stack in the forge,<br/>
let alone there is no easy way to pull one<br/>
piece of a stack of twenty).<br/>
<br/>
After making all the bits, I then restock the water to an amount equal<br/>
to the bits, and buy the same number of<br/>
bottles (6 copper variety). I then buy lantern molds in 24 piece lots<br/>
(161 copper per mold). If you succeed with a<br/>
lantern you can sell it for 225 copper. The price of ore for me was 56<br/>
copper, water was 11 copper. I measure<br/>
everything in copper.<br/>
<br/>
My average cost per skill point making skewers was 23-25 gold per point.<br/>
Using the lantern approach (and<br/>
increases in skill) I was able to lower that to 17-21 gold per point.<br/>
The last batch I made gained my 6 skill points<br/>
in 24 attempts and I made 23 lanters, meaning I paid about 6 gold for<br/>
each of the last skill points. <br/>
<br/>
I now have 63 skill points in Blacksmithing. I am sure I can push it<br/>
higher with the lantern work, but honestly I just<br/>
got tired of doing this. I figure it took me on the order of 7 hours to<br/>
raise my skill and this was good because<br/>
most of the time I was the only one at a forge. However the first day I<br/>
was there it took me awhile to find an<br/>
empty forge in Freeport (having never been there)<br/>
<br/>
So how should you do this yourself based on my experience?<br/>
<br/>
1. Have 5 chests/backpacks. (you want 3 open inventory slots for other<br/>
things). You should reserve the two top<br/>
rows of your top backpack for your personal food/water ... (and its a<br/>
good place to store batches of 20bits)<br/>
2. Make bits and never sell them. Make lots of them, until your blue in<br/>
the face. Usually I do 50 water and 100<br/>
ore per chest. Convert them all. Never sell them.<br/>
3. Once over 20 skill. Buy 20 lantern molds and 20 bottles at a time.<br/>
Keep the molds in your crates/backpacks.<br/>
Put 20 water, 20 bits, and 20 bottles in your open inventory slots. Make<br/>
lanterns, returning completed ones to the<br/>
same place you pulled the mold from.<br/>
4. Rinse and repeat step 3 until out of bits or cash.<br/>
5. Go to step 2 and repeat to here until your skill is what you want or<br/>
you have no cash.<br/>
<br/>
Now figure on averaging a cost of 20-25gp per point of skill. If you do<br/>
the lantern version throughout you should<br/>
be less than that (but remember your failures are pretty consistent at<br/>
lower skill levels, hence the cost will be<br/>
higher to get through the 20s, and decrease afterward). The gains are<br/>
often streaky as well, I did not gain a<br/>
single point in one 24 lantern pass, only to gain 7 points in the next<br/>
batch. <br/>
<br/>
Two other things.<br/>
1. Don&#39;t try this during primetime.<br/>
2. Don&#39;t do this on days you have enough time to do real adventuring.<br/>
(thats why I am back home in Felwithe - its<br/>
the weekend and I may have some real time to play)</div>
