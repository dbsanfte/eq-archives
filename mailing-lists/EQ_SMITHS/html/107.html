<b>Subject:</b> Re: FW: [EQ_SMITHS] Studs and studded leather armor... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-498763619">ahah!!  I just knew there had to be a market for the stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, are there any smiths on the Tunare server who would like to team up<br/>
with a Tailor?  I am a very skilled tailor, but have not had the training<br/>
points or money to invest in smithing yet.  Please let me know if you are<br/>
interested.<br/>
<br/>
On a second note, I am also very skilled in pottery, so can be of help<br/>
making ceramic linings if you are practicing your skill in smithing with<br/>
items that require those and do not wish to invest in the pottery<br/>
proficiency.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; A freind of mine is a Ranger/Tailor and they have had extensive<br/>
&gt; talks about<br/>
&gt; studed/reenforced on the Ranger mailing list he is on,  He and I<br/>
&gt; are also in<br/>
&gt; bussiness selling the stuff in the Kelethin area (I supply the studs, we<br/>
&gt; both go kill the puma&#39;s for the pelts, and he makes the armour)<br/>
&gt; from what I<br/>
&gt; have been told the ac is a little better on some pieces of armour, where<br/>
&gt; studed and reinforced become usefull is in their absourbtion.  as<br/>
&gt; an example<br/>
&gt; say in leather you get hit for 8 points of dammage the exact same hit in<br/>
&gt; studed armour would do 6 damm and 4 damm in reinforced.  This of course is<br/>
&gt; just an example of the numbers which will probally vary....<br/>
&gt; because of this<br/>
&gt; extra absourbtion and better AC studed/reinforced is well worth it for the<br/>
&gt; people who can&#39;t use better. </span></blockquote></div>
