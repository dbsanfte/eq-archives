<b>Subject:</b> New molds and armor type? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253323820">There&#39;s a couple of interesting rumors that surfaced on an EQSS message <br/>
board about a new armor type, and new weapon molds. I can&#39;t validate either <br/>
one right now, as I&#39;m at work. I wouldn&#39;t even have mentioned them here, or <br/>
even given them a second thought, except for the fact that I&#39;ve spoken with <br/>
3 guides and a GM (approximately 2 weeks ago; all on Bertox) about smithing <br/>
steel/plate armor; all of whom say that the ability to smith weapons and new <br/>
armor types will be eventually added in. They couldn&#39;t give me specifics as <br/>
nothing was finalized, but they eluded to the fact that it would be added in <br/>
soon. Any help in this matter would be appreciated. Here are the 2 rumors:<br/>
<br/>
1.) Supposively there have been weapon molds seen somewhere near the Fishing <br/>
Village in West Karana or the Inn in Qeynos hills. The rumor continues on <br/>
about the molds being recently added in around the same time as the new <br/>
tailoring patterns.<br/>
<br/>
2.) On Tunare, (I believe) someone claims to be able to make &quot;tin&quot; armor. <br/>
This armor is supposed to be as good as banded but much more light weight, <br/>
and is a smithable item.</div>
