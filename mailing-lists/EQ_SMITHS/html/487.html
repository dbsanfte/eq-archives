<b>Subject:</b> Dwarven Plate Armor of Brell Serilis Bugged? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2120483518">This morning, I decided to bite the bullet and try making some of the <br/>
Dwarven Plate Armor of Brell Serilis (skill 178). Much to my <br/>
surprise, all of the recipes on reputable sites (EQ Casters, <br/>
AllaKhazam&#39;s Magical Realm, etc.) were the same, but none of them <br/>
worked!<br/>
<br/>
The Dwarven Plate Armor recipes worked, yet most of the sites just <br/>
added an Imbued Ruby to the list to upgrade Dwarven Plate to Dwarven <br/>
Plate Armor of Brell Serilis. When I made my attempt, the Stormguard <br/>
Forge just spit the components back at me saying that they would not <br/>
combine in those quantities. Fortunately, none of the VERY expensive <br/>
components were lost in the failure (I just closed and reopened the <br/>
forge to find my items waiting for me).<br/>
<br/>
Is the most advanced racial/diety armor bugged, or do we just not <br/>
know what the correct recipe is yet?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help.<br/>
