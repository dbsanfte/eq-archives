<div id="ygrps-yiv-2052004050">Unfortunately trolls do not have cultural amour. They can wear the Ogres<br/>
though. As far as Overthere goes I wouldnt even go there because the prices<br/>
on everything are double and the last time i tryed the forge it was<br/>
unusable. The last time i used Skewer molds was along time ago i purchased<br/>
them in freeport. You may need to have a friend purchase them for you. The<br/>
only bad thing about this is the amout of trips to get your skill up. If its<br/>
possible the best solution is to get your faction up with freeport then go<br/>
there yourself. That or the Iskars **howerver thats spelled** town is a<br/>
option. I know you can get good faction with them because my troll shadow<br/>
knight can enter calibis as long as i avoid necros. =P<br/>
