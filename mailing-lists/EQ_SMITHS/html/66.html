<div id="ygrps-yiv-676756898">An interesting thing occurred the other day.<br/>
<br/>
I had been told that once you &quot;triv out&quot; on a task (i.e. polishing rusty<br/>
weapons) <br/>
you would no longer get a skill increase from that task.  I was polishing a<br/>
rusty<br/>
two-handed sword yesterday (I was at skill level 22) and Lo and behold, I<br/>
got a<br/>
skill increase!<br/>
<br/>
I have been watching closely and I believe you CAn raise skills in the low<br/>
20&#39;s at<br/>
polishing weapons BUT the weapon you polish has a factor.  <br/>
I can polish rusty daggers & short swords with 80% success and never see an<br/>
increase.<br/>
I can polish rusty battle axes, and two handed swords with a 50% success<br/>
and see<br/>
an occasional skill increase even though I am STILL getting the trivial<br/>
message.<br/>
It seems the damage/value of the weapon is included in the difficulty<br/>
formula.<br/>
<br/>
Also, oddly enough I have made 4 metal studs in 5 attempts at a skill level<br/>
of only 23.<br/>
I have yet to see a skill increase making studs even though studs are,<br/>
supposedly,<br/>
a more difficult task than scalers or files.<br/>
I have made 8 files in 10 attempts<br/>
I have made 4 studs in 5 attempts<br/>
<br/>
I bought my blacksmithing to 21 with pracs and the only increases I have<br/>
seen were <br/>
polishing weapons with a sale value of greater than 2 gold.  Obviously I<br/>
HAVE &quot;trived&quot; <br/>
out on the cheaper weapons such as daggers and short swords but this game<br/>
seems <br/>
to reward sacrifice.  Try your polishing on weapons that have a 2+ gold<br/>
monetary value <br/>
and you MAY still get an increase for the effort.  I have.<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, I have yet to see an increase while making bits, files or studs.<br/>
