<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399131751">So you&#39;re trying to say that when you buy a car you&#39;re not paying for the <br/>
people that put it through all of the safety and durability tests that &quot;do <br/>
not NEED to be done?&quot;  Maybe you should change your name from Talthoron to <br/>
Talmoron.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; 1 - NEVER buy any CD for more than 10 cents. They&#39;re just shiny <br/>
&gt;pieces of<br/>
&gt; &gt; plastic<br/>
&gt; &gt;  that only cost 10 cents to produce. Since you don&#39;t pay for any <br/>
&gt;overhead and<br/>
&gt; &gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt;  simply sticking to cost, this is the most you should ever let yourself <br/>
&gt;pay<br/>
&gt; &gt; for a<br/>
&gt; &gt;  CD of any kind.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I see your not paying attention.  when you buy a CD your not just buying <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;shiny piece of plastic.  you are paying for what is one it, you are <br/>
&gt;paying<br/>
&gt; &gt; for someone to put it on there as well.  You are not paying for someone <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; check each one to make sure it was done right as it was supposed to have <br/>
&gt;been<br/>
&gt; &gt; done right in the first place.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  2 - Never ever rent anything or visit a video arcade You aren&#39;t <br/>
&gt;actually<br/>
&gt; &gt; buying<br/>
&gt; &gt;  anything, and therefore aren&#39;t aquiring these precious materials that <br/>
&gt;are all<br/>
&gt; &gt;  anybody ever charges for. If you don&#39;t get materials, they don&#39;t lose<br/>
&gt; &gt; materials,<br/>
&gt; &gt;  so they should charge nothing because they are losing nothing. If you <br/>
&gt;pay<br/>
&gt; &gt; more<br/>
&gt; &gt;  than nothing, you are again violating your own principles.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t rent =)  and why go to an arcade?  I have a computer to play <br/>
&gt;games on.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  3 - Don&#39;t buy gas for your car. Don&#39;t even buy a car! The gas for your <br/>
&gt;car is<br/>
&gt; &gt;  sold in bulk, and therefore at discount. When you buy gas from a gas<br/>
&gt; &gt; station, it<br/>
&gt; &gt;  has gone through several middlemen who add a little to the price each <br/>
&gt;time.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Since<br/>
&gt; &gt;  you could buy petroleum from the middle east and process it yourself <br/>
&gt;for no<br/>
&gt; &gt; more<br/>
&gt; &gt;  than cost, you shouldn&#39;t pay the price a gas station will charge <br/>
&gt;because it<br/>
&gt; &gt; has<br/>
&gt; &gt;  been marked up several times. Same goes for cars. No car company that I <br/>
&gt;know<br/>
&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt;  mines the metal it needs and then shapes it into the parts needed for <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; car.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  This again means middlemen and markups, so if you want a car, you need <br/>
&gt;to go<br/>
&gt; &gt; mine<br/>
&gt; &gt;  all the materials yourself, process even more petroleum into the <br/>
&gt;plastics<br/>
&gt; &gt; needed,<br/>
&gt; &gt;  build your own engine and any other moving parts, and put it all <br/>
&gt;together<br/>
&gt; &gt;  yourself. This way you make sure to not pay anything more than cost of<br/>
&gt; &gt; materials.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; again, your just looking at the materials, you pay for materials and the <br/>
&gt;work<br/>
&gt; &gt; it takes to make it into what you want.  You are not paying for someone <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; check and recheck that work, etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  4 - Refuse paychecks from your place of employment. The only things <br/>
&gt;ever<br/>
&gt; &gt; paid for<br/>
&gt; &gt;  are material costs, time and work aren&#39;t included.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  5 - If you ever get into a legal battle, don&#39;t hire an attorney. The <br/>
&gt;paper<br/>
&gt; &gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt;  used on your case does not cost what they charge you. Since they are <br/>
&gt;charging<br/>
&gt; &gt;  more than cost, you must refuse to pay them and therefore boycott their<br/>
&gt; &gt; services.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  You can represent yourself for cost.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; again and again &lt;sighs&gt;  materials+the accual work that it takes, not <br/>
&gt;all the<br/>
&gt; &gt; etra work that doesnt&#39; NEED to be done.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Yes, I know this is all rather ridiculous, but that&#39;s what things would <br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt; &gt; like<br/>
&gt; &gt;  if you really followed your ideas here. It&#39;s almost as bad as saying <br/>
&gt;&#39;don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; use<br/>
&gt; &gt;  plastic, they charge too much!&#39;. Well... where would you be without <br/>
&gt;plastic?<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Think along those lines... where would you be without business? If <br/>
&gt;everybody<br/>
&gt; &gt;  charged for cost and nothing more, employees wouldn&#39;t get paid and all<br/>
&gt; &gt; businesses<br/>
&gt; &gt;  would eventually collapse because any failures they made over the years<br/>
&gt; &gt; would add<br/>
&gt; &gt;  up. Since they only charge what it costs them, they don&#39;t make any <br/>
&gt;money in<br/>
&gt; &gt; their<br/>
&gt; &gt;  business so everything comes from their pockets. Since other businesses <br/>
&gt;can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;  afford to pay employees, there is nowhere else to work to gain any <br/>
&gt;money.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Timber!! There goes business as we know it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Seriously, reconsider what you&#39;re saying here. It makes absolutely no <br/>
&gt;sense.<br/>
&gt; &gt; We<br/>
&gt; &gt;  all know EQ isn&#39;t a real economy (it&#39;s downright terrible). Actually, <br/>
&gt;it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; weaker<br/>
&gt; &gt;  than a real economy. You see what charging for cost does to a real <br/>
&gt;economy,<br/>
&gt; &gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt;  you imagine what it would do to EQ&#39;s? It would be nearly irreversible. <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt; &gt; can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;  begin to explain the damages your ideas will cause if they are <br/>
&gt;practiced by<br/>
&gt; &gt; all.<br/>

&gt;taking<br/>
&gt; &gt; half of what I said.  perhaps you should go back and reread it.<br/>
