&gt;Subject: Raising from level 26<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I can get to level 26 in smithing pretty easily. After this I have heard a <br/>
&gt;few ways to raise skills here. Skewers, (skalers?), or large lanterns. I <br/>

less fails so you make back some money.  After that start skewers till it<br/>
no longer gives you skill(90`s).  After skwers no longer give you skill<br/>
start trying banded gorgets, I heard they are the easiest.  Stick with<br/>
things that only need one sheet metal, then move to things that need two<br/>
sheet metal and so on....<br/>
<br/>
Now large lanterns, from what I have heard, can be uses insted of the<br/>
skewer stage.  They seem to make more money back.  You make large lanterns<br/>
till skill 70`s then you start on the skewers when you get to the 90`s.  By<br/>
this time most ammor pieces should be easy.  <br/>
