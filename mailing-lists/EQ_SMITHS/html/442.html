&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi there,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just made 40 in smithing.  I tried to research what to do next,<br/>
&gt; but I am finding conficting information.  Should I be making<br/>
&gt; lanterns or skewers now?  Or should I be making something else?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks very much for your help,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The progression is metal bits (21), scalers (41), lanterns (68), skewers<br/>
(115), pots (122) and finally sewing kits (135).  Everything you need to<br/>
make metal bits is in N Freeport.  Everything else is in E Freeport until<br/>
you are ready to make sewing kits.  When you reach skill 122, pick up and go<br/>
to high pass hold to the Serpent&#39;s Supply.  There is a forge right next to<br/>
the vendor with needle and thimble molds.  This is kinda important for your<br/>
sanity because sewing kits are containers and take up a whole inventory<br/>
slot.  The postition of the vendor means you can simply turn around and sell<br/>
off your kits to make room for more.  Personally, I had alot of trouble<br/>
making armor profitably until I maxed my skill out with the sewing kits.<br/>
Also, note that many of the guides out there have incorrect information on<br/>
how to make cloaks.  The correct formula is mold + 2 metal sheets (not 3!) +<br/>
water.<br/>

Welcome to the wonderful art of smithing.</div>
