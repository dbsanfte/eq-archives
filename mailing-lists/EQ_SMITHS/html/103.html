<b>Subject:</b> FW: [EQ_SMITHS] Studs and studded leather armor... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043208871">There are several classes that CAN&#39;T wear banded.  So there is a definite<br/>
market for the studded and reinforced leather.  But, as mentioned before, if<br/>
the studded isn&#39;t any better than leather, it is more of a skill-builder<br/>
than anything.  I imagine sales on reinforced would be quite nice, however.<br/>

&gt; Problem is it cost so much to make studded and boned people would rather<br/>
&gt; buy banded.<br/>
