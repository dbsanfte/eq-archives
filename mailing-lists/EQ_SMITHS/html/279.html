<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603340816">If you even bother selling for these prices you are part of the problem. I<br/>
am not meaning this as an attack at you, but rather as an observation. As I<br/>
stated I don&#39;t care that much as I simply won&#39;t sell at these prices I would<br/>
rather hunt somwhere and get exp and loot than waste my time making banded<br/>
armor.<br/>
<br/>
The way I see it is if most smiths stick to a reasonable price the populace<br/>
will have to pay for it. Sure there will always be someone who will sell<br/>
stupidly cheap but if that is an exception rather than a rule they can&#39;t<br/>
possibly keep up with demand. I still sell a little at the prices I<br/>
mentioned earlier I may not sell as much as others but I make just as much<br/>
money in less time. Seems to make sense to me.<br/>

&gt;On the Karana Server, prices have hit the floor.  The following is what I<br/>
&gt;sell at (and I have stock in my bank that has been there for weeks):<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;bracers, gorgets, helms, boots, arms, masks, belts - 5p<br/>
&gt;mantles and cloaks 10p<br/>
&gt;tunic and legs - 13p<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now this is rediculous but I have masks, arms and mantles in the bank that<br/>
