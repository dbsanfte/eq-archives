&gt; What level should i make banded armor and studs at? I&#39;m level 20 in smithing,<br/>
&gt; what should i make? Also, i&#39;m in kelethin and they only have medium molds for<br/>
&gt; banded armor, where can i get small molds for banded armor? Thanks<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was told to wait until my skill is over 50 before even attempting to<br/>
make<br/>
banded armor.  Then wait till over 60 before expecting to make it<br/>
regulary.<br/>
Finally,  over 70 to make other banded other than gorgets/bracers<br/>
<br/>
As for small molds,  I believe you will need to go to Kaladim or<br/>
similar.  Right now<br/>
all I have found are mediums in Freeport</div>
