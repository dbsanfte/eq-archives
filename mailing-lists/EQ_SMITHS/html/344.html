&gt;I think the best solution for enchanted armor is to allow metal &gt;sheets to <br/>
&gt;be made of precious metals. Then enchanters would already &gt;have the spells <br/>
&gt;implemented. We&#39;d be able to make enchanted silver &gt;banded, enchanted <br/>
&gt;electrum banded, enchanted gold banded, and &gt;enchanted platinum banded :) <br/>
&gt;That&#39;d be neat, and it&#39;s the easiest to &gt;implement...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I thought about that as well. Guess it&#39;s a matter of implementing it though. <br/>
I also like the idea of a tag to show who made the item. Not sure if it&#39;s <br/>
feasible or not.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also like to see being able to use other ores/metals as well, (like <br/>
steel, admanatium, bronze etc.) and to be able to smith weapons (using these <br/>
ores as well). Perhaps quests could lead to the discovery of these <br/>
metals/ore locations?</div>
