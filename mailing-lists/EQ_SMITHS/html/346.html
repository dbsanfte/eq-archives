<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927842125">i think this is a REALLY good idea, but verant is too busy now fixing bugs, <br/>
and updating spells etc.. so i think it&#39;ll be a long time before they get <br/>
around to it. someone should inform them of this good idea though. is there <br/>
mithril and adamantium in this game already? i&#39;m only a level 15 so i haven&#39;t <br/>
found anything yet.</div>
