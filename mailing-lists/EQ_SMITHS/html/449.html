Well, there are new items for smiths to make since this mornings patch.<br/>
Time for people to collate our info on where, what and how much.  So far, I<br/>
have uncovered 3 new items we can make.  The molds are available from a<br/>
vendor near the entrance to Kaladim, in Butcher Block. </span></blockquote></div>
