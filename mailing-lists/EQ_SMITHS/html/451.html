<b>Subject:</b> Banded Guantlets <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-651905823">I have heard from half a dozen people that banded guantlets were introduced<br/>
in the last patch, including a person who claims to have actually seen a<br/>
pair.  Anyone know anything about this?<br/>
<br/>
Also, does anyone know any place near Freeport (that an Erudite can buy<br/>
from) that sells large molds?</div>
