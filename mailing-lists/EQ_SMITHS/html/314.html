I created this list in hopes of people sharing their experiences and<br/>
knowledge on any types of smithing within Everquest -- lets try to stop the<br/>
flames and get back to all being friends. =)  Anyone else posting flames<br/>
will be removed and banned from the list, so lets try to keep it all<br/>
civilized!<br/>
<br/>
On that note, if ya have smithy friends, please tell them about the list and<br/>
to subscribe!  The more people involved, the more knowledge we all have to<br/>
draw upon.<br/>
