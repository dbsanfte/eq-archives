<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155061216">Hail Smiths of Norrath:<br/>
<br/>
I am Praetor, level 10 Paladin on the Rodcet Nife Server, and a recent addition to<br/>
the smithing trade.  Before I continue with my occupation in Smithing, however, I<br/>
have some very simple questions that I believe are important to all beginning<br/>
smiths, as well as non-smiths.<br/>
<br/>
#1 - Where is the closest place that a smith in Qeynos may purchase basic smithing<br/>
items (i.e. Metal Bits, scraps, bars, blocks, File Molds, etc.)?<br/>
<br/>
#2 - At what skill level should a Smith begin to create Banded armor, and what type<br/>
should be produced first (i.e. Boots, Belts, Leggings, etc.)?<br/>
<br/>
#3 - What are the standard prices on Studs and Banded armor (both minimum and<br/>
maximum prices)?<br/>
<br/>
#4 - Are there any other things that Smiths can produce, other than in the Basic<br/>
Blacksmithing Books (i.e. non-Banded armor, weapons, etc.)?<br/>
<br/>
Thank all of you in advance for your time!<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Praetor</div>
