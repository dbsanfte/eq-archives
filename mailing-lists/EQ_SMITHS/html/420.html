<div id="ygrps-yiv-473784172">i made lanterns until trivial. Then skewers until trivial. That took me to <br/>
level 115 i believe. sewing kits until 135..after that its just making the <br/>
armor that raises your skill. Bracers and gorgets are easy to make at like <br/>
around 80 or 90..at least for me they were.  All other items are pretty <br/>
sucessfull too around 115..except leggins and mail.  Their the hardest.  Ive <br/>
given up on smithing...i put so much money into with nothing to show for it. <br/>
  Everyone sells stuff for so cheap... just not worth while.  good luck</div>
