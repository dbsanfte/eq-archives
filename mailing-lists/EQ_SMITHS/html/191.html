&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hello everyone,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I used some bits made by another smith to try to practice my<br/>
&gt;blacksmithing tonight and I failed on all 20 times to advance my<br/>
&gt;blacksmithing skill.  Also, using store bought metal sheets making<br/>
&gt;banded armor, I failed every time to advance my skill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My question is:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Do you have to make your own components in order for your<br/>
&gt;skill to advance or was this just bad luck?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks<br/>
&gt;David<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What&#39;s your smithing skill at? I to use store bought metal sheets, and have <br/>
had little problems using them (other than trying to make banded with a low <br/>
smithing skill level; I&#39;ve had less than a 30% success rate and I&#39;m <br/>
currently at 43; I&#39;ve been told to hold off on making banded until around <br/>
skill level 80). Also, depending on what your smithing skill level is would <br/>
determine what I&#39;d recommend using to advance your smithing further.<br/>
