<b>Subject:</b> Power Smithing (what I have learned so far) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-44383700">Well I decided to become a smith, as my character about dead-ended on<br/>
the tailoring route. BTW, I am<br/>
on the Rathe Server (Archonon)<br/>
<br/>
I started with a 10 skill, and now have 40. I have spent 62p doing this<br/>
and have the system figured out<br/>
pretty well. I have 100p left to spend, afterward I will have to go out<br/>
and earn some spending cash or<br/>
sell some stuff off..... (I think its more fun to go earn the money<br/>
however)<br/>
<br/>
From x-20 points of skills just make metal bits, and don&#39;t sell them!<br/>
When you cross 20 skill just make<br/>
as many as ore you have left on hand. <br/>
<br/>
Then fall into this rotation.... buy and use enough skewer molds to use<br/>
up all the metal bits you have<br/>
assembled (try to do a min of 20-30 per cycle). When you run out of<br/>
bits, go make more, on the order<br/>
of 100 or so (meaning 200ore + 100water + extras for all the failures)<br/>
<br/>
Then just turn them all into skewers (I have made 9-12 skewers). You<br/>
will fail all the time, but you still<br/>
gain skill points from failure. If your lucky you can sell a skewer back<br/>
to make up some lost cash, but<br/>
not much. Never sell the metal bits, its better to just bank them until<br/>
you can afford to smith more.<br/>
<br/>
The key is too build up a big supply of bits so that your skewer<br/>
creation attempts run one after the other<br/>
as this seems to affect the skill rewarding.<br/>
<br/>
So far the average cost has been 21-24gold per point of skill. <br/>
<br/>
11 copper per water,  56 copper per ore,  89 copper per mold.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The last step in all of this is!!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
GO BACK AND BEG YOUR FRIENDS TO LET YOU BACK INTO THE GROUP!!! ;)<br/>
<br/>
(actually I am only spending the weekday nights doing this (90 mins a<br/>
night) and will rejoin the groups I<br/>
usually find by Saturday)</div>
