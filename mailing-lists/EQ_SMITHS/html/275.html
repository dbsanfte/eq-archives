<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-281393854">On the Karana Server, prices have hit the floor.  The following is what I <br/>
sell at (and I have stock in my bank that has been there for weeks):<br/>
<br/>
bracers, gorgets, helms, boots, arms, masks, belts - 5p<br/>
mantles and cloaks 10p<br/>
tunic and legs - 13p<br/>
<br/>
Now this is rediculous but I have masks, arms and mantles in the bank that I <br/>
cant get rid of at these prices.  Go figure.  (smithing skill 135).<br/>
