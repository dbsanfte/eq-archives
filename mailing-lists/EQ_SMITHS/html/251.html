&gt;Kale,<br/>
&gt;If you have a problem do the following:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1. Call Verant and resolve it by phone.<br/>
&gt;2. Don&#39;t cross post your bitching to nearly 10 special interest game <br/>
&gt;groups.<br/>
&gt;3. If no solution repeat from step 1.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think the members of many of those groups, including people like me who <br/>
&gt;are on<br/>
&gt;more than one of them would be very appreciative.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>OK PEOPLE! ENOUGH ABOUT IT ALREADY! The newsgroup moderators already have <br/>
extremely large chunks of my behind about the multiple crosspostings, so let <br/>
it be! I was only asking for some help, and will admit that I let my <br/>
emotions get the better of me (hence my whining). LET IT DROP! You&#39;re just <br/>
adding to the &quot;spam&quot; that no one wanted to and/or wants to see here.<br/>
<br/>
To all those whom I offended, I apologize. I cross posted hoping that <br/>
someone could help me out. Instead, I started a major flame war. All I can <br/>
say..... LET IT BE! IT&#39;S OVER! NOW DROP IT WILL YOU?!?!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the last public crosspost of an extremely off topic subject that I&#39;ll <br/>
post. Now I&#39;ll take my own advice, get off the soapbox I&#39;m on, and drop it <br/>
leaving the matter be (IE - the last time I&#39;ll bring it up or crosspost; I <br/>
promise).</div>
