<b>Subject:</b> Leather backing <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-307970869">To make leather backing you must have a small sewing kit. First you <br/>
put in 2 spiderling silks and combine to make silk thred. Then you <br/>
put the silk thred and a med. quality pelt of desired size into the <br/>
kit and combine. That is how you make the leather backing . Also a <br/>
note my tailoring skill is only 26 and i can make the backing about <br/>
half the time so get the skill up some if you do alot of plate mail.</div>
