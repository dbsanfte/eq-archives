<div id="ygrps-yiv-652534112">I work now for a company which does product development for government<br/>
and Civilian customers.  This is also not the first company like this I<br/>
have worked for.  It is in the Aerospace field.  I often bid jobs and<br/>
work up what the overall price will be to do a certain job.  Believe me<br/>
when I say failures and scrap are included in the price.  Now I do<br/>
estimate a certain percentage of scrap in the final price.  That means<br/>
that any failures or waste over that I have to eat.  GM, Boeing,<br/>
Gateway, and every other company operates the same way.  t is how you<br/>
make profit.<br/>
