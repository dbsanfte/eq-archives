<b>Subject:</b> At what point does a smith become fully functional? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331668103">I am a new smith on the Erollisi Marr server.  I have gotten my skill up to 112 but have only made one piece of banded armor so far.  I figure skewers are good for another 3 points and then I could move onto pots and sewing kits if needed.  My question is at what point can a smith make banded cloaks with a reasonable degree of success?  Should I quit trying to raise my skill and graduate to only making armor or should I blow the rest of my platinum on pots and sewing kits?  Anyone have any experience with trying to make the cloaks with only 112-115 skill level?  Does it become much more cost effective (ie does it greatly increase you success rate) to move from 115 (skewers) to 122 (pots) and then 135 (sewing kits).  The only reference I have for this is a guide to blacksmithing that says my skill needs to be 145 to make cloaks.  I see no way to bring it to that level except by making armor.</div>
