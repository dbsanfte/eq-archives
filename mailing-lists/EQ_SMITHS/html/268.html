&gt; I just read someone selling banded gorgets for 8pp and banded bracers for<br/>
&gt; 6pp or something like that?  Selling 2 banded bracers for 14pp????  Is<br/>

&gt; I try selling banded bracers on my server (Bertox) for 4pp each, 7pp a<br/>

&gt; All of us blacksmiths need to figure out a SET price for banded.  The norm<br/>
&gt; that we ALL will follow.  This way, no matter where you go, all will KNOW<br/>
&gt; the minimums to banded.  They can still bid over it if there is a &quot;bidding<br/>
&gt; war&quot;, but we all need to have the same prices.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That will never happen, there will always be a person or two who will<br/>
undersell the others, and then the customers will want it for his/her price.<br/>
However, these people will forever be in the minority, since they will<br/>
quickly realize that they can not supply enough of the items to make a<br/>
decent profit.  Even if they never fail, they simply will not make enough<br/>
money for them to want to continue to invest so much time into it.  And even<br/>
if do?  Well, kudos to them, as they have done what the player driven<br/>
economy is all about, undersold their competition.  Sounds a bit like real<br/>
life doesn&#39;t it?  But think about it this way, even if you do half the<br/>
business of those types, and you are charging double the price, you are<br/>
still making the same as them for half the work.  As for people who always<br/>
want to buy cheaper and cheaper, well guess what, it&#39;s not going to go that<br/>
low, at least not consistently.  Those that ask for such abysmally low<br/>
prices have probably seen someone sell for that price, either one of the<br/>
above mentioned lowballers, or someone who simply no longer needed the<br/>
items, and wanted to get rid of them quickly.  If they continue to seek such<br/>
a low price, they will probably eventually get it, of course they may be in<br/>
their high teens, low twenties and still in mostly patchwork....<br/>
