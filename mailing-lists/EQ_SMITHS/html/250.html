<div id="ygrps-yiv-1304834330">The help files on EQVault also said three sheets for a cloak. That is NOT<br/>
correct. Cloaks take two sheets. My skill is 126 and I have been making<br/>
cloaks since I as about 120 with reasonable success. Lately I have been<br/>
noticing that mantles are failing alot. Not many problems with anything else<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
However with the current economy on Karana I have not made any as I can make<br/>
more pp by going to unrest. I get exp that way too...<br/>

&gt;&gt;Subject: Levels for banded<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt;&gt;I just hit 102 in smithing last night, and I still have a pretty high<br/>
&gt;&gt;failure rate for some pieces of banded (especially cloaks - I&#39;m 0 for 20<br/>
&gt;&gt;with those for some reason). Does anyone know the levels at which the<br/>
&gt;&gt;various banded pieces become trivial (and thus their difficulty)?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I know that bracers are trivial for me, and gorgets probably are too, but<br/>
&gt;&gt;what about the rest?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Thanks<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This should be of some help.<br/>
