<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629406281">Time for me to disagree here.  Think of the alternatives:<br/>
<br/>
1.  The game is still buggy, lets delay shipment until the game is<br/>
no longer buggy.  (That means YOU don&#39;t get to play)  <br/>
The might still be working on this game getting the bugs out.  You<br/>
would still be playing Quake2.<br/>
<br/>
2.  The game is still buggy, exec&#39;s at Verant decide to can this project<br/>
since the bugs will never be worked out and it just isn&#39;t feasible.<br/>
YOU never get to play.<br/>
<br/>
3.  The release this game in March, you get to enjoy the game, albiet with<br/>
a few bugs.  Play around the bugs, live with the bugs because the rest<br/>
of the gaming experience is so fun.  <br/>
<br/>
If you honestly feel that you shouldn&#39;t play this game until the bugs are<br/>
worked out.  Cancel your account, and I will email you when the last bug<br/>
is gone, at which time you can open a new account.<br/>

&gt; I have to say I disagree with the way you feel.  We all bought and paid for <br/>
&gt; a game that we love playing.  We all pay money each month to play this game <br/>
&gt; online.  As a programmer myself I feel as if the bugs should have been <br/>
&gt; worked out by now.  I have gone through this same routine with the guys at <br/>
&gt; Verant and can say it is the worst customer service that I have ever <br/>
&gt; received.  I sat online for 4 hours waiting for a GM to help me out and <br/>
&gt; still no one came.  Sure there are a few hundred people saying they lost <br/>
&gt; things when they really didn&#39;t lose anything at all..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m still waiting for an email regarding a video problem that I&#39;m having. I <br/>
&gt; switched video cards and can&#39;t get the game to work properly.  I&#39;ve been <br/>
&gt; waiting for that email for 2 1/2 weeks now....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When game companies release a game they should make sure that the bugs are <br/>
&gt; pretty much gone after beta testing.  Sure there are going to be problems, <br/>
&gt; but then these companies should have the support needed to  help customers <br/>
&gt; out..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; IMO<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thx<br/>

&gt; 	I know how you feel, but I don&#39;t have a solution for you.  I have lost<br/>
&gt; a character before on the Karan server when it was crashing all of the<br/>
&gt; time.<br/>
&gt; Lost a level 12 char with full banded.  Luckly for me I had some friends<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; were able to get me some patchwork armor and a mino axe and worked my<br/>
&gt; way back<br/>
&gt; to where I was.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I feel as though I&#39;m getting the raw end of the deal from Verant. I lost <br/>
&gt; 10<br/>
&gt; &gt; P and an Opalline earring (paid 25 P for it) off an alt character, due to<br/>
&gt; &gt; yet another bug/glitch with the boat. I&#39;ve done everything I can possibly<br/>
&gt; &gt; think of, (/tell, /shout, /petition, /bug, /feedback, and email directly <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; a GM at the suggestion of a Guide) to get this equipment restored. And <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; done them all numerous times and still nothing!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; One Guide told me that a request to have my equipment restored had been<br/>
&gt; &gt; forwarded, and that it would take 2 days at most to get it restored (now<br/>
&gt; &gt; going onto day 4); quite truthfully, I&#39;m more upset at losing the <br/>
&gt; opalline<br/>
&gt; &gt; earring than any of the other gear (it being the hardest and most <br/>
&gt; expensive<br/>
&gt; &gt; to replace); and still nothing has been said or done about it - no email, <br/>
&gt; no<br/>
&gt; &gt; /tell&#39;s, no nothing in any way shape or form to explain what the holdup <br/>
&gt; is.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In fact, all I keep getting from most of the Guides about anything, is <br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m too busy right now. Please /petition it.&quot; If I petition one more <br/>
&gt; time<br/>
&gt; &gt; and get no response, I&#39;m going to scream! As a matter of fact, I still <br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; a petition in queue right now in the queue of my primary character and <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; alt that lost the equipment, and guess what, it&#39;s still not answered!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; What I&#39;d like, is for any Verant employee/cohort to sit up and take <br/>
&gt; notice,<br/>
&gt; &gt; or for anyone who has an idea about how to get this situation taken care <br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; to submit their suggestions via post or email, so that I can get this<br/>
&gt; &gt; straightened out once and for all!!! I&#39;m sick to death of hearing &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; too<br/>
&gt; &gt; busy&quot; or &quot;It&#39;s not our policy&quot; or &quot;Sorry. It&#39;s against policy to do <br/>
&gt; that&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve done everything I can short of calling Verant&#39;s support hotline, <br/>
&gt; like<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m supposed to! Are you GM&#39;s and Guides there just to create lag? Or for<br/>
&gt; &gt; once will you do what it is that you&#39;re s there to do? Customer support!<br/>
&gt; &gt; ****(I&#39;m not holding my breath!!!!!!!!!!!)****<br/>
