<div id="ygrps-yiv-527466688">Wow, a whole 2-3p? Good luck.<br/>
<br/>
The pelts are EXTREMELY rare. As a tailor who has been searching for those<br/>
pelts, I can say that I don&#39;t think I would sell a pack for less than 20p.<br/>
And I know at least a dozen people who would jump at the chance to get one<br/>
that cheap.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, the going rate on my server is 5-10p to make the pack for you if<br/>
you supply the pelt.<br/>
<br/>
When I go around trying to find pelts, I offer 1p for the raw pelt. So far<br/>
I&#39;ve been able to buy 5. That&#39;s after 4 weeks of searching. Every time I<br/>
enter or leaave a zone I auction for them, and soemtimes if I spend a long<br/>
time in a zone I&#39;ll auction again. All that, and only 5 pelts have turned<br/>
up. I&#39;ve also spent a large portion of time killing bears. Not one single HQ<br/>
skin has fallen out of a bear I&#39;ve attacked.<br/>
<br/>
I pass all my skins on to my friend who is a better tailor than I. After 15<br/>
attempts at backpacks, we&#39;ve only made 2.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you need to rethink how much you are willing to pay.<br/>

backpacks,  yet I can never find anyone making them!<br/>

10 spaces! - with my normal &quot;smithing setup&quot; that gives me 14 more slots<br/>
to dump stuff into!<br/>
