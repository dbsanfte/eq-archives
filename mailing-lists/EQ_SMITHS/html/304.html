<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909707855">Fleetwood, the top maker of moter homes and RV&#39;s, Pella, the number one maker <br/>
of window, GM (which has been mentioned) all will tell you the same thing, <br/>
Screw ups, inspections, the people working in the office, the people who <br/>
drive the fork lefts carting material all day....all the work they do and <br/>
much work that others do is NOT what the costumer buys.  The customer buys <br/>
what it takes to make the product and that is all.  They are not paying for <br/>
the time it takes to train John Doe, not for the time it takes for someone to <br/>
fix or check his work. They do not pay for the people to run the accounts, <br/>
they do not pay for the guy to drive around on a forklift.  Would you?<br/>
<br/>
When you buy something, do you want to pay for all that extra that had <br/>
nothing to do with building your car?  You can say it did have something to <br/>
do with your car, but the fact of the matter it isn&#39;t.  Efficency is the key. <br/>
 If the people doing the paid for work are good enough, then THEY pay the <br/>
cost of all that excess.  I don&#39;t charge people for me learning to smith, I <br/>
don&#39;t charge for failure rates.  I charge for my work and the matrials needed <br/>
to make the given item.  I have about the same prices.  I guess I just value <br/>
my work more then you do yours.<br/>
