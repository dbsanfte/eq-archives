Well some people are trying to get money by giving their knowledge in blacksmithing to others. You must have seen the posts on the Everquest official website. Some guys offered to tell you the building order to become a Master blacksmith in no time IF you gave them a certain amount of pp. I am sure that they were not trying to trick anybody BUT knowledge should be free, everyone should have acces to it IMO.<br/>
So is someone on this list a master Smith and knows the magic build order to go from skill 0 to 135 in notime ??<br/>
I would love (and i am sure i am not alone) to see a complete guide on smithing.<br/>
After all that is the purpose of this list isn&#39;it ?<br/>
<br/>
I hope to be enlighten by your knowledge very soon.<br/>
