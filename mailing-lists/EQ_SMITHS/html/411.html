&lt;&lt; Make skewers to get your skill up, these are good until skill 115, although<br/>
 around skill 110, I was good enough at making banded that I stopped advancing<br/>
 my skill and just made armor for sale.  I believe after skewers you can<br/>
 make skewing kits up to skill 175. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes...you will save money in the long run bringing your skill to 115 with <br/>
skewers... Then...if you want and have a little extra money...and a bit of <br/>
extra time...Sewing Kits will bring your skill to 135...to get to 175, you&#39;ll <br/>
need to make banded...the problem is, is that only banded Cloaks, Mantles and <br/>
Leggings are not trivial at 135.</div>
