&gt; <br/>
&gt; Was wondering if someone would be so kind as to post/repost a complete<br/>
&gt; listing of items you can create/make with blacksmithing, the approximate<br/>
&gt; level they become trivial, the minimum skill level you&#39;d recommend before<br/>
&gt; trying to create/make them, and the approximate resale value to other<br/>
&gt; players. I know this was posted once before, but don&#39;t know what happened to<br/>
&gt; my copy - (I guess that&#39;s what I get for using a free email service). Thanks<br/>
&gt; in advance! </span></blockquote></div>
