<div id="ygrps-yiv-837898451"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; It&#39;s more cost effective to work your skill to 135 and then start making<br/>
&gt; cloaks. At skill lvl 145, you&#39;ll be making them with about a 30%<br/>
&gt; success (or<br/>
&gt; so I&#39;m led to believe; could be wrong though).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My skill is at 122.  I can&#39;t find needle molds (although the thimble molds<br/>
are near the forge in East Freeport), at least on E. Marr.  My intelligence<br/>
is tweaked at like 165 and my wisdom is about 90 (I have several nice stat<br/>
items, hehehe), yet I&#39;m still having trouble breaking even selling banded<br/>
because of all the failures.  I can make anything up to a coif with a normal<br/>
amount of failures but mantles, belts, leggings and tunics kill me (maybe<br/>
30% success on the mantle and belts and 20% on the leggings and tunics.  I<br/>
have been completely unsuccessful making cloaks (8 attempts all failures).<br/>
Is this normal?  Would working my skill to 135 fix this?  What is everyone<br/>
elses experiencing with success rates since this weeks patch?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know where I can find both the needle and thimble molds, preferably<br/>
near Freeport?</div>
