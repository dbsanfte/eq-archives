<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-460225973">I think many would appreciate it, and that it would benefit us all, if<br/>
the smiths on the list could work together (through posting) to assmble<br/>
a listing by zone location what items and/or equipment are available<br/>
there as relating to smithing.  For example, Rivervale doesn&#39;t sell ore<br/>
but does have a few molds of various types available, and also does<br/>
have a forge.  Those with information of one zone or another, please<br/>
ante up.<br/>
<br/>
Small pieces of ore, small blocks, large blocks<br/>
Molds (what kind; especially file, skewer, scaler and armor molds)<br/>
Forges<br/>
Smithing in-game books (the books you buy on the subject)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m interested how many areas actually enable one to smith without<br/>
having to run back and forth between multiple zones.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance<br/>
