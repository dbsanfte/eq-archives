<div id="ygrps-yiv-984523838">I&#39;ve yet to see any either, but it seems like there would be a good market<br/>
for studded and bonned armor for those people who can&#39;t quite yet afford<br/>
banded and already have leather....assuming that the AC is actually better.<br/>

&gt; Subject: [EQ_SMITHS] Studs and studded leather armor...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is it worth making studded leather armor?  I have never seen<br/>
&gt; studded leather in any form, and I have seen websites that say<br/>
&gt; studded leather has the same AC as leather, and I have seen sites<br/>
&gt; that say studded leather is between leather and chain.  My<br/>
&gt; character Cassin (Povar), is both a tailor and a smith (and not<br/>
&gt; very good at either!), so I was wondering if this would be a<br/>
&gt; smart endeavour.<br/>
