<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271531850">Here is one thing to try, use summoned water which probably won&#39;t work but might be worth the try.  The reason I say summoned probably won&#39;t work is I hear there will be a new enchanter spell<br/>
where you can enchant metal sheets or something like that.  So you enchant the sheet then use it to make something like you would jewlery but now the iteam has effects.  Ask or scower around<br/>
yourself and look for enchanter spells that can do this or hell ask a GM if its in the game they should be able to give you a solid no if it isn&#39;t.</div>
