&lt;&lt; If you even bother selling for these prices you are part of the problem. I<br/>
 am not meaning this as an attack at you, but rather as an observation. As I<br/>
 stated I don&#39;t care that much as I simply won&#39;t sell at these prices I would<br/>
 rather hunt somwhere and get exp and loot than waste my time making banded<br/>
 armor. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I dot make it, it is left over inventory that I have in the bank that I have <br/>
been trying to get rid of for weeks.  I made some for the sole purpose of <br/>
practice and now I cant dump it.  I would not normally sell for that low.  If <br/>
you every hear my sales pitch you will hear me say that I am having a <br/>
&quot;clearance sale.&quot;  When I dump these items, my prices will likely go back up.<br/>
