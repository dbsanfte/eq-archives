<div id="ygrps-yiv-1432709485">Sorry if this comes across wrong, but why do you enjoy having a virtual job so much?  You pay Verant to have a job, I don&#39;t get it, I&#39;m sure you have fun at it or whatever, but I would just like to understand the reasoning behind paying to have a virtual job?<br/>

Well, this is sort of a mini-rant / praise for verant..  On one hand, verant let<br/>
the pottery/brewing problem go on for FAR to long. One day would have been enough<br/>
to fix it.. Then on the other hand, I got on this morning to crys of anguish..<br/>
Was MUSIC to my smithing ears.. &quot;WTF my pottery/brewing dosen&#39;t make money<br/>
anymore&quot;  &quot;Why can&#39;t I sell mindless amounts of x-product back the merchant for a<br/>
huge profit&quot;  I was rolling in my chair laughing at these people.. some stuck<br/>
with tons of brewing materials that will net them nothing.  Well, That is only a<br/>
childish reaction from me, for that I guess I should be sorry.. But Verant still<br/>
needs to FIX the trade skills.  I don&#39;t care if your a smith, brewer, fletcher..<br/>
All the trade skills are broken.  Only Jewelry is even close to being useful.<br/>
But it to will go the way of the banded armor, once the market is flooded with<br/>
items that can&#39;t break, and will pretty much never get lost.  I mean right now<br/>
the only way to lose a single item is to have your coprse disappear.. That dosent<br/>
have very often once people get past 6th level.. and how hard is that..  Insted<br/>
of whining about smithing prices, or what not.. We should be on Verants ASS to<br/>
fix the trade skills.  I mean come on, you can&#39;t tell me that smithing as a trade<br/>
should or was ever thought to be nothing more then making banded armor? (No I&#39;m<br/>
NOT the kind of person to make a petition..... But one of you save the whale<br/>
types should.. (Oh I can hear the flames for that one already))  Snicker..<br/>

&gt; The problem with smithing and diminishing prices is the fact that once an<br/>
&gt; item is created, it usually never leaves circulation.  Most, if not all<br/>
&gt; banded is passed down and sold to others when it no longer has a use.  What<br/>
&gt; this means is that eventually, there will be little to no market for banded<br/>
&gt; AT ALL.  What smiths and other crafters need is some sort of item degrade.<br/>
&gt; This is the only way to keep the trade skills working indefinitely and the<br/>
&gt; only way to remove items from circulation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, another major problem with trade skills and the economy as a whole is<br/>
&gt; the fact that Verant said they would not allow for you to sell back to a<br/>
&gt; merchant at a profit, then went ahead and did it anyway.  I was one very few<br/>
&gt; people that was a Master at Brewing and Pottery before &quot;The Patch.&quot;  Now<br/>
&gt; everyone and their mother is a brewer and a potter simply for the exploit.<br/>
&gt; Can you imagine what would have happened if this was true for smiths and<br/>
&gt; jewelers??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Verant needs to stick to its word about no profit from selling to merchants.<br/>
&gt; Already, no one sells good items any more for plat because plat is worthless.<br/>
&gt;  The current economy just leads to more camping and kill stealing.<br/>
