<div id="ygrps-yiv-640339597">Hello<br/>
<br/>
Well I guess asking how to make Studs and Bonding is not an intelligent<br/>
question (and here I thought this list was to share information about<br/>
smithing) so I will ask another. I am currently at 69 smithing, I have a 50<br/>
to 75% success rate on bracers and gorgets and slightly lower on boots and<br/>
roughly 25% on helms and masks. I am still working off and on with skewers<br/>
but it has been a while since I have gotten any gain from them. So question<br/>
is: From a strictly skill improvement point of view what is the best way to<br/>
raising smithing at 69 skill. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again<br/>
