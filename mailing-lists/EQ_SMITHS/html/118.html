I cannot answer all of your questions, but, being a beginning smith in Qeynos, I can<br/>
anser some of it.<br/>
<br/>
1.) There are basic smithing items all around Qeynos, except for ore and sharpening<br/>
stones. For these items, the closest place I&#39;ve found is High Hold. At your level it&#39;s<br/>
a risky but not impossible trip. Below these answers I will give you a run down on the<br/>
best route, and who to see once you are there. For molds, and books, check in town (one<br/>
of the shops ... the Tin shop I think), and also the cottage in Qeynos hills, and one<br/>
of the cottages in East Karana.<br/>
<br/>
2.) I&#39;ve asked this question myself and didn&#39;t like the answer. I believe it really<br/>
depends on how many failures you will tolerate. The answers I have heard are above 40<br/>
skill you can TRY. At 80+ skill you can DO.<br/>
<br/>
3.) Good question ... on my server they are all over the charts. From 5-20pp per piece<br/>
usually. Good luck getting a standard price. And remember that Qeynos smiths can charge<br/>
slightly more due to the lack of local materials. Again, I have not made any, but I<br/>
heard banded gorgets were the item to start with?<br/>
<br/>
4.) No weapons ... I know it sucks doesn&#39;t it. I&#39;ve heard that you can make pots, and<br/>
other miscellaneous items. Not seen molds for them yet myself though.<br/>
<br/>
To get to High Hold from Qeynos:<br/>
-If under level 15 or so ... put EVERYTHING into the bank except food. You won&#39;t be<br/>
able to kill mobs on most of the maps so you will be avoiding combat. If you die or get<br/>
lost .... who cares, all of your items are in the bank.<br/>
-Leave Queynos north on the road. Zone into Qeynos Hills.<br/>
-After zoning in, follow the road to the marker, take the right path (going east) all<br/>
the way along the road and through the valley until you zone into East Karana.<br/>
-Continue following the road into East Karana to the first road marker, turn right,<br/>
following the road to the south until the road ends .. and you are running on the bare<br/>
plains. Go south all the way to the water.<br/>
-Turn east, following the water all the way across the map (a long way). Zone into West<br/>
Karana.<br/>
-Continue on this zone along the water. You will come to a large white bridge. Do not<br/>
cross it. Continue again along the water heading east. There will be one raider camp<br/>
along the way, just against the water. Go around it by swimming, or running into the<br/>
plains jut a little.<br/>
-You will come to a second bridge, this one will be wooden, and shaped like a large<br/>
linked chain. Turn south and cross this bridge .. in the middle you will zone into<br/>
South Karana.<br/>
-After exiting the bridge, follow the water left (again east) until you can just see<br/>
the mountains coming up. In the water is a large NPC you will want to avoid called<br/>
Bruune. Skirt areound him and go up the mountain face until you cannot climb any<br/>
higher.<br/>
-Turn South and follow the mountain all the way to a valley when you must run down. Do<br/>
not go into the valley ... it zones into the Gorge.<br/>
-Instead, go up the mountain on the other side, and once again go to the top, and<br/>
continue running south. You will eventually reach a corner where you will have to curve<br/>
around and run west. Continue running west along the mountain top to the next valley.<br/>
-Looking into the valley you will see road winding up on the right hand side. Take this<br/>
route and follow it up all the way around the mountains (quite a hike). You will zone<br/>
into the High Hold map.<br/>
-After zoning be careful!! There are gnolls and orcs on this map that are high level.<br/>
You most likely woudn&#39;t survive a fight with them so wait until they move (they seem to<br/>
patrol the area) and then sneak by. You will have to follow the left hand wall around<br/>
all the inlets in the rocks. If you see lights .. you are getting close to the Keep.<br/>
You will come to one inlet that leads to a tavern/inn. Come out of this and contiue<br/>
left to the next inlet which should be the hold main entrance.<br/>
-Go into the hold, zone to it&#39;s map, cross the coutyard and go into the keep. follow<br/>
the hallway down and back to a large chamber with columns in it.<br/>
-At the back of the chamber is a set of steps going down. They will lead to a mine<br/>
entrance. A miner just in the entrance sells sharpening stones as well as ore. Leaving<br/>
him, as you return to go back upstairs you should see the female bank teller also.<br/>
Place your stuff in here for safe keeping.<br/>
-Follow the route back home or do like I do and explore until you get killed, whereby<br/>
you respawn in Qeynos and go to the bank to retrieve your items.<br/>
<br/>
- Don&#39;t get discouraged if you die ... I littered many of these maps with my corpse ...<br/>
you can too.  :-p  Try to use a concept called &#39;bordering&#39; as much as possible. Mobs<br/>
don&#39;t seem to wander close to the map borders (mountains or water). Use this to your<br/>
advantage by running right up against the side of the map.<br/>
<br/>
Note: When looking at the main hold entrance if you turn around, directly behind you,<br/>
you will see a path leading up into the rocks. This path actually takes you back to the<br/>
other side of High Hold that exits to the Kithcor Woods on the way to Freeport.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck Praetor!!<br/>

If you are on the same server, send me a tell. I would be glad to show you the way<br/>
there.<br/>

&gt; Hail Smiths of Norrath:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am Praetor, level 10 Paladin on the Rodcet Nife Server, and a recent addition to<br/>
&gt; the smithing trade.  Before I continue with my occupation in Smithing, however, I<br/>
&gt; have some very simple questions that I believe are important to all beginning<br/>
&gt; smiths, as well as non-smiths.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; #1 - Where is the closest place that a smith in Qeynos may purchase basic smithing<br/>
&gt; items (i.e. Metal Bits, scraps, bars, blocks, File Molds, etc.)?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; #2 - At what skill level should a Smith begin to create Banded armor, and what type<br/>
&gt; should be produced first (i.e. Boots, Belts, Leggings, etc.)?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; #3 - What are the standard prices on Studs and Banded armor (both minimum and<br/>
&gt; maximum prices)?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; #4 - Are there any other things that Smiths can produce, other than in the Basic<br/>
&gt; Blacksmithing Books (i.e. non-Banded armor, weapons, etc.)?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank all of you in advance for your time!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Regards,<br/>
&gt; Praetor<br/>
