<div id="ygrps-yiv-76862231">Good Point!  I have an idea but would be hard to implement.  Why doesn&#39;t<br/>
armor degrade after so many hits to it?  If it did then the owner would<br/>
have to go to a smith or tailor (depending on armor type) for repair. <br/>
That would give smiths a reason to want to raise their level and<br/>
everyone would need it.<br/>

&gt;The problem with smithing and diminishing prices is the fact that once<br/>
&gt;an <br/>
&gt;item is created, it usually never leaves circulation.  Most, if not all<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;banded is passed down and sold to others when it no longer has a use. <br/>
&gt;What <br/>
&gt;this means is that eventually, there will be little to no market for<br/>
&gt;banded <br/>
&gt;AT ALL.  What smiths and other crafters need is some sort of item<br/>
&gt;degrade.  <br/>
&gt;This is the only way to keep the trade skills working indefinitely and<br/>
&gt;the <br/>
&gt;only way to remove items from circulation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, another major problem with trade skills and the economy as a<br/>
&gt;whole is <br/>
&gt;the fact that Verant said they would not allow for you to sell back to<br/>
&gt;a <br/>
&gt;merchant at a profit, then went ahead and did it anyway.  I was one<br/>
&gt;very few <br/>
&gt;people that was a Master at Brewing and Pottery before &quot;The Patch.&quot; <br/>
&gt;Now <br/>
&gt;everyone and their mother is a brewer and a potter simply for the<br/>
&gt;exploit.  <br/>
&gt;Can you imagine what would have happened if this was true for smiths<br/>
&gt;and <br/>
&gt;jewelers??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Verant needs to stick to its word about no profit from selling to<br/>
&gt;merchants.  <br/>
&gt;Already, no one sells good items any more for plat because plat is<br/>
&gt;worthless. <br/>
&gt; The current economy just leads to more camping and kill stealing.<br/>
