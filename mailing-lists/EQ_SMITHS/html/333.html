<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757197405">Just want to say, when we are finally able to make plate (this isn&#39;t in<br/>
the near future, mind you. Tailoring is probably next to be worked on<br/>
after make poison, and then probably tinkering or alchemy from what I&#39;ve<br/>
read all around), we should only sell for 5 to 10 plat less than the<br/>
magical plates are sold for. We can&#39;t sell for NPC plate prices (people<br/>
would just buy magical plate) but I really don&#39;t want to shoot myself in<br/>
the foot and have the same thing happen with plate as it did to banded.<br/>
Please, no flames, I know some of you will only want 10 plat profit per<br/>
piece, that&#39;s your right, and this is mine. This is what I will be doing<br/>
and I would hope if you&#39;re concerned over smithing, please do the same.<br/>
Plate will NOT be cheaper to make oneself (not only the 150 plat it<br/>
takes to get to banded, but all the time selling banded to get to making<br/>
plate), so we don&#39;t have to worry about that happening. Just gotta be<br/>
competetive with magical plates. Again, please no flames, I&#39;m terribly<br/>
sick of them, and I will not respond. Please, if you&#39;re on my side,<br/>
don&#39;t respond to any flames either. Let the baby have his/her bottle.<br/>
