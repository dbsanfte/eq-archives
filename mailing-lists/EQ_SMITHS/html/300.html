<b>Subject:</b> Looking for a few good men (and women) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-701591547">i know this is a bit off the subject, but it indirectly effects smithing. I&#39;m <br/>
looking for two level 16 wizards, one level 14-16 monk, one level 14-16 <br/>
cleric and a level 14-16 magician or enchanter to go on a journey to upper <br/>
guk. the point of this journey is to accumulate lots of money and magical <br/>
items so we can make money to use to further our smithing skill. i am <br/>
currently broke. this is on the fennin ro server, i am a level 15 warrior <br/>
named Coil. I would prefer that you are a small to medium character because <br/>
trolls barbarians and ogres can block passage ways. Also if anyone wants to <br/>
give me money if they are high level and have too much i&#39;d accept it =) Email <br/>
me if you are interested please, thanks.</div>
