<b>Subject:</b> Large Molds? (well Skewers really) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139263129">Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
 As a new TROLL smith I&#39;m wondering where I can find Large Molds, and <br/>
at the moment I need skewers (I&#39;m just starting). If you could direct <br/>
me to somewhere in Grobb or Oggok(?!?), it would be much <br/>
appreiciated. If some one could let me know what the Forge in Grobb <br/>
is for that would be helpful also.<br/>
<br/>
~Thanks, Skorned</div>
