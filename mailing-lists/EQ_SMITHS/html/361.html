<div id="ygrps-yiv-1059330761">Again WOOHOO 115 skill. Now what?<br/>
<br/>
I have gone as far as I can go with Skewers. I wish to have high enough skill <br/>
to make plate when it does come out, so what can I practice on? I know some <br/>
will say banded but I don&#39;t want to spend the money on banded and I hate <br/>
trying to sell a ton of armor I have laying around. When I do sell banded I <br/>
make it to order that way I don&#39;t have a ton of armor no one wants.<br/>
So what can I do? what will give me a good skill gain? <br/>
Has anyone hit the coveted 255?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time<br/>
<br/>
Fezik the decent smith</div>
