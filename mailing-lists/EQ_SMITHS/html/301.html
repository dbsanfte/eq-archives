<div id="ygrps-yiv-1946515779">You need to be a LOT less specific on the type of people you group with,<br/>
and where you go!<br/>
<br/>
Try this:  I am a level 15 warrior on Fennin Ro based in Freeport seeking<br/>
3-5 others around my level that would like to group, hopefully to <br/>
get some decent cash.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll never get the group you specify.<br/>

&gt; i know this is a bit off the subject, but it indirectly effects smithing. I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; looking for two level 16 wizards, one level 14-16 monk, one level 14-16 <br/>
&gt; cleric and a level 14-16 magician or enchanter to go on a journey to upper <br/>
&gt; guk. the point of this journey is to accumulate lots of money and magical <br/>
&gt; items so we can make money to use to further our smithing skill. i am <br/>
&gt; currently broke. this is on the fennin ro server, i am a level 15 warrior <br/>
&gt; named Coil. I would prefer that you are a small to medium character because <br/>
&gt; trolls barbarians and ogres can block passage ways. Also if anyone wants to <br/>
&gt; give me money if they are high level and have too much i&#39;d accept it =) Email <br/>
&gt; me if you are interested please, thanks.<br/>
