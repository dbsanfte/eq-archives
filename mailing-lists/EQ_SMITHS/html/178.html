<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-515787556">Greetings one and all! I just joined this mailing list and have a few <br/>
general questions so please forgive me if they&#39;ve already been asked- What <br/>
are folded metal sheets used for (not to be confused with metal sheets)? <br/>
Anyone know what blade and sledge molds are used for, and what are the <br/>
proper combination of items to use it properly? And lastly, I have heard <br/>
rumors that there are items that will help you in your &quot;skill roles&quot; when <br/>
smithing. Specifically the lucky rats foot. Is this true?<br/>
<br/>
