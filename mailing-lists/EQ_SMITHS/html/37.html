<b>Subject:</b> My 2 coppers on Smithing... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1021572931">I consider myself a rather strange Smith. I took up Smithing when I was a<br/>
lvl7 Barbarian Warrior. At that time, I put 19 practice points in it, and<br/>
that was it. I started sharpening things, and quickly became lvl20. After<br/>
that, I made a few metal bits, and became lvl21. A few files and skewers<br/>
later, I became lvl24, and then I tried my first Banded Helm. It worked. You<br/>
can imagine how surprised I was when I read that I shouldn&#39;t start with<br/>
banded until I got to lvl70-80. I have now become a lvl9 Warrior, and have<br/>
10 more practice points to waste. I tried to dump them into Smithing as<br/>
well, but my trainer refused to teach me any further. I wonder why...<br/>
anybody have a clue? Also... I am currently stationed in Rivervale, and I<br/>
wonder if they sell the components you need for smithing over there. I found<br/>
a forge, but that was all. (And I really don&#39;t feed like going to Freeport<br/>
again, way too many Griffins)<br/>
Tips for a beginning smith (it seems that is what I am) are most welcome.<br/>
<br/>
