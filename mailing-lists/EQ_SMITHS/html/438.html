<div id="ygrps-yiv-617282299">ACK. Hon dont make files make scalers till 40. Thay are 2 diff items. Files<br/>
bring you to about 20. So you just miss understood who ever you talked too.<br/>
You get a file and a large lid for each one you make.  Then goto skewers<br/>
till 115. Then armour. As far as studds i think thay area easy at 40 and<br/>
bonings at around 60. Dont do lanturns thay are too exspensive. You may fail<br/>
more with skewers but thay are cheeperer. As far as studd selling prices<br/>
thay cost about 6 gp a shot to  try to make one depending on your chr and<br/>
natority level. Usuale sell them for a min of a plat. In truth I wouldnt<br/>
bother making these unless someone requests them. Just keep making scalers<br/>
then skewers till about 115. You can make armour about 110 with some good<br/>
luck. I made the one sheet things about half the time at this level. It cost<br/>
me about 100 plat to get too 110 but i have a high chr and was amiable to<br/>
the vendors.<br/>

                                 if you have any other questions let me know<br/>
