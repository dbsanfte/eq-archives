<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194446899">On Povar, I&#39;ve seen patchwork in two different places.<br/>
First in Halas and the Everfrost patchwork is usually sold about 2 gold per<br/>
piece, for every piece.  That&#39;s large patchwork.<br/>
<br/>
And in Kelethin it was usually 2-4 gold per piece, 4 being for the tunic<br/>
and legs I beleive, but I got a whole suit for 2 gold per piece.  That was<br/>
small patchwork.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the Halas patchwork is most likely so cheap because there are just<br/>
so many polar bear cubs in the everfrost peaks.  (not to mention polar<br/>
bears, but they kinda hurt..)<br/>
