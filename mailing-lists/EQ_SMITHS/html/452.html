<div id="ygrps-yiv-2072937501">I met someone today who said his brother in law was able to get banded<br/>
gauntlets somehow for this quest.  However this horses ass refused to tell<br/>
me how to go about it (at the same time auctioning for someone to sell him<br/>
banded gauntlets).  The sheer number of people who keep asking about them<br/>
makes me believe they are implemented and work but the people who know ain&#39;t<br/>
talking so as to corner the market with the shamans.<br/>
