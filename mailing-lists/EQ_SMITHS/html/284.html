<div id="ygrps-yiv-551030751">That is the business world.  You want to know what else?  They don&#39;t care one <br/>
bit for your failures either.  They are buying the successes.  No one wantes <br/>
to pay for the ones you screw up on, they are not buying the skewers you used <br/>
to practice with either.  If anything, get anrgy with EQ on the sucess ratio. <br/>
 Once something is trivial, I think it should be VERY rare that you fail. <br/>
