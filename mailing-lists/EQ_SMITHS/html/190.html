<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070674335">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I used some bits made by another smith to try to practice my <br/>
blacksmithing tonight and I failed on all 20 times to advance my<br/>
blacksmithing skill.  Also, using store bought metal sheets making<br/>
banded armor, I failed every time to advance my skill.<br/>
<br/>
My question is:<br/>
<br/>
Do you have to make your own components in order for your<br/>
skill to advance or was this just bad luck?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
David</div>
