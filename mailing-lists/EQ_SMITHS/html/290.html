<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404028636">I prefer not to spend hour after hour doing just banded orders. I&#39;ll make the<br/>
same amount over one night&#39;s spread without advertising. I just respond to people<br/>
who need banded. Whether I&#39;m hunting or practicing a different trade, I always<br/>
hear calls for smiths. I answer them without having to spend hours advertising<br/>
and altering prices to meet demand. I make plenty :)<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m simply stating the facts of the real business world.  If a worker at GM<br/>
&gt; screws up and breaks a windshield, does the customer pay for that broken<br/>
&gt; windshield and the cost that it takes to fix it? no.  When they buy the car,<br/>
&gt; they are paying for what it takes to make that car.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You think banded is low on some of your servers, you should see Cazic Thule.<br/>
&gt; There is a guy in Freeport (obviously made and twinkled by a high level char<br/>
&gt; just to be a smith) who sells banded dirt cheap.  I&quot;m talking from 2pp for a<br/>
&gt; gorget to 9pp for a tunic or cloak.  Today at the Bazaar he had someone<br/>
&gt; standing in teh area of the bazzar announceing banded for sell then refering<br/>
&gt; them to the guy making it in freeport.  I went to the forge and watched for a<br/>
&gt; bit, there was never less then 8-10 people lined up waiting on costum made<br/>
&gt; banded.  He was there for hours makeing banded after banded item for dirt<br/>
&gt; cheap.  He&#39;s making a killing on banded armor because he&#39;s found a way to<br/>
&gt; sell a ton of it at dirt cheap prices.  and no, he&#39;s not taking a loss.  He<br/>
&gt; has a VERY high smithing skill and only charges for what it costs to make the<br/>
&gt; banded plus a little for the work.<br/>

&gt; Personaly, my prices are more in your guys&#39;s range  Gorget 4pp clear to a<br/>
&gt; tunic for 20pp.  yes, I can sell it for these prices but I don&#39;t make nearly<br/>
&gt; the sales nor the money that the guy in freeport does.<br/>
