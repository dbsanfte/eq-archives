 I just thought it&#39;d be a neat idea to have &#39;name tags&#39; on trade-made<br/>
 products. Maybe not for cooking or brewing, as those items aren&#39;t meant<br/>
 to last, but on generally anything else. Something in the status window<br/>
 that says, &quot;made by: name&quot;. Wouldn&#39;t that just be neat? Buy a banded<br/>
 tunic 6 months from now with one of your secondary characters and say,<br/>
 &quot;hey! I made that!!&quot; I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s even possible for them to code<br/>
 this, nor do I expect or really even want them to. I just think it&#39;s<br/>
 kinda neat, that&#39;s all :) Too much coding for the effect it would<br/>
 produce (or should I say lack of effect =P). Just, as I said, neat :)<br/>

I think this would be such a great improvement to the role-playing <br/>
environment.  Although, I agree, this could never be implemented.  Along that <br/>
same thread, I would like for trades to have quality ratings (maybe along the <br/>
lines of slower decay if we had decay).  It would be nice to see the High <br/>
Quality Banded Bracer made by HRE. ;-)  Again, this will probably never see <br/>
the light of day<br/>
