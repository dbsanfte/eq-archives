<div id="ygrps-yiv-140726316">I&#39;ve got an idea! Any of you remember the &quot;oil crisis&quot; of the 70&#39;s?  You <br/>
know, when we had to wait in line at the gas stations because of the huge <br/>
&quot;oil sortage&quot; and all along the oil tankers were sitting in the Delware <br/>
River loaded with oil waiting for prices to go up before they&#39;d bring in the <br/>
oil? Well, I say we smiths do the same. All smiths stop making/selling <br/>
banded until there&#39;s such a high demand that the people who want to buy it <br/>
keep raising the price they are willing to pay. I think we can get the price <br/>
to go up 3-5pp if everyone cooperates. Think about that, 7pp for a banded <br/>
gorget. It can happen. We can make it happen. We can hold Norrath by its <br/>
balls.  WE SMITHS CAN RULE NORRATH!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I&#39;ll have to work on my smithing considering it&#39;s only at about <br/>
13 right now.<br/>
