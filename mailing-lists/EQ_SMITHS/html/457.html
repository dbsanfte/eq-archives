&gt;I have heard from half a dozen people that banded guantlets were introduced<br/>
&gt;in the last patch, including a person who claims to have actually seen a<br/>
&gt;pair.  Anyone know anything about this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, does anyone know any place near Freeport (that an Erudite can buy<br/>
&gt;from) that sells large molds?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can personally say that they do in fact exist. It&#39;s simply a matter of <br/>
finding where they&#39;re sold. Also, they require 2 sheets of metal to forge.</div>
