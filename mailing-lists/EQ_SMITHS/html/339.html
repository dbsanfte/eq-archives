&gt;I just thought it&#39;d be a neat idea to have &#39;name tags&#39; on trade-made <br/>
&gt; &gt;products. Maybe not for cooking or brewing, as those items aren&#39;t &gt;meant <br/>
&gt;to last, but on generally anything else. Something in the &gt;status window <br/>
&gt;that says, &quot;made by: name&quot;. Wouldn&#39;t that just be neat?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The idea had crossed my mind once or twice. Never really suggested it to <br/>
Verant though. It&#39;s a good idea, but I&#39;d rather see them get the bugs worked <br/>
out first, and do something about smithing other things like plate, weapons <br/>
etc. I&#39;d also like to see them do something about using different ores (IE - <br/>
mithril, adamantite etc.) and possibly enchanting magic weapons and armor <br/>
(by no means do I think that these should be easy tasks to do in game!)</div>
