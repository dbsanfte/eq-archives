<br/>
     You should keep doing banded untill 175 then start on plate. Plan to<br/>
spend about 1500pp or so unless your selling it all to players.  I did<br/>
Mantle till 135 then gauntlets till 168 last of all cloak to 175. You still<br/>
fail quite a bit at plate but not as much as you would if you started lower.<br/>

Subject: [EQ_SMITHS] New server, new smith<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hello Fellow Smiths<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am Shaepe, a high elf enchanter on Tholuxe Paells, and the<br/>
&gt; proprieter of Shaepley Armor, located in the tree high city of<br/>
&gt; Kelethin.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been having lot&#39;s of fun working on my smithing skills on a new<br/>
&gt; server, banded is actually in demand.  When I was able to make my<br/>
&gt; first few pieces, not enough other players had any money to spend on<br/>
&gt; fancy armor, so sales were slow, but starting yesterday (server 1 week<br/>
&gt; old), WOW!  I was kept very busy, and feel I have finally achieved<br/>
&gt; enough skill and customers to make a profit with my smithing.  I found<br/>
&gt; I got much more response when I changed my auctions from &quot;WTS small<br/>
&gt; banded gorget, bracer .....  1pp per PC&quot;  to &quot;Heros of Norrath, make<br/>
&gt; sure you fight in style.  Buy Shaepley Armor.  Small banded gorget,<br/>
&gt; bracer...... now in stock.  1pp per PC&quot;  and other such variations.<br/>
&gt; Putting my name in the ads really helped folks remember me, and I<br/>
&gt; started getting tells at other times, asking for armor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My skill is now at 124.  I started with sharpening weapons, then did<br/>
&gt; scalers, lanterns, skewers, pots, and now sewing kits.  I tried my<br/>
&gt; first simple banded pieces when I reached a skill of 70.  I do pretty<br/>
&gt; well with most pieces now, except those stubborn leggings and mail<br/>
&gt; pieces.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My question to you all is, now what?  I thought about making forged<br/>
&gt; weapons (already trivial), but was disappointed to find the cost of<br/>
&gt; making the weapons (without failure) was more than what I could sell<br/>
&gt; them for.  I want to be able to make the new fine plate armor, but<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know what I should do to prepare for that.  What skill level<br/>
&gt; should I achieve before then?  How do I get that level? (more banded?)<br/>
&gt; Are there items I should be collecting now that I will need later?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All thoughts greatly appreciated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Shaepe<br/>
