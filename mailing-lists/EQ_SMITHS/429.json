I can&#39;t validate either <br/>\none right now, as I&#39;m at work. I wouldn&#39;t even have mentioned them here, or <br/>\neven given them a second thought, except for the fact that I&#39;ve spoken with <br/>\n3 guides and a GM (approximately 2 weeks ago; all on Bertox) about smithing <br/>\nsteel/plate armor; all of whom say that the ability to smith weapons and new <br/>\narmor types will be eventually added in. They couldn&#39;t give me specifics as <br/>\nnothing was finalized, but they eluded to the fact that it would be added in <br/>\nsoon. Any help in this matter would be appreciated. Here are the 2 rumors:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.) Supposively there have been weapon molds seen somewhere near the Fishing <br/>\nVillage in West Karana or the Inn in Qeynos hills. The rumor continues on <br/>\nabout the molds being recently added in around the same time as the new <br/>\ntailoring patterns.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.) On Tunare, (I believe) someone claims to be able to make &quot;tin&quot; armor. <br/>\nThis armor is supposed to be as good as banded but much more light weight, <br/>\nand is a smithable item.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
