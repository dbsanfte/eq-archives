I mean if I pay for materials<br/>\nand the worker that works on those materials only the company is going to<br/>\nlose money right?<br/>\n<br/>\nHmmmmm I wonder why they are still in business doesn&#39;t make much sense to<br/>\nme. I think you should take a close look at what you are saying. If no one<br/>\npays for overhead then the business loses money. SOMEONE must pay for it,<br/>\nthe workers driving the forklift and the forklift itself do NOT work for<br/>\nfree. I don&#39;t know of any business that loses money and stays open for very<br/>\nlong. Unless of course it is run by a government.... HEHE Hope none of you<br/>\nwork for the government or I will have to go get my asbestos undies.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I am not going to argue this point anymore =) If you still don&#39;t<br/>\nagree then we will have to agree to disagree.<br/>\n<br/>\nThump<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Talthoron@...\">Talthoron@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Talthoron@...\">Talthoron@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com\">EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com\">EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, July 12, 1999 2:40 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_SMITHS] Looking for a few good men (and women)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Talthoron@...\">Talthoron@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Fleetwood, the top maker of moter homes and RV&#39;s, Pella, the number one<br/>\n </span></blockquote>maker<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;of window, GM (which has been mentioned) all will tell you the same thing,<br/>\n&gt;Screw ups, inspections, the people working in the office, the people who<br/>\n&gt;drive the fork lefts carting material all day....all the work they do and<br/>\n&gt;much work that others do is NOT what the costumer buys.
