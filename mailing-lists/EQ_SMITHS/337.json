We can&#39;t sell for NPC plate prices (people<br/>\n would just buy magical plate) but I really don&#39;t want to shoot myself in<br/>\n the foot and have the same thing happen with plate as it did to banded.<br/>\n Please, no flames, I know some of you will only want 10 plat profit per<br/>\n piece, that&#39;s your right, and this is mine. This is what I will be doing<br/>\n and I would hope if you&#39;re concerned over smithing, please do the same.<br/>\n Plate will NOT be cheaper to make oneself (not only the 150 plat it<br/>\n takes to get to banded, but all the time selling banded to get to making<br/>\n plate), so we don&#39;t have to worry about that happening. Just gotta be<br/>\n competitive with magical plates. Again, please no flames, I&#39;m terribly<br/>\n sick of them, and I will not respond. Please, if you&#39;re on my side,<br/>\n don&#39;t respond to any flames either.

Most people move from banded, <br/>\nto bronze, to magic.  I only see a market for steel if it is significantly <br/>\ncheaper than magic and only slightly more expensive than bronze. (This <br/>\nassumption is based on plate being exactly the same as store plate) If plate <br/>\nwas available from PC&#39;s from the beginning, then we would have a thriving <br/>\nmarket.  Since deflation has already set in on most, if not all, mature <br/>\nservers, it will be hard to start selling a high priced median item for much <br/>\nof a profit (at least as much as it will take to get good at it).  We should <br/>\nall pray to the EQ ghods for item decay ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHawkwin of Hawkwin&#39;s Roaming Emporium</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
