Most","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-75353412\">I have been having some horrible luck improving my skill.  My skill<br/>\nis in the 100s, and I have been making medium sized banded armor<br/>\nwith a high-elf.  Most stuff except for leggings is fairly easy, but<br/>\nleggings take about 5 tries on average.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that my skill<br/>\nvery rarely goes up.  I have made about 150 attempts at banded<br/>\narmor, and it has only improved twice.  Am I not holding my tongue<br/>\nright or something?  I&#39;m using store bought water/metal sheets/molds.<br/>\nDoes it matter if I have the smithing books in my inventory?<br/>\n<br/>\nSkewers are still helping, but it is more and more rare on those also.<br/>\nIs there any nonbanded items that help after skewers?<br/>\n<br/>\n-------<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other trades, does anyone know any pottery items more difficult<br/>\nthan Large Bowls?  How about Brews harder than Ol&#39;Tujims?<br/>\n<br/>\nElaari<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Steven Le &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:svietnam@...\">svietnam@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At 11:04 AM 6/28/99 -0000, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Date: Sun, 27 Jun 1999 19:36:29 CDT<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   From: Henning Seljenes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hseljenes@...\">hseljenes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Raising from level 26<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I can get to level 26 in smithing pretty easily. After this I have heard a <br/>\n&gt; &gt;few ways to raise skills here. Skewers, (skalers?), or large lanterns. I <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well I would use scalers till the 40&#39;s, I heard they work just as good but<br/>\n&gt; less fails so you make back some money.  After that start skewers till it<br/>\n&gt; no longer gives you skill(90`s).  After skwers no longer give you skill<br/>\n&gt; start trying banded gorgets, I heard they are the easiest.  Stick with<br/>\n&gt; things that only need one sheet metal, then move to things that need two<br/>\n&gt; sheet metal and so on....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now large lanterns, from what I have heard, can be uses insted of the<br/>\n&gt; skewer stage.  They seem to make more money back.  You make large lanterns<br/>\n&gt; till skill 70`s then you start on the skewers when you get to the 90`s.  By<br/>\n&gt; this time most ammor pieces should be easy.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;want to know which way is the most effective but does not cost so much <br/>\n&gt; &gt;money. I hear all kinds of differant opinions, and I just wanted some <br/>\n&gt; &gt;information. If someone on Xegony could give me character a /tell (Irontoe), <br/>\n&gt; &gt;or just send me an e-mail back.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Irontoe Peacebringer - Paladin of Justice<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; BTW.
