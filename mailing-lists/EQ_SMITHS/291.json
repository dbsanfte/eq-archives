Any of you remember the &quot;oil crisis&quot; of the 70&#39;s?  You<br/>\n&gt; know, when we had to wait in line at the gas stations because of the huge<br/>\n&gt; &quot;oil sortage&quot; and all along the oil tankers were sitting in the Delware<br/>\n&gt; River loaded with oil waiting for prices to go up before they&#39;d bring in the<br/>\n&gt; oil? Well, I say we smiths do the same. All smiths stop making/selling<br/>\n&gt; banded until there&#39;s such a high demand that the people who want to buy it<br/>\n&gt; keep raising the price they are willing to pay. I think we can get the price<br/>\n&gt; to go up 3-5pp if everyone cooperates. Think about that, 7pp for a banded<br/>\n&gt; gorget. It can happen. We can make it happen. We can hold Norrath by its<br/>\n&gt; balls.  WE SMITHS CAN RULE NORRATH!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Of course, I&#39;ll have to work on my smithing considering it&#39;s only at about<br/>\n&gt; 13 right now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kulin &lt;lvl 10 warrior on the Rallos Zek server&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Campaign 2000 is here!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Discuss your thoughts; get informed at ONElist.
