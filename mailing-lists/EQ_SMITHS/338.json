Now the actual problem is how fast can the database<br/>\nretrieve the information for the item with unique identifiers on each<br/>\none. Currently a given item held by any person in the game (e.g. banded<br/>\ngorget) goes to a generic stats file to retrieve its data. The hit from<br/>\nadding names of crafters is the extra time when it has to retrieve the<br/>\ncrafters&#39; name. Each item has a unique name in the game so adding the<br/>\ndata field there might not be too bad since it is keeping track of the<br/>\nitem on the character with that unique name. If they were stored<br/>\ntogether it might make it faster. Oh well, just the musing of a<br/>\nprogrammer.</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
