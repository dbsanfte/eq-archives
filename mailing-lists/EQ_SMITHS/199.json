I was having the same problem and just switched to<br/>\nlanterns. My skill started going up frequently and I also get some return on<br/>\nmy<br/>\nmoney for smithing. According to the posts I got back today, lanterns will<br/>\ntake<br/>\nyou to 68 skill so .... why not do lanterns instead of skewers until you hit<br/>\n68?<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way Grak, how was the pottery skill? I heard a master potter telling<br/>\nme<br/>\nhe was quite profitable now and had been since about 75 in skill or so.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Rosmorte<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSoftware hound wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Software hound &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:softwarehound@...\">softwarehound@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have found that it took me at least 10 skewers to get 1 point of skill.<br/>\n&gt; One time I went through 3 backpacks of skewers and did not get one point.<br/>\n&gt; Then on my next run I got 3 points in 3 tries =) I am a master in 3 trade<br/>\n&gt; skill now, and smithing is by FAR the hardest to get up.
