I want to purchase a full set<br/>\n(but don&#39;t need mantle).  I currently have only 17 plat but hope to be much<br/>\nhigher by Sunday, and much more by the following Sunday.  I currently<br/>\nrunning around Freeport / Itthica Swamp zones.  Also may have another banded<br/>\npurchase a few weeks later for another character which would require small<br/>\nbanded.  I guess I need to know cost first, then I can e-mail you when I get<br/>\nthe plat up, and make arrangements to meet up sometime/place (prefer<br/>\nFreeport or Itthica Swamp area) to make the trade.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone can help me you can e-mail me directly to keep the noise down on<br/>\nthe list.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrek</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
