At the time I was doing this, I was<br/>\nsimultainiously working on Tailor and Blacksmith. The Item I am talking<br/>\nabout is stell boning, used for tailoring to make reinforced leather. This<br/>\nis nice low level armor. It is better AC, as well as lighter than regular<br/>\nleather.This requires the use of bricks of ore, but the costs don&#39;t work out<br/>\ntoo differently from studs if you work out the math. I tried making stell<br/>\nboning 20 times at lvl 26/27 smithing, don&#39;t remember which for sure. I only<br/>\nsucceeded 8 times, but got to skill 33 off just those attemtps. I think this<br/>\nworks out to be both cheaper and quicker than other things I have heard<br/>\nsuggested, and you can try to sell these to Tailors, too. I haven&#39;t played<br/>\nthat character in a while, so can&#39;t give any more info than this, but I hope<br/>\nthat this helps someone .<br/>\n<br/>\n                                    Argynte<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Chris Holko &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cholko@...\">cholko@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com\">EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com\">EQ_SMITHS@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, June 28, 1999 5:50 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [EQ_SMITHS] Raising from level 26<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Chris Holko &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cholko@...\">cholko@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Henning Seljenes wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; From: Henning Seljenes &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hseljenes@...\">hseljenes@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I can get to level 26 in smithing pretty easily.
