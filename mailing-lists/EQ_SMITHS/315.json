Most, if not all <br/>\nbanded is passed down and sold to others when it no longer has a use.  What <br/>\nthis means is that eventually, there will be little to no market for banded <br/>\nAT ALL.  What smiths and other crafters need is some sort of item degrade.  <br/>\nThis is the only way to keep the trade skills working indefinitely and the <br/>\nonly way to remove items from circulation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, another major problem with trade skills and the economy as a whole is <br/>\nthe fact that Verant said they would not allow for you to sell back to a <br/>\nmerchant at a profit, then went ahead and did it anyway.  I was one very few <br/>\npeople that was a Master at Brewing and Pottery before &quot;The Patch.&quot;  Now <br/>\neveryone and their mother is a brewer and a potter simply for the exploit.  <br/>\nCan you imagine what would have happened if this was true for smiths and <br/>\njewelers??<br/>\n<br/>\nVerant needs to stick to its word about no profit from selling to merchants.  <br/>\nAlready, no one sells good items any more for plat because plat is worthless. <br/>\n The current economy just leads to more camping and kill stealing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHawkwin of Hawkwin&#39;s Roaming Emporium</div>","specialLinks":[]}}
